18729237
google-chrome	safari
i am trying to constrain an image that works in google-chrome and moz but safari its not

18729237
width	height
in safari it is holding the max height but stretching the image width to its actual size

18729237
width	height
in the other browsers it sets the max height and sets the width proportionally

18729247
division	modulo
the modulo returns the remainder of division

18729248
division	modulo
modulo finds the remainder of division of one number by another

18729250
division	modulo
the result of a modulo is the remainder after division of the left operand by the right operand

18729259
glut	pyopengl
the original glut implementation doesn t have cylinder functions but freeglut does from here then python 2.7.1 pyopengl 3.0.1 with freeglut 2.6.0 together work well in my laptot - linux-ubuntu 12.04

18729302
nullpointerexception	indexoutofboundsexception
otherwise you ll occasionally get a concurrentmodificationexception nullpointerexception or an indexoutofboundsexception

18729356
rtsp	rtcp	rtp	rtcp	rtp	rtsp	udp	rtp
the video and audio data packets are sent as rtp essentially udp packets with extra data and then you have rtsp and rtcp which you can ignore for server client communication

18729356
rtp	rtsp
i would recommend looking into the mediaplayer and stagefright source code especially where they set up different data sources and see if you can extract parts of the rtsp handshake and the setup of the rtp session

18729361
int	chars
getc returns either an int not a chars

18729361
int	chars
if you change c to be int instead of chars it should work correctly

18729376
for-loop	loops
i am trying to using a while loops inside a for-loop in matlab

18729376
for-loop	loops
the outcome from the while loops is one iteration in the for-loop

18729379
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
it looks like you re using a uinavigationbar but not a uinavigationcontroller which means these properties won t do anything unless you code them to

18729379
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
you can switch to use a uinavigationcontroller or you can programmatically change the height of your uinavigationbar from 44 to 64 on ios 7

18729409
int	chars
i m looking for a regular expression that can match chars that are preceded by a number int decimal or fractions plus 0 or more spaces

18729424
put	get
it cripples being able to put business logic in your entities and use those methods over-the-wire makes maintenance a nightmare and without enough hardware and careful design if hosted on a single server you may end up having to use named pipes to get the speed you need which negates any distributed advantage you d get from using wcf

18729434
sorting	filtering
this provides a .net library that can be used to add server-side data paging filtering and sorting to your mvc controller actions

18729457
post	put
i am building an restful api where say userid addressid are post put between other fileds and these fields are foreign keys in the db

18729466
disk	ram
i m creating a very very simple block ram disk based on sbull

18729466
disk	ram
i am sure that reads and writes are working correctly when there s no offset because i created a file that is the same size as my block ram disk and dumped the entire file into my device using dd then got the output of the device also using dd and the input and output files are exactly the same

18729466
disk	ram
i also wrote the same file into a brd linux kernel original block ram disk driver and the outputs are the same comparing my device and the brd device

18729490
width	height
make sure the placeholder is the same width and height as the element you are trying to move over

18729538
post	get
i checked the other post with this question but nothing worked didn t get it

18729560
pull	push
i m also launching this from within ppt to push out the data and can t really pull it from any of the other apps so the applescript menu would be where i want it to be

18729603
joptionpane	jdialog
then you can put it into a joptionpane a jdialog or jframe or whatever the need dictates

18729605
hide	show
i m using angularjs with html5 mode on which is making it difficult for me to use libraries ratchet in particular that are dependent on using hash urls to show hide information

18729618
hide	show
i can place all markers on the map using markermanager to show hide at different zoom levels using the depth field from my table

18729618
children	parent
anyway the function returns id name depth of each child of the parent id provided as well as how many children each one of those children might have

18729641
min	max
by the way a isn t related here it s intended to run on decision game trees and find min max optimal path max benefit for you min for the opponent that s a different story

18729648
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
#create is 50 from the top and 50 from the left but the negative margin value is half the width height of itself so it s positioned in the center

18729649
charindex	substr
if this is sql server a relatively easy way to remove the leading bit would be with the help of substr and charindex

18729649
charindex	substr
the charindex function finds the position of the substr and the result is used as substr s second argument

18729649
int	chars
the length argument is set to the maximum int value to make sure all the remaining chars to the end of the string are returned

18729649
charindex	substr
you don t need to calculate the exact number. if the substr isn t found charindex returns 0

18729652
mouse	trackpad
the following code changes the frame font height for all buffers with control + mouse wheel trackpad

18729688
versioning	upgrade
this will have upgrade your current packaged install to the new versioning which will allow you to test that any upgrade code in your app works you will not however be able to debug it in visual studio

18729745
calloc	malloc
on the other hand i have found that memory allocation functions calloc and malloc enable to allocate larger arrays

18729802
typedef	struct
you typedef the struct the same way as in c and then initialize it with

18729820
postgresql	mysql
i am trying to move my postgresql database with all the data inside it to a mysql database so i am using mysql workbench data migration tool

18729865
width	height
note that a useful tool for you to get the size of the pygame window is pygame.display.get_surface .get_size which will give you a tuple of the width and height

18729865
width	height
that is you should store the width and height of the window for later retrieval

18729901
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
it does not require jquery and it works on a variety of browsers ie7-10 firefox safari mac ios google-chrome android stock browser

18729901
client-side	server-side
i could use sinon.js to make mock servers client-side or nock to have a separate server-side mock server

18729905
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
turns out google-chrome and firefox don t include the scrollbar as part of the width while safari does

18729906
superclass	subclassing
i have two classes a superclass and subclassing

18729906
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
the subclassing inherited from the superclass

18729906
superclass	subclassing
i know that subclassing can call superclass methods via the following syntax

18729908
strlen	strncpy	memset	strncpy
by the way if you actually use strlen token and it returns then token strlen token is already 0 because that s how strlen knows how to stop thus the memset above is unnecessary if you do the strncpy with that length

18729908
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

18729972
overwrite	preserve
in other words i want pasting in visual mode to preserve my copied text so i can continue pasting it and not overwrite it with whatever got replaced

18729973
rspec	minitest
because minitest s spec dsl is based on rspec and this is the way that rspec works

18729984
pull	push
it also has buttons which give you the adb push pull functionality but from a gui if this is easier for you to use

18729989
for-loop	loops
one way to test for intersection is to extract the rectangles of the two components or use a for-loop if you must loops through several components extracting rectangles as you go and then testing if one rectangle intersects another

18730005
int	double
you divide an int with an int which will produce an int and after that you cast it to double

18730022
mouseover	mouseout
when mouseover event is fired i will slide for a block every speed milliseconds until the mouseout is fired

18730040
for-loop	loops
the first thing i notice is that in your for-loop you use and then when echoing from within loops you use

18730049
superclass	subclassing
however when you define a constructor in a subclassing and do not explicitly invoke a superclass constructor the compiler automatically inserts a call to the default constructor of the superclass

18730077
satellite	mercator
my problem is that the satellite image data is not in the platecarree projection but the mercator projection

18730096
inherited	subclassing
basically i would like to make my uiimageview subclassing to inherited from a subclassing of uiview instead of the uiview itself

18730126
subtract	add
develop a ruby class called mathdojo that has the following functions add subtract

18730126
subtract	add
then i modified the add and subtract methods to include calling flatten

18730162
redcarpet	rdiscount
something that uses redcarpet or rdiscount or any other library deemed important

18730166
required	placeholder
or positional placeholder required a standard indexed array

18730184
pop-up	dialog
however during a facebook sdk login session without the facebook app install it pop-up a dialog with internal browser and shows the status bar

18730188
hash	salt
my coder friend wasn t the smartest when he didn t add salt to the sha512 hash

18730188
hash	salt
i was thinking about making some complicated code to rehash when someone who has the old hash type logs in and it would set the variable to true after adding a salt

18730188
hash	salt
or i could take the currently hash passwords and somehow fuse a salt into them

18730191
children	parent
i know that i could use the application s event aggregator but these events are specific to the parent module and its children and not the whole application

18730191
children	parent
i think the idea of having a single event aggregator for parent module and its children is cleaner

18730242
post	get
i know there are other post of a similar fashion but i cant seem to get anything to work

18730242
pop-up	dialog
what happens is when a user will hit the login button a small dialog will pop-up and ask them if the app can get these things permissions from them

18730253
folder	directory
the resources folder is a special directory that gets stripped out of the default path names when copied over to the ios app bundle

18730291
inherited	properties
the combobox.selectedvalue properties is inherited from

18730297
hash	salt
if yes compare the salt hash and log in

18730297
hash	salt
store your new salt and hash in the database

18730297
hash	salt
alternatively instead of a salt column you could put in a hash_ver column and use that to determine which validation method to use and when to update the hash

18730297
hash	salt
that way if you wish to use a hashing method that packs the salt in with the hash like bcrypt you don t get stuck trying to figure out what type of hash you re dealing with

18730333
google-chrome	safari
the problem occurs when i use mobile browsers such as safari and google-chrome in iphone and google-chrome in android

18730342
inherited	subclassing
depending on what you want to inherited from your view subclassing you may be able to pull those behaviors up into a category on uiview which both your uiview subclassing and uiimageview subclassing could then use

18730343
range	minimum
you could build a minimum range out of it so user always sees at least 4-5 data points

18730384
hash	md5
is the unlikely md5 hashing result not the response being hash

18730390
rubygems	bundler
this is not a bad place for it since this is the domain of rubygems and bundler - thus you can utilize their apis to validate gem versions if they ve loaded â as well as the existence of your target groups

18730470
qtextedit	qpushbutton
i added a qpushbutton and a qtextedit to a mainwindow ui form

18730511
wordpress	joomla
this is a serious question specifically relating to the many frameworks out there for wordpress and joomla - warp t3 gantry etc

18730511
wordpress	joomla
i mean all of the native codex is there with joomla and wordpress anyway to construct a theme simple enough so what good does a whole proprietary app do between your design and the cms

18730527
sdl	glew
the target is opengl 3.3+ using no deprecated mechanisms such as glbegin etc. using the libraries sdl 2.0 glew 1.10.0 with wglew and glm 0.9.4.5

18730539
mongohq	appfog
firstly you may enable the mongohq add-on and appfog will create a mongohq sandbox for you

18730539
mongohq	appfog
since you said you have already got mongodb collections you can clone your original collections to the one offered by appfog via mongohq web ui

18730539
mongohq	appfog
the other solution is don t worry about the mongohq add-on in appfog

18730557
integer	unsigned
but in xcode 5 with 64-bit it is causing the following error implicit conversion loses integer precision time_t aka long to unsigned int

18730557
integer	unsigned
this is because time null returns a long integer and srandom requires an unsigned int

18730557
integer	unsigned
convert the long integer to an unsigned int

18730576
width	height
get new size from - cgsize intrinsiccontentsize and animate it by animating width height constraints

18730582
getdate	dateadd
between dateadd day -2 dateadd day datediff day 0 getdate 0

18730582
getdate	dateadd
and dateadd second -86401 dateadd day datediff day 0 getdate 0

18730596
integer	unsigned
a bit-ï eld is interpreted as having a signed or unsigned integer type consisting of the speciï ed number of bits

18730613
subtract	add
if you add 1.0 to position.z it will move it to the far plane and if you subtract 1.0 from position.z it will move it to the near plane

18730616
disk	ram
my current idea is create a master-cluster managed by heartbeat to easy error recovering and create a script that mounts the disk on ram downloads the most recent dump and creates the database on it

18730620
clang	llvm
i compiled the musl c library using clang 3.3 and dumped the generated llvm ir files

18730690
width	height
but there is a problem the card s size is 333x485 i need the text to be resized in order to fit in the background without resizing its height but only the width

18730690
width	height
to be more to the point the should have and but if it doesn t fit it goes off the background i need a function that will resize its width in order to fit in 240px and leave the height to 34px always

18730690
width	height
in the name you can add as much text you like it will always fit in and in the right width and height

18730706
unsigned	short	int	chars
so after you ve gone through the options you are left with the various types of int chars short int long long long in signed and unsigned forms and _bool

18730706
int	chars
the behaviour of plain int is implementation defined it may be signed or unsigned roughly like plain chars can be signed or unsigned

18730720
ant	maven
you can also invoke the frege compiler through ant in maven not the best way but still an option

18730724
folder	directory
this redirects all requests for the folder directory they get a 404 response

18730752
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
you could also look at what sharpdevelop or monodevelop use c#

18730764
sbt	scala-reflect
after some dependency updates in a project i somehow end up with sbt clean update leaving me two scala-reflect versions in lib_managed

18730798
width	height
use imagecopyresampled to copy the new image with your text to your existing card setting the parameters to shrink the width but not the height

18730839
subtract	add
you then subtract 1 from that to get index then add 1 back to that with index++ and finally you set currentathlete to _athletearray index which will be the same athlete you started with

18730863
flask	web.py
i d go with flask or web.py

18730863
flask	web.py
both microframeworks have tutorials here s web.py s and flask s is right on the home page

18730889
post	get
in my ember app i get a list of all the restaurants using an ajax call copied from discourse co-founder s blog post

18730891
folder	directory
pathcchremovefilespec will remove the last element in a path so if you pass it a directory path the last folder will be stripped

18730902
folder	directory
it adds an item to the file menu that opens a folder browser and will add all .net assemblies found in that directory to the assembly browser

18730923
post	get
you can get more informations from this post

18730926
happy	alex
you might also check out the haskell compiler series which is nice as an introduction to using alex and happy to parse a subset of java

18730930
superclass	subclassing
you generally want a subclassing implementation to be invoked before the superclass one because the subclassing one might want to totally override the superclass and not invoke it at all

18730931
onkeyup	onblur
lastly change your onkeyup event to onblur

18730974
nant	opencover
i have a c# project that i have used opencover and gallio to run the mbunit unittests from nant script

the program works fine even if i dont have bufferedwriter and filewriter like below

18731188
versioning	upgrade
building l is one firmware versioning higher because it was supposed to fix the leak and an internal telnet issue but didn t so i have not upgrade the building s firmware and will be downgrading the building l firmware

18731191
inherited	subclassing
whether a regular map or a unordered_map is used will depend on how many subclassing virtually inherited the base class

18731196
propertychangelistener	listeners
now you could modify any of your propertychangelistener s to check that they are being executed within the context of the edt but what you can t do is change how other registered listeners might work

18731234
int	double
so either declare them as int or if you choose to use double

18731265
temporary	tablespace
now if still need to change the temporary path you first need to create a tablespace if you didn t do it already

versioning	upgrade
i recently tried to upgrade my python versioning via brew and now i am stuck with osx s system python because brew does not seem to be creating a link to it s python binary

18731323
hex	binary
you can use x with the hex digits to express the binary value

18731337
folder	directory
what i would like to do is also create a directory with the original file name so i can then have all the duplicate automatically placed in the new folder

18731343
wordpress	joomla
generally though a template is comprised of basic html and css that works with the platform wordpress joomla etc that is used to build the output to the page

so super b self actually gets self.__class__.__mro__ in this case d.__mro__ finds b in the list and returns the next thing after it

18731473
gif	png
i won t really need a filter for file extensions png gif jpg etc but just rather any file resource being requested from img to be read from the real directory

18731560
put	get
i tried the following code different ways like by taking out the while or the if but when i put both together if and while i always get the error at the end.

18731568
heredoc	herestring
as johnsyweb mentioned this is called a herestring as it uses a short string in contrast to a whole block as in a heredoc

18731569
folder	directory
i ve achieved this in the past by setting up a virtual directory in iis to map the url to a specific folder

18731600
bonjour	avahi
for example for windows the user will need to install bonjour for windows where as linux users will need avahi but most of this can be setup durin install

18731646
mp3	ogg
the audio is html5 tag and supports only ogg mp3 and wvm but my file is amr or other format

18731684
post	get
i d also recommend you to read the guidelines on how to post questions here or else you won t get much attention from anybody plus they will downvote you

18731706
versioning	upgrade
you can only upgrade if they have rolled it out in your country in which case you ll see a banner at the top of your admob site we have launched a new versioning of admob

stdout	stderr
i pick up the stderr stdout and the return code from the subprocess but if the program segmentation faults stderr is empty stdout is empty and the return code is -11

18731791
stdout	stderr	post	get
i don t really care all that much about what is in stderr and stdout and to that end have seen a number of post including this that deal with picking up the output but i don t care all that much about the output although it would be nice to get the segmentation fault string out of stderr but what i really need is a way to definitively tell what happened to the subprocess

18731808
int	chars
since an int must be at least the size of a byte chars so there s no way two bytes can give you four int

18731986
folder	directory
the folder cakeroot app plugins is specific to your application living in app while cakeroot plugins applies to all possible applications in cakeroot you can place multiple applications in different directory in the root folder

18731997
google-chrome	firefox
data is not shown in google-chrome but working in ie and firefox

18732008
queue	fifo
so in yield we need to push the current thread to the end of the ready thread queue and pop the first thread out and execute it. fifo i am using the swapcontext

18732047
put	get
i am able to pull them from the databases and put them in an array but i cannot get them to show on the map

18732066
hide	show
first you need to on your ui page figure out which images exist and show hide the images based on the results of the query

18732066
hide	show
now this should be all you need to display the images on the page and be-able to show hide the images as they are uploaded

18732124
ubuntu	centos
i am using ubuntu work station and my production environment is centos 6.2 i used to use ubuntu 11.10 and i just install 4.4.6 coming with it and the compiled binary works perfectly under centos 6.2 environment

18732173
for-loop	arrays
for-loop to traverse dense associative arrays

18732184
oncreate	onnewintent
you could then use this method both in oncreate and onnewintent

18732288
width	height
i need to get the width and height of the secondelement and the firstelement in pixels after they are scaled down

18732350
width	height
but the image would have to be exactly the height and width of the div

18732356
google-chrome	firefox
following code is working in firefox 23.0.1 as well as google-chrome 29 but not in the ie 10

18732389
sequence	permutation
you can do permutation directly on sequence of integers so no overhead for converting the types

18732392
int	chars
with this an array of chars will use the version that assumes a nul terminator but an array of int will use std end so it refers to the entire array

18732393
wxpython	pyqt
although there are many similarities in look and function between wxpython and pyqt under the hood they are essentially different

18732420

you will see lots of .jar files that are not directly referenced in the parent pom.xml nor the children pom.xml

18746336

when referencing other aggregate roots that usually means just modeling the many-to-one side and for references within an aggregrate root - from the root to its children that usually means just modeling the one-to-many and leaving the many-to-one out of the model

18746408
many-to-one	one-to-many
so in this case we need to model both the one-to-many orderheader.orderitems and also the many-to-one orderitem.orderheader

18753692
mayavi	matplotlib
there are two main options matplotlib and mayavi

18753692

18753932
superclass	subclassing
i have a subclassing that adds graphics capabilities to a superclass that implements the algorithms

18753932
superclass	subclassing
so in addition to a few extra initialization functions this subclassing will only need to refresh the graphics after the execution of each algorithm-computing function in the superclass

18753969
put	get
as you can sort of see here i m trying to insert a slash for the put method to get the format api v1 tasks id.json

portrait	landscape
i have a view controller that consists of two child uicontainerview s one of which is fixed-width and the other which dynamically adjusts its width based on portrait vs landscape mode

18754045
portrait	landscape
however if it loads in landscape and then rotates to portrait the second dynamic table gets all screwy and thinks it s wider than it is should be letting you scroll it horizontally which it should not be doing

18754048
laravel	codeigniter
there are many awesome php frameworks out there including symfony zend codeigniter laravel and i m sure many more

18754340
ostream	istream
i have one function that outputs data into an ostream object and a constructor that initializes a class from an istream object in the exact same format

18754362
short	base
you can create an auto-incremented int32 id and then format it in a base higher than 10 to get a short string

18754455
viewmodel	caliburn
another free alternative might be to make use of a wpf mvvm framework like caliburn micro which includes base types like propertychangedbase from which you can inherit your viewmodel and minimise your code duplication

since you need both input and output you need a derivative of std iostream which inherits both std istream and std ostream

18754641
min	max
the difference among them is only the number of bytes they occupy in memory i.e max and min values

18754641
int	chars
therefore literal a is represents actually the code of chars a and therefore can be assigned to any int type

18754641
int	chars
however once it is assigned to chars variable it is actually just a code and therefore can be assigned then to int without casting

18754641
int	chars
types like int long short chars are actually primitive wrappers they are regular classes that wrap primitives

18754641
int	chars
this experession returns type chars that definitely cannot be assigned to int variable

18754641
casting	autoboxing
casting to int solves it in this case the literal a is transformed to type int then transformed to integer by autoboxing and therefor can be assigned to intger variable

18754699
bluetooth	usb
i m attempting to figure out how to get a usb bluetooth dongle to work with my beaglebone black

18754700
subtract	add
what i would do is have a counter for the number of tigers either as a static data member of tiger or on the safari object add 1 to it in the tiger constructor and subtract 1 in the tiger destructor

18754725
superclass	subclassing
or you could use sti to make balance a superclass and then subclassing for each type

18754751
jobs	cron
if you don t have access to cron jobs you could have a web page that controls that background worker by executing a shell command with like exec or passthru and manage the timer yoursel this is much more risky since any error in your script might throw things off

18754902
mouseleave	mouseenter
basically you manually pop open close the popover on the mouseenter and mouseleave events but once someone clicks on the popover for the first time you remove those event handlers and add a new handler on the click event that toggles the popover

18754924

you ll start with the parent nodes and get the parent children

18754928
button	checkbox
for radio button and checkbox it is better to use change events using .on event handler attachment

18754960
jlist	jtextfield
you need a jtextfield well okay that was obvious a jlist and a jpopupmenu or jwindow

18755046
for-loop	loops
say we have that nested loops printed cnt will always be 0 because that s what it was defined when we entered the 1st for-loop

18755151
width	margin
removed width from body added margin 0 auto to #box

18755160
client-side	server-side
the code samples in the other answers will work fine for doing the client-side checks just don t rely only on checking keypress events but as was pointed out in the accepted answer a server-side check is really required

18755220
put	get	post	get	post	put
post resources body of put containing a duplicate of the representation by get resources 10 without the id so that the post creates a new resource

switching	screens
many apps instagram for example have these navigation buttons at the bottom of the screens for switching activities

18755249
stdout	stderr
runs foo arg1 arg2 arg3 with stdout and stderr swapped because

18755249
stdout	stderr
makes a copy of fd 2 stderr on fd 1 so now stdout and stderr both go wherever they were going

18755249
stdout	stderr
makes a copy of fd 3 saved original stdout on fd 2 stderr

18755249
stdout	stderr
send stderr to wherever stdout is currently going

18755249
stdout	stderr
send stderr to stdout again this has no new effect

18755249
stdout	stderr
so sh -c is run with its stderr going to your stdout and its stdout going to file file

18755249
stdout	stderr
s stderr which is your stdout

18755256
portrait	landscape
the problem that we are facing is that screen resizing is happening properly in iphone in all versions whereas in most of the android devices the resizing from landscape to portrait is not happening

18755256
portrait	landscape
in other words when we rotate the device from landscape to portrait the automatic adjusting of the screen is not happening

18755256
portrait	landscape
but the resizing is proper when we rotate the device from portrait to landscape

18755260
portrait	landscape
i m doing orientation change from portrait to landscape and from landscape to portrait

uitableview	uisearchbar
you might be adding uisearchbar to uitbaleview s header that is why it goes up while you scroll the uitableview

18755438
uitableview	uisearchbar
you can take uisearchbar and uitableview from xib nib and first put uisearchbar on top and below that put your uitableview may be you problem will be solved

if you are invoking your view directly from the form simply change the form method to get instead of the default post so your form will look like

18757706
post	get
in this latter case it doesn t matter if you use post or get invoking the controller

18757714
int	chars
for all class-based types decaring a default ctor in fact replaces the implicit one but -for built-in types like int chars float etc. - the default explicit constructor -in fact- sets the value to zero but the implicit one does nothing thus letting the value uninitialized

ienumerable	ilist
when you wrap something i would suggest roomcollection as wrapper class or simply ilist or ienumerable

ilist	icollection
if so use icollection or an ilist as these expose add clear and remove methods

18758533
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	icollection
if you need the list to be indexed then you should choose ilist - this interface inherits from icollection and ienumerable so this may be what you are after

i want to group some textview together to show hide them together

18758553

uncomment the width and height

18758573
width	height
also uncomment the line before width and height on resources

18758590
post	get
the point is you need to use json.parse on the response of the post request and then get the uuid

18758611
ilist	icollection
it s mean if you need in function only functionality of ienumarable you should use ienumarable not icollection or ilist

18758611
ilist	icollection
and as a return type you should use the most general type but you should be aware for icollection and ilist type

udp	tcp
suppose you have a specification for sending information on a tcp or udp stream and you have a sequence of bytes that you receive delimited with stx and eot bytes

18758848

sequence	permutation
here s the algorithm described in wikipedia which generates the permutation of a sequence in lexicographic order same as itertools

18759327
min	max
the converter just appends the two values like min max

the min and max values are used in the allownumberonly which composes the value from the input digits and checks if it exceeds one of the limits

18759327
converter	multibinding
i simplified the code and removed the converter to be sure it s not the converter or the multibinding

18759327
min	max
in the inputservice i added default values to the min and max properties like this

18759346

you should set a specific width for header to make margin 0 auto work

18759351
gif	png
basically i abstracted concept of reading first 8 bytes from the image any and depending on that decide if it falls under any of types png jpeg gif

if you measure out the dimensions of the label height width horizontal and vertical gap between labels and then modify the general details layout accordingly you will then produce the desired results

i knew that all function based view receive an request object and return an httprespose object but what is the difference between httpresponse and render_to_response object

18771740
put	get
the only benefit i see to calling the chooser is that you get to put a name into the choice dialog rather than getting the default complete action using message

18771744
post	get	httpresponse	request
you had return render_to_response .. only in the post section so when the request processes def add as a get request the first time there is no httpresponse object returned

18771794
width	height
although it produces a background completely #2f2727 color so it might not be your best bet but that finds the height and width of the window and sets the gradient accordingly

18771805
width	margin
but applying margin rules on your columns will break the grid due to margins adds up with the width

18771805
margin	height

18772248
put	get
i know it works since i put it in the openlist control and it displayed on all five categories i just don t know how to get it to display on only the selected category

18772258
post	get
also if value is coming from request get or post value actually even if it does not come from request you should use mysqli_real_escape_string to sanitize value before putting it into query

18772272
translation	localization
and it is often used in translation and localization to handle strings that should be translation

this allows the above mixin to take a known variable defined in the parent level and redefines it for the current level and available to it s children

18772423
hide	show
notice that your first example calls ca_fdhidefield to hide one set of fields then ca_fdshowfield to show the other

18772423

if you don t want to duplicate a lot of code you could hide them all before the if statements then just show the one that corresponds with the radio button that was selected

i made a slight change to the way your min s and max s are calculated

18772457

according to this blog post which is for 2010 and a little stale on version info you should just delete the contents of the cache folder not the cache folder itself or the parent dir

18772490
factory-method	singleton
i am using factory-method to call my getinstance static method to create singleton object

18772536
children	parent
you can add the layout update in custom design section of your category then set all children categories to use the parent settings

18772578
hide	show
if you can add a show and hide class to the inputs that are supposed to show hide the element respectively you can do something like this

18772638
ubuntu	linux
i am using linux ubuntu trying to run .sh scripts

18772648
factory-method	singleton
searching for uses of factory-method over a factorybean it seems that it used quite oftenly with legacy singleton beans to get the underlying instance but this approach doesn t provide support for initialization methods such as for example an init method that initializes a given set of properties

18772701
google-chrome	firefox
i notice this problem in ie9 firefox 23 and google-chrome 29

18772734

i switched to a post instead of a get which works due to eventually moving onto https and keeping the token out of the url

18772757
entities	entitymanager
jpa requires that entitymanager keep entities cached so that they can track changes

18772757
entities	entitymanager
if your entitymanager do not need to track changes such as if the application is read-only and the entities are not modified you can set queries to return entities from the shared cache so that only a single instance of the data exists using the read-only query hint

18772765

18773116
integer	unsigned
all implementations that i know after working with c++ for 20+ years on different platforms convert signed - unsigned integer by doing nothing the binary value is passed unchanged

18773116
integer	unsigned
when you have even number of conversions you either need to take care that the value of the number is a non negative integer that is not using the highest bit in this case it is not important if the type is signed or unsigned

18773149
width	height
now if your screen width gets too small to accommodate its total width then it will overflow horizontally and horizontal scroll bar will be introduced...and if one cell gets too tall then row size will take the height of tallest cell and rest of the cell will be aligned vertically middle by default...you cant change this property dynamically depending on screen size

18773152
ireport	subreports
and the subreports s design is in ireport

18773193
integer	unsigned
the integer promotions sections of the standards covers conversion of signed and unsigned very well

18773193
integer	unsigned
regarding promoting a like-sized signed integer to an unsigned integer where the signed integer is not in range of the unsigned integer it is less than zero 0

18773206
textarea	textbox
because table cells do not have values so you can not set the value like you would for textbox or textarea

when you synthesize your property xcode is going to generate setter and getter for your property unless your property is read-only

18773299
subtraction	addition
then the following jquery will allow the addition or subtraction of 1 to occur from the text-value converted to an integer upon the checking or unchecking respectively

18773336
int	double
the object obj can be any numeric types like int float double etc

18773336
int	double
but when i tested it with int float double the attributetypestr always returns non-numeric

18773336
int	double
i guess that s because int float double are subclasses of number but number.class does not equal double.class

18773347
getter	setter
then you could access the variable via a property getter setter where the getter and setter check the current thread id and throw an exception if it is not the same as the original thread id

18773347
put	get
you buy a tv you put it in your apartment only people in your apartment are allowed to watch your tv. the details of single threaded apartments vs multithreaded apartments vs free threading get quite complicated

18773406
folder	directory
actually you not checking and not opening the same file you re passing absolute path to file.exists and relatively path to file.readalllines if the current directory is different from path.getdirectoryname application.executablepath which is the case when you start your program on boot i guess it should be windir system32 but i am not sure - however it is definitively not your application folder

18773447
min	max
if i understand correctly you want to be able to change the parameters of the slider step min max etc. after it s been initialized

18773512
min	max
one for min x bound one for max

18773512
min	max
any time you move resize rotate or otherwise change the bounds of a sprite you d then have to update those lists by removing the old values of min and max from each of your two lists and adding them in at the new positions

18773512
min	max
for extra speed you would most likely also want to store the min and max values for x and y and only change them if the sprite action would change them

18773512
minimum	max	min	max
so if a sprite is placed below the minimum or above the max you could update the value with a simple assignment to the new min or max

18773512
min	max
and if the sprite was the only element in the array for the current min column and was moved higher then you d loop from the old min up to the sprite s new position and set the new min to the first occupied array element and the same but opposite for the max column

18776816
ceil	floor
i think most of us know about the solution we can find floor ceil by modified binary search

18776816
ceil	floor
but i discovered that same binary search algo does work but for floor we need to just write and for ceil

18776816
ceil	floor
and if floor return -1 then show n a and if ceil return a value which is greater than array index than show n a

to make it responsive i changed the layout to vertical on screen sizes smaller than 908px and use jquery s toggle function to show hide the horizontal menu when on a small screen by pressing a little menu button

18791530
width	height
attribute layout_centerinparent will only work if the width and height are set to wrap_content

18791530
width	height
alternatively you can set the height and width to fill_parent and set the textview s

18791530
width	height
so even though you set the textview s height and width to fill_parent it actually only fills up the space leftover after placing the back button

18791573

when you are using gcc or g++ on the command line you are in control over what directory the final application runs in

after expanding the image when advancing through the expanded gallery all of the images appear to be anchored at the bottom meaning when you switch from a landscape long-side horizontal image to a portrait long-side vertical image the bottom edge of the image will stay in one place and the remainder of the image will expand upwards

18791652
portrait	landscape
this doesn t work too badly except if when you go from a portrait image to a landscape image the new image is sitting at the bottom of the viewport

18791861
portrait	landscape
my method works fine in portrait but when i set a transform on one of my subviews in landscape i get this error

so it looks like the same format but the post is including some screwy time value and the put some other screwy time value neither of which are correct

18791987
hash	md5
a hash of the data md5 sha whatever you want

18792007
hex	binary

trie	tree
the standard implementation of a prefix tree is a trie

18792581

18792852
versioning	upgrade
looks like changing the size is only a problem for users that already have a local db created this is because there is no way to change the size of the db when running upgrade scripts for versioning

spaces	delimiter
getline as a default uses r and n as a delimiter compared with cin which also use spaces

18792912

18792945
width	height
the array you re allocating needs to be pixel width pixel height number of bands in size

18792947

this works because the implementation of anonymous types is such that they override the equals method to compare the values of each member of the type and also overrides the gethashcode method to make it a composite hash of the hashes of all of the values of the object

18793025
ember.js	javascriptmvc
a better and far less cumbersome approach is to use one of many javascriptmvc frameworks like backbonesjs ember.js or angularjs

jar	war
note that this plugin execution should happen after you copy the war into your jar project so that the file exists specifically

18793081

google-chrome	firefox
when i load this into ie9 the buttons do nothing fine in google-chrome and firefox

your server may need to keep one open tcp connection per client but each client does not need many tcp connections open - one tcp connection can handle any number of udp associate commands

18795312

the tcp connection is needed so that the socks proxy knows when to disassociate the udp ports namely when the tcp connection goes down

the search would also show that both firefox and google-chrome are supposedly supporting it and that one might have to enable a flag in about config about flags respectively that would allow the usage of extensions that are still in draft status

the following script will list all folder within a directory tree that contain at least one file

18795564
integer	unsigned
arithmetic on unsigned always yields unsigned which can be a problem when subtracting integer quantities that can reasonably result in a negative result â think subtracting money quantities to yield balance or array indices to yield distance between elements

google-chrome	firefox
i am making a website and it has as background a video assets mp4 file and when i tested it i saw it in different way in google-chrome explorer firefox for it i would need to add to my code to get to fit it in all browsers

make sure you re accessing your site by ssl https at the beginning of the url if you ve got the secure flag set

put	get
obviously this works when there are two values for stp more and you can put them alphabetically by priority or use a correlated sub-query to get the value for stp

18795712
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
to understand why just consider that it is possible to have case-sensitive and case-insensitive filesystems mounted at the same time

18795746
integer	unsigned
also as you probably know many parts of standard library already rely on unsigned integer types quite heavily

18795746
integer	unsigned	floating-point	integer
the only real reason to prefer signed in some contexts that comes to mind is that in mixed integer floating-point code signed integer formats are typically directly supported by fpu instruction set while unsigned formats are not supported at all making the compiler to generate extra code for conversions between floating-point values and unsigned values

18795746
integer	unsigned
but at the same time in purely integer code unsigned types might perform better than signed types

18795749

18795848
getter	setter
i wasn t able to figure out how to reuse a lens as both a getter and a setter

18795848
getter	setter
readm debug mvarlens and setm debug mvarlens both work just fine but any construct like let debugmvarlens debug mvarlens loses either the fact it works as a getter the fact it works as a setter or the knowledge that int is an instance of show so it can me used for debug

18795919
tput	tcsh
more portably to shells other than csh and tcsh the tput command part of the ncurses package is similar to echotc but it uses terminfo capability names rather than termcap though it also supports termcap if support is compiled into the package

18804448
getter	setter
this way all subclasses of buildingmaterial can give access to amount through getter and setter

18804448
getter	setter
you may have amount declared as protected so you wont need getter or setter to access that field inside subclasses

18804461

to illustrate this point imagine enhancing the model with a padding class and changing the make_box function so that instead of returning a box object that is possibly smaller than the size specified by the width and height arguments it always returns a box having exactly those dimensions but also including a padding attribute encoding any discrepancy between the specified aspect_ratio and the specified width and height

18813800

to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

integer	unsigned
v.size returns a size_type which is an unsigned integer type most likely the same as std size_t which often is a typedef for unsigned long long so your v.size -1 wraps around since it can never be a negative number

the compiler firstly checks the reference type of acobj which is a .class a has the saygreetings method so its ok.but the actual object is a c .so the compiler starts from subclassing c to find whether this method is implemented all the way to the superclass a .the method saygreetings is overriden at c class

18817479
superclass	subclassing
it s just polymorphism.since an a class reference variable can be either a or c object the compiler restricts the access only to the methods that are common which are the methods of the superclass a.next it checks whether this method is implemented at the class of the actual object c .if it is not it moves up to the superclass a and calls the method of the superclass.but if it is implemented it calls the method of the subclassing c

clicking a button includes mousedown and then mouseup activities

18821760
mouseup	mousedown
when you refresh the items in the gridview too quickly your mousedown activity happens on one button instance then the list refreshed and the button instance under your mouse is replaced by other button instance so mouseup activity done on other button instance

18821760
mouseup	mousedown
you can change the click event to mousedown or mouseup event and ensure firing but i don t sure it would be the right solution from the design point of view

18821769

18822822
coalesce	isnull
if you want to have 0 or any other value then use isnull or coalesce

18822822
coalesce	isnull
you most likely want to use isnull or coalesce around both unit and unit_1 if you want to treat an absent value of one of these columns as zero values

18822822
sum	coalesce	coalesce	isnull
in that case if you want to get a zero in a resultset even if there are no values that match your case condition you still need to use isnull or coalesce around sum

18822839
int	boolean
like the javadoc says sparsebooleanarrays map int to boolean which basically means that it s like a map with int as a key and a boolean as value map

18822839
int	boolean
however it s more efficient to use in this particular case it is intended to be more efficient than using a hashmap to map int to boolean

18822927
int	boolean
from what i get from the documentation it is for mapping int values to boolean

18822944
int	chars
i know how to create in boost graph a graph with int or chars vertexes see commented code below

18824523
kerberos	ntlm
it will not work if you are using integrated authetication as this will still require ntlm kerberos or whatever

18824523
kerberos	ntlm
by allowing the phantomjs executable to bypass the proxy you will overcome the problems which i and many others have experienced but you will still have a bit of an issue as you will have just broken your system security so be aware and hope that there is a new version phantomjs which handles ntlm kerberos

18824531
switching	screens
another thing i want to ask you is it possible to show a loading screens like a ajax gif inside my panel my extension needs a few seconds after switching a tab to get the dom data every time i press the toolbar button

hash	md5
that would ve been fine except for one thingâ the canonical spec only supports using md5 as the hash function

18828089

of course you could store both the bcrypt hash and the md5 hash but doing so only undermines the security of the bcrypt hash effectively rendering it useless since an attacker can shift his efforts into brute forcing the md5 hash instead

comparing coalesce and isnull

18828687
coalesce	isnull
the isnull function and the coalesce expression have a similar purpose but can behave differently

18828687
coalesce	isnull
isnull uses the data type of the first parameter coalesce

18828687
coalesce	isnull
the nullability of the result expression is different for isnull and coalesce

18828687
coalesce	isnull
isnull takes only 2 parameters whereas coalesce takes a variable

18828697
coalesce	isnull
isnull can only have one input however it s been shown to be slightly faster than coalesce

18828718
coalesce	isnull
the main difference is that coalesce is ansi-standard so you will also find it in other rdbmss the other difference is you can give a whole list of values to be checked to coalesce whereas to isnull you can only pass one

18828859
ssl	https
as far as i know you could say that it s not a bug it s a feature one of the features of ssl that it prevents man in the middle attacks if you want to use ssl then nginx it self should have an ssl key and allow https connection otherwise the user will see the well known yellow warning page about untrusted ssl

if i set height and width to 100 then the images resize but the slider stops working

18829245

you should apply height to img tag inside li this will stretch height of image to fit container and to center image by adding text-align center rule to its container

18829423

depending on how you need to fit image you may want to stretch image by width instead of height

int	double
the standard library functions frexp and ldexp will reliably convert between a double and the corresponding mantissa and int binary exponent

18831320
int	double
but if you just want to transmit floating point numbers over the wire and you don t have some idiosyncratic processor to support i d suggest just sending the raw bits of the float or double as a 4-byte or 8-byte int in whatever byte order you ve selected as standard and restricting yourself to ieee-754 32- and 64-bit representations

18831320
int	double
the result is not really precision-dependent as long as you can transmit arbitrary precision int so you don t need to distinguish between float double or some other binary representation

i mean the usecase is also weird but you could use event.which before the post was made to determine if the user clicked on the button or used enter or whatever and only if they did it then you could only show to that particular user making the comment that they did indeed press click the submit and not use automation to make a submission

18833226

18833522
goto	break
besides this and other convenience features notably automatic resizing push_back the biggest advantage of std vector over creating arrays with new is that it adheres to raii meaning that it will automatically it s objects memory as soon as it leaves scope -- no matter if by falling off the function s end a return statement break continue goto or throwing an exception

18833530
put	get
i think f# don t allow that kind of match so it is better to put a conditional to get what you want

18833544
integer	fractions
division regular_members regular_group yields a integer result so any fractions becomes 0

18833549
ienumerable	iqueryable

btw basic auth challenge can cause browser to pop-up browser auth dialog which is not expected in most of the web application

udp	tcp
in theory smtp can be handled by either tcp udp or some 3rd party protocol

18833814
udp	tcp
in addition the internet assigned numbers authority has allocated port 25 for both tcp and udp for use by smtp

18833814
udp	tcp
for example in microsoft s port listing port 25 is only listed for tcp and not udp

18833814
udp	tcp
the big difference between tcp and udp that makes tcp ideal here is that tcp checks to make sure that every packet is received and re-sends them if they are not whereas udp will simply send packets and not check for receipt

18833814
udp	tcp
considering smtp it makes more sense to use tcp over udp

18833904
hide	show
i know about ctrl + to show hide formulas -- that isn t it

18833907

instead of getting a json response from the post you should get a text html response that contains the result of rendering the template on the server with the values that would have been returned via json and then replacing the innerhtml of the dom node that s being updated

18833911
google-chrome	firefox
however that doesn t work -- at least not in google-chrome or firefox on linux which is all i have access to

18833915

width	height
something is recognized though since the display window does adapt itself to the correct height and width

18833936
slideup	slidedown
so instead of doing a slidetoggle on all of the li s you want to be more specific as to which ones to slideup and slidedown

18833936
slideup	slidedown
basically you need to check if the link has the class if it does then slideup because it is already open otherwise slidedown because it wasn t opened

18834082
vbscript	vba
i am working on vba from which i have to call a vbscript by passing some values

int	chars
i have done it when the result is an int but when i get a float i do not know how to convert that result to a string of chars that represents my plaintext

18834155
put	get
since you had to type your string in quotes originally so that it would evaluate to a string instead of a constructor expression show will put quotes around it so you could paste the value back into ghci and get a string value instead of a constructor value

18834178
cos	sin
i m try to use sin 1 and cos 1 but can t understand how rotateonaxis works cause translate functions work like a charm and moves camera in direction in what she sees

create table x id int primary key name chars 10

18834365
uipangesturerecognizer	uiswipegesturerecognizer
yes you can tell the uiwebview s uiscrollview that its uipangesturerecognizer should only fire when your own uiswipegesturerecognizer has failed

18834372

i know top left corner and also i know the width and height of the square

18834428
uipangesturerecognizer	uiswipegesturerecognizer

18834461
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
and i have tested it using safari firefox and google-chrome

18834518

but later on it will show hide when button tapped

hide	show
update i have this code to animate show hide the uipickerview later on using button so what i need is initial position to be outside the screen when user runs the app

18834529
width	margin
so this will make the width of you textview go all the way to the other side of the screen but indent the right margin 20dp so you would see the space you want

18834532
tabs	tabpanel
for example if the tabs are called tabpanel1 tabpanel2 tabpanel3 and tabpanel 4 then a ui element on the first tab would be referred to as tabpanel1_controlname

opera	firefox
i ve tried my site with dolphin firefox and opera and it is not working

18834570

select one set of cross-platform libs for example freebidi + harfbuzz-ng + freetype + fontconfig or a framework like qt and recompile them for each target system or

18834577
google-chrome	firefox
i think harfbuzz-ng has reached parity with uniscribe even on windows so that s the lib i d target if i wanted cross-platform today google-chrome firefox and libreoffice use it at least on some platforms

the div with the rel attr is just the parent not the parents parent

my advice export from excel to a .csv file and have it either comma or spaces delimiter based on your needs

18834646

but i read a post that says to get around the issue to append a to the end of each search

18834650

salt	md5
i m having some trouble using salt with md5

18834744

18834759
pop-up	dialog
when a grid s edition mode is set to pop-up it automatically generates a dialog box to let the user modify the editable fields of the selected row

18834786
inherited	properties
and do not use such deep inherited heirarchies for each address account and other properties to be included in child dtos

post	get
i have this action where i get the data via post in array format and save it to a database this part works but im trying to do this via ajax i think im having problems getting the data from the form or maybe sending the data to my php script

18834967
spaces	delimiter
then zip the data and writer via csv writer with spaces as a delimiter

18834979
int	double
casting a double to int will cut off decimal places

18834990
disk	ram
furthermore even if you are using the file system to name your destination socket if that socket has been accessed recently its file system structures will be cached in ram so you won t have to go to to disk

18835051
emacs	lighttable
i know at least lighttable allows external dependencies in their instarepl so i assume you can do it in emacs and ccw.

18835092
folder	directory
i need to copy an entire folder in a secure directory one of the directory that i pbrun into onto my windows computer not a server just a regular pc

18835110
shadowing	named
you could use double-underscore variables which will automatically do some name-mangling so that the shadowing behavior is preserved but in general a more cleaner solution would be to simply use different variable named and design the code so that you don t need two different versions of the same attribute floating around

18835143
integer	unsigned
it is mostly likely a pointer to a volatile unsigned integer indicating the unsigned integer is volatile and not the pointer

18835143
integer	unsigned
each of the struct members will be a volatile unsigned integer and somewhere there will be a base address defined that indicates where the registers start in the memory map

i have a show hide script that works perfect

18835288
uiview	subviews

rubygems	rvm
edited to add - if you run rvm rubygems 2.0.7 latest that seems to be really available right now it seems to work

18835323
subtract	add
your best bet is to make an assembly in msil with arithmetic functions like add subtract etc. then call those from your c# code

18835348
width	height
so although you could set the height and width of an object in html you would have to use css to use the active and hover selectors

18835411
google-chrome	firefox
but when opening from other locations firefox and google-chrome give security warnings and do not display the app even with java control panel set to medium also ie displays the following message

18835423

18837727
nunit	moq
from time-to-time i have a situation where i make a change in the repo teamcity kicks off and then fails because it can t find moq nunit

18837772
put	get
it runs without errors but it pushes nothing as the repo folder is empty i guess if i could get azure to put the files into repo instead site repository everything would be fine

post	get
to do a get instead of a post everything works fine

18837804
getter	setter
i have setup a regular getter and setter method for sessionid and registered the varaible as a managed-property

18837825
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
if you re just migrating feature states from a previous versioning of the same install you can do this by authoring the upgrade table - fill in your upgrade code and versioning range then set attributes to 771 and it will copy over the feature states without removing the other installation

18837869
put	get	post	get	post	put
additionally you should be able to use backbone models fetch get save post put destroy delete methods instead of writing ajax requests directly in the model

18837900
onmouseover	onclick
if this function handles both onmouseover and onclick events - you can check event.type and disable tooltips only if it s equal mouseover

18837959
google-chrome	firefox
this only works in firefox and not in google-chrome

18837977
decoder	encoder
what i am looking for is a way to pass individual frame grabs of an input source into an encoder transmit the encoded output across the network and then decoder the frame into some image standard bitmap preferred on the other end

18837981

a string can contain many lines lines defined as string delimiter by a cr linefeed or crlf

18837987
width	height
and get close look at the div#cover is 100 width and height is perfect look and i would like to see my code do the same

18838085
jstl	taglib
i think for jsp spring expects that jstl is the way to go for a taglib

18838096
comparator	comparable
the generic type of the method should extend comparable not comparator

18838109
for-loop	loops
i think its because of the for-loop using the addresses in the vector that have been changed causing it to never leave loops

18838137
mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	mousemove	mouseover	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup
would it be some combination of mouseover mousedown mousemove mouseup events

18838142

jtable	jeditorpane
trying to use jeditorpane for one column in a jtable without any success

18838196
jlabel	jeditorpane
main reason for this is that i want to add a hyperlinklistener and jeditorpane should apparently be a better choice for this than the default jlabel

18838201
google-chrome	firefox
and on the client side google-chrome firefox i get websocket is already in closing or closed state when trying to send second message

18838337
post	get
i m trying to get an excel sheet to go from this sorry my reputation isn t high enough to post pictures so hosted them myself..

18838371
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter
probably you would like also to use mouseenter mouseleave events rather than mouseover mouseout if you will nest text div inside circle div

18838388
hash	md5
only other minor point is to make sure datatohash is utf-8 encoded before you convert to md5 hash

18838402
post	get
i have manage to get get requests to work with no particular problem however the minute i start using post i get 403

18838420
width	height
so width to height ratio 1.333

18838498
children	parent
the thing is i have these parent divs layed out by using floats to look like they make a pic frame where the children divs are clickable and content appears inside the frame. not shown in jsfiddle

18838518
rational-numbers	fractions
after computing my matrix a which has size 5 x 10 000 and each entry contains rational-numbers in fractions form with total number of digits for numerator and denominator more than 10 pages i run the following command

18838518
cpu	processors
i should also note that i m using a laptop with a 64-bit operating system x64-based processors windows 8 i7 cpu 2.40 ghz and 8 gb ram

18838534
min	max	range	max	range	min
alternatively maybe a nested query to give the min and max ids if the some_conditions prevent you from making this sort of assumption about the range of ids in your result

18838540
udp	tcp
use af_inet if you want to communicate using internet protocols tcp or udp

18838580
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
works in ie google-chrome and firefox but not safari 6

18838605
width	height
size width pixels height pixels pixel size byte

18838605
width	height
for 16 bit pixels - 2 bytes per pixels - size width height 2 bytes

18838676
range	max
this operation is well within the range of long values max value 9223372036854775807 over 9 quintillion

18838759
next	except
it looks fine except for i don t know how to stop the viewpager from either snapping back to its original position or completely going to the next page

18838773
writetofile	nsdata
if you re writing image data why not try writing via nsdata s writetofile options error method the error parameter for which can give you some really useful hints as to why your file isn t writing

18838796
put	get
i can t think of how to get it to recognize the end of line character though incase they don t put a period

18838805
versioning	upgrade
basically i am sending the app versioning from app to application server and then deciding whether to show the app upgrade reminder screen or not

18838806
width	height
every now and again an app throws a width and height must be non-negative error

18838913
width	margin
applying auto margin to an absolutely positioned inline element with unknown width introduces various problems

18838937
many-to-many	one-to-many
i am working with symfony 2.3 on a new project using an existing database with numerous associations - many-to-many one-to-many etc

18838939
post	get
once you add the to your route the magical code that uses the prefix of the method name to determine get post functionality doesn t work

18838959
multiplying	multiplication
the difference is that the default behavior is to multiplying and then or each multiplication

18839057
hide	show
i have one script that displays one div or another based show instead of hide on what a user selects from a dropdown list

18839087
superclass	subclassing
it seems that if i call both superclass and subclassing .on init functions oninit only the subclassing version will be called

18839091
getter	setter
however if you want getter and setter at the latest in a conforming implementation of ecmascript edition 5 you can have that natively

18839091
accessor	properties
â works because the return value of the function is used lhs but as part of another expression that evaluates to a properties access using the dot properties accessor syntax

18839099
integer	radix
i have a function that takes a radix base and then using getchar will get the number to convert from the given radix to an integer representation

18839123
ctime	strftime
generally the way to display the value of a time_t is to break down its components to a struct tm using gmtime or localtime and display those or convert them as desired with strftime or ctime to go directly from time_t to a string showing local time

18839123
floating-point	integer
if you want to see the raw value for some purpose the c standard specifies that time_t is real which means it is integer or floating-point c 2011 n1570 6.2.5 17

18839202
free	malloc
at the area i marked here i believe i am malloc-ing for all instances of info in the row struct these line are the only ones doing malloc free

18839221
width	height
so you can use the example code as long as the width and height of the containing div remains the same and also the aspect ration of the image stays at 4 3

18839231
flatmap	fold
you just wrap each snippet of code that can run independently of others in a call to the future factory function and you can then compose transform the results of each snippet also in parallel using calls to map flatmap fold etc. or with for comprehensions

18839256
octal	decimal
0320 is likely the octal representation of decimal 208 though i m not sure why the status would be reported in octal

18839278
range	minimum
if the data is sorted evenly spaced and you know the minimum and maximum values it is a simple proportion calculation to determine the first and last index in the plot range

18839302
google-chrome	firefox
i am learning scrapy and wondering is there some existing tool - probably google-chrome maybe web developer or firefox plug-in to quickly get the xpath of a web element

18839357
post	get
i have been struggling to get the facebook c# sdk to post to my page as the page for a couple of days

18839377
mdpi	hdpi
launcher icon is 48x48dp so 48px on mdpi 72px on hdpi etc.

18839409
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
any page inside any folder displays a page can t be displayed error or similar in all browsers ie firefox google-chrome safari unless the page is a default.aspx page

18839409
folder	directory
i also deleted all of the files and folder in my temp directory

18839421
pop-up	dialog
i have a custom action which pop-up a dialog

18839446
width	height
the image will be background size cover and at the same time i will add the image inside the same div with 100 width and height and 0 opacity

18839449
debian	linux
debian gnu linux unstable sid linux zoonman

18839549
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
edit here s a jsfiddle showing the same problem in google-chrome no problem in firefox nor opera

18839572
google-chrome	safari
all the stuff that safari and google-chrome do to render not-quite-standard real-world pages isn t accessible this way. looking at how chromium ripped out the js engine and replaced it with another might help at which point you might be able to build the same api as a wrapper around cpython but it s not going to be easy

18839601
for-loop	loops
the for-loop over 1 000 000 iterations is actually very very fast since there are no changes after the first loops some engines like v8 will actually optimize the rest of loops ideally

18839612
put	get
you might need to use a different method for determining which key to put in each array but you get the general idea

18839647
range	minimum
when i call getrandom i don t achieve the expected result because it always returns the minimum number of the range given

18839674
move	drag
so for example if you change yview to not call textbox.yview you can drag the scrollbar all you want but the text view won t move

18839687
button	checkbox
in the callback that i use to display the setting which contains the radio button i enable them and disable them based on a checkbox value

18839692
serializable	deserialization
i suggest that you encapsulate the data you want to serializable in a helper class and limit the serializable deserialization to those data

18839716
min	max
it does work when i get rid of either the max or the min

18839731
plot	heatmap
i usually use ggplot2 but in this case i am using the regular image function to plot a heatmap of a large data set

18839755
post	put
you can put the data into a form element and post that form to an action that s set up to receive it

18839788
put	get
now i m a bit lost as to where to put the code to get the image data if helpers cannot call on controllers

18839821
awt	swing
painting in awt and swing that discusses overriding an update

18839950
switching	screens
my memory jumps up when i switching screens but doesn t go back down when i switching back to the previous screens

18839954
public	protected
the module being used is stored in the protected variable module in the mx_router class however there is no public method to allow you to get access to it

18839956
awt	swing
take a look at painting in awt and swing

18839996
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
guys i am new to xhtml and css and for some reason the website i am building looks fine in google-chrome and safari but looks totally incomplete on ie and firefox

18840027
uiview	subviews
i have a viewcontroller that will be adding two subviews uiview to it depending on what goes on

18840035
opera	firefox
you need to copy all those css values and add -moz- for firefox -ms- for internet explorer and -o- for opera

18840078
rspec	capybara
i m going through the rails tutorial and i noticed that it recommends including capybara via config.include capybara dsl in spec_helper.rb whereas the capybara readme recommends adding require capybara rspec to spec_helper.rb

18840088
post	put
it s difficult to put this into words and i m not really sure how i can help make it clearer but i ll edit this post if i can think of anything useful to add

18840143
rspec	capybara
if you take a look at the contents of capybara rspec here on github you will see it that it also calls config.include capybara dsl but it also does some other setup making sure capybara sessions are reset after running specs switching to the js driver if necessary etc.

18840143
rspec	capybara
i think you should go with what the capybara readme says and require capybara rspec so that you are less exposed to potential changes in the way capybara hooks into rspec

18840147
versioning	upgrade
is there anyway to upgrade the vb script working environment to same environment versioning in both of 7 and xp is currently 5.8 so that i don t have to worry about the environment to run my script

18840181

18845775
getter	setter
other reason why getter and setter are better than public fields in java

18845788
getter	setter
if the public getter and public setter are just to return the value of the private property and to change its value then i see no difference

18845805
getter	setter
but in team developpment you may need to have some control on modification and you can do it through the getter and setter

18845805
getter	setter
moreover in some classes you ll only have getter as the setter will be done by the constructor or via some other functions

18845820
getter	setter
making variables private in java and providing getter and setter for them makes your class compatible java bean naming convention

18845821
opera	google-chrome
while google-chrome and opera does...

18845825
getter	setter
if you have a data transfer object with limited scope and by design it should have no logic associated with it i don t see a value in getter and setter

18845825
getter	setter
initially it might appear that all the getter and setter are trivial and just fill up you class but over time you might add validation to the setter and even change the getter

18845991
getter	setter
if your class has no invariants to maintain then writing public getter and setter for a private data member is pointless

18845991
getter	setter
note that just because you have a data member doesn t mean you have to write any getter or setter for it

itâ s strongly suggested that you use get and post instead of request

18846317
post	get
for convenience a dictionary-like object that searches post first then get

18846317

perhaps the authors of this code did not know if the form would be submitted via post or get so used request to make sure they caught both

the .hover is a short cut to register both mouseenter and mouseleave handlers if only one function is passed then the same function is called on both the events

18847511
getter	setter
sometimes a class attribute could have more than one getter or setter let s illustrate with a silly short example

18847511
getter	setter
is meaningless to store the value more than once for each unit type which you want to work so the getter and setter will provide an interface that makes the class able to work with different units

18847511
getter	setter
imho when a object contains active attributes attributes that must do some work after or before it is assigned or accessed it must be a class with only the essential getter and setter the private attributes that doesn t need accessed outside the class obviously doesn t need public getter and setter

18847511
getter	setter
in the other hand if an object conains only passive attributes attributes that doesn t need extra work when assigned or accessed it must be a struct and therefore all his attributes would be public accesible without getter and setter

18847583

you can fetch the operation from the server side match them and show and hide accordingly

18847902

svm	naivebayes
ordering of the features does not affect any of classifiers i know except those which are specially designed to do so - like specialistic classifiers for time series and other temporal features no matter if it is neural network svm randomforest randomtree or naivebayes - it is just a numerical simplification as arrays are faster then sets while under the hood they are treated as unordered sets only with indicies showing from which dimension it comes from

18867106
google-chrome	safari
but i think only webkit google-chrome safari has one for the scrollbar so it isn t very cross browser

create a string with a query and execute it using prepare statements

18873389
int	double
hence double pow double int is an extension rather than a standard function

18873389
int	double
hence there should be a double pow double int overload

18873389
int	double
however this overload must as he says in his answer cast the int to a double and call double pow double double

18873389
int	double
finally the link provided by hulk is very relevant and howard hinnant again explains that there s almost no reason to provide an optimized overload that does anything different from casting the int to the double

18873410
tunnel	packets	tunnel	lan
this protocol on top of tcp ip is that will tunnel the communication inform the lan address or some session aggregated later that the nat should redirect the packets

hide	fadeout
the hide and the fadeout which changes the display to none causing the layout to jump

18873838
hide	fadeout	fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout
so what i did was remove the hide statement all together and instead of using fadein and fadeout i used fadeto which instead of fading all the way to 0 i faded to 0.01 which still gives it the look of completely fading out but without emptying the container

hash	md5
so i would be glad to use hash md5 translation text as an id string

18874406
int	double
otherwise if any argument corresponding to a double parameter has type double or an int type then all arguments corresponding to double parameters are effectively cast to double

18874406
int	double
edit yet when looking at this answer it is indeed possible for an implementation to still provide an optimized overload for int powers as long as it behaves exactly like std pow double x double y

18874422
stateless	stateful
the beans are currently stateless but will become stateful to store use the value of the schema parameter as well as some other stuff if we can figure out what s wrong

post	get
is there any way to post values while redirecting to an aspx page from code behind i can send it using a get like below

18874649
for-loop	loops	floating-point	integer
there are usually better ways to write loops that use a sequence of floating-point values such as using an integer for-loop control and calculating the floating-point value from the integer in each iteration

18874649
for-loop	loops	floating-point	integer
alternatively you can use a floating-point object for-loop control but take care to use only integer values for loops expressions.

18874689
client-side	server-side
i m able to do this client-side but forcing all of my test connections to close but i d rather do it server-side to just tell the http server to hard-close all sockets

18874895
hex	binary
the binary data is definitely received correctly on the client side as a hex dump of the buffer shows

18874919
client-side	server-side
i m not entirely familiar with jsp but as a server-side language it must have some way to simply echo a literal value to the client-side output

18874919
client-side	server-side
but since we re talking about server-side variables those variables can emit client-side constants

18874919
client-side	server-side
essentially what this is doing it looping through a server-side collection to emit multiple lines of client-side code

18874928
children	parent
of course changing the datacontext for the parent control changes it also for the children

18874942

18875060
google-chrome	safari
i ve just tried safari so far simulator but i suspect google-chrome will be the same

18875082

libs	buildpath
to fix the issue got to your project s buildpath configuration under libs you should find the jars-folder as class-file-folder

18875475
children	parent
after doing some logging i came to the conclusion that the parent level baseexpandbleadapater will call create a childview corresponding to the number of children in your dataset group

18875475
children	parent
it is confusing because your child nested adapter handles displaying the actual children whereas in a single nested list you children are handled within that same parent adapter class

18875475
children	parent
in this scenario the child nested adapter is going to handle displaying what would be the children as its own groupview making the number of children in the parent adapter irrelevant

18875547
int	chars
i d like to be able to use 4 chars locale like en-us but enus is okay as well as the - is superfluous afaik as an unsigned 16 bit int directly in my code without any runtime overhead

width	height
bitmap picture has both horizontal and vertical resolution 150 dpi 24 color bit depth width 4395 pixels and height 5613 pixels

18875548
put	get

18875775
int	chars
sure you can encode enus in a 16-bit int if you get to choose how you encode each chars but you can t encode every 4-letter string

18875798
put	get
the simplest thing to do is poll the directory at an interval say 2 to 5 seconds an eternity in computer time read the directory using opendir and readdir call stat to get the mod time and put it in a list not a queue

18875808

18876098
floating-point	fractions
remember that when floating-point values are converted to integral values the fractions part is simply truncated

18876098
int	chars
since printf is a variadic function it promotes values of type chars to int

if it s a static form you can add jquery code to replace the content when change has been detected in each part using show and hide or other effects to do this

18882617
getter	setter
the style guides in my shop suggests formatting simple getter and setter like this

getter	setter
abcxyz adding something like to the getter and setter methods which showed that there were actually 2 different instances of the class for some reason

18882964
hide	show
i think the easiest fix is to set the input processor in show and clear it in hide

18882964
hide	show
alternatively you could have your callbacks check to see if the button stage screen they are in is active or unregister re-register the callbacks in show hide depending on how you are using your screens

18883050
folder	directory
you should absolutely have a web.config at the root of the publish directory and a bin folder with your dll s

18883066
getter	setter
you probably want to use factory or change your getter setter to this.get this.set

versioning	upgrade
after opening an old ios 6 app xcode asked me if i wanted to upgrade my ib doc to versioning 5.0 or skip

18883099
hide	show
and when button clicked it show the text every thing work fine except the result of my code lead to hide whole textview not only the text because i set my textview background to drawable shape which form red border around the text as

18883099
hide	show
when start app you can see empty space only which will be fill with text after button click but there s no border there which come from shape background so it hide whole textview and i need it to hide only text and keep the textview with its background show when text set to invisible

18883102
put	get
i heard that there s a way to add submodules but for some reason they get put in the root of the repo so i d have to manually move them after adding them every time and removing submodules also is a pain in the ass if i want to change something

18883155
button	checkbox
when i press submit button i pass all the checkbox statuses to the controller that has the following signature

18883172
stdout	stderr
but if you want to run that after java has already started using runtime.getruntime .exec you ll find that tput can t talk to your terminal because java has redirected stdout and stderr

18883176
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

18883178

edit finally it seems that this error occurs because you need to override equals and gethashcode in your address class

18883255
width	height
the problem is if the view is a rectangle but not a square after 90 degrees of rotating the width gets the value of height and even the value of the height gets width

18883284
post	get
you would be better taking the submitted data ie post get and first checking the names and data is what it should be ie strlen regex for a-z0-9 possibly an array with all valid data etc and then once you are happy all data submitted is valid then get your prices from a database other source based on the form names

18883288
put	get
it seems like if i can just get the stupid token to pass into an httpwebrequest header i could put an insert into the body of the request and do what i want

18883294

update the problem does not occur if i use ie 10 only with firefox and google-chrome

18883394
put	get	post	get	post	put	google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome on the other hand make an options request the result of which is allow options trace get head post no put so i guess that s why it doesn t work

opengl-es	glkbaseeffect
how glkbaseeffect and glktextureloader fit into opengl-es drawing in general

18883423
opengl-es	glkview
glkview is just fine for any opengl-es drawing you want to do -- it does everything that the older documentation you linked to does setting up framebuffers caeagllayer s etc for you so you don t have to write that code

18883423
opengl-es	glkview
inside the glkview drawing method drawrect or glkview drawinrect depending on whether you re drawing in a subclass or delegate you write the same opengl-es drawing code you would for caeagllayer or any other system

18883423
glkbaseeffect	glkview
you can use glkview glktextureloader and glkbaseeffect independently of each other

18883423
glkbaseeffect	glkview
if you want to write all your own drawing code and use your own shaders you can draw in a glkview without using glkbaseeffect

18883498
getter	setter
this is a pretty common problem when it comes to integrating third party libraries especially libraries that are ports as box2das3 is where they keep the coding and naming conventions of the parent language rather than fully integrating with the destination language case in point box2das3 using getfoo and setfoo instead of a .foo getter setter

18883498
implements	extends
a class that just extends object and implements an empty getpostion function

18883498

cpu	processors
for a cpu you can check cpuid or sched_getcpu or getprocessornumber in order to check which core processors the current thread is currently executing on

18883551

18883568
button	checkbox
here s an example that makes checkbox function like radio button

18883590
int	chars	int	double
whilst i managed to get it to work using just the int type it seems that now i need to change it in order to implement an array of double and it would fill the array with chars using the type double and keep popping out double from the stack until it is empty and print them

18883590
int	double
basically this is what i had before using the type int and it was working and now he gave instructions and wants us to change it to type double and i was trying to merge them to no avail

18883596

put your view code inside a form and bind via action this form with your controller post method

18883705
mouseup	mousedown
the element moves out of the way before mouseup so just listen for mousedown instead

18883774
for-loop	arrays
if you want you could even use the for-loop to fill the arrays with the values you want

18883825
floating-point	integer
as a rule of thumb floating-point is about 2x slower than integer on

18883825
division	modulo
in such cases integer division and modulo

18883829
getter	setter
you need to provide some setter getter for that private variable

18883836
ffmpeg	libavformat
if you look at ffmpeg source libavformat rtpenc_h263_rfc2190.c in function ff_rtp_send_h263_rfc2190 you can see that the mb boundary info is passed to their packetizer from the encoder somehow

18883851
pbkdf2	salt
i chose to store the salt along with the pbkdf2 iterations in the passwordsalt column of webpages_membership and that way you can increase this value later on when computers get faster and upgrade your old passwords on the fly

18883891
width	height
you have to specify the group interaction as an aesthetic to the geom_point and the exact width height needed to be passed to the position_nudge depend on the size of the points and the size of the output

18883912
google-chrome	firefox
this is the case in google-chrome and firefox but not in internet explorer

18883913
google-chrome	firefox
use firefox with firebug or google-chrome with dev tools enabled

18883936
int	double
it would be much better to use an int offset by address of course than a double pointer

18883936
int	chars	int	double
you never changed yours when you text-replaced all chars with double which wasn t going to work anyway and were therefore sending a double to printf where it expected an int type

18883937
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari

what i am using and what i would suggest to everyone is using webstorm or phpstorm

18884097
gridview	rowdatabound
you can use rowdatabound event of gridview and bind changecode dropdown for particular state in this event

18884108
put	get
it won t be nicely put in header tags or anything like that but if you have a consistent pdf structure in your docs you might be able to get something working

18884266
versioning	upgrade
i haven t been able to find a good explanation of how all the bits client-rdk.csj client-pbdt.csj developer certificate key store blackberry id android package id versioning numbers portal packages applications vs upgrade etc... all tie together

18884308
super	self
when i call square and call its designated initialiser in self super init it calls the super class

18884308
superclass	subclassing
however when the superclass calls its designated initialiser named the same as one of the subclassing it calls the subclassing

18884308
superclass	subclassing
what i end up with is an infinite loop of the subclassing calling init on the superclass and that calling the subclassing initialiser

18884317
hide	show
try changing your selector to better specify what you want to show or hide

18884353

i can hide show the wide bar completely with a nice slide transition using

18884487
for-loop	arrays
i m trying to print the elements in an arrays using a for-loop but it s not coming out the right way

18884491
int	chars
given the outcome above why does textreader.read return an int and not a chars

18884492
cos	sin
those are so easy you don t even need sin and cos

18884497
for-loop	loops
that semicolon means your for-loop has an empty body and you end up printing after loops completes equivalently

18884503
flac	ogg	flac	speex	vorbis	webm	speex	ogg
i ve also tried installing directshow filters for ogg vorbis speex theora flac and webm and converting my video to theora vorbis in an ogg container

toggle recognizes the current state of the element show hide and applies the opposite effect to the selected element

18884548
min	max
i saw that the app inventor has blocks that do just this aptly called max and min but i cannot figure out how to use them

18884550
for-loop	arrays
it turns out i had a hard coded maximum index in my for-loop which was bigger than the arrays i was trying to assign to

18884576
clang	llvm
i ve built llvm and clang from source as described on the llvm website and i can import the clang.cindex module from a python script

18884708
folder	directory
as the name suggests this was placed here to remove .svn folder from the project www directory

18884708
folder	directory
this method uses shell.rm and shell.cp to remove the entire www directory then copy the root www directory over into the project folder

18884861
int	chars
but in the result it game me 1 chars type 2. and 1 int type 5

18884910
int	double
the reason for double is that float can t represent all 32-bit int values exactly

18884910
int	double
edit to test for a double value being integral just compare d int d

18885006
put	get
and i ve been trying to get a result set from json put in a simple adapter to load data into textview s contained in a relativelayout

18885016
put	get
i have attempted various places to put the file and have set the action as both embedded resource and content and in all cases i get the not found error

18885065
x86	64bit
edit_add interestingly this code runs 30 faster in x86 32-bit mode than in x64 64bit mode likely due to avoiding the slight extra overhead of extending the uint32 numbers to ulong s

18885069
min	max
if initialize the min and the max values to 0 it will keep on being the smallest value.i want it to show the largest number and the smallest number after the user has entered a series of integers

18885190

i want the boards to boot and mount the ram disk as the p1020 board does

18885311
screens	tablet
small size screens not for tablet

18885328
inherited	properties
this is actually a very neat trick which allows static properties to be inherited

18885328
inherited	properties
one of the biggest advantages of true prototypal inherited is that there s no distinction between normal properties and static properties allowing you to write code like this

18885328
inherited	properties
this also means that static properties are automatically inherited and are no different from normal properties

18885383
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
sounds like firefox has updated to follow the spec while google-chrome and opera haven t yet

the folder structure of the directory i d like to move them to is like this.

18885492
versioning	upgrade
i believe that amis in the 2.3.x range use jetty 7 so if you re inclined to upgrade to a later versioning of hadoop 1.0.3 that should also help

18885552
serializable	deserialization
so after digging around a while and trying to figure out how the built-in serializable deserialization in c# works i found out that c# has a method called getuninitializedobject

18885614
width	height
you can try passing the width and height that the image actually is see if that helps

18885614
width	height
fit scale the dimensions of the image proportionally to fit inside width height

18885614
width	height
if only one of width height are provided the image will be scaled proportionally

18885623
int	chars
is assigned to an int without first casting to an unsigned chars

18885641
int	chars
in order to return both a negative value and a chars int must be used

18885641
int	chars
in this example a chars is being assigned to an int in the while loop

18885641
int	chars
otherwise convert chars and short to int

18885647
int	chars
this implementation of getchar makes sure that all successfully read chars are returned as non-negative int values

18885647
int	chars
this behavior is required by the specification of getchar which literally says that the chars read is returned as unsigned chars values converted to int even if chars is signed on the given platform

18885674
put	get
but when i get these data and put it back on text input by ng-model i m getting s #227

18885676
pop-up	dialog
the issue is that pop-up blocker is blocking facebook share dialog when i call window.open

18885690
int	chars
aside from that assigning from chars to negative int and back to chars is guaranteed to produce the correct result and chars to negative int to unsigned chars is guaranteed to have the same result as a direct cast from chars to unsigned chars

18885722
post	get
i ve been researching this problem for a while now and have been trying to use the post method until recently when i figured out that the get method will be sufficient for what i need to do

18885735

to prevent cron from sending any mail make sure your script and any commands it spawns don t output anything to stdout or stderr

18886042
passenger	webrick
i have similar issues when using the default webrick but when uploading in production with apache and passenger i do not have these issues

18886073

i m trying to send a post request to get a file downloaded but i m having problem complete this operation using url

18886093
int	double
i am trying to write a map of heterogeneous function pointers and have mimicked that in a smaller program which has functions to either take a int or a double val

18886093
int	double
when i run this program i see the double value getting printed correctly but the int value is garbled

18886112
int	chars
they behave like int when it comes to math but will print as chars to the screen

18886112
int	chars
you simply need to cast the int to a chars for the string to concatenate properly

18886115
margin	height
the other thing you can do is put a view that s aligned to the bottom of the relativelayout and set its height to the bottom margin you would want to use or simply specify a value for layout_marginbottom like so

18886115
textview	imageview
this example fills the relativelayout with the imageview and positions a textview over the imageview

18886125
oncreate	setcontentview
try something like this relocate the setcontentview on oncreate

18886135
case-when	subquery
is there a way to nest case-when statements in an in statement such that one of the when or else returns a subquery

18886137
submit	submission	post	get
when the browser directs you to a link via an anchor click unless you catch all anchor clicks using jquery seems like overkill nor will headers be sent on form submit get post unless you again catch all forms submission and the killer is the fact that server side redirects will also not resend any custom headers

18886146
int	chars
you can simply cast int to chars

18886156
google-chrome	safari
since i m using the -webkit- prefix for the transition this example only will work with webkit browsers safari and google-chrome

18888565
equals	gethashcode
to implement from scratch what this basically involves is when you see an object for the first time typically using reference equality not equals gethashcode overrides or overloads you invent a new unique identifier

18888565
equals	gethashcode
the exact way this is implemented depends on the target framework but the preferred implementation is simply a using a custom comparer to ensure that the polymorphic gethashcode equals aren t used

18888672
int	chars
the card class has a chars for the suit and an int for the rank the deck class has a vector of 52 cards which needs to be private and the hand class has a vector of 5 cards which also needs to be a private member

18888691
int	chars
let s try to understand why it works with int and not with chars

18888691
int	chars
dr printf uses the stack overwriting some of the space pointed by str but since the int array is bigger in memory than the chars array it is far ahead in the stack and doesn t get overwritten

18888691
printf	strcpy
that memory could get overwritten with the stack that strcpy and printf uses

18888691
printf	strcpy
the thing here is that it is overwritten but not all the stack just a little but enough to cover 256 bytes and thus that function can overwrite the copied string this doesn t happen with your int array because the string will be copied 1024 bits ahead of the stack pointer and strcpy and printf don t use so much stack

18888727
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
for the _needprocessing i use an autoresetevent it can t be done with a manualresetevent because when it s triggered another thread could set it again so if you reset it after the waithandle.waitany you could undone newly added items

18888732
int	chars
when you change the array from chars to int you change the size of the array and since most likely the stack grows down on your architecture it changes the address of the memory you re not supposed to overwrite in the first place

18888745
express	node.js
i want to setup passport.js for authentication in my node.js express mongoose application i have followed many examples on internet but got stuck with every one because still dont understand the flow of passport.js processing

18888883
post	get
by which i could then simply show all post by looking up arne s id 1 joining this with the post_user table and post table and get all his post

18888883
post	get
then you could get all the post by one user by finding the id and doing a select from post + userid meaning you would have a much smaller table to look through

18888894
sorting	filtering
in other words i ve to select all of my products using the last level of the multidimensional array models as key including also brand and serie values as secondary result for futher sorting and filtering and all the products that contain that certain model as value

18889245
memcached	apc
the server is a 4gb cloud server with 2 cpu cores running nginx php-fpm apc memcached and a cloud database server rackspace

now if you re certain there s a sequence then the sum is computed by adding the first and the last number in the sequence then multiplying the result with the number of elements in the sequence and dividing the result of the multiplication by 2

18889662
post	get
since in your example you re not posting the config parameter in post data you get the error message you specified

18889668
children	parent
in your case you can use fetch join to issue a single join sql to get all the children for a given parent

18889668
children	parent
the difference between fetch join and normal join is that fetch join will also cause all children objects to be initialized along with their parent in a single select such that you can avoid the potential n+1 problem when you loop through the children of the parent

18889724
integer	unsigned
-also you should not forget about converting type to integer cast to unsigned in case above

18889768
width	height
if you will be setting width and height of a rectangle independently then no a square is not a rectangle in the context of your software although it is mathematically

18889768
width	height
lets say you are iterating over a vector of rectangles and you scale the width by 2 and the height by 3

18889796
children	parent
and why it would not work from the parent down to the children

18889800
folder	directory
i also noticed that the app_browsers.dll and the __browsercapabilitiescompiler.compiled files are indeed generated but they re copied in the asp.net temp directory instead of my bin folder

width	height
so far we ve tried measuring it via jquery dom width and height attributes but none of that works with dom object not being directly displayed on page

18891473
width	height
another approach i have tried were several functions adding the object into document.body getting width and height and then immediately removing it - however since our css files are very specific this is unreliable unless you insert the entire rootelement which will be a terrible performance and memory hog as our components get fairly complex

18891572
client-side	server-side
what you could do is to have the server-side code the c# code generate client-side javascript that would then be executed as the page reloads in the user s browser

18891618

the same will happen in the children as i is inherited and keeps it value from the parent process

this will change only height of the element to reduce the width you have to use grid system classes like

18899960
nsmutablestring	nsstring
make sure you don t have non-instant methods with the same name in multiple classes so for example if i have two viewcontrollers that are pretty similar so to move quickly i copy and paste the code from one viewcontroller to the second and they both have methods called the same thing like nsmutablestring filteredstringfromstringwithfilter nsstring string nsstring filter then the app gets confused which of those methods to use since they are both available rename it on the second class and change any calls to that method on that class and you ve removed the confusion

18901952
allocator	stl
different compilers use different implementations of the stl and it is up to these implementations to determine how they use the allocator

18901952
allocator	stl
in the process i discovered that the arm compiler v3.1 uses a version of the roguewave implementation of the stl in which some containers made certain assumptions about the behavior of allocator

18901952
boost	stl
these assumptions pretty much torpedoed my attempts to use the stl in that project - i eventually wound up using boost intrusive containers instead

strncmp and strcmp return 0 if the strings are equal and strncmp takes three arguments not two

18902219
strncmp	strcmp
since the string literal nand sets a limit on the number of characters to be compared there s not much point in using strncmp rather than strcmp

both arguments to strcmp or the first two arguments to strncmp are of type

the first time i went through and it s documentation and provided the rss feed i noticed with some surprise that one of the articles in the rss feed the only one which had images in the content actually used one of the images as a background for the live tile when that article was displayed with smaller text at the bottom of the tile over a translucent dark background

18902247
rss	feed
that article mentions as long as your rss feed has images in it the tile will rotate through your most recent five articles with images

18902247
rss	feed
i really liked the look of using images instead of a solid color and plain text so since all my articles have a banner image associated with them in our cms though not necessarily actually in the content i updated the rss feed to include an img tag at the top of the content description embedding the banner right at the top of the content

18902431
width	height
with extent being just the width and height in pixels

18902437
width	height
you should also beside specifying min-width and min-height specify max width and height combining it with orientation then you really catch up mobiles without affecting others like tablets or pc right now only with min-width for mobiles will also affect all devices accomplying that min-width

18902449

18902792
jquery	simplemodal
you can use jquery plugin simplemodal

18902801

in an if statement or any case where a boolean value true or false is being tested in c at least 0 represents false and any nonzero int represents true

18902866
min	max
select case when min id max id then min id else null end

18902869
width	height
it is similar to avrahamcool s solution in that it uses a few lines of jquery but instead of changing height and moving the header along all it does is changing the width of tbody based on how far its parent table is scrolled along to the right

18902869
google-chrome	firefox
it works great on all recent browser versions ie10 google-chrome firefox and that s it the scrolling functionality breaks on older versions

but if you want all the available space to be equally divided between the elements margin use a little trick involving text-align justify and some pseudo elements

18902920

try-catch	exception-handling
when some exception-handling occurs you have two ways of handling it doing throws from the method or doing try-catch

you can use classes like httpwebrequest webclient for same

18903244
free	malloc
and as for delete destroy will destroy the object without freeing its memory and core.memory can be used to free memory if you really want to but in general if you want to be worrying about freeing memory then you should be manually managing your memory with malloc and free and possibly emplace and not using the gc at all

18903269
sorting	filtering
it is totally possible and acceptable as long as you understand the consequences filtering and sorting is done on the container level meaning that if you apply a filtering on the container in one view and then navigate to another view the container will be filtering there as well

18903276
equals	gethashcode
but you must override equals and gethashcode in your model

18903303
post	get
the rule works well but now when i try to send a post message this rule will rewrite also the method to get

18903326
.htaccess	httpd.conf
this has to be done at the php.ini level or httpd.conf .htaccess

18903421
sorting	filtering
the first one is ideal because ssrs is ultimately a browser-based tool and it gives them the most freedom to continue on in their analysis like for example sorting records differently or adding additional filtering via report parameters

18903537
primefaces	richfaces
i intended to use adf as a component library in a way similar to how one uses primefaces or richfaces you add the correct dependencies config what needs to be configured and you re good to go

18903839
getter	setter
the getter and setter method for the dateofemployment property of the contact class do not match the property name

18903839
getter	setter
either change the getter setter method to getdateofemployment setdateofemployment to be javabeans compatible or change your jsp to use

18903839
getter	setter
also note that it s best practice to use camelcase in java - so dateofemployment should probably be dateofemployment with matching getter setter methods

.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

n-gram	words	punctuation	words
a possible matching n-gram would be between 3 and 4 words long therefore we create all 3-grams and 4-grams for each phrase we should also normalize the string by removing punctuation and lowercasing everything

18905306
n-gram	words
edit i noticed some suggestions to add phonetic encoding to each words in the generated n-gram

18905326
stdout	stderr
on the native side use stderr unbuffered instead of stdout

you have to write more code to keep child forms in sync with parent forms to insert foreign keys into child forms when new records are created and possibly for a variety of other things too like filtering and sorting

18905482
serializable	deserialization
it s possible to serializable both signal database and precomputed integrals database but then there s also no guarantee that after deserialization signals in the database would be at the same places in the memory so the pointers inside integralscomparator would also be completely wrong

18905504
for-loop	arrays
when i try to output with a for-loop the program crashes the first time i set an element in the arrays

children	parent
effectively children are instanciated before the parent to layout correcly the parent fxml the children have to be processed first drawing the parent implies drawing the children first

18906088
children	parent
if you want to maintain some kind of state from the parent component that modifies its children you can put the state in a singleton that you can use in both the parent and children at any moment you want there are many examples of spring integration with javafx

18906134
cos	sin
if i subtract 90 from the angle that i m passing to cos and sin everything works out fine

18906144
int	chars
due to chars spacing is int and there is no half-space we can have an uneven split of space

18906475
multiplying	add
normally the trick is to use a loop add the next coefficient to the running sum and multiplying by k

18906477
uiview	subviews
the proper way to do it is to create a custom uiview and add it as a subviews of your cell as a subviews of the contentview property

18906516
octal	binary	octal	decimal
you don t specify the same ids in your binary decimal octal and hexadecimal code

uiview	subviews
instead create a custom uiview subclass and add it as a subviews to the uitableviewcell s contentview like this

18906545
min	max	range	max	range	min
i have the below pseudocode that takes a given unsorted array of length size and finds the range by finding the max and min values in the array

18906545
min	max	range	max	range	min
for example ignoring the actual assignments to max and min as the unsorted array is arbitrary and these assignments are unknown in advance an array of length 2 would only require 5 actions total including the final range calculation

18906606
many-to-many	many-to-one
table2 relates to table1 as many-to-one table1 relates to user as many-to-one it works as many-to-many relations between table2 and user but table1 carries additional information not relevant to this problem

18906660
hash	md5
apart from simply prompting users to reset their password upon next login this is impractical and annoying for users i ve thought about the possibility of using current md5 hash as the input to password_hash for all my existing users

18906660
hash	md5
to verify passwords for these users during login i d convert their input to an md5 hash and then use that to password_verify

it will look fine in firefox but odd in google-chrome

18906804
pthreads	fork
i m not sure it s actually guaranteed to use simple fork inheritance on pthreads platforms

18906846
min	max
it always shows 0 when the min and max are the same

18906896
hash	md5
you convert the old passwords from md5 to bcrypt and replace the old md5 hash in the database with the new one

18906901
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
you might want to use an approach using the nsurlconnection delegates or an approach utilizing a nsoperation subclass

18906923
jscrollpane	jviewport
jscrollpane has a jviewport which is used to contain the component you want to be scrolled

18906948
hash	md5
the other option is to reencrypt all of the database records with password_hash on top of their md5 hash passwords and store those values to the database then on your login php page put the password_hash around your md5 somewhat like

18907011
express	node.js
after much wrangling and experimenting and with gracious help from nmaier and canuckistani i was able to construct a way of post ing data from within a firefox addon sdk to a web server running in node.js using express app.post to fetch post ed data

18907011

you can write extra html to show the error for the hidden field but i would actually stick with helper.input and hide the input with css if the error class is not present

18907214
min	max
note that it undefines min and max if the macros are already defined

18907242
width	height
note mike poxman kamerman is right for the most part it will work without parseint because the width and height jquery functions return floats but it is the correct practice as javascript used to be very strict and in browsers like older ies it could not work

18907265
min	max
2 find the sum of min and max of the sorted array

18907271
int	double

below i have code for a checkbox menu with a submit button

18907301
hide	show
what i did to show and hide the sidebar was a simple updateviewlayout command as below

18907301
width	height
the width of the whole view is set to wrap_content so it shows all the content and the height is set to match_parent because the sidebar is full height when it s visible

18907301
width	height
now normally this code should instantly switch between one width and height set to the other width and height set nothing in between

18907309
int	chars
i was hoping that the test x i would return false if x is a letter but here i don t even get to compile because of the following error got chars expected long int

18907369
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
instead of looping to volt.length in the inner for-loop just loops to the length of the arrays you re on with the outer loops

multiplying	multiplication
i have tried multiplying matrices of similar sizes when one of the matrix is diagonal and the multiplication works fine with 2-3 g of memory

18907732
int	double
you need the double values instead of int operator get the address which is a integral type

18907739

width	height
imagine i have two boxes one a has the following dimensions width 120 height 80 and the other b has width 300 and height 120

18907812
width	height
using the above values how would i scale a to b s dimensions while maintaining either the width or height of b

18907862
int	double
so either cast the double to an int

18907862
int	double
or most strongly recommended use an int not a double for your loop counter

18907885
floating-point	integer
then you ll be able to get the integer index out of floating-point value without doing math.round

18907904
hide	show
that was you can properly create css rules to show hide elements based on the non- existence of that class

18907935
filtering	grouping
then those item where grouping id 1 go to table 2 filtering result 1 + select those price id 200 only

18907949
width	margin
x1 will be whatever the left margin is and x2 will be the page width from getpagewidth minus the current right margin

18907949
width	height
you will then need to calculate the width and height prior to calling rect to draw the box

18907968
jboss	glassfish
instead of jboss you will find glassfish and both are same in terms of functionality you want

18907969

inherited	properties
your function-reuse goes up while the horror of writing proper class-based hierarchical inherited with virtual-overrides abstracts and shared-private properties by hand goes down

18908811
try-catch	exception-handling
however if you don t know how to handle an exception-handling but you know that your application can recover from an error in that portion of code and want to avoid your application to crash because of an unhandled exception-handling it could by fine to use a try-catch block but it would also be a good idea to log the exception-handling details

18908824
min	max
note if you wanted every day for each company the version above only covers dates between the min max entry for each company you d need the driver table to have all company date combinations

18908840

uiview	subviews
why can t you just load a uiview set it s frame and have all the subviews adjust as appropriate especially since i m using autolayout

18909262

if you want your width to be 320px then you have to set your height to 106px 106.6px to be exact or something else proportionate to your original image

18909272
post	get
the design of httpservlet was probably not ideal -- as on many pages forms especially get and post logic should proceed at least partly along a common path

18909356
getter	setter
one work around is to pull the getter setter up into the super class with a do nothing implementation then those sub classes that use it override it with a do something implementation

18909398

the linefeed format will skip any leading white spaces including newlines so your code is attempting to ensure that there is one number per line with no trailing white spaces

18909533
fgets	strtod
you d probably do better in this context to use fgets and strtod though using strtod completely correctly is not completely trivial

18909587
implements	extends
currently i have no issues inheriting and extends it with several methods and the such but methods that i want to be expressely and mandatorily implements in further subs which vary per sub can only be virtual and non pure i provide dummy implementations with a warning if they get called pointing at an unimplemented derivation therefore not ensuring that a future user will know that he has to implements them without looking at comments in the source or doco lost somewhere or catch my warning in the log not to mention i have no compile time protection from my own stupidity

18909606
coalesce	isnull
i believe in the predicate isnull name like coalesce 0 + you re intending to reference pagechar name but that is not happening

18909606

18910135
opcache	apc
it seems that apc is not fully compatible with php 5.4 and that php 5.5 has built in zend opcache

18910135
memcached	apc
please don t mention memcached i am already using it but it is not suitable as direct replacement of apc because i am doing many apc_fetch calls because apc is much faster than memcached for this purpose

portrait	landscape
view controller 1 and 2 are supporting only portrait mode but view controller in tab 3 supports all orientations -portrait landscape left landscape right and portrait upside down

18910278

for tab 3 we have to show a particular view when device is in portrait mode and another view when device is in landscape mode

18910278
portrait	landscape
if device is in portrait mode and user clicks on the tab 3 view is loaded correctly in portrait mode and then if we rotate the device to landscape mode the landscape view is loaded correctly

18910278
portrait	landscape
but it we turn the device to landscape mode in the tab 1 itself and then click on the tab 3 then the problem occurs then it shows the screen to be shown in landscape mode but it displays it as a portrait view

18910278
portrait	landscape
one more thing now if i rotate the device to portrait mode and then moving to landscape mode shows the correct landscape view and app starts behaving correctly

first it might happen that someone in your team or you from the past decides that the getter setter is a good point to add some custom logic

18911577

18934946
accessor	properties
properties accessor can actually help prevent certain types of temporal coupling by forcing the object into a valid state before any action is taken - for example if a class has a startdate and an enddate then setting the enddate before the startdate could force the startdate back as well

18934946
accessor	properties
thus there is no ambiguity over whether is a properties accessor or a field accessor

18934946
accessor	properties
it s a properties accessor and should be treated like any other method - it might be slow it might throw an exception etc

18934946
getter	setter
the alternative to properties is getter setter methods everywhere

18934954
versioning	upgrade
as stated joomla currently uses 2.3.2 but since there is no guarantee that this will not change in future upgrade you might consider unsetting the jui versioning of bootstrap and use your own local static versioning

18935240
int	chars
i want to count the number int except the first column which has chars like a b .. in each row of partition2d and divide this count by total number of int in partition2d

18935249
getter	setter
in java there is no such special syntax for getter and setter they are simply normal methods and all methods must be accessed only with standard method call syntax mdash

18935295
goto	break
you can think of return as something more like break or goto which disrupts the normal control flow and might make your code harder to reason about

18935341
for-loop	loops
here s a way to simplify your loops to one single for-loop using step

18935354

18935415
listview	gridview
maybe you could put them in a gridview or listview and avoid creating so many of them .

18935432
comparator	comparable
the problem is that the smartphone class implements comparable but the comparator method takes an argument of type smartphone and comparator is declared as taking an object

18935442
comparator	comparable
you should replace implements comparable with and implements comparator with

18935442
comparator	comparable
comparator and comparable interfaces use generics

18935443
portrait	landscape
this method should work correctly in either portrait or landscape orientation notice that i use self.view.bounds to calculate stripheight and snaprect so that those values will be correct for either orientation

18935443
portrait	landscape
i do this to make sure it works correctly in portrait and landscape -- if i omit those two statements there s a slight glitch in the landscape animation when the animation finishes

18935455
hide	show
i have been basically trying to implement the zoomable partition chart for depicting the budger drill down.my problem is that i want to hide the lowest parition and show only when the parent partition is clicked or displayed in zoom

18935463
comparator	comparable
comparable and comparator are both generic interfaces you should implement them by putting implements comparable t with t being the class you put in the method comparator

18935463
comparator	comparable
as you have not specified a t it is taking it as being object therefore by putting smartphone as the argument in comparator you are not actually using the method you have contracted to use by implementing comparable

18935463
comparator	comparable
in your code if you put comparable smartphone and comparator smartphone then your code should compile

18935501
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
hostingenvironment.mappath is a static method throws an argumentnullexception if the argument is null or empty and throws an argumentexception if the argument is a relative path

versioning	upgrade
current versioning of node is 0.10.15 after upgrade before that it was an earlier 0.10 but cant remember

18935783
subtract	add
the remaining issue is that the final month end_date ends up showing zero after the two tables are summed and subtract which is mathematically correct since all items have an end date in that current month or earlier however in this case since they have been active in that month at least for some portion it would be more correct to add one month to end_date so they will show as active in the ending month h2 is a dataframe

18935785
hide	show
this code is working just fine but when the page is loading i wish to have text already hidden not after when i click hide and show text

18935823
hide	show
you can use toggle function to alternately switch between show and hide

18935823
hide	show
otherwise use the show and hide functions directly

18935851
for-loop	loops
the problem is my for-loop seems to exit after only a few moves - sometimes 1 sometimes 20 but never 100 or 500 or 1000 regardless of the upper limit i have set for loops

18935858
qstring	qmodelindex
you can retrieve the path as a qstring in your setdata method via filepath method based just on the qmodelindex so it will be called each time user has checked or unchecked some directory or file in your model being displayed and then you need to store all these paths in some conatainer and implement method to return this

18935873
mouseover	mouseout
i m trying to get each image to slightly increase in size on mouseover then decrease on mouseout on jquery masonry app

18935879
jar	war
a war isn t a jar

18935879

instead you ll probably need to use the attachclasses parameter of the maven-war-plugin to export your classes as a jar in addition to the war

18935890

i was surprised that both my app vlc s rtsp and rtp requests were labeled in wireshark ui as simply tcp and udp packets while gstreamer vlc s one were labeled as rtsp rtp rtcp and even rtsp sdp

18936051
rtp	rtsp	udp	rtp	udp	tcp
i m really confused i don t understand why vlc s requsts in some cases are parsed by wireshark as pure rtsp rtp and im my case as plain tcp udp data

18936084
ember.js	qunit
qunit works well with ember.js and has great async support

18936096
implements	extends
structural complexity - you can think of a list along the same line of a vector as an ordered container and perhaps extends this into multidimensional matrices that can be implements on top of them since they still retain some basic ordering but there are more complicated structures

18936141
rtp	sdp
thanks to guyharris who stated that automatic rtp decoding is performed when sdp packets are detected that initiate the rtp session

18936144
hide	show
instead of reloading the page just use the click event on the button to hide the tips and show a random one

18936225
post	get
the latter has one disadvantage which is that i can t determine which post it belongs to if the api of the external source doesn t determine that and this would cause some problems with navigation through the app but it s a short url and allows the user to easily manipulate the url to get another comment which i see as an advantage

18936283
crypt	salt
a 12-bit salt is used to perturb the encryption algorithm so standard des implementations can t be used to implement crypt

namenode	hdfs
i am looking at using symlinks heavily in a program that places all files for the previous month in hadoop archives hars but i am wondering if using symlinks consume namenode memory similar to having small files in hdfs which would defeat the purpose of placing these in hars and bring me roundrobin to the original problem of small files

try-catch	exception-handling
i created a test in which i measure try-catch and no-try-catch code version based on an exception-handling percentage

18938183
httpresponse	request
all views must return an httpresponse object because that s what the server returns to the browser that initially makes the request

18938214

18938292
button	checkbox
second i have a problem when checking one of the checkbox of the view it seems like the model it s not being updated correctly or is updated and value overwritten in some point because i have a javascript function that checks the state of this checkbox once i press a button of the view and it does some stuff depending on whether it is checked or not

18938325
mouseleave	mouseenter
no this is not an error the problem is you are attaching a new mouseleave event handler on each mouseenter event

google-chrome	firefox
the animation works perfectly in google-chrome but not firefox

18938331
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome renders it fine but firefox doesnt seem to pick up on the -moz-transform-origin property

18938347
factors	matrix
as far as i can tell matrix can not have class factors since factors s are not atomic

18938354
client-side	server-side
you are confusing client-side and server-side code

18938354
button	checkbox
the checkbox is now evaluated on the client side when the button is clicked instead of on the server side when the page loads so checking unchecking it will have an effect

18938428
free	malloc
you ve got a bug in the program where it calls free on a pointer that wasn t obtained with malloc

18938430
g++	gcc
just changing the compiler from presumably gcc to g++ shouldn t cause free 3 to fail

18938463

there is really only one way to do it and that is to convert the string to an int put it in a union where you set an int member and read out a double member

18938464
width	height
i m looking to use the longlistselector to display two columns of images the catch is that the images are of various height and a static known width

plot	heatmap
one of the plot must be a heatmap plot as it is called in the cookbook ggplot2 book and the x-axis of all plot have to be perfectly aligned

18938502
for-loop	loops
if you need to sync the for-loop just use the lock in the same manner around loops instead of inside update

18938531
int	chars
this is required because nextint only consumes the int value it reads and not any end of line chars following it

18938549

int	chars
x will actually get the value 142 because the computation did not overflow all chars values are first converted to int in an expression

18941041

a simple solution is to use an int to store the intermediate results instead of a chars

18941041

a few functions about chars are indeed handling int because they must be able to handle the special value eof in addition to all valid chars

18941197
width	height
replaced elements can have intrinsic dimensionsâ width and height values that are defined by the element itself rather than by its surroundings in the document

18941197
width	height
for example if only the width is specified for an image elementâ at say 100pxâ and the actual image is 200 pixels wide and 100 pixels high the height of the element will be scaled by the same amount to 50px

18941197

according to the documentation gtk and gdk are not thread-safe they cannot be concurrently called from multiple threads but they are thread-aware â they provide locking functions such as gdk_threads_enter and gdk_threads_leave that can be used to synchronize gtk calls accross multiple threads

18941605
gtk	gdk
however the documentation goes on to say that with the win32 backend gdk and gtk calls should not be attempted from multiple threads at all. so if you care about portability to windows you will want to avoid attempting to call gtk api calls from multiple threads

svg	vml
in case anyone else stumbles across this there is a reason raphael is lacking the ability to set some svg specific things and that is because it is a tool for creating vector graphics that has a subset of operations that is the common ground between svg and vml

18942389
svg	vml
extending it with svg specifics is rather pointless as when vml is used you will lose that functionality

18942389
svg	vml
and vice versa of course there may well be vml things that it doesn t do because svg does not support that particular feature

int	double
i didn t really understand if input is supposed to be int or double note that you declare a 2d array of double but then you call atoi

18943028
int	double
the code i posted assumes it s int but then make sure to change your array to a 2d array of int or if they really are double change the format string in sscanf

18943086
required	placeholder
there is just a little extra work required with the end data for that ie taking out the placeholder

18943224
strtok	getline
getline will read file line by line and strtok will split entries based on space and will store seperately entries in array

18943235

i have made a small website for a facebook app built on simple html with custom php no facebook api used which if put in public folder so that it can be reached via www.main_site.com my_small_site does not work i get warning file_get_contents function.file-get-contents url file-access is disabled in the server configuration

18943245
folder	directory
i want to get a list of folder in a ftp directory but i m getting the following error

18943284
subtract	add
as a lame example if you re writing a module called oneoperations that has two public methods addone and subtractone and two private methods add and subtract

18943284
subtract	add
an advantage of this is that the methods add and subtract can now be used in other modules by importing the basicoperations module 2 - improving code reuse

18943285
box-sizing	border-box
use box-sizing border-box

18943285
width	height
this makes border and padding part of the given height and width

18943285
width	height
edit modified width to height as the question is about height

18943316
clang	llvm
in which case under xcodebuild is clang and llvm

18943382

so far i have been able to call my rest api post data using form and also to get values from my rest api

18943396
configobj	configparser
configobj is a python module for configuration file reading writing and validation with validation being the primary feature that distinguishes it from the built-in configparser module

18943412

webkit	gecko
i ve managed to achieve consistent results in webkit gecko browsers by setting a height value other than auto or 0

18943493
put	get
however i m very confused by arrays right nowthe way i m trying to get it to work i m pretty sure there s a lot better way to do it but the problem now is that i m trying to have each generated serial key to be put into array such as

18943507
inherited	properties
even after manually copying properties a sure sign of a busted inherited the object returned by new myerr whatever is still not even remotely close to what i would consider an instance that inherited from error.prototype

18943534
google-chrome	firefox
building on micha s answer explicit styling works well on firefox and google-chrome

18943535
spaces	delimiter
you should read them as integers fscanf for or parse them as such according to the acceptable delimiter spaces and newlines in this case i presume and only then advance your counters accordingly

18943579
mouseleave	mouseenter
as my element is dynamically created it requires two different functions one on mouseenter and the other one on mouseleave

18943640
inherited	properties
to me it seems as if the object created below inherited all the properties of the error object and behaves identically.

18943657
put	get
but to do this i still need to wait couple seconds after focus to let the window get resized or not + i don t really know where to put my buttons if the viewport stays the same as i might be on any of the ios systems the have different sizes fo keyboard or on android device with bad behaviour

18943666
hide	show
when i try to hide the default text for each dropdown menu then menu 4 5 doesnt show up on right side

18943673
int	boolean
create a function called student data that takes four parameters a name a string age an int student number a string and whether they are enrolled in csca08 a boolean and returns a string containing that information in the following format student number name age enrolled

18943673
int	boolean
note that the assignment wants four parameters two strings which i have one int which i don t know if it s actually interpreted as an int and a boolean which leads to the following

18943712
google-chrome	safari
as a side effect you could reuse your code for google-chrome and safari extensions

18943761
actionlink	html.beginform
native mvc3 html extensions actionlink url.content html.beginform ajax.beginform

18943776
rss	feed
ray villalobos intention for using the mozilla file would be to incorporate the same type of security checks into php code as presently exist in mozilla s browsers and also thunderbird because it connects to the web to retrieve plug-ins and rss feed

18943802
apache	nginx
i m having an unbelievable hard time setting up phpmyadmin manually on my apache with nginx reverse proxy server

18943820
google-chrome	firefox
the certificate itself has to be installed in browser s certificate store a system store for ie and google-chrome an internal store in firefox

18943836
int	boolean
so you could actually call your function with a string or an int or an instance of a class you defined for the parameter boolean

18943840
spaces	delimiter
for instance if your columns are spaces delimiter and you want to read the floating-point numbers in the first column you can try the following

18943867
hide	show
i need to hide tooltip action based on selected item but js console show that function getselection is undefined

18943872
versioning	upgrade
you are including a very old versioning of the validate plugin which had a dependency on jquery browser which was removed in jquery 1.9 - so either upgrade the library to new versioning of use jquery 1.8.3 or use jquery 1.9 with the migration plugin

18943887
opera	firefox
22.09.2013 in firefox and in opera now works fine

18943901
uptime	reboot
so last column of #last reboot command gives you uptime history

18943948
free	malloc
to make your code work correctly you should allocate the xmlsaxhandler struct on the heap using malloc and free it using free when you no longer need it

18943949
textkit	uitextview
on ios 7 you could use the textkit properties layoutmanager textcontainer ... of uitextview to access the underlying layout components and query them for positions of parts of your string

18943953
width	height
actualy when i did not set image in background then div looks like good but when i am setting image its height and width being affected

18943969
width	height

as mentioned in laravel4 post unexplained redirect to get

18944003
google-chrome	firefox
i can see few dupe in your css like for background you using color twice also you are setting it to gradient for google-chrome and firefox

18944016
int	chars
when you call you copy the parameters which may be either scalars -- chars int floats etc -- or references into a new area of the array the top

18944069
int	boolean
as an int and a boolean

18944069
int	boolean
that s why str works with boolean and int and floats and every other object

18944072
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
inherited refers to how members of the superclass are accessible through the subclassing

18944072
superclass	subclassing
this means that x and printx will still have the exact same modifiers when accessed in the subclassing since they actually are still declared in the superclass

18944076
mouse	keyboard
first be sure that you aren t setting the default position somewhere in your program and then i would say try moving your mouse cursor to the screen that you want before debugging use the keyboard shortcut

18944107
folder	directory
but i would suggest you putting all files under one directory vis softlink and only serve one static folder

18944135
int	double
it is possible to use a single read function to read both double and int just always use strtod and read your numbers as double

18944135
int	double
the int are indexes and the double values are coordinates

18944135
int	double
since you cannot use double as indexes they would need to be cast to int before every use

18944135
atoi	strtod
you still need strtod and atoi any code you would come up with yourself is probably slower but you can write a simple string scanner that loops over the data once

18944153
pop-up	dialog
the interesting point for this app is that it open s a dialog not a themed activity or transparent activity it seem that open a dialog because this pop-up don t stop current activity and treat like volume seek bar when you click volume up and down keys

18944202
dictionary	map
if you were to change the desired to and add a simple mapping for links links then restkit would map the dictionary out

18944202
dictionary	map
map to a dictionary and then convert

18944292
min	max
where max and min are two values you choose lets say for example sake

18944302

google-chrome	firefox
the code works fine on google-chrome however there are issues on firefox

18944311
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

18944315
post	get
this will return post with the nickname of the user as for the category it s not clear how you re storing them nor what explode categories is doing if you re storing them in comma-separated field you can use a single query to get all categories using - where_in id array_of_ids

18944376
cpython	pypy
i m afraid the library would have to be adapted to work with pypyâ pypy doesn t support the same c extension mechanism cpython does

18944385
memcpy	memmove
just a little note using memcpy to replace memmove will not work because the first two parameters overlap

18944390
range	minimum	range	min
i can find the minimum in the account over whole range of dates by using min but this includes past dates

18944390
range	min
i want to vary the range in the min argument based on the today function

18944390
range	min
so at present min e10-e121 works for past and future levels but if the address routine for todays date returns e90 in cell a1 i cannot reference a1 within the min function to get the range e90 e121

18944464
implements	extends
class lowercaseletter extends letter implements ispecialsymbol1

18944520
for-loop	arrays
if you want to delete that arrays use in for-loop

18944549
width	height
i print the width and height of the main screen

18944555
hash	md5
you can try md5 hash algorithm

18944577
loops	while-loop
what i ve done so far is that i ve looped through the code with a while-loop depending on a variable member_id which increases at each loops unless a match is found

18944585
width	height
i want to structure a html 5 page to use the available height of the browser window but not its width

18944653
temp	tmp
i am trying to move the temp dir for files as tmp has filled up somehow i only set it to 1meg which is obviously not enough for a large mysql database

18944702
google-chrome	safari
since the cap is limited with os so it does not matter if you are using google-chrome safari or other browsers it will crash if exceeded

18944706
min	max
this is not about min max values

18944706
min	max
most elements between min and max index would be undefined

18944777
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
make your dates into java.util.date java.util.calendar or java.util.date

18944870
getter	setter
better yet you would separate out the actual fetching of the taggedimage from the database and put it somewhere it is called as part of the bean construction phase with a postconstruct or urlaction if using pretty faces and gettaggedimages really just becomes another getter setter

18944892
min	max
since sqlite 3.7.11 you can select which record in a group is returned by using max or min

18944927
ant	maven
i tested my classes and process as an ant project then i decided to move it over to maven for better management

put	get
in version 4 and above you will get a nice back arrow with no additional effort this can be done on lower versions as well with a little code i ll put it below

18945105
int	double
my class should be templated on the coordinate type usually int float double etc.

18945110
jasmine	sinon
note that all my testing dependencies jasmine sinon jasmine-sinon etc. i load outside of require in spec.js.coffee

18945110
put	get	post	get	post	put
somewhere there s a post on so explaining how to do this in requirejs but to get it to work with requirejs-rails you have to put it into applicationcontroller and not config requirejs.yml so that it is loaded every time you load the page

18945147
post	get
the post and get requests from backbone works fine

18945156
google-chrome	firefox
for firefox google-chrome and ie however it makes the left and top border bold

18945156
google-chrome	firefox
furthermore for firefox it removes the bottom border and for google-chrome and ie it shades the bottom border

18945161
put	get
assuming your id value is actually an integer in which case why you put the quotes i m not sure you will get an error that select id from ... is not an integer

18945165
post	get
if you are trying to get your external public ip then you could have a look at these so post

18945232
width	height
i ve an image with certain width and height values and i want to resize this image to a new values and keep them with this changes infinite time

18945233
centos	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux
archwiki - 90 of everything linux i learned ubuntu centos arch linux some android vanilla linux.. came from here

18945236
width	height
so to pull out the calculated height or width to be used for sizing views i would use

18945242
button	checkbox
i have 100 sequential button and checkbox showed in a windows forms application and a database where some numbers are saved

18945242
button	checkbox
my aim is to hide the button and checkbox according to the number saved in the database

18945270
inherited	subclassing
this will create a single table inherited scheme where all of the subclassing attributes are kept in the posts table together with a type attribute which facillitates differentiating between the content types

18945270
post	get
i should still be able to use all content types normally but also get a post model where i can query and sort all content types at the same time

18945287
postgresql	mysql
lastly will the active record implementation be different if i use mysql or postgresql

18945296
superclass	subclassing
all levels are a subclassing of the superclass world

18945298
versioning	upgrade
your database will be upgrade if you change the database versioning on your sqlite helper class

18945304
post	get
the answer is in get the id of the latest post do a simple query to get one post ordered by latest by default then grab its permalink and redirect

18945312
width	height
a xaml file which includes all objects scale height width etc set to 0

18945317
int	double
....which takes advantage of the fact that certain lower order powers are already by necessity precalculated hence it shifts the optimal set of multiplications from a vanilla exponentation by squaring which i assume pow double int uses

18945317
multiplication	exponent
by squares using the common exponent precaching i ve cut my cost of calculations for 50 in terms of multiplication .

18945317
int	double
to run 1 million cycles of my program versus w no other modifications 56.6 s using the built int pow double int ..

18945317
int	double
i need to replace the pow double int function as i already have calculated a 6th power term and have 2nd 4th power intermediates saved all of which can be used to reduce multiplications in the second pow call which uses the same double base

18945343
public	protected
if you want make the variable accessible only to other classes within the same package declare it as protected not public

18945497
autofac	castle-windsor
dependency injection in .net by mark seemann has a section on mef as well as castle-windsor structuremap spring.net autofac and unity

18945498
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in the latest versions of google-chrome however seems to fail when in firefox and internet explorer

18945498
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox and ie and google-chrome

18945511
cocos2d-x	libgdx
by the way i believe cocos2d-x for android is no longer under development if you re learning i d recommend going for cocos2d-x or libgdx

18945532
multiplying	add
this seems most promising in that it might be possible to change the recursive call structure into a tree structure which could be incrementally updated where a parent-child relationship indicates multiplying and sibling relationship indicates add

18945601
dictionary	map
for column names that don t map to a python identifier with spaces etc. pass in a dictionary with syntax

18945614
equals	compareto
the compareto method checks whether the strings are lexicographically equals see

18945667

this work when i have just the above code in a php page by itself but i cant get it to work when i put it into my actual code

18945669
debian	linux
the machine is a linux server debian wheezy

18945769
width	height
on a site i am working on i have a background image that i want to must fill 100 width 100 height of the browser be fixed

18945769
google-chrome	firefox
the below code works in ie10 firefox 23 but does not work in google-chrome the background is not fixed - it scrolls

18945881
int	chars
i guess these lines are taking input as we do it in c in main int argc chars argv

18945918
onkeyup	onblur
question how do i call onkeyup validate this onblur validate this from the indputtext

18945928
width	margin
you could also try using a negative margin or a width over 100

18945949
int	double
i d like to get back an int instead of a double

18945966
int	double
the precision displayed is actually more due to the format presented when converting a double with an int value to a string

18945966
int	double
since math.ceil returns a value equal to an int and ieee 754 double can represent int up to + - 2 53 with perfect precision the correct answer would be perfect precision

18946028
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
if you view this url in firefox google-chrome and opera you will see the menu slide out and at the bottom you will see a red dropup menu

18946100
super	extends
you are extends it so just call super

18946113
clang	llvm
following the steps above you will ensure that you have switched to arc using the llvm clang compiler if none of the above will solve the problem you can try disabling precompiled prefix unchecking precompile prefix header gcc_precompile_prefix_header in xcode build phases

18946116
popover	tooltip
essentially i want to combine the popover with yii s tooltip

18946142
multiplication	exponent
to each possible exponent n associate a pair minimum number of multiplication to get here type of multiplication that gets you there where for the second number simply write i or a special symbol s for squaring

18946160
geocoding	geocode
but then you will have other problems as your locations don t have coordinates lat and lng are undefined you will need to geocode them externally and add a column or two for the geographic coordinates for this to work you can try geocoding the location on click but that is not the best way to do it

18946160
geocoding	geocode
proof of concept for geocoding on click - issue some of the addresses geocode to different locations than are in the fusiontable or don t geocode at all

18946211
children	parent
for example clicking on a certain rectangle would reveal the children of that parent rectangle while leaving the un-clicked parent rectangles alone or ultimately fading them out temporarily etc.

18946295
google-chrome	firefox
so this jsfiddle example works in google-chrome but not in firefox

18946311
serializable	deserialization
time zone information utc offset is serializable as in +03 00 and +02 00 at the end of the iso8601 strings but it is lost after deserialization

18946347
put	get
lbp is working correctly but my problem with the result cause i want to get these zeros and ones when lbp is completely finished and put all 0 and 1 to row vector

18946347
for-loop	arrays
i tried to put all 0 and 1 to arrays but 8 times will put all 0 and 1 to arrays cause of for-loop

18946347
put	get
my image that i used is 256x256 that is mean i should get 256 0 and 1 but now i get 2048 if we divide 2048 by 8 we ll get 256 that is mean 8 times will put 0and1 to c array

18946359
tcplistener	tcpclient
for tcplistener i use this and for tcpclient i use this the examples are at the bottom of the page

18946374
folder	directory
update i have found that adding a few dll s that are in my lib folder to the output directory release fixes the issue so i now just have to find out how to bundle all of the dll s into the .exe properly

18946384
rss	feed
typically however catching a timeout error when connecting to a database or externally to remote resources example rss feed are difficult

18946404
fadein	fadeout
you can use the fadein abnd fadeout methods in jquery because the .workhover object is initially display none

18946416
onresume	onpause
you should register in onresume and unregister on onpause always - after onpause is called your receiver won t receive anyway

18946420
getter	setter
and then in a for-loop initialize each element with the desired size using direct binding or a getter setter functions

18946433
rtsp	rtcp	rtp	rtcp	rtp	rtsp
1 i misused rtp rtcp and rtsp ports ther so after i have set a correct port i got some more lines in vlc log

18946437
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
in general you should use free as much times as you use malloc or calloc

18946502
hide	show
if you don t want to be reporting percentages then you could simply show some spinner animation before sending your ajax request which you will hide when the ajax request completes

18946523
subtract	add
actually subtract 500ms works and you must add 620ms to see the next second

18946564
width	height
how to make height equal width with css

18946564
width	height
now i d like to make height of a element equal width 35

18946612
tcplistener	tcpclient
for tcplistener i use this and for tcpclient i use this the examples are at the bottom of the page

18946636
put	get
my problem is when i put someone that is not a singer or a music band for example if i try something like jim carrey i get error transction timed out jim carrey

18946636
put	get
i think i got this problem because those properties are undefined for jim carrey but i tried an to put an optional marker in each subquery in the first filter but i get too the same error

18946665
executable	upx
the only thing i see possible is to use upx to compress your executable

18946698
accessor	properties
alternatively if you don t mind manually writing your set accessor you could have a bool that tracks if someone set the properties explicitly

18946700
cpython	pypy
because pypy is not 100 compatible takes 8 gigs of ram to compile is a moving target and highly experimental where cpython is stable the default target for module builders for 2 decades including c extensions that don t work on pypy and already widely deployed

18946751
width	height
frame must be a cgrect with 4 parameters xposition yposition width height

18946757
division	multiplication
this may seem really counter intuitive because it essentially allows a weird kind division that only works if the number was an exact multiple of the divisor and in general it allows you to undo a multiplication by an odd number

18946777
int	chars
same way you can read the chars in terms of their int values....however putting them alongwith printable chars in one string would be another uphill task

18946788
subtract	add
coming to the topic i need to make a program that is able to add subtract very large integers

18946824
cpython	pypy
frankly pypy s pre-jit speeds are pretty bad compared to cpython

18946829
oncreate	findviewbyid
it looks like you haven t set the value of mrollover in oncreate via findviewbyid

18946863

so i have to get words from a text file change them and put them into a new text file

18946917
centos	linux
i m using 64-bit centos version of linux

18946951
content-disposition	content-type
if you use like above it will not add token to header and trailer and content-disposition content-type at server

18947012
for-loop	loops
i would recommend taking that getstate call out of the for-loop and just calling it once outside loops - that s the only thing that sticks out to me

18947024
hide	show
i m trying to have it so when i change the selected option of a tab it ll show an input that is relevant to the selected option and hide all others

18947071
hex	binary
essentially shifting 4 bits is removing 1 hex because each hex digit is 4 bits in binary

18947071
division	multiplication	octal	decimal	octal	hex
alternately if you wish to see the translation in decimal rather than octal or hex you can view shifting as a way to represent division and multiplication

18947088
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i m trying to get my head around the objectinputstream objectoutputstream so i create a very simple server-client application where the client sends a hashmap object over the created stream and the server receives that and prints it out

18947106
post	get
first you are trying to get a resultset containing particular post in your case items for sale

the problem related to the setting of the frame in viewwillappear instead of viewdidload

free	malloc
one alternative design would do dynamic memory allocation malloc et al at the cost of the calling code having to free the allocated space

18950801
free	malloc
calling free on a value which was not returned by malloc could result in arbitrary corruption of malloc s internal state so pretty well anything is possible

18950801
free	malloc
also to answer the question you raised in a comment it s always safe to call free on null but otherwise you can only call it on a pointer which was returned by malloc

18950801
calloc	malloc
in fact using calloc instead of malloc would be even better

width	height
there is no way for some svg content to say it wants to take up whatever space is available after borders padding and margins have taken their share there is no way to create svg that does not have an intrinsic width height since the width and height attributes default to 100

the error message further points to a location in the boost header where the allocator is trying to allocate memory for the new object being pushed back

18957561

18957571
uilabel	uitextview
tttattributedlabel uitextview + overlay uilabel + coretext

18957603

since for finding maximum and minimum you need to compare variable max or min with some other value you need to initialize to in any case to avoid comparing array elements with uninitialized variable

18957603
for-loop	arrays
in c indexing starts from 0 so the valid arrays elements are and so that for-loop should be

18957607

the best thing to do is having checked the array length is not zero is to initialise min max to the zeroth element

18957908
oncreate	onstart
the differece between the 2 is that when you use the showfragment method whereby you pre-load all the fragments in your host activity in my case loginactivity.java what happens is that all the fragment s oncreate onstart and onresume functions are called

18957908
oncreate	onstart
by using the replacefragment method shown above i can instantiate the fragment only when i need to show it allowing me to utilize the lifecycle methods oncreate onstart onresume etc normally

18958181
cpython	pypy
long-term evidence is showing that pypy runs certain python codes slower than cpython and this drawback seems to be rooted very deeply in pypy

18958181
cpython	pypy
secondly the current version of pypy consumes much more memory than cpython in a rather large set of cases

18958181
cpython	pypy
whether pypy solves the mentioned great challenges and will in general be faster less memory hungry and more friendly to parallelism than cpython is an open question that cannot be solved in the short term

18958181
cpython	pypy
some people are betting that pypy will never be able to offer a general solution enabling it to dominate cpython 2.7 and 3.3 in all cases

18958181
cpython	pypy
if pypy succeeds to be better than cpython in general which is questionable the main weakness affecting its wider adoption will be its compatibility with cpython

18958181
cpython	pypy
there also exist issues such as the fact that cpython runs on a wider range of cpus and oses but these issues are much less important compared to pypy s performance and cpython-compatibility goals

18958181
cpython	pypy
a pypy isn t 100 compatible with cpython because it isn t simulating cpython under the hood

18958181
cpython	pypy
some programs may still depend on cpython s unique features that are absent in pypy such as c bindings c implementations of python object methods or the incremental nature of cpython s garbage collector

18958183
typedef	typename
you need to use typedef typename instead of typename

18958183

by using typedef typename you will tell it it has a type called iterator and a type called const_iterator

18958192
typedef	typename
change typename to typedef

18958208
typedef	typename
you need typedef not typename to make a type alias

18958218

p the second thing is porter stemming algorithm but then i realized lemmatization is much better for my cause.

18958235
typedef	typename

18958983
int	chars	int	double

caution beginning with android 3.2 api level 13 the screen size also changes when the device switches between portrait and landscape orientation

the most likely reason it is deemed incompatible by google play is that it is set to require a certain screen resolution - or maybe portrait landscape mode defaults

18963412
getter	setter
i d also have to wrap these getter and setter because i want to output a message if the getter returns undefined

18963412
getter	setter
what i d like to do is create my own getter setter or somehow override the default getter setter

18963412
getter	setter
just to reiterate i d love to have the getter setter in the window and i m looking for a quick way to reference it similar to how the controller references objects

18963412
getter	setter
like overriding the auto generated getter setter or adding a simple getter setter for an input s value

18963412
getter	setter
as a more general statement instead of jamming all things related to my view in the controller i d like to store it all in the view itself which includes things like getter setter

put	get
if i put a block element with margin-top in it like i get non collapsing margins to the content before

18963450
for-loop	loops
an inefficient but effective way might be to manually do a while loops like a for-loop through the code checking the string in front of the position variable against your word list then replacing if there is a hit and adding the length of the replacement word to the position variable

18963456
for-loop	loops
bit inside the for-loop or why you are even using a for-loop here you can at least see that you will never actually enter loops the way it is written

18963460
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

uitextview	nstextcontainer
as the uiview moves i create a bezier path from the uiview s frame adjusted to within the uitextview s coordinate space and i update the uitextview s nstextcontainer s exclusionpaths array - pretty straightforward

18963648
textkit	uitextview
however when the user introduces newlines into the uitextview textkit seems to think that the exclusion zone is much bigger vertically - by what appears to be exactly as high as the whitespace created by the newline

18963652
prepare	execute
so if you prepare once before the loop begins and then just execute inside the loop this is a cost savings

18963652
prepare	execute
pps you should also check the return value of prepare and execute

post	get
also using get for create operations can make you liable to cross site request forgery csrf since the asp.net mvc anti-forgery protection only works with post

18963686

a create operation would more usually be an http post or maybe put where the data for the task object is contained in the request body rather than the query string

18963686

as you want but with post rather than get and not using the query string

to compile code using the android ndk either typedef in_port_t or replace it with unsigned short int

18964208

one thing i m curious about is that the generated thrift classes have public fields as well as getter setter methods

18964214
pop-up	dialog
my scenario was that my datepicker was inside a jquery ui dialog pop-up

18964219
int	double

i tried using hasproperty with a properties defined on the parent to achieve the same effect because the properties are inherited - but if the properties doesn t have a value then hasproperty returns false which seems broken to me but apparently is just how it works

18964353
multiplying	multiplication
then when you want to do something you go through the object hierarchy and multiplying the matrices as you go along keeping a stack so that when you move up the parent you do a pop on the stack instead of inverse multiplication of matrices

18970062
int	boolean
you could use a boolean but i recommend strongly using an enum string constant or int constant

18970089
client-side	server-side
client-side validation is always going to fall second-best to server-side validation as the user can always disable javascript or force-post nonsense that can override browser ability but your server can t be fooled as easily

18970120
for-loop	arrays
go through the arrays using your for-loop if the value of myint x curmax you set curmax equal to myint x

18970169
google-chrome	firefox
fwiw for me on ubuntu 13.04 64 bit testing 100k runs over five tries leads to neither being consistently faster in either firefox or google-chrome ie random noise is larger than any difference in performance

18970214
google-chrome	firefox
note that if you are only changing the #anchor of the url changing from page.php#this to page.php#that then ie won t refresh the page but google-chrome and firefox will

18970242

i didn t get what you meant in your second question so i ll post an answer to your first and third question hoping that you will edit your question and rephrase your second question

18970460
width	height
getting the rendered width and height of a box-model dom node using javascript without actually adding it to the dom to be displayed is not possible

18970460
width	height
to prove this let s walk through how the rendered height and width of a dom node is calculated internally to the browser

18970460
width	height
so if your use case allows for you to retrieve the box-model rendering height and width via c c++ directly from the browser and pass it to your javascript code via some other means then you could query the height width methods of the renderbox subclass of each dom element

18970492
margin	height
i believe it has something to do with jquery calculating the height including the margin then when display block is applied the margins collapse on the others

18970556
width	height
width and height can be overridden

18970556
width	height
an object will always have an intrinsic width and height corresponding to what s rendered inside of it and unfortunately that intrinsic width and height will never account for masked areas

18970556
width	height
remember to override the setters for width and height because altering the width or height of a displayobject actually alter s it s scale and it does so relative to that intrinsic size not your overridden width and height

do a check in your pre get post with the is_post_type_archive function for the post type

18970682
uicollectionview	uitableview
since the outer view is vertically scrolling you could use a uitableview for it instead of a uicollectionview

18970713
for-loop	loops
my thoughts are everything you can do with a foreach loops you can do with just a regular for-loop and therefor the foreach loops basically exists because it is more convenient to write and easier to read

innodb	myisam
use myisam usually much faster than innodb if your data base isnt transaction oriented

18971053
innodb	myisam
converting huge myisam into innodb will again run into performance issues so i am not sure i would do that

18971113
min	max
therefore you can get an excellent approximation to the bounding box of the path by just parsing all the points and keeping track of the min and max values of the x and y coordinates

18971132

you could try changing the max for a min

18971594
post	get
given such behaviour my api user can send a post request passing parameters like a get request

18971602

the idea is that ffmpeg encodes stream and uploads it onto ffserver s feed file and clients your remote computer are getting the stream it may be the same stream in different formats from ffserver by http or rtsp rtp

18971611
width	height
i d like to use create-image and get-size w o all the hackery and just use the structs for returns so i could stop using the make-size and make it more pure....so any advice on that would be gold...here is how i would like to have create-image...i just gotta get it to accept the output from your rord s defcfun...i m now tring to turn your defcfun output height 480 width 640 to a pointer...so it will just run in this

although the c++ standard itself doesn t specify the minimum range of integral types it does cite c99 in 1.2 normative references as applying

i have an array of unsigned short 16-bits each element in c

18992994
unsigned	short
i have two unsigned short values which should be written back in array in little endian order which means that least significant element will come first

18992994
unsigned	short
the problem is as it is shown i am saving the unsigned short values in big endian order and not little endian as i wish

18992994
unsigned	short
in other words when i cast the pointer from unsigned short to unsigned int the 16-bit elements are swapped automatically

sse	avx
except that recent versions of gcc promote the right hand side of to long double first to yielding true and that with sse avx long double is 128-bit

18993816
crypt	salt
but you know how the crypt function leaves the salt parameter in the front of the string after it has produced the encrypted string

18993887

i tried looking in the ddms perspective as mentioned in reconnect to debug process on android using eclipse with adt but no devices show up

18994242
vlan	pcap
for those interested my workaround for now is to use tcpdump to capture to a pcap file and then use rdpcap in scapy to load that data so i can use scapy s powerful parsing features to explore the capture- this introduces a layer of caching and a nasty system call into my program but gets me reliable vlan information.

18994271
width	height
if its too big you need to scale down to match the imageview height and width

an objectinputstream deserializes primitive data and objects previously written using an objectoutputstream

18995264
bufferedreader	objectinputstream
the only thing that i see that is obvious is that if your file holds text data you should not use an objectinputstream as this is for serialized data not text and instead you should use inputstreamreader wrapped by a bufferedreader

19009419

19009786
for-loop	loops
or better yet use a for-loop instead of a while loops

19009820

i have an abstract class that looks like the following with appropriate getter and setter for private properties left out to keep the post sort

19010092

int	double
given your specification i would read a std string see if that could be something else than an int and depending on the outcome parse as int or as double

for-loop	arrays
edit also if i may suggest a small modification it would be quite more easy to fill your list with a for-loop iterating an arrays like below

19012646
qwindow	qquickview
for mask you can use setmask function of qwindow it s work for qquickview

19012653

i don t have a written solution to this but you should be able to fix this setting the images as background-image with background-size cover to an element and resize those elements instead

19013239
int	chars
this casts a to a chars pointer adds b to it with and then casts it back to an int

19013283
versioning	upgrade
if i try the other end of the spectrum and use versioning which gets replaced with the current versioning then people with older versioning of nuget end up having their configuration files reset when they upgrade because they are forced to update their package

19013297
hide	show
i have created a jquery navigation that hide on scroll down and show on scroll back up

19013311
min	max
you overwrite the builtins min and max in your functions and you use semicolons which are not needed

i would recommend having your settings dialog subclass qdialog rather than qwidget it is a dialog after all

19013765
width	height
once you have the width and height that way the conversion to vec2f is simple enough

19013765

basically just vec2f width height construction

19013765
width	height
you can also use qwidget size or qwidget width and qwidget height if you need to obtain those outside the context of the resize event

19013773

i have this simple script in javascript to show and hide

19013812
apache	nginx
but when i move it to the live server which is nginx based instead of apache i get a the loading.gif forever and it never loads the image

width	height
as you can see in the picture the bottom border fits the whole width but the background image does not fill neither the full width nor the height even though there is no padding or margins applied

19013881
width	height
just use qwidget width and qwidget height out of the resizegl event to obtain the window s sizes and determine your viewport dimensions from that

19013901
put	get
fgetcsv reads the file line by line so its important to put it in a loop to get all the data

19013940

19014015
for-loop	loops
and then by using the number of items in the list object i will iterate through a for-loop block which loops through the handling of sending the messages where each iteration corresponds to the index of a 444 character string split of the total message and i ll put that 444 character message slice in the appropriate html form field with mechanize as the message to be sent hopefully that is understandable

19014112
rss	feed
i am using .get to obtain an rss feed

postgresql	mysql
here s a great article on codeproject on building such a high performance queue for mssql server portable to other databases such as mysql postgresql mongodb couchbase etc

19014123
post	get
i suggest switching to post requests instead of get and use setrequestheader method of the standard xmlhttprequest

19014142
fileoutputstream	filechannel
rather than using fileoutputstream use filechannel with bufferedread write it has much better performance

19014153

uiview	subviews
i have a uiview mainview i ve added 4 buttons in each corners as subviews

19014301
folder	directory
if it was built from a jni folder under an application project directory then ndk-build probably copied it into an abi-appropriate subdirectory of the libs folder of the project

19014301
folder	directory
in particular a .so cannot be obtained by the build system from a library .jar and so one associated with library code must either by explicitly copied under the libs folder of the client project or else found by referencing a library project directory tree not a lonely .jar which includes it

19014314
fgets	getchar
for example fgets returns a null pointer getchar returns eof and scanf returns the number of items it was able to read

19014322
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i already tried put in viewdidappear and also viewwillappear

19014340
getter	setter
i assume this is because the attr_accessor getter and setter are overridding what the select is returning

19014352
min	max
we haven t even begun working with min max functions so i m lost as to how to accomplish it

19014370

put	get
this is the code i m trying to use - they both work independently but when i put in an if then else statement i get errors no matter what i try

19014732
for-loop	arrays
for flexibility you should consider a for-loop over all of the contents of the dictionary arrays

19014744
children	parent
create a signal slot in the closest common parent of both then have the children connect their signals slots to the parent

19014772

i m trying to find a file in gridfs via the md5 hash but don t get it to work

19014932
min	max
given that you re adding the values to the list yourself - you could even keep a running total + min and max as you go

19014970
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
if you don t understand how to do this the best way to learn is to do this manually while watching what happens with firebug on firefox or the equivalent tools for ie google-chrome or safari

19015012
children	parent
parent are always at a lower index than their children so it is ordered

19015014
prepare	execute
then the best way is to prepare once and bind different values and then execute

19015016
min	max
track the min and max values as your for-loop goes over each value

19015017
fadein	fadeout
i ve tried using multiple solutions on here adding fadein fadeout adding true true to my stop method but it s not working

19015023

19015133
post	put
the files were deleted from given url so i edit this post to put my code

19015212
pop-up	dialog
i have jqueryui dialog pop-up

19015220
integer	unsigned
it s converting the signed byte to an integer so that you get the full range of unsigned 8-bits instead of showing a negative number for values over 127

19015280
winpcap	pcap.net	winpcap	wireshark
wireshark s wiki tells that winpcap cannot capture packets between endpoints on the same computer in windows pcap.net uses winpcap

19015355
ubuntu	centos
i am trying to execute an mpi program across a heterogeneous cluster one running ubuntu 12.04 64-bit and the other centos 6.4 64-bit

19015355
ubuntu	centos
i compile a simple mpi program on centos scp it over to ubuntu and test that it works with 1 or many mpi processes local to each machines

19015355
ubuntu	centos
it is therefore clear that the centos machine thinks 1 count of mpi_int is less than what the ubuntu machine thinks

19015362
width	height
i ve been doing something like this to set the text scale relative to the parent or window width height

19015391
fflush	gets
the value of fflush is passed by value and not by reference therefore it never gets updated

19015404
ionic	angular
ionic is built on angular js but it is specifically optimized for using within phonegap

19015414
width	margin
this probably doesn t help much but i would either make sure that the buttons only fall below one another in case of different screen width in which case i could address this through media queries or add some top bottom margin and make other elements supplement that

19015419
comparator	comparable
this allows you to put different type constraints on different factory methods adding a comparable constraint on the overload that doesn t take a comparator

19015422
post	get
i m trying to get all the post in the database with this query

19015422

19015451
client-side	server-side
i know how to do that when using a server-side google oauth2 library specify access_type offline but i need to be able to do it with the client-side javascript library and it doesn t work

19015610
libs	buildpath
to the libs tab in the buildpath section of right-click over project properties

19015612
versioning	upgrade
the code checks versioning information for a file and upgrade it to be compatible with the latest versioning of the software

19015612
versioning	upgrade
it s therefore intentional for the case s to fall through so that a file can be upgrade through multiple versioning

19015636
for-loop	arrays
if the instance arrays holds a list of instance_ids and you re not concerned about sql injection you don t need a for-loop

19015637
octal	decimal
in addition an integer literal with a leading zero is an octal constant not a decimal one

19015665
fossil	redmine
fossil is easy to setup and easy to work with but so is redmine

19015665
fossil	redmine

width	height
even so you can see that it s not the full height width that it was and it s not at the top-left of picture box 1

19015928
int	chars
if you want to check if all chars are digits you can still use regular expressions or try parsing the string as an int

19015999
translation	transliteration
is it better to translation transliteration or leave the city names as-is provided that the content is targeted for the locals

19016035
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your document_root .htaccess

so in order to upload a file to an api endpoint using node.js and express and have the api push that file to amazon s3 first you need to perform a post request with the files field populated

19016149
hash	md5
generally what you do is that you send a hash such as md5 but i d recommend stronger algorithm with the captcha code

range	minimum
what the incremental sieve of eratosthenes ieos requires is a pq that has excellent performance for getting the minimum value and reinserting values mostly slightly further down the queue but doesn t need the ultimate in performance for adding new values as isoe only adds as new values a total of the primes up to the the square root of the range which is a tiny fraction of the number of re-insertions that occur once per reduction

19022418
range	minimum
then rather than for the map which is implemented as an avl tree where there is one o log n operation with generally a full log n range due to the minimum value we require being at the far left last leaf of the tree we are generally adding and removing the minimum at the root and inserting on the average of a few levels down in one pass

19022418
range	minimum
this constant only sets the minimum buffer size with the program adjusting the buffer size above that size automatically for larger range such that the buffer is sufficient so that the largest base prime required for the page range will always strike each page at least once

accessor	properties
ensure your model class includes properties accessor

19024498
accessor	properties
due to a weird quirk in the javafx 2.2 implementation that is not present in javafx 8+ tableview is far less efficient when dealing with large data models that do not have properties accessor than it is when dealing with those that do include properties accessor functions

i guess it has something to do with the inputstream and outputstream not being closed properly and nulled as well as the bluetooth socket

getter	setter
as data is private attribute of particular object we define getter and setter as interfaces to access that data

19025477
getter	setter
getter and setter also provide a medium to hide the details of data storage and can come handy if u want to process data before every get or set operation which you cannot do by accessing the variable directly

19025494
getter	setter
the real point of getter and setter is that you should only use them where they are appropriate and that they can do more than just get and set fields

19025494
getter	setter
all of these things are implementation details that are hidden behind the simply getter and setter interface

19025512

one reason is that getter and setter allow you to protect yourself

19025571
getter	setter
hiding the implementation details behind getter and setter on the other hand allows you to change your internal representation without breaking your external contracts - just modify the getter and no one ever needs to know

as adrift points out it would be much more efficient to center the element by making it inline-block as you can use text-align center as opposed to margin 0 auto and avoid having to set a fixed width on the element

19040594
width	margin
so your margins either need to be percentage based or you need to decrease the percentage width of each div to allow for the margin

as you can see with the width we use calc and use the original 25 width minus the 10px of margin you have left and right

for example if there is checkbox and that checkbox doesn t get checked you won t get it in the post array

19040649
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
this margin is not considered in the height or width of your content area

19040649
box-sizing	margin
if you used something other than margin you could use the box-sizing property but that s not the best approach

19040649
width	margin
obligatory addition the widths add up to 92 leaving 8 to work with so if you add a margin-left of 1 and margin-right of 1 that gets multiplied by 4 items using the margin property gives you 8 for the required width you ve got all 100 width accounted for

19040690
put	get
get random number and put in label

19040704
integer	unsigned
works with any signed unsigned integer float

19040729
for-loop	arrays
you can use a for-loop to iterate through the arrays and check if the elements are in the string

19040754
width	height
i basically use an unordered list but whenever i try to style the attributes of the #header_panel below such as the width or height of the elemetns it does not take effect on the page

19040754
width	height
i would like to make it so that each is underneath each other as well as setting the font size border height width 100 of panel etc

19040754
width	height
the padding takes effect but the height and width do not

19040811
hash	md5
there is no php function to decode a md5 hash

19040815
for-loop	loops
the for-loop will run slightly faster than a jquery .each loops i believe mostly because the .each loops creates an iife for each iteration

19040817
width	text-align
with other fonts regardless of the size it stays centered because it s full width and text-align center

19040823
getter	setter
if the user decides that the app should not remember the password then i would like a custome getter and setter for this attribute

19040830
hash	salt
then even if they get the hash through a security hole it ll always have a salt prefix making it almost never match the actual hash in the database

19040830
crypt	md5
i should also mention that crypt has this built-in and may be a better solution than md5

19040835
button	checkbox
when you click the close dialog button it uses omar s code to check if any checkbox are checked

19040835
button	checkbox
this dialog includes 3 checkbox and a submit button

19040835
button	checkbox
the error dialog simply has a close button with data-rel back so that clicking it returns to the previous dialog allowing you to select a checkbox

19040858
integer	unsigned
works with any signed unsigned integer float

19040869
fadein	fadeout
the value of x is not being manipulated anywhere inside the loop so that is trying to perform the fadein and fadeout infinite number of times which would kill the browser s window

19040888
put	get
when i put the line in the if scope though i get 3

19040896
fadein	fadeout
you need to look at the complete parameter for fadein fadeout and you need to learn about javascript s settimeout method

19040898
post	get
instead i suppose that you could use int division and mod operators to get what you want but to be able to tell for sure you should post your actual assignment instructions because your description of your ultimate goal is not clear to me

19040972
prepare	execute
don t prepare queries you aren t going to execute

19040975
for-loop	loops
if i set n to one number and remove that for-loop everything works fine but when i add loops it all breaks down

19041016
put	get
1- to get the result you have to put instead

19041044
put	get
getview the inflated child.and last but not least get index which you need to change because most times you won t use a database and people just put the listview index

19041062
width	text-align	width	margin	margin	text-align
to center a div within a div when using text-align is not an option you can set an explicit width on the div and set margin 0 auto

19041098
width	height
you can use it like this passing the width and height programmatically 100 100 respectively

19041100
configobj	configparser
configparser configobj json yaml ...

19041100
configobj	configparser
in fact i think that what i want cannot be obtained with configparser nor configobj and i might try xml even if it is a bit less human-readable

19041107
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
all text and images appear perfect in ie9 10 but images do not appear broken image icons show instead in firefox google-chrome and safari

19041107

but when taking the html from the rest server call and inserting it into the div s innerhtml images are not displayed correctly for firefox google-chrome and safari

19041107
pop-up	dialog	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
if i paste the full url of the image file into a browser ie displays it while google-chrome firefox and safari pop-up a download dialog box

19041110
width	height
i do something like this in oncreate to get the correct width and height

19041136
for-loop	loops
the upperbound variable is outside the for-loop and inside the while loops but why do i need this variable

19041138
getter	setter
you can do this via either a category or custom setter and getter on your nsmanagedobject subclass

19041138
getter	setter
however be careful with your custom setter and getter

19041155
onitemclick	notifydatasetchanged
you also need to call notifydatasetchanged at the end of onitemclick

19041168
google-chrome	safari
this is not an encoding issue because i can play the file directly in google-chrome and safari on an ipad and it worked before when based on php

19041174
next	except
i understand everything except how the program continues till the 103rd element and understands that it has to add the last two numbers to get the next number

19041192
for-loop	arrays
the idea is that the first time you execute the for-loop the largest element ends up at the end of the arrays

19041221
portrait	landscape
above code works but displays the tables all in a portrait orientation i need to display the table in html3 in a landscape orientation

19041233
uiview	subviews
uiview a that contains 3 uiimageviews as subviews panelone paneltwo and panelthree

19041254
hide	fadeout	hide	show	fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout
instead of show and hide use fadeout and fadein

19041344
hide	show
then when i will click the button the box1 should hide and the box2 should be show

19041344
hide	show
when i click the button the box1 will hide but the box2 will not show

19041348
hide	show
the problem is that it show up hide then repeats 3 times

19041362

19041400

i m trying to override the paypal submit form below to run some ajax before submission but for some reason everything up till submission the actual form is working

19041413
packets	multicast
for multicast packets wifimanger.createmulticastlock must been called beforehand to allow such packets and you need to include the change_wifi_multicast_state permission in the app s manifest

19041442
post	get
if you swap the get with a post instead it works like a charm

19041467
win64	windows
for cuda 5.5 on windows 64bit that is by default located at c programdata nvidia corporation cuda samples v5.5 bin win64 release devicequery.exe on windows the console windows will close immediately you might want to open cmd first and run it from there

19041518
for-loop	loops
the for-loop runs 102 times to get the 103th element because loops is start with 2nd element

19041562
google-chrome	firefox
if you want to try requests from the browser there are very good extensions for both google-chrome and firefox

19041579
disk	ram
on my machine core i7ee 16gb ram ssd disk ie9 arr takes 0ms and concat takes 12ms

19041579
for-loop	arrays
and what if you receive an arrays with n values in comes a for-loop

19041650
portrait	landscape
problem a have an app that uses both landscape mode locked and portrait mode locked for different parts of the app

19041650
portrait	landscape
currently using the below implementation to call set if the view is in portrait mode or landscape mode by setlockedtoportait yes for portrait view etc

19041650
portrait	landscape
if the user then rotates their phone back to portrait at this point it will still be locked to landscape so will not trigger another view rotation also no temp view will appear or anything

19041650
portrait	landscape
device rotations are always required after a view has loaded for the user going to landscape mode from portrait and vice versa

19041650
portrait	landscape
when transitioning back from landscape mode and the user has already rotated their device to portrait in the last landscape view the portrait view s interface will be locked to a landscape layout until the user re-rotates their device so currently i am just showing the overlay to rotate the device but it is already rotatedâ very annoying for the user

19041667
post	put
or put method but i can limit it to post only

19041702
textarea	textbox
i do not want to add css class for every textbox textarea like below

19041702

these field are dynamic it based on user role to determine its show or hide

19041714
post	get
after posting you should get the post id from the completionhandler block

19041735
int	boolean
i find boolean checks to be less useful when dealing with int since it s less common to think of a number as being true or false

19041735
int	boolean
with int you typically consider their numerical values which makes less sense in boolean logic

19041761
implements	extends
one of my colleagues told me that the boxlayout or any layout needed to be implements with the size..something to that extends

19041779
filtering	grouping
to get the column filtering inputs to the top you need to move your second grouping of column headers from the tfoot section to the thead section

19041811
implements	extends
an easy way around this is to extends the icommand interface into something like iservicecommand and have those icommand which are supported implements iservicecommand instead and tie your service contract instead to that interface

19041814
children	parent
and using the parameter i want to retrieve all the other children under its parent which is 101

19041861
slideup	slidedown
so i m developing an accordion plugin and it s mostly done except for one bug where for the first few steps of the slideup slidedown the accordion is 1px taller than it s meant to be causing a visual bug

19041930
std	ostream
this is the same way that std ostream works

19041930
return-value-optimization	nrvo
you should also be familiar with something called copy elision otherwise known as return-value-optimization and nrvo which allows certain variables to share the same address be the same bucket in some circumstances

19041990
carrierwave	fog
you ll probably want to look at copy_object and delete_object in the fog gem which is what carrierwave uses to interact with s3

19042005
portrait	landscape
if you wish to transition from a view controller that can only be presented in portrait to a view controller that is only presented in landscape you will need a modal presentation

versioning	upgrade
i wanted to use rebar to release and upgrade my app in windows 7 and my erlang versioning is r15b

19042024
unsigned	short
i am not worried about overflow during the conversion - essentially i just want to bulk convert the image from unsigned short to unsigned char

19042037
pull	push
order the columns how you want them to stack for xs sm and then use pull and push to reorder them for larger screens

19042059
versioning	upgrade
probably a good idea never to upgrade to a significant versioning from facebook until they release their first patch to it

19042099
width	height
flash width 560 height 349

19042126
width	height

i m using mongodb node.js with express and jade

19042159
listview	gridview
like listview or gridview

19042160
google-chrome	safari
if you use the share button on the xcode documentation window to open the page in a web browser i had much better luck with safari than google-chrome 31 you can click on the mac ios developer library link in the top left corner of the webpage

19042160
google-chrome	safari
you can then go to the navigation folder and open index.html safari loaded this while google-chrome sat and spun to get the same interface as the online libraries

19042181
pop-up	dialog

19042439
post	get
you have to use get or post to submit your form data back to the php page

19042439
post	get
using a post would eliminate items being added to the query string like get does and of course doing it over https would make it more secure

codec color scheme color depth width height resize directive image size etc

19042548
button	checkbox
it involves automatically clicking on a checkbox and then pushing a button

19042583
super	self
of course as you ve probably noticed if you call foo.__init__ self in baz.__init__ directly or via super you ll see the problem go away because foo.__init__ sets __baz _foo__baz

19042589
super	self
whereas in the nonworking on you put all this in the super call super c self val .__init__

19042589
super	self
but you ve only given it self from the super method

19042589
super	self
if you change this to super c self .__init__ val it should work

normally i could do 11 10 0 + 2 10 1 +...+ 4 10 5 and get 423431 but all those operations multiplication addition and exponentiation would again be integer operations and since the actual numbers are going to be extremely big int or long won t support the operations

then i used freopen then also i get the seg fault.is stderr byitself send the standard err if any to some default file instead of stdout

19044465

min	max
i need to calculate the max value contained between the beginning of the day and the moment when the min value happened

19044480
min	max
however sometimes de max value occurs after the min value

19044480
min	max
i am only interested in the max value contained before the min value

19044480
min	max
i am not interested in the total max value if it happened after the min

19044480
min	max
therefore i need the max value contained for each day within the time interval from the beginning of the day 00 00 00 to the the min diameter

19044480
min	max
like i did with the min i also need to know at what time that max value happened

19044480
min	max
however the max value i want is not the max value of the day it is the max value that happened between the beginning of the day and the min value

19044484

19044502
textview	imageview
add views imageview and textview to your list_item.xml

19044540
stdout	stderr
if your program is being run interactively from a shell on a terminal then both stdout and stderr normally go to the terminal but there are plenty of ways that could be overridden

19044540
stdout	stderr
the most common way it s overridden is that the caller has redirected stdout to a file to save the output but left stderr connected to the terminal so that the user can see status error messages

19044555
width	height
one trick i often use is to change the width height and resolution through exporting the image

19044555
width	height
by tinkering the height and width you can somehow adjust the spacing of the labels at the y-axis

19044555
width	height
you may even make its height longer than its width to let the labels spread out

19044572
min	max
not sure though how you would like to process the crosspoint data status label as you only can sum count average min max by default .

19044609
translation	localization
for localization you can use gettext extension of php this uses .po and .mo file format for content translation

19044910
min	max
i want to know how can i use max min command with ormlite

19044940
maven	pom.xml
pom.xml is required for building project using maven

19044940
maven	pom.xml
you might import jars manually in eclipse but for building the project in some other build system which supports maven you would need pom.xml

19044942
tax	shipping
_gaq.push _addtrans transactionid affiliation total tax shipping city state country

19044967
int	chars
delete and will be equal only if the p points to basic data types such as chars or int

19044977
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
instead of putting the border on the a which caused a weird ever-expanding width issue i put it on the div which wraps the a and added margin and padding to that div then gave the arrow a height 0

19045007
maven	pom.xml
so answering your question - no you don t need to add pom.xml if you don t use maven

19045020
maven	pom.xml
its very little information that you ve provided it would at least be good to see your maven resources plugin configuration in your pom.xml

19045045
pull	push
but of course as with any form of history rewriting this is only possibly if your previous commits have not been shared either via a push by you or a pull from you

19045060
uninstall	upgrade
create an upgrade file that has the name upgrade-1.3.0-2.0.0.php that really contains an uninstall script

19045060
uninstall	upgrade
then your upgrade uninstall script will run and only after that remove the extension

19045065
maven	pom.xml
usually it is enough to just define a dependency in your pom.xml and maven will do the right thing

19045091
width	height
but try check your html viewport meta tag and remove width device-width and height device-height properties

19045115
mouse	keyboard
your form isn t updated and you message loop handling of mouse paint keyboard events is blocked

19045123
screens	tablet
if device is tablet then regardless of screens is in portrate mode

19045157
disk	ram
the difference here is likely to be rather small unless not all of these pages fit into ram and need to be written to disk which is unlikely here since b is only 10000000 4 40000000 bytes 38 mb

19045165
youtube	vimeo
you can now also attach video links youtube vimeo dailymotion and viddler

19045184
hex	binary
first i converted the hex to binary

19045194
int	boolean
an int value of 3 supports the idea that a boolean variable does not have a valid value

19045201
int	chars
so by default it works for int bigint chars string and so on because scala.predef defines conversions for them

19045275
cout	cin
in whole program there are also other classes which use cin and cout and as i said at the begining i didn t wanted to extract all of them to one class responsible for input output

19045300
uibutton	uinavigationitem
you can create a custom uibutton and manually assign it as uinavigationitem s leftbarbuttonitem

but i want to implement if user installed ads enable versioning then he can upgrade it to the ads free versioning

19045397
width	height	google-chrome	safari
the current implementation is centering the overlay based on the viewport width and height - determined by the window.innerwidht hegiht - in ios google-chrome ios safari default android and android google-chrome

19045441
int	chars	int	double
non-prototyped functions will default to the standard calling conventions which means all int args chars short int promote to int and all float args promote to double

19045609
width	height
and set the height and width of overlay-inner overlay-content in percentages

19045629
eurekalog	madexcept
i don t want to use external libs such as eurekalog or madexcept

19045654
google-chrome	firefox
please check you development tool google-chrome or firebug firefox that your request is going and what is coming in response

19045659
min	max
there s an answer here using min max and no branches

19045659
min	median	min	max	median	max
actually 4 min max operations are enough to find the median there s no need for xor s

19045691
hide	show
put div into every content and show hide div like folowing

19045696
uiview	subviews
once done i add uiview as subviews to scroll view set scroll views content size in programatically

19045696
uiview	subviews
whether i add constraints or not to uiview its subviews it works perfectly

19045741
min	max
library aggregate allows for a witness on min max scalar operations

19045744
post	get
after some googling i found that this might be a issue between webgrid get method posting and my form s post method data posting

19045771
mouse	keyboard
i have buttons for my products and if they are pressed via keyboard shortcut or mouse button the product is ordered

19045807

pop-up	dialog
when the pop-up is opened jqm appends a hash to the url www.myjqm_page.com # ui-state dialog

19045923
portrait	landscape
the output image has been displaying correctly when i take the picture in the landscape mode however it returns a rotated image 90 degrees when taking a picture in portrait mode

19045955
haskell	ocaml
also in haskell f arg only has a chance of being computed when a is nothing due to haskell being lazy unlike ocaml

19045979
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
in case your uiviewcontroller is inside a uinavigationcontroller you will have to set the barstyle

19046007
inherited	properties
as you can see you now have some code duplication between the two pages so the next step would be to consider implementing a basepage which as the common properties and then inherited that from a1.aspx ulogin.aspx

19046020
folder	directory
3 now copy this iphonesimulator4.3.sdk and follow this same directory structure for new xcode version and past this iphonesimulator4.3.sdk into sdks folder along with iphonesimulator7.0.sdk

19046040
post	get
the post-fix if cannot be placed as you have it because technically that is in the middle of the block that you want to pass to the get or post

19046052
min	max	range	max	range	min
the range property has the min and max of what is actually being displayed within your axes

19046057
width	height
design for one screen resolution then scale up or down according to screen aspect ratio can lead to skewing as the screen size scaling for width height are likely to be different

19046168
maven	pom.xml
for this maven plugin this is done by adding it as property android.sdk.path in the properties section of the pom.xml

19046184
versioning	upgrade
you would need to upgrade the weblogic versioning if you need jpa2 or otherwise use jpa1.0

i have a button when scroll bar is bigger than 600 it will show if less it will hide

19046272
post	put
have your application only respond to put post delete requests

highcharts	highstock
unfortunately it is not possible but highcharts highstock use timestamps time in miliseconds instead of data like 2013-09-24

19046311
hide	show
but you can prepare your own custom selector which will show hide related points by setvisible function

19046337
maven	m2e
edit when you have m2e make sure you import the project using import maven project

19046442
google-chrome	firefox
works in google-chrome firefox ie9 ie10

19046464
equals	compareto
compareto method always return zero for equals and non-zero for unequal dates

19046467
folder	dir	folder	directory
in order to determine whether something is a file or directory you can check how it registers when using the dir command on the containing folder

19046467
folder	dir
its a bit of a hassle but when using dir called on the folder won t work when called on the file directly you seem to get the correct output

19046479
versioning	upgrade
they will not be able to download and install versioning 1.1 unless they upgrade to ios7

19046488

19046514
textview	imageview
i would like to move all objects textview buttons imageview in order to occupy the whole screen

19046522
min	max	range	max	range	min
you can use sql to calculate range using the aggregate functions min max and the mean using avg in a simple aggregate

19046575
gridview	detailsview
the user-defined type must define public properties whose names match those of the dictionary entries passed to the data source control from data-bound controls such as gridview and detailsview

19046575
accessor	properties
the data source object s public properties must expose both get and set accessor

19046575
accessor	properties
so in my case i can pass countries object only if object s public properties expose both get and set accessor

19046575
getter	setter
only getter was public and setter were initialized through constructor

19046575
objectdatasource	detailsview
finally problem was somewhere else in objectdatasource not in detailsview component

19046590
width	height
if listview layout attrs are wrap_content it called getview every width or height changing

19046620
regasm	tlbimp
following various suggestions on stack and the web in general i ve gone down the route of trying to create intermediate com objects create a project in .net and register for com interop in 64bit and 32bit guises to see if i can call those to provide this step down from 64 to 32 bit but i either end up going round in circles using tlbimp to create a 64 big runtime callable wrapper or to use regasm to go the other way around

19046627
keydown	keyup
use .val and .keyup using keydown doesn t register the newest value it registers the value before so keyup is better to use for this

19046628
ssl	https
yes gsoap supports ssl https by using openssl the info can be found from engelen soapdoc2.html#tth_sec19.21

19046640
youtube	vimeo
the user is able to enter the id of a youtube video or the id of a vimeo video - wordpress then displays the video for the id on custom post type page

19046640
post	put
for example on the music post page i have assigned it the category music and put a vimeo video id which is displayed on the front end but then the same video is displayed for promo and commercial and i dont want that to happen

19046646
mouse	keyboard
also take a look at my solution for setting focus on textarea when user changes selected tab using mouse or keyboard

19046660
keydown	keyup
it should be val for adding value to input and use keyup rather than keydown to show value in other input immediately

19046665
try-catch	exception-handling
keep the operation in try-catch to catch any exception-handling in all the cases

19046689
maven	pom.xml	ant	pom.xml	ant	maven
earlier i was using build.xml ant to run my test cases but now i use pom.xml maven to run the test cases

19046689
ant	pom.xml
when i had ant i was able to get testng-xslt reports but after reading many blogs and tutorials i couldnt generate via pom.xml

19046692
getter	setter
you could consider a t4 template that generates a partial definition of your class with the desired getter setter might need to be placed in partial methods code after extracting the values with reflection from the attribute

19046770
persistent	transient
variables may be marked transient to indicate that they are not part of the persistent state of an object

19046850
multiplying	subtract
so i have a file called calcoo.py which has a class called calculator that sums and subtract and then i inherit that class in another class called calculatorchild located in another py file of the same directory that just extend the behaviour of calculator adding the divide and multiplying methods

19046866
int	double
not a good idea for double and you would probably need to trim the input string of whitespace even for int

19046878
usergroups	administration
also this design helped me to create a comfortable user interface where the administration can manage and change permissions for usergroups

19046879
glut	glfw
when working with glut i used glutsolidsphere to draw my spheres but having moved to glfw i had to use glusphere

be carefull not to mix up the maven-eclipse-plugin and the m2e maven eclipse integration

19047493
maven	m2e
if you have maven commands in your ide i suppose that you have installed m2e successfully if not check this answer

19047515
try-catch	exception-handling
another important point about this exception-handling is that it is a checked exception-handling and you need to provide explicitly exception-handling handling while using methods which can possibly throw classnotfoundexception in java either by using try-catch block or by using throws clause

19047613
getter	setter
what objective-c does is set a lock so only the actual thread may access the variable as long as the setter getter is executed

19047613
getter	setter
only the method call of the setter getter is

19047613
getter	setter
but if you use a setter and after that a getter at the same time with 2 different threads it could be broken too

19047620

this code is working well in ie9 google-chrome firefox

19047791
int	double
like say extracts only mantissa from high-word of double only 20 bits of highword - higher bits are sign and exponent - this constant performs int bit operations under some parts of floating point value specifically on mantissa as i see

19047833
int	double
i think you want to take care of the special cases- for 0 it should be 1 for negative you should treat it as a negative power hence you should use double instead of int for your variable

19047839
hide	show
in source control explorer there is an option to show hide deleted items

19047953
vim	sublimetext

19055370
int	boolean
this works because boolean types are primitive they are some kind of int and not smart enough to participate in memory management

19055381
width	height
instead of using height and width like you are currently doing you should use padding because then the text is vertically centred

19055397
implements	extends
in this case unless there s a lot more going on i would just create my own test class extends the class with the real behavior that implements the interface you need to mock

19055410
width	height
as giving width and height can limit your button and if you have more test or padding the height and width will not let the background increase

19055432
mouseover	mousemove
if you want to you can bind mousemove events to the canvas track its position and the position where you drew stuff and imply on your own that it s over that object effectively what the plugins do but it s all mousemove events on a single canvas rather than mouseover events on components of it

19055486
rss	feed
i m designing an app that needs to have access to an rss feed at all times

19055487
subtraction	multiplication
a subtraction that produces a tiny result is necessarily exact due to characteristics of the floating-point format there are no significand bits lower than the bits in a subnormal value and subtraction unlike multiplication cannot mathematically have any lower bits than there are in the inputs

19055514
maven	pom.xml
account for the above step 4 by a pom.xml dependency pointing to you remote_interface.jar in your local maven repo assuming you installed it

19055565
inherited	properties
looking a bit deeper it appears that direct inherited of a class implementing ibaserecordcollection would work but delphi can t handle doing it indirectly via a properties using implements

integral types can be implicitly converted one to another so returning a chars from a function that s declared to return an int is perfectly fine

19055654
uicontrol	uibutton
in regular ios dev i can subclass uibutton and add selectors for the uicontrol events

19055686

width	height
when i nslog the height and width for a retina device in landscape mode i get a height of 1024 and a width of 768

19055895
width	height
i would expect for a device in landscape orientation the height would be 768 and the width would be 1024

19055899
getter	setter
in your constructor you need to use the same tests as in getter and setter instead of setting the values directly

19055900
maven	pom.xml
update please note that i am not looking for a workaround using using the maven release plugin within the pom.xml

19055925
min	max
realistically you re better off just using and max and min validators and adding an ng-change directive that calls a function to update the date

the .hover jquery function takes two arguments the function to be executed at hover mouseenter and the function to be executed at hover out mouseleave

19056056
width	height
scale the image uniformly maintain the image s aspect ratio so that both dimensions width and height of the image will be equal to or larger than the corresponding dimension of the view minus padding

19056069
16-bit	64bit
i recently discovered that 64bit window won t run 16-bit applications .com in this case because 64bit windows doesn t have a 16-bit subsystem or so the internet says

19056085
int	double
limit your storage range to what will fit in float or else use some other representation such as unsigned int or double if you want to reliably store 20m as an int

19056100
width	height
the width is set to 80 which works fine but the height auto property is not working fine at all

19056112
rss	feed
a slightly smaller function that will grab the first available feed whether it is rss or atom most blogs have two options - this grabs the first preference

19056122
777	tmp

19056138
int	double
you could replace float with double or int to solve this problem

19056191

19056192
google-chrome	firefox
as mentioned the player character displays and moves as expected in google-chrome however in firefox it simply displays initially and does not move

19056192
google-chrome	firefox
btw the following alternate code also works in google-chrome and not in firefox

19056200

i have double and int in the data not only strings

19056367
int	boolean
but i created a boolean function which determines whether an int is a prime number or not and i named it bool isprime

19056367
cout	cin
i am not sure how to fix it i ve also noticed that my compiler visual c++ gives a red underline for cout and cin but if i declare using namespace std than the compiler underlines the std and gives this error name must be a namespace name i don t know what it supposed to mean

19056408

integer	unsigned
i need to perform a multiplication operation on a fixed-point variable x unsigned 16-bit integer u16 type with binary point 6 bp6 with a coefficient a which i know will always be between 0 and 1

19056657
integer	fractions
however since the coefficient is limited in precision by the number of fractions bits and i do not necessarily need the full 10 bits of integer i was thinking that i could just make the coefficient variable a a u16 bp15 to yield a more precise result

19056693
super	implements
okay in this piece of code i get that your creating instance variables of type gesture detector which will call the flinggesturelistener.class.i m getting the error a super interface must be an interface but i have created it as of type interface .the id gives an error also when i refer it to my xml layout name.implementing flinggesturelistner so my studentgallery class looks like this now and implements the flinggesturelistener

19056714
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox but not google-chrome for some reason

19056723
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox but not google-chrome

19056723
google-chrome	firefox
i also recommend using firebug in firefox and google-chrome developer tools - just looking at the errors in google-chrome developer tools showed what it doesn t like

19056729
width	height
when i nslog the height and width for a retina device in landscape mode i get a height of 1024 and a width of 768

19056729
width	height
i would expect for a device in landscape orientation the height would be 768 and the width would be 1024

post	get
httpurlconnection redirects my post request into a get

19056804
implements	extends
to override this method you either need to 1 create a class that extends simpleongesturelistener or 2 implements a gesture listener within your existing class

19056804
implements	extends
then for flinggesturelistener i use a separate class that extends simpleongesturelistener so i can choose to only implements onfling

19056925
hash	md5
the table has a column called active which is either is null which means the account is active or contains a md5 hash which means the account is inactive

19056925

19056981
width	height
to determine the width height of a page you need to do the following

19056999

int	double
that parsed double value converted into int type using .intvalue

19058602
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
please advice on what could have been the issue is it again probably related to not using xdomainrequest instead of xmlhttprequest so that we could take precautions in the code to avoid future issues

19058605
int	double
your main problem is that you try to parse a double value into an int

19058609
textmate	sublimetext
so mac users can utilize textmate sublimetext etc.

the problem is it works somehow in firefox ie sort of and definitely doesn t work in google-chrome

19059477
listview	gridview
a gridview is not what i am thinking of as far as i know as it is basically a different style of listview

19059492
implements	extends
if your plan is to make a special class that implements parcelable and have many other classes extends that class it is tricky because members and fields in objb need to be written in the same order in which they were read so obja needs to sort properly and it needs to know what types the members of objb are so that it can read and write the proper types

19059529
for-loop	arrays
because in real life i will be having dynamic columns populated into datasource and i will construct the columns arrays inside the for-loop

width	height
when the button is released it tries to repaint the new background with the true value background but then the image width is cropped since is using the original toggle button height as width

19059918
hide	show
my current solution is to have three different toggle buttons for each rotation to use 90â 0â -90â animate and hide the current button and then show the new button using the same drawables and rotate them with xml tags but i think is kind of cumbersome.

19059938
serializable	deserialization
there are other possible routes to achieve this type of complex serializable object navigation still using json and overriding parts of the framework but actually i think that it might be better to just use your own baseviewmodel s to do serializable and deserialization - use serializable code like

19060068
post	get
so for example intercept the login form post using jquery do an ajax post of the login form get json or something else back and then pop the dialog with a redirect on the client side

the latest versions of google-chrome firefox internet explorer and safari are evergreen browsers they automatically update themselves silently without prompting the user

19060337
equals	tostring
due to the way anonymous types work with equals and tostring being autogenerated this should give you a nice error message and check all the properties at the same time

19060404

client-side	server-side
in that case at runtime the client-side axis-generated code parts of which i pasted above thinks that the server-side method does not return successfully on the server side even though it does and throws the return value instead of returning it

19060805

19060881
width	height
it also correct the width and the height of each image because i think there is an error in masonry

19060891

19060970
for-loop	loops
if the while loops is having problems try a for-loop

19060972
margin	height
to avoid that the simplest solution is to add bottom margin to body element in the same amount as footer height

19060972
margin	height
but to make sure you avoid footer overlap you would have to use jquery to update body s bottom margin on screen size change because footer height can change especially in responsive layouts

19060994
google-chrome	safari
it will show in google-chrome safari and internet explorer

19061129
inherited	subclassing
this works also for any future subclassing of input that might not even exist yet or you might not be aware of at the time of adding the method so is therefore better more generic than creating an alternative inherited hierarchy which you ll have to then maintain and keep in sync with upstream changes

19061131

folder	directory
the reason for the problem - putting the database mdf and ldf files in a directory outside the official sql server installation folder

19061203

the problem i have is when i rotate the devices to landscape the uiwebview rotates but it keeps the same width as the portrait mode

19061385
portrait	landscape
it displays one view of its data in portrait mode and a different view of the data in landscape

19061385
portrait	landscape
on a smaller phone type device landscape is too small to be useful but portrait mode is still viable

19061386
put	get
i just want to make sure that if i put it up it doesn t get raped

19061388
getter	setter
dot notation is an alternative way to invoke a property s setter or getter and it does exactly the same thing as the other syntax

19061392
xlsx	xlsm
basically the idea of xlsx vs xlsm is that user can tell straight away if there is code in a worbook or not so if you want to put code in your workbook you must save it as xlsm

19061406
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i know how to achieve that with an attached uinavigationcontroller into my uiviewcontroller and a 64pp image background that i set with

19061412
folder	directory
my root folder localhosts for server paths is different than my local directory structure

19061414
mdpi	hdpi	screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi
basically the little screens falls under ldpi while the other screens pictured is either a mdpi or a hdpi

19061414
screens	mdpi
apparently the drawable folder treats images the same as mdpi so this is why it is over-scaling for the larger screens and under-scaling the small screens

19061461
switching	screens
you can then use the sw qualifier to switching on the physical screens size

19061480
atan2	sin	cos	atan2	cos	sin
for this we need both the sin and the cos - then we can find the angle using atan2

19061480

rspec	capybara
when you add config.include capybara dsl to the bottom of the rspec helper file in the section right before this you may have forgotten to save the page

19061591
unsigned	short
it s just a way to get the unsigned byte value by converting it to short and then masking out the original bits from the byte to display it as an unsigned value

19061592
google-chrome	firefox
ie doesn t render span with the display none style properly while firefox and google-chrome don t have this issue

19061593
division	multiplication	floating-point	integer
if all the values vary each time then it seems unlikely that the floating-point division to compute the 1.25 followed by floating-point multiplication is going to be any faster than the integer multiplication followed by integer division

19061593
int	double
but the chances are that if your values start as int doing int ops on them is going to be faster than converting to double and doing a similar number of double ops

19061607
width	height
i also tried adding some javascript to the iframe page that returns the height and width of the page and then setting the iframe width to that

19061625

i have a menu on the top of a page i need an overlay at the background with black color and and this overlay has to appear at li hover mouseenter and disappear at mouseleave

19061671
int	double
there s not really a reason to take an int as an input type here since java will automatically cast int s to double s for you

19061672
int	boolean
in scala given the int d x i would have a boolean expression which should be true if and only if is a square

19061673
put	get
just more info...i found that i should not put a slot in a qthread..not sure how to get around this but here is my class definiation

19061675
int	double
you are attempting to return a double value in a method declared to return an int

19061698
cos	sin
if you store the orientation as an angle then you must assume some kind of default orientation when angle is 0 express that default orientation as a vector like 1.0 0.0 0.0 if you assume x+ direction to be the default then rotate that vector by your angle degrees either directly with sin cos or by using rotation matrix created by one of the d3dxmatrixrotation functions and the resulting vector will be your current direction

19061768
width	height
as akjoshi has explained the gridsplitter changes the height property of rows width property of columns

19061768
width	height
if you check the value source for the height or width property after the gridsplitter has been used to resize a row or column you ll see it s been set to local

19061768
width	height
clearing the height or width property allows the height or width property to again be set using triggers and or styles

19061784
floating-point	integer
additionally does not generally produce the same result as due to properties of integer and floating-point arithmetic including rounding and overflow

19061784
floating-point	integer
if your program is doing mostly integer operations then the conversion of j to floating point multiplication by 1.25 and conversion back to integer might be free because it uses floating-point units that are not otherwise engaged

19061828
gdi	direct2d
a paint could just be a list like bgcolor red fgcolor blue font tahoma or something or it could be a pointer to an internal structure the paint system uses this is an abstraction over windows gdi but will ultimately abstract over direct2d and coregraphics which have paint objects which i don t wanna recreate over and over and then bind over

division	multiplication
most others would require at most 2 instructions like j + j 4 instead of a slow multiplication and a very slow division

19062174
multiplying	division
using int multiplying divide also allows the compilers to optimize out division by a constant and there s no need to convert to and from floating point value

19062174
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	division	division	multiplication	floating-point	fractions
for other cases when the fractions is not representable in floating-point like then using int multiplying divide would be more correct because 0.3 isn t exactly 0.3 in binary floating-point and most probably faster because the compiler can optimize out division by a constant by converting it to multiplication by its multiplicative inverse

however it s probably best not to mix the two kind of parameters so the solution is always to include your extra parameters as hidden fields then it will work with both get and post forms

19063793
post	get
you will get form data in post array and url parameters in get array in request you will get both get and post data in one array

19063793

19064515
getter	setter
if beanutils.copyproperties considers only the setter and getter of the elements and is not intelligent enough to figure out that set and list are both collections and iterates and copies the elements one by one - which still requires that authority is compatible with dtoauthority - then it will throw this reflection error then set is not assignable from list not compatible

19066319
listview	gridview
the problem i encounter is when the app is in snapped mode and i navigate to the page with the listview and gridview both views try to call loadmoreitemsasync and i enter the exception clause whereas when in normal fullscreen mode only the gridview calls the method and the listview doesn t

19066321
min	max
first find the bounding box of your points by going through your list of points and detecting the min and max points along each axis minx miny maxx and maxy

19066389
pull	push
i have seen some previous questions here and here and some others that indicate i need to do a git pull and merge before i can push these changes

19066399
listview	gridview
the gridview is visible by default and the listview is not

getter	setter
while i have done a lot of reading about getter setter and accessing data from inserting data into a database in my instance a mysql db one thing isn t clear to me

19066441
width	height
the width and height of stage are calculated after it has been shown .show

19066449
min	max
either way just change the min vs max

19066449
min	max
start first with just the stores and the max price or min item they sell -- regardless of what it it

19066465
width	height
here s how to get the screen height and width

19066477

to summarize that for-loop simply collects all the keys of t in an arrays a in order to sort them using table.sort and then print them

19066531
fadein	fadeout
it s all working great until i open up a dropdown menu above it and then the current li list item shows above the menu not the ul background only during the fadein fadeout transition

19066531
fadein	fadeout
once the transition has resolved the list item returns to the correct z-index until the next fadein fadeout starts

19066561
ubuntu	linux
i have written a program in c++ in linux ubuntu 12.04 platform which print my required output into the stdout in every second

19066634
versioning	upgrade
the simplest and most futureproof possibility is to wait a bit for 6.2 rcs are already out and upgrade your portal to this versioning

19066648
children	parent
when you set the opacity on an element all children of that element has an opacity of 1 but as they are inside the parent element the opacity set on the parent element will also affect the children elements as well so you can not set the opacity of a child to be more visible than the parent as the childs opacity is already 1

19066651

for that you ll need to do g.clearrect 0 0 width height as well

19066826
superclass	subclassing
when you extends any class it will invoke constructor of superclass while creating object of subclassing

19066859
mouse	keyboard
i want when i press a or b on the keyboard to make the same action like when i press it with the mouse

19066869
versioning	upgrade
when you need to upgrade there s a separate method onupgrade - but it should be used when you actually release a new versioning

19066870
client-side	server-side
the actual validation should always be done server-side as the client-side validation can easily be cheated

19066893
serializable	deserialization
the constructor for a is called during deserialization because a does not implement serializable

19066917
serializable	deserialization
constructors are not executed for serializable classes i.e b during deserialization

19066991
mouse	keyboard
i browse a lot and i use some adjusted scripts to work only with my keyboard without use of mouse

19067001
mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	mousemove	mousemove	mousedown
i m trying to get it so when you mousedown and mousemove whatever polygons you mouseover change to brown too

19067001
mouseover	mousemove
the problem is that it looks like whatever polygon the user mousedowns will be the only polygon that mousemove will see and mouseover won t fire at all unless the user mouseups over a polygon as if in the split second that the mouse button isn t down the mouseover had a chance to fire

19067001
mouseover	mouseup
when the button is mouseupped in the split second before the mouseup event fires the mouseover event

19067013
addition	multiplication
chip doesn t support multiplication only addition

19067038
post	get
notice however that because of the inner join enforced by joins you will only get post with existing comments

19067072
addition	multiplication
all you need to remember is that a multiplication is a repeated addition assuming that both operands are so we have

19067072
subtract	add
if y is not zero then add x one more time and subtract 1 from y

19067092

in the root i have a vbulletin forum and in cms i have wordpress

19067221
domxpath	domdocument
scraping data with html simple dom parser is slow as compared with the built-in dom parser domdocument and domxpath

19067253
post	get
i m assuming that the data variable being returned by the get call is not a true file type so the post is failing as a result

19067253
post	get
i m not sure how to properly create a file object that s returned from get so that it post correctly as a file

19067259
width	height
only if you have width height is unnecessary but its other story

19067260
google-chrome	safari
apparently google-chrome and safari are wrong onchange should only be triggered when the user releases the mouse

19067260
mouse	keyboard	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
to get continuous updates you should use the oninput event which will capture live updates in firefox safari and google-chrome both from the mouse and the keyboard

19067308
pull	push
the problem is this i was writing code when without make commit or push i ve made a pull from github and my code was deleted

19067311
ubuntu	debian
if not to make it the default usually already the case on debian and derivative like ubuntu

19067312
gif	png
common image formats png jpg gif etc. don t lend themselves well for rendering by a graphics chip

19067386
vbscript	vba
it works quite well for vbscript and should do so for vba too

19067386
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
also this implementation is case-sensitive for method-by-name look-ups which should be tweaked as vb is case-insensitive

19067413
bufferedreader	filewriter
or you can use the traditional java i o classes like bufferedreader and filewriter as other answer seems to suggest

19067447
uiview	calayer
you can t apply a calayer to a uiview

19067460
width	height
but height and width are always 0

19067476
width	height
with this following code you can change the height of your uitextview depending of a fixed width it s working on ios 7 and previous version

19067476

so i have my browser activity ready however i m struggling to get the code working to open the link from my rss feed to open in that it just goes to a blank page

19067620
scatter	graphing
i have kept the grouping enabled yet the graphing doesn t group the scatter serie

19067690
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
it seems crazy to have a readerinputstream bufferedreader inputstreamreader fileinputstream but it s the only way i ve seen to avoid rolling my own

19067703
optgroup	textarea
i was learning some html and i got confused about use of the label element because i found it in many places with inputs in a form with optgroup tag for the sections in a select element before the textarea elelemt etc

19067713
bmp	png
i m trying to convert a very big bmp file to a png

19067713

ready	each
i have laid the game tiles and the game is ready to play all i need is an algorithm to verify and make the changes to the connections when the user clicks on each tile every time

19067739
profiler	visualvm
i suggest using visualvm as a start and possibly a commercial profiler if the heap is large or the problem is obscure

19067761
client-side	server-side
client-side validation that compliments the server-side validation is good practice from a user-experience perspective

19067780
width	height
in the second code there is only div with specified height and width inside map-wrapper

19067813
peer	p2p
introduced in ios 7 multipeerconnectivity is a framework for connecting to nearby peer over bluetooth wi-fi or p2p without distinction between the transport layer being used

19067814
peer	p2p
the multipeerconnectivity framework is an ios 7 framework for connecting to nearby peer over bluetooth wi-fi or p2p

19067824
stdout	stderr
i then wrap that script with another script to set things up for cron such as source .profile redirecting stdout and stderr logging errors etc

19067826
unsigned	short	integer	unsigned
in your first case the 4th rule applies -1 is signed integer which can represent all the values of unsigned short therefore the unsigned short is promoted to signed integer

19067826
integer	unsigned
in your second case the 3rd rule applies signed integer cannot represent all values of unsigned integer so it is changed to unsigned integer

19067826
unsigned	short
in your third case the -1 is converted to unsigned short and then the first rule applies

19067901
post	get
you can try this query for thumbnail size for medium image i am not sure about the right size if you know the dimension then make custom alias as i made below using the substring_index to get the extension of file then i have used concat function with the post_name column and the dimensions + extension similarly you can do this for medium size as all upload goes to the upload folder you can analyze the generated thumbs name are original attachment name + -150x150 or other dimensions so from this logic your thumbs get the name with the dimensions the attachments of post are stored in post_meta with the post id and having key name _wp_attachment_metadata which stores all the information about different sizes of file but in a serialized form so in mysql query you cannot unserialize the data

19067950
int	boolean
i d like to write a method that does return something of a primitivetype like float int boolean and also string if possible

19067988
post	get
as long as your wordpress plugin assigns a proper image to each post using the og image tag and the conditions stated below emphasis added then you should be able to get full size post

19068049
geocoding	geocode
effectively starts the process of geocoding each row while in the second table it says column is fully geocode

19068068
post	get
now you should decide whether you want to support data given by get post requests or support both

19068070
width	height
i want my div to adapt its height to always equal its width

19068108
min	max
min 0 max 255 col 5 base 10 format html rnd new

19068109
viewdidload	viewdidappear
so somewhere in-between viewdidload and viewdidappear the value of the track property was changed to null

19068124
post	get
basically i want to get the username of the person that created the post

19068149
getter	setter
under source generate getter and setter but first you need something to get and set like this

19068160
websphere	ibm
for more complex and high load applications its better to go to ibm websphere application server

19068214
inherited	properties	implements	extends
when we say one class extends another class it is having strong relation ship known as inherited .this means when one child extends parent then child should be able to inherited something from parent class like horse is a animal .horse is inheriting some properties of animal .but when a class implements another class then child class is trying to implements a contract dosen t need to inherited anything from parent just following a contract that why interface all methods are abstract by default but you can provide some concrete method in class for child class to inherited and can make some of then abstract is well

19068214
implements	extends
so for me extends is inheritance and interface in implements contract.hope this is satisfactory

19068351
gdi	direct2d
i have tried an approach with direct2d but that was even much slower than the drawlines method in gdi

19068363
post	get
i can t use post or get functions

19068398
easymock	jmock
bytecode manipulation frameworks using proxy generation and reflection spring hibernate etc mocking frameworks easymock jmock etc code analysis tools pmd findbugs etc

19068436
firefox	safari
try it in firefox of safari

19068444
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
edit use plain fileinputstream and fileoutputstream

19068453
google-chrome	firefox
it s working on ie but for firefox and google-chrome the animation always play twice

19068470
width	height
it must have the overall width of all images and the height must be declared otherwise the images will go to several lines

19068537
int	chars
assumption you can assume one swap method is given with signature swap chars arr int index1 int index2

19068544
outputstream	inputstream
i think it will be much better to inputstream outputstream using byte arrays

19068559
uitableview	uisearchbar
what might be even easier is to embed the uisearchbar in the header of a uitableview

19068633
int	chars
fgetc returns an int not a chars

19068686
width	height
here is my code the point is you need set width and height 100

19068717
int	chars	int	double
let s say i want the user to input an int but he enters a double or a chars value how do i check that the the user has input the correct type

19068741
springsource	grails
i ran into the same problem running the the test target for the gradle quickstart app in springsource groovy grails tool suite 3.3.0 gradle ide 3.3.0.201307040643 plugin

19068773
post	get
you re basically mixing the post request stuff with the get one

19068793
melt	reshape
i have been fumbling around with apply plyr split reshape melt merge and aggregate with no luck

19068808
addclass	removeclass
jquery comes with addclass and removeclass to add or remove css class dynamically

19068816
super	implements
this automatically covers addall as well because addall is implements using add it looks very enticing.if you look closely you will see that this implementation is fragile because its relied on super class behavior

19068829
int	chars
when trying to use the function in the cmd it says it could match the expected type int with chars however if i use my function directly in the cmd with an actual value it does what it s supposed

19068830
clang	llvm
it seems a custom compiler might be the way forward or at least a plugin that wraps current llvm clang

19068831
floating-point	integer
because 5 9 is an integer division and will never return a floating-point value

19068841
viewgroup	viewdraghelper
if you are implementing your own custom viewgroup you should use a viewdraghelper for this

19068872
folder	directory
you should remove the corresponding folder for the languages you don t want to support from that directory

19068885
afnetworking	sdwebimage
i personally use afnetworking for any network operation a part from images for which i use sdwebimage

19068887
qmainwindow	qwidget	qmainwindow	qframe	qframe	qwidget
qvideowidget qwidget qframe and qmainwindow

19068905
int	boolean	int	chars
it is said that the in-class initialization is allowed only for integral types int chars boolean and only for constants

19068911
getter	setter
edit all the getter and setter methods are in place

19068916
int	chars
since string 123 will also be considered as string and not an int so the better way is to iterate the string to end until we find any non-digit chars

19068927
fast-forward	merge
the merge op will fast-forward master as the only thing needed to achieve the merge is to slide the label down from commit f to commit d

19068959
int	chars
printf is a variadic function which means that any arguments of type chars are converted up to int before the function is called

19068978
int	chars
all integral arguments passed to a function are generally promoted to the cpu s word size so regardless if you pass a chars short int or long the physical layout of the stack and or registers upon entry to printf is the same anyway

19068984
post	get
payload but this is fundamentally against rest since now we change the semantic meaning of post to mean data retrieval get

19069025
jobs	cron
i found that this is done using cron jobs

19069030
getter	setter
create getter and setter to make bean properties out of them

19069042
width	height
you will need to filter with a kernel that has height desired_displacement_y 2 + 1 and width desired_displacement_x 2 + 1

19069052
getter	setter
here s the model which i m practicing with getter and setter are omitted to reduce space

19069055
distance	polygons
i would like to calculate edge to edge distance between a polygons in which is situated a turtle and each polygons that is situated in a radius of 2 km around the polygons in which is situated the turtle

19069059
ienumerable	ilist
it s an interesting concept but seems like overkill if all you want to do is replace ienumerable with ilist

19069106
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
it contains padding inside the given width like the box-sizing border-box would do on other block level elements

19069129
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
the current css3 definition of box-sizing does not say anything about this but translating the above quote it basically means in x html tables use the border-box model padding and borders do not add to the specified width of a table

19069129
box-sizing	border-box
box-sizing is set to border-box

19069129
google-chrome	firefox
but given what the note says above i would say that ie and firefox are closer to the intended css3 definition since in google-chrome you can t seem to change a table s box model using the box-sizing property

19069138
integer	unsigned
according to the 1999 iso c standard c99 size_t is an unsigned integer type of at least 16 bit see sections 7.17 and 7.18.3

19069177
jruby	mri
it should have worked - i m not that much familiar with ruby-ing on windows but this is definitely an issue of having both mri and jruby on the path - most importantly messing with each others gem_home gem_path you might check the paths from irb by running gem.path - you need to isolate those - make sure they point to the right direction

19069201
folder	dir
if you specify the input folder through uigetdir then all the files can be grabbed using dir command

19069236
pthreads	fork
the fork function is the unix linux pthreads way of creating a new process by duplicating the calling process

19069263
std	ostream
if you really want to disable the stream even if the output operators are badly implemented you can save the current rdbuf in a suitable std ostream pword and set the stream buffer to nullptr

19069270
post	get
to get a valid form you need to bind it to post or get data

19069315
post	get
if you are not reading get or post values then you should not worry

19069339
google-chrome	firefox
the issue that has me stumped involves the show my windows and tabs from last time setting in firefox and the continue where i left off setting in google-chrome

19069339
google-chrome	firefox
however with both firefox and google-chrome the session-only cookie is still active when the browser is started again and i navigate to the page that is marked as login_required

19069339
google-chrome	firefox
i can live with the fact that firefox google-chrome will remember session cookies for tabs that are open but what i don t understand is why they remember session cookies for my site even when the tab is closed before closing the browser

19069369
ubuntu	linux
by the way i m on linux ubuntu

freeglut	glew
i m just starting out with freeglut and glew and getting it running was already quite hard for me

19069428

19069503
hide	show
when i enter the search bar and show the keyboard and hit search again just to hide the keyboard the contentsize then adjusts correctly to only fill the screen and nothing more

19069511
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in google-chrome but not in firefox

19069513
client-side	server-side
to be sure you must do validation server-side although you can use client-side javascript to make the process of altering form data more difficult for the client

19069622
hide	show
then what you do with these classes depends on whether you want to just show hide a div with css or use javascript to redirect the page

19069653

19069925
boost	stl
since stl containers are not thread safe i was planning to define boost mutex in a and store it as reference in class b

19069931
post	get
since php 5.3.9 there is a new setting max_input_vars that limits number of post and get and cookie and so on and so on variables one can pass to a script

19069932
folder	directory
display image from a directory folder in left column

19069932
folder	directory
display text value usually paragraph sentences from .txt file in the same directory folder as the .jpg file in the right column

19070025
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
there is a little hack where you can add box-sizing border-box therefore the padding doesn t effect the width of the element

19070032
floating-point	integer
the short course is that you re doing floating-point computations when you should be doing integer computations

19070049
stdout	stderr
i just learned that in slurm there is no need to do bpeek to check the current standard output and standard error since they are printed in running time to the files specified for the stdout and stderr

19070085
subtract	add
you only need to subtract or add the bias to all of your input vectors

19070185
mp3	wav
you can convert from wav and mp3 using

19070202
for-loop	loops
what you want is a loops statement a for-loop would do well here

19070224
pull	push
or other grid or article push pull alignment using bootstrap 3 so i will vote for close this too

19070238
width	margin
and then apply it to the structural elements header main and footer or it is best to repeat margin and width properties into the id css rules of the structural elements

19070253
hide	show
i m using zurb foundation as a framework and jquery to show hide a containing a foundation based on a dropdown box

19070253

19070458
put	get
so after i put doctrine schema update --force i ll get error table symfony.categories already exists

19070468
hash	md5
it will not improve security because nothing has changed the server can only see the md5 hash and the username now and if i can intercept that i have everything i need to also log in

19070468
hash	md5
and on top of that an unsalted md5 hash is as insecure as the plain text password itself - it is only marginally more effort to scan the whole password space

19070530
src	attr
now the iframe has a src attr which is a link to the actual site that has the comments

19070583
post	get
in response to the wadl thing you should use the built-in facilities of whatever your content format is in html that would be link and a elements to indicate the client should make get requests and form elements for post requests

19070596
for-loop	while-loop
but for this case i would suggest you put the while-loop before the for-loop

19070596
for-loop	while-loop
because if you don t change the value of inputinteger elsewhere in the for-loop the while-loop will only run in the first cycle of the for-loop

19070602
int	boolean
i want to create a database which contains packs each pack contains 50 levels each level has the information of 2d int array and 2d boolean array

google-chrome	firefox
i want to page with no scroll and sticky footer .there is no problem with google-chrome and firefox

19070671
google-chrome	firefox
this code works fine in firefox browser but failing in google-chrome browser saying not able to find element

19070693
folder	directory
when doing the ajax request process maybe 1k records at once these 1k would also be splitted like in the above example run internally 10 times with 100 results for example write them into a temporary directory like part-1.csv part-2.csv and at the end when all the records are processed create an archive from the folder containing all the csv parts and force the browser to download it then remove it from the server window.location.href from within the last ajax call

19070738
stdout	stderr
my first answer is effective when you wish to merge stdout and stderr

19070747
google-chrome	firefox
it looks good in google-chrome but somehow does not work in firefox ie

19070753
getter	setter
once you expose the field through a getter or setter you should be able to serialize this data

19070761
int	chars
you want addition as if the items would be int though may be int chars or std string

19070822
google-chrome	safari
i think part of it was putting the username password in the url which was just a temporary measure because i found that method provided the same results in mobile safari and desktop google-chrome

19070850
infobox	infowindow
yes if you mean open from within an infowindow or an infobox

19070890
bash	tcsh
for example if you enter the command limit descriptors 10 on bash or tcsh you can still run a very long command like ls|cat|cat|cat|cat|cat|cat|cat|cat|cat|cat|cat|cat|wc without having any error messages or broken pipe

19071005
int	chars
i want strside to contain the last chars in rawid and then to strip that chars so that the value of rawid will convert to an int

19071011
for-loop	loops
supposedly one could use #pragma loops on contiguous data regions are moved by a for-loop

19071057
post	get
ok i solved my problem....turned out i was missing some parameters so i used fiddler and found out the post get parameters that where needed and i recreated the requests using libcurl

19071059
int	double
i have double checked that points are int type have the value greater than 500

19071173
post	get
but at the end of this post i m also including yet more code that should do what i want get data from an excel file but it needs to be adapted to work in my macro

19071265
min	max	range	max	range	min
you pass the number you want to exclude and a range of min and max and get a random integer in that range that isn t the number you want excluded

19071286
ubuntu	linux
as i personally rather use linux the server is already set up using ubuntu server

i want to display a long text inside fixed height width of span element

19071414
google-chrome	safari
i want to change the color of the ios 7 status bar in safari and google-chrome

19071464
tex	mathjax
you can of course configure mathjax to use whatever delimiters you want but dollars are the plain tex approach

19071508
move	drag
however when i try to drag an item the very first drag move the item way off its current coordinate but then later on everything is dragged normally

19071532
ubuntu	linux
i m supposed to have ubuntu linux server with python 2.7 and why can t there be a simple explanation of how to get python 2.7 on your uls somewhere

19071534
getter	setter
i would use the getter and setter for each instance variable of the class shape

19071540
public	protected
if you want to read them you ll need at least a public or protected getter

19071540
public	protected
if you want to write them you ll need at least a public or protected setter and or a constructor that initializes them

19071543
folder	directory
every time it just creates multiple folder in the directory i run the program from

19071544
hide	show
i have a group of words that on click should show and hide elements

19071544
hide	show
so if it gets clicked it show the container with content + gets changed to hide

19071544
hide	show
in alternative when it is clicked again it should hide the content and become show again

19071553
hide	show
you can have a counter to toggle between hide and show

19071577
glut	glew
in x86 put the 32-bit versions of glut glew and anything else you need

19071579

19071602
rss	feed
when i try to manually enter rss feed here

19071625
ontouch	ondraw
my understanding is that my customview gets drawn on with ontouch which draws onto the path object and then calls ondraw canvas which draws the path on the canvas

19071639
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i ve tried safari firefox ie google-chrome and opera all with the newest versions and on win7 and i can t see any scrollbars on the footer.

19071648
portrait	landscape
however when the app is in landscape vs portrait the amount of text in the edittext takes up less space thus less lines

19071648
portrait	landscape
that is it will display portrait # of lines when rotated to landscape then landscapes # of lines when rotated back to portrait and so on

19071689
post	get
but most it is get or post most of the time

19071730
put	get
i tried different places to put the wait and set methods but both the tread and the timer get blocked and i don t know how to debug the program

19071787
gif	png
file extensions gif png xbm etc. display in uiimageview

19071825
implements	extends
public class dynamiccolorscreen extends activity implements

19071832
post	get
additionally you don t know whether servlet would be called by get or post but you have same functional requirement for both

19071837
free	malloc	free	strdup	strdup	malloc
don t forget to release memory with free new.value when you delete your node if you do so because strdup calls malloc

19071846
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
this can be further expanded to include an abort signal by throwing in another manualresetevent this could also be an autoresetevent but as it s only going to do something once the distinction is not important

19071853
mdpi	hdpi
it helps you to create and export your psd to drawables for android hdpi mdpi etc

19071879
width	height
need to specify that you are calling the base class with two double parameters in your case height and width

19071906
post	put
i am having an issue with the post request to the web app being sent from the arduino but i can t put my finger on it

ubuntu	debian
or you can use the standalone math library rmath also supplied by r and available as package r-mathlib for debian ubuntu via my packaging

19071942
ubuntu	debian
include link paths work on debian ubuntu

19071975
setinterval	settimeout
i am trying to animate 3 different shapes with settimeout my question is how can i use multiple settimeout to animate 3 different shapes also is there a better way to do this maybe using setinterval

19071977
put	get
if i put settings.py in .gitignore then presumably it won t get deployed with my project

19072009
neo4j	titan	orientdb	titan	orientdb	neo4j
gremlin-scala is a thin thin scala wrapper for gremlin a graph dsl for traversing a number of graph databases including neo4j orientdb dex infinitegraph titan rexster graph server and sesame 2.0 compliant rdf stores

19072015
linefeed	delimiter
._2 can be used to divide the lines of the file using the last character in the string in this case linefeed as the delimiter

19072035
qmodelindex	qabstractitemmodel	qtreeview	qmodelindex	qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel
alternatively qabstractitemmodel and qtreeview offers the way to assign your class treeitem to each qmodelindex so you can next retrieve a pointer to each data using static_cast of pointer returned from qmodelindex.internalpointer function

19072088
min	max
you can control the max min number of threads in the pool using setmaxthreads and setminthreads functions

19072106
width	height
try using the qdesktopwidget s width and height to get the width and height respectively

19072116
superclass	subclassing
arguably by always checking for nil it becomes easier for a superclass to add a failure condition in the future without requiring subclassing to be changed but really it s just a convention

19072128
children	parent
ad a width to the first ul li so children can not push up width from parent

19072159
free	malloc
a basic solution is to prefer new and delete over malloc and free

19072163
free	malloc
the problem with malloc in c++ is that it doesn t call the constructors for your objects and free doesn t call the destructors

19072221
g++	gcc
however if i compile this with an apple provided gcc g++ i get

19072254
int	boolean	int	chars
people say it s because of a widening conversion - that a 2-byte chars will fit in an 4-byte int but what about boolean

19072282
int	boolean
but fortunately it is easy to convert a boolean to any int you d like

19072295
int	double
converts the int value 12 to the double value 12.0

19072299
free	malloc
moreover in c++ you should prefer using to c s malloc free and even better just use std vector container for arrays

19072313
int	boolean
java developers didn t want boolean to convert into any int type implicitly as it was ambiguous in c language

19072386
portrait	landscape
handling device orientation portrait vs landscape on ipad

19072407
hide	show
and when i hide the form again by clicking the cancel-button it show a flicker in the end of the animation of the change-form-button how come

19072417
hide	show
you could also keep the mousemove event on all the time and use cssâ s hover to show and hide the tooltip

19072418
folder	directory
the reason is that this directory is used for the storage of other files and folder that the user might upload from within my php application to the server

19072424
min	max
next i zoomed in by calling the setautomatic false and setminmax min max method provided by the axis class

19072450
free	strdup
it uses the strdup function in such a way where the memory is not free

19072454
width	height
properties of that class would be things like xpos ypos text width height

19072540
octal	decimal
leading zero octal interpretation 012 10 in decimal

19072552
lan	intranet
i am attempting for my program to read an access database from another computer connected in the same lan network intranet

19072603
int	double
you re doing int division which results in an int not a float or double value

19072605
express	node.js
trying to understand how to implement angularjs in a node.js express app

19072613
free	malloc
don t use malloc or free on c++ objects

19072613
free	malloc
malloc does not call any of your constructors free does not call any of your destructors

19072640
implements	extends
carddeck and cardstack extends basecardstack which implements the cardstackinterface

19072704
floor	sqrt
given phi legendre s prime-counting formula is pi x phi x a + a - 1 where a pi floor sqrt x

19072728
partialfunction	implicit
i dug around and rewrote it and found out that it was implicit creating a partialfunction and passing it to planify.apply

19072771
rss	feed
i want to find a web page s rss feed if it has one

19072816
margin	height
i have tried tinkering with just about every css combination i can think of margin padding negative margin defining height floating elements

19072822
http.sys	httplistener
allows port sharing with other processes using http.sys including those using httplistener or iis so long as the prefixes are unique

19072822
http.sys	httplistener
the reason for this is partly because httplistener uses http.sys which is a kernel module and apparently the implementation causes several additional copies of the body data to be made

19072841
for-loop	loops
i need to get a string input from the user and create a loops preferably a for-loop that inserts asterisks between each character

19072853
getter	setter
just to clarify since you seem confused between getter and setter

19072897
mono	xamarin.android
we are considering porting our c# .net application to android and i have started reading about xamarin.android and the mono framework

19072941
int	double
imagine you had a field of type double for instance where it had to have an odd int portion

19072941
getter	setter
you d set showfps to be private and then access it through a direct getter and a validating setter shown here in java syntax

19072952
getter	setter
making the variables private inaccessible to outside directly can prevent the the accidental modification of the data inturn access the data by providing getter setter methods

19073004
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
and this solution works for all latest versions of google-chrome opera safari except from firefox

19073008
min	max
looks like you initialize min and max both to 0

19073008
min	max
then the only code that will ever change min or max is based on user input

19073008
min	max
you need to initialize max and min on the user s first input

19073014
post	get
the voice url does not need to be a post request it can be a get request

19073017
for-loop	loops
the while loops doesn t stop until j is 0 and then it goes to the for-loop and increments j so j is now 1 but the while loops runs again until j is 0 so you loops forever

19073040
int	double
you are not correctly computing the average value double sum count will first do int division which truncates the value then gets cast to double do this instead double sum count or optionally make the type of sum a double

19073094
next	except
everything is working fine except that when i try to clear sorting using following javascript the sorting clears up but the asc desc image still shows up next to the column header

19073095
post	get
i can t post what i did for work but i would be willing to answer questions to help you get started or if you get stuck

19073153
jar	manifest.mf
inside the jar file the manifest.mf file is located in meta-inf folder

19073200
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to a rails 3 compatible versioning here which is compatible for rails 3.2 but not 3.0

19073296
minimum	max	min	max	range	max	range	minimum	range	min
you re using an awful lot of parentheses so it gets hard to see but the minimum value should go outside the call to nextint because nextint returns a value of the range 0 max - min but you want one in the range min max

19073316
hide	show
in ios 7 developers are encouraged to show date pickers between table cells when needed for input and then hide them when done

19073347
virtualenv	setuptools
note a better approach to the path hacking is to have setuptools -based setup.py files in both projects and run python setup.py develop which will link your project path into the python s path i m assuming you use virtualenv

19073420
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
for some reason it works just fine in both google-chrome and safari but not in firefox

19073479
division	multiplication
but as blender pointed out in the comments you have another issue which is the lack of a multiplication operator after your floating point division expression 1.0 2.0

19073479
multiplying	multiplication
notice how i place multiplication operators between every expression that you intend to multiplying

19073517
memcpy	malloc
malloc some memory memcpy your arguments into it or pointers to them and pass that newly malloc ed memory to pthread_create

19073544
gif	png
p.s instead of image png you should put proper content type like image gif or image jpg

19073588
google-chrome	firefox
also document.writeln is potentially dangerous and not best practice to use - if you re looking to check that something is running open up the console f12 in google-chrome firebug a firefox extension that s better than the native one and ie ctrl + shift + k for firefox s native console

19073648
for-loop	loops
your last changeimage goes to #4 immediately because you re changing the image in the for-loop which causes the check within loops to keep being true and so it runs all the way to the last index at which point the check finally fails

19073672
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome and firefox but in internet explorer 10 the canvas is blank

19073672
google-chrome	firefox
i did look at the values for the flashvars and they are identical to what they are when i trace the method in google-chrome and firefox

19073713
stdout	fflush
stdout is line buffered so it will not output without a n character - try fflush

19073729
ontouchevent	ondraw
so you override ontouchevent motionevent and ondraw canvas canvas

19073729
ontouchevent	ondraw
in ontouchevent motionevent you should call invalidate to trigger ondraw canvas canvas

19073854
put	get
note that you ll have to put get +1 in that case

19073861
width	height
i know my images height and width so i set the css accordingly

19073883
width	height
so the canvas may only have some default pixel width and height

19073883
width	height
those width and height definition will define the actually canvas pixel size and can be set differently from css

19073906
width	height
typically you want to decide on a minimum supported screen resolution and design for that using something like setpreferredsize width height to size your top-level windows

19073915
versioning	upgrade
the move which was highlighted on reddit is a significant one as it will give those who have not upgrade their ipad iphone or ipod to the most recent versioning of ios access to a lot more apps

19073922
button	checkbox
i got it working with dispatchtouchevent instead of ontouch but then the problem is that i also get touch response when i press the checkbox button

19073969
folder	directory
i also put all my .js .css and images files in their own directory in a folder named assets in the web root

19073976
hide	show
you can wrap the whole video widget in to hide it if there is no video to show just like you would in plain php

19073996
int	double
my program was a stock market application that read a file that includes a string 5 double and an int

19074023
hide	show
as soon as a process like this is started the progress bar dialog hide or something and the progress is no longer show but the processes still run fine

19074024
qabstractitemmodel	qstandarditemmodel
i know you can do it when you have access to the qstandarditemmodel but using returns a qabstractitemmodel which doesn t have the item int row int col accessor

19074024
qmodelindex	qabstractitemmodel
i ve tried working with qabstractitemmodel itemdata qmodelindex but can t get it to work as i require

19074062
vb.net	vb6
strptr is a vb6 function it does not exist in vb.net

19074067
rvm	bundler
you might need to setup the correct path variable in case you are managing gems locally using rvm and bundler

19074072
versioning	upgrade
i hit this same problem so i upgrade by versioning of python to work around it

19074073
google-chrome	safari
it works on all mac browsers google-chrome safari but i opened my project on google-chrome and internet explorer on windows it displays the font as bold rather than light

19074086
mouse	trackpad
control-click support needs to be added as mac users might not be using a mouse with second button - a trackpad doesn t have a right mouse button

19074128
int	chars
rather than using a slow series of strncmp s you can cast each chars array to an int and do a straight comparison

19074128
post	get
a common use is in web servers for the get post head.

19074128
int	chars	post	get
note if you just use post or tsop as your comparison you may get warnings about multibyte chars the workaround other than turning of the warning is to use p | o 8| s 16| t 24 or vice versa depending on endianness - it will compile to a const int that can be used in a switch

19074247
g++	gcc
gcc 4.7.3 g++ -wall -wextra -std c++0x word-freq.cpp

19074288
post	get
i will find out how to get post array in jquery but my question here is how will i make an ajax call to this specific insert method in categories class as there will be more methods in categories class like delete update etc etc.

19074305
int	double
you can convert everything to double first but if you want to stay in the realm of int check that the division should result in an int

19074321
post	put
you can set a post called method there you put insert update etc so in the php file you make a switch

19074333
int	double
when trying to build sample code something strange happens when i try to add a single letter named variable regardless of its type int double others

19074344
observer-pattern	command-pattern
it provides implementations of several common messaging patterns including the event aggregator pattern command-pattern and observer-pattern

19074352
navigationcontroller	modalviewcontroller
in your case the navigationcontroller which contains modalviewcontroller needs to implement preferredstatusbarstyle and return uistatusbarstylelightcontent

19074359
post	get
i am quite sure that once i can get the post working correctly i won t have a problem directing r to download the files i need online activity reports for each of my 500 students this semester

19074396
apache	nginx
if you are in production you never want to serve your static or media files through django so you should configure apache or nginx or whatever server system you are using to serve the files instead of django

19074433
mouse	keyboard
i have a form that i want fill it only with mouse no keyboard

19074454
min	max
if so i think you could just use min and max no

19074488
textview	imageview
what s happening is i ve set up the imageview and textview in the xml as such

19074505
post	get	google-chrome	firefox
note that some user agents google-chrome firefox ie went further and treat a 302 redirect as a get request even though the original request could be a post

19074505
post	put
for example post or put it will do the following request with

19074519
children	parent
every once in awhile we haven t found out why yet when removing an aggregate entity hibernate will send a sql command to first delete the parent and then try to delete the children

19074590
typedef	struct
one thing i m unclear about is in all the examples i ve seen is they typedef the struct

19074590
typedef	struct
also i don t really see the point struct node isn t that much longer than a single typedef d name

19074611
superclass	subclassing
a subclassing does not have to have any constructor with the same number of parameters in the constructor as the superclass but it does have to call some of its superclass constructors from its own constructor

19074611
superclass	subclassing
if the superclass has a no-arg constructor it is called by default if an explicit call to a superclass constructor is omitted or if the subclassing has no explicit constructor at all as is your case but since your superclass does not have a no-arg constructor compilation fails

19074627
typedef	struct
personally i don t use typedef on a struct very often

19074633
children	parent
the method getchildren returns node array which has all the children of that parent

19074635
typedef	struct
to refer to your struct of the linked list use struct node after the typedef you can also use llist

19074644
haskell	ocaml
this is definitely showing f# s ocaml heritage as some other functional languages haskell scala ml keep the list as the last argument to allow for the more common partial application scenarios

19074654
folder	directory
that list files and folder in a directory

19074655
setinterval	settimeout
also use settimeout not setinterval see here

this function works fine but when each ajax call is done i need to colse and re-oper google-chrome in order to work works fine in firefox

19078919
qstring	qobject
you can just pass qstring through qprintable to the qobject tr

19078965
joptionpane	jdialog
the jdialog mentioned is created using joptionpane

19079010
width	height
transitions works when you change the width and height via different styling

19079010
width	height
but not by applying direct width height attributes to the dom element

19079011
mousemove	mousedown
it works when mousedown in svg area and mousemove outside of svg area in html area

19079012
typedef	struct
the first technique is to only expose the typedef struct s_result result letting the layout of the struct be defined in the .h

19079017
glfw	glew
i use glfw glew opengl 3.3

19079023
width	height
i use monotouch.dialog heavily customized and i used the tableview s stringsize method to get the size of a string height and width

19079024
put	get
if in the url i put the website.co.uk index.php aboutus i get the page although it s not got any of my formatting there

19079030
firefox	safari
use the replace option if you re going to reuse the utc variable such as new date utc as firefox and safari don t recognize a date with dashes

19079044
screens	tablet
my app works perfectly on normal screens and 10 inch tablet screens

19079051
couchbase	couchdb
it s an embedded nosql store for ios and android which is able to sync with couchdb and couchbase server

19079052
put	get
this is much easier to get working if you put the makefile in the parent directory

19079075
for-loop	loops
i d also note however that when you have an initialization a test and an increment operation of some sort you re almost certainly better off using a for-loop instead of a while loops

19079095
for-loop	arrays
i m using sdwebimages for async image downloading and a for-loop to run thru the arrays of urls

19079098
many-to-one	one-to-many
see some more explanation here jpa joincolumn vs mappedby and also here hibernate annotation one-to-many many-to-one

19079173
observer-pattern	mediator
i believe that combining observer-pattern publish subscribe logic along side with the mediator one can be a good solution to your problem

19079184
for-loop	arrays
i want it to run like a table but using a for-loop only not using an arrays

19079200
post	get
post request over get request

19079200
post	get
i can think of two scnarios where i have to use post request instead of get

19079200
post	get
i agree post request is designed to create update the resource where get request is designed

19079200
post	get
is it not always benefecial to use post request over get request except the two requirements i mentioned

19079202
opera	google-chrome
this doesn t directly answer your question but if possible i d suggest moving over to google-chrome beta and google-chrome stable once it gets getusermedia support rather than struggling with opera

19079208
qlist	qvector	qlist	qtextstream	qlist	qfile	qobject	qvector	qobject	qlist	qthread	qobject	qthread	qiodevice	qfile	qtextstream	qfile	qvector	qfile	qsettings	qiodevice	qfile	qtextstream	qiodevice	qtextstream	qvector	qtextstream	qsettings	qstring	qobject	qstring	qiodevice	qstring	qvector	qstring	qsettings	qstring	qlist	qstring	qtextstream	qstring	qfile
typically this tag can be seen together with tags like qstring qobject qt-signals qfile qiodevice qvector qlist qtextstream qthread qsettings et al

19079219
for-loop	arrays
just use a regular for-loop to iterate over all arrays at once

19079228
int	boolean
this is even expressed in the bytecode - there is the opcode baload - load byte or boolean from array but there is no opcode for loading a byte from local variable like there is iload for int

19079228
int	boolean	int	chars
similarily local chars and boolean variables actually are stored on the stack as an int and int -based opcodes are used to access them

19079228
int	chars
the entry 2.6.1 in jls also says that all local variables take either one or two slots on the stack so the single-slot types byte chars float and int all take the same space

19079283
int	double
you can cast the mmap result to int or double or whatever you like

19079292
post	get
i get values from a form using post method and add them to database

19079320
width	height
for elements the css rules for width and height set the actual size of the canvas element that will be drawn to the page

19079320
width	height
on the other hand the html attributes of width and height set the size of the coordinate system or grid that the canvas api will use

19079320
width	height
note if the css rules for width and or height aren t specified then the browser will use the html attributes to size the element such that 1 unit of these values equals 1px on the page

19079320
width	height
if these attributes aren t specified then they will default to a width of 300 and a height of 150

19079323
integer	fractions
when converted to integers the fractions part of the float is dropped meaning the float 10.5 will be converted to the integer 10 and the float -10.5 will be converted to the integer -10

19079348
oncreate	setcontentview
i have following method inside a actionbar.tablistener method and when i am calling the setcontentview i am expecting it to call oncreate method for that view

19079375
multiplying	add
the general idea is to multiplying ah by 10 then add to al

19079382
width	height
in the css declaration many other units are allowed too the em unit that lets you scale an image in proportion to font size useful for small images presented in text though you would normally then scale the height rather than width

19079394
hide	show
you need to create a hidden edittext and when textview long clicked hide the textview and show hidden edittext

19079394
hide	show
after finish editting hide the edittext and show the textview again

19079446
google-chrome	firefox
now i wish to selectively disable the plugin e.g plugin should be disabled for firefox but enabled for google-chrome

19079447
integer	fractions
when a finite value of floating type is converted to an integer type the fractions part is discarded the value is truncated toward zero

19079475
addition	multiplication
think of multiplication as repeated addition x y is adding y together x times

19079475
integer	fractions
so in this example you add y one time then x becomes 2 not 2.5 because integer division throws away the fractions

19079558
multiplying	add
for example to multiplying 14 x 21 we multiplying one digit at a time and shift left a place where needed so we add 1x14 + 2 x 14 shifted left one digit

19079596
width	height
changing the height or width attributes of the canvas tag will complete clear it remove anything drawn to it resetting it to a blank slate

19079596
width	height
for elements the height or width attributes have a unique relationship with the css properties of height and width which i describe here

19079596
width	height
changes to the height or width attributes will not be transitioned animated

19079596
width	height
changes to the css properities of height or width attributes will be transitioned animated

19079631
hash	md5
depending on how many files you have you could consider a subsequent step with larger hash such as md5 or sha1

19079658
mouseleave	mouseenter
i have the following function which toggles mouseenter and mouseleave on click

19079679
google-chrome	firefox
you re not using actual css flexbox in either firefox or google-chrome in that testcase

19079679
google-chrome	firefox
you re using xul boxes in firefox and a very old and buggy flexbox draft in google-chrome

19079712
multiplying	subtract
so here i am facing a problem.i have only 25 instructions in my instruction set. no multiplying divide subtract increment instruction

19079736
switching	screens
the point of such an architecture is because i have news with some text between which i want to be able to switching with paging effect but the news text can be bigger than the screens

19079737
google-chrome	firefox
it works with firefox and google-chrome

19079751
post	get
i get the values into jquery but don t find any possibility to send them via post to php

19079764
google-chrome	firefox
re-finding 6 times might take 10 ms on a fast computer and google-chrome firefox when searching by id but it could take 30 seconds when searching on ie7 by some complicated xpath expression or on a computer under heavy load or on a remote machine

19079795
width	height
to something like this to one a1 page width 84 1 cm and height 59 4

19079799
hash	salt
follow up question if the salt is always generated randomly i ve seen the same password use different hash so i don t think the salt is created from the text of the password itself then how would a rails app be able to reliably rehash the password on a login form submit and compare it to what s in the database

19079810
postgresql	mysql
in other databases - esspecially in mysql and postgresql - this can be done with simple select x y unfortunately oracle doesn t support this syntax and we must use select x y from dual

19079823
rss	feed
url is coming from a rss feed

19079823
rss	feed
you can see example here right now it working cause i manually input the id in the shortcode but from rss feed i get url but i cant get the id out of url through php to echo into shortcode

19079845
min	max
start title dpath i min max separate | shared

19079859
button	checkbox
i am trying to create a gui that has two spinboxes and two checkbox whose values will be printed when a user clicks a particular button start

19079861
integer	unsigned
if we get away from signed numbers for a second and just consider the value of a 4-byte unsigned integer that is 10 we get the value of 4294967285

19079861
integer	unsigned
to convert a unsigned integer to a two s complement signed integer we subtract the value of 2 32 from the integer if its over 2 31 - 1

19079863
hash	salt
for the follow-up question the salt is embedded in the stored value along with the type of hashing the number of bcrypt cycles to use and of course the hash itself and to authenticate the server needs to read the stored value then it simply re-uses the same salt to generate the hash part - if the input password is correct then the hash will be identical

19079863
hash	salt
a random salt is only created when generating a brand new hash for storing

19079863
hash	salt
the bcrypt password is easily split into components for a server to read i have chosen non-realistic characters to make it easier to see boundaries in fact salt and hash are base 64 encoded binary data

19079930
youtube	vimeo
but the streaming is bit slow like the buffer takes too long to play small size of video i have tested my internet speed and rather then my website other websites like youtube vimeo works perfectly fine

19079938
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your document_root .htaccess

19079950
portrait	landscape
one in an xml file in a portrait folder and the other in another xml file in the landscape folder

19079959
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
but what really bothers me is that when i display self.interfaceorientation it says landscape in the viewwillappear viewdidappear and viewwilllayoutsubviews

19079959
portrait	landscape
but the most weird is that the status bar is in landscape over the portrait viewcontroller

19080109
width	height
you are using 100 for width and height but the container of the page doesn t have an actual height

19080133
post	get
i am trying to get the name of the person who has posted the post but i don t understand how to get the name from the array

19080139
addition	multiplication
what i am looking for in particular is to acquire energy consumption measurements on a processor s individual cores after running some code like matrix multiplication or vector addition

19080141
min	max	range	max	range	min
the min and max function are used to clamp this parameter to the range 0..s so that the point lies between a and b

19080143
post	get
i also need to join two table post and thread because i only want to get category id number 3

19080148
min	max
you can either clear the pool after a connection is closed heavy and inefficient or you can set the min pool size and max pool size in your connection string by try and error to optimal values

19080148
min	max
it is good to start with min and max value 1 and test

19080177
fadein	fadeout
you could create the different heatmaps in different div s and then use jquery to fadein the new heatmap and fadeout the old heatmap at the same time

19080199
maven	pom.xml
when using maven your project s dependencies are well defined in pom.xml which is good for collaborative development as addition of dependencies doesn t require other developers to be informed as maven automatically handles dependencies itself by downloading dependencies

19080217
post	get
in fact a useful practice for post which have effects is to make the response to them be a redirect to a url which the browser will get for a page describing the results of the action for example if the post posted a comment it would then redirect to a link to the comment

19080219
int	chars
if you multiply chars with int than chars will be converted to ascii code and result will be int

19080235
maven	pom.xml
then maven will discover your plugin without further cahnges in pom.xml

19080248
min	max
i think my use of the min max macros may be wrong but i am not sure

19080256
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i ve got a uiviewcontroller that i would like to display over top of my uitabbarcontroller kind of like a custom uialertview

19080267
google-chrome	safari
when i ran this code on ipad safari google-chrome then i get null in the alert and then i get the alerts i have inside the ajax call

19080268
post	get
then post a question with a more specific problem when you run into trouble be sure to include relevant code and logcat errors if you get stuck

19080284
rss	feed
i m creating a mini search engine in java which basically grabs all of the rss feed that a user specifies and then allows him or her to choose a single word to search for

19080284
rss	feed
since the rss feed documents are fairly limited in number i m thinking about processing the documents first before the user enters his or her search term

19080296
width	height
however setattribute works for height and width

19080305
public	protected
both of those constructors are package protected and only the first one can possibly be used with a null argument through the public synchronizedlist and synchronizedset methods of collections

19080364
width	height
width height and id can be used as attributes or styles which is why they work in your second example

19080384
subtraction	multiplication	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
the arithmetic capabilities are limited too - there s no subtraction no multiplication or division no bitwise operations except not and rotation by one

19080427
post	get
i have keypress event at textbox and called a funstion of ajax post and i am able to get list for selection

19080445
decltype	auto
the upcoming decltype auto construct automatically computes the return type from an inlined function

19080461
folder	directory
the setting of the magento local module file should point to your extension inside the app code local folder and be of type recursive directory

19080492
hide	show
i m trying to make a jquery script to show and hide navigation and at the same time change class of another div

19080492
hide	show
on show it slides to the left and on hide it slides back

19080501
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
so bufferedreader and bufferedwriter would be your main weapons

19080502
printwriter	bufferedwriter
wrapped your bufferedwriter with printwriter and run

19080511
width	height
it should display edittext of specified height width and one reply button in notification area itself

19080533
children	parent
for example a parent with 1000 children will issue 1001 statements 1 delete for the parent and 1000 for the children

19080554
charindex	substr
it would take a lot of charindex patindex and substr commands wrapped in a case statement

19080580
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval

19080596
keydown	keyup
the keydown event may not get there in time to clear it from before so clearing it in keyup resolves this

19080602
outputstream	inputstream
you re not specifying a proper encoding for the transmission you should use inputstream outputstream instead of reader writer for this anyways since you re handling binary data and not text

19080634
folder	directory
i want to the uploaded file go to his folder but the files goes to uploads directory

19080647
superclass	subclassing
alternatively add a 0-argument constructor to your superclass and leave the subclassing constructor as it is

19080657
for-loop	arrays
you might want to use a regular for-loop for each arrays and match against each item in them

19080667
subtract	add
i will need to add subtract multiple divide first and second number so that it will produce -- first number + the operation + second number the answer

19080671
width	height
i have tried to divide the width and height of the image on 2 before calling the css-property with no luck

19080679
post	get
i have a blog and would like to get short text for the post title

width	height
offset width 2 height 2

19080715
centos	linux
i m on a 64-bit centos 5 linux

19080745
portrait	landscape
do not hard code width property as it will set same width for portrait and landscape modes - which is very unpleasing user experience

19080771
post	get
model the item list resource get - lists all items post - allows item creation items

19080772
octal	binary
octal 24 -hex 4b and give a binary answer

19081026
range	minimum
i need to find the minimum and maxinum price of products so that i can use it to set the range of my price filter

19081026
min	max
i also dont want to use setorder and then get the min and max price as it would affect the sort order of the collection

19081070
uilabel	nsstring
you basically have two options - update the text property of a uilabel or draw an nsstring directly onto a uiview after first erasing the previous value

19081101
google-chrome	safari
i m have 2 images on a page which is meant to be opened on a mobile browser such us google-chrome and safari

19081101
mp3	ogg
i have both versions ogg and mp3

19081148
symfony	fuelphp	codeigniter	fuelphp
symfony has fosrestbundle fuelphp has a rest controller out of the box and codeigniter has a rest server

19081174
octal	hex
we have the octal number 24 and the hex number 4b

19081174
octal	binary
every octal digit represents 3 binary digits

19081174
hex	binary
first tiny note you made a small mistake when converting 0x4b hex 4b into binary format

19081174
octal	binary
i sticked to 8 bit here except during octal - binary conversion

19081253
post	get
to that end i ll have to do something later on in order to get their first appearance in datomic for blog-standard post history

19081283
hide	show
also you can save yourself some typing by using hide and show instead of manually changing the css display property

19081308
width	height
the property- height and width is set as match parent

19081339
pop-up	dialog
when i load iframe from local computer the pop-up is showing text but the search dialog box is not showing

19081359
uitableview	uisearchbar
when i set navigationbar to translucent then the underlaying uitableview is correctly aligned to the active uisearchbar

19081360
post	put
instead of using a form backing object we want to do an http post or put of a user object as json data and have spring automatically convert that json to a user object on our behalf

19081360
getter	setter
imagine a user containing a company object with the appropriate getter setter

19081391
public	protected
netbeans will correct the package declaration and you can easily use autogenerate javadoc to get a navigable web archive listing all the classes and public protected methods

19081413
mvp	presenter
so far i always worked with mvp architectures where the view only has the ui elements and exposes them in public getters whereas the presenter registers click listeners on them

19081466
portrait	landscape
it follows that into an a1 landscape iso page 84.1 x 59.4 cm we can put disposed into two rows 4 a4 portrait pages for row

19081470
accessor	properties
the dynamically generated properties accessor are wrappers for calls to kvc-like methods that access the private storage

19081536
nsfilemanager	writetofile	writetofile	nsdata
instead of using nsfilemanager createfileatpath contents attributes use nsdata writetofile options error

19081574
udp	tcp
tcp gives you three features that udp does not a estimating sending rate b retransmission and c flow-control

19081574
udp	tcp
in doing so the tradefoff is that tcp becomes slower compared to udp

19081574
udp	tcp
there is yet another advantage that udp offers which tcp does not if you have an application that might use mulitcast

19081574
udp	tcp
so in summary udp will offer you two features that tcp cannot lower-delay and ability to do multicast

19081574
udp	tcp
so this way we can actually reduce the scope of the question and ask what are the features of tcp that one would like to add to udp since there is no way one can add features of udp to tcp

19081606
invariantculture	cultureinfo
since you didn t gave us any information about your cultureinfo here with invariantculture

19081609
listview	gridview
what you probably want is a listview with an embedded gridview which will display each item of information as a separate column - which lines up the data

19081628
rss	feed
in my codeacademy and codeschool lessons i ve been fetching data from google rss and simulated twitter feed

19081665
int	chars
you will you need to remember the chars at index 0 hint a chars not an int but you also need to start a count -- at 0 if you start looping right at the beginning of the string

19081749
express	node.js
i ve written a simple node.js socket.io express redis server

19081754

what i want is that when user click close button then modal popup is closed but the same time i want to get all selected checkbox values to save in string

19081783
justmock	typemock
if you really want to mock a readonlycollection the you will need to buy either typemock or justmock

19081792
imperative	declarative
xml s fewer token recognition comparisons means it s optimized for declarative transformation whereas more comparisons being like switch statement for speed reasons assume speculative branch prediction that imperative code in scripting languages is useful for

19081808
innodb	myisam
from what i can tell innodb and myisam use b-tree indexes while the memory storage engine allows you to specify b-tree or hash indexes

19081865
textview	imageview
likely the textview s width is being clamped by framelayout measuring only its immediate child dimensions namely that of the imageview

19081884
temp	tmp
note i run most of my stuff on linux for staging and production and mac for local dev - so using tmp as a temp dir for tests works for me in practice

19081894
versioning	upgrade
so the solution is to upgrade to a recent versioning of eclipse see eclipse downloads

19081918
post	get
check out the routing functionality in dnn7 i ve got a blog post for how to get signalr working

19081921
google-chrome	firefox
i did use css masks and it s especially interesting to see that using masks are very simple with google-chrome than firefox

19081921
google-chrome	firefox
the code will work at both firefox and google-chrome i didn t check for ie

19081990
vb.net	vb6
just started upgrading to vb.net from vb6

19082016
int	double
0.752 is a constant of type double while 27 is a constant of type int

traceroute	packets
i am building a win7 program in c# that acts as a packets sniffer that searches for a specific packets and upon receiving it performs traceroute on the packets source

19082076
chown	sudo	chown	chmod
i know that we set sudo chown hduser hadoop app hadoop tmp so user hduser is the file owner but i d like to know guidelines for the permissions bits chmod on these files

19082082
nsurl	nsdata
i am trying to convert nsdata to nsurl and i found this method on the internet

19082148
int	double
i also want to make sure that any numeric values are coerced to double int as they are read in as strings

19082182
children	parent
i assume that i need to assign the different levels of the hierarchical model page parent and item children to different userroles in order to filter them to the qml views but i m struggling to find any suitable examples of how to go about this

19082199
children	parent
in js and other functional languages functions are objects and can have parent children attributes and methods like in oo languages

19082212
daemons	systemd
so i can t use mod_wsgi in daemons mode on windows becuase it doesn t support fork like a unix systemd

19082230
getter	setter
note sometimes you could just use the getter or setter of the var but due to the issue i had with foreign keys i wasn t able to in this case

19082250
inherited	properties
removing that inherited and the dependency properties causes the template selector to fire fine

19082361
min	max
exactly you mixed up min max

19082361
min	max
you can and should for readability omit the if else because min max if used correctly make if else unnecessary here

19082412
erd	diagram
i have several erd diagram that i have been maintaining in visio for several versions

19082429

i m build project using markercluster everything work fine to show hide marker.

19097534
hide	show
for example i have 100 marker for all marker status show hide actually 60 are show and 40 hidden the cluster must be totally 60 but i get still cluster count 100

19097601
for-loop	arrays
using a temporary list and using move rather than a for-loop for moving the data improved the performance already quite a lot because it prevents the arrays from being copied twice when it has to grow once in setlength on the existing arrays and another time with move

19097605
n-gram	words
most descriptions you see concern themselves with individual words but it s simple enough to extend that to n-gram

19097627
hide	show
so basically the idea is when the datas are loading i want to show the loading view for that i hide the listview container by putting its visibility to gone if i put the visibility to invisible it keeps the size of the list in the view using gone is like removing it completely and thus the loading view can take all the screen and showing the the loading view by putting its visibility to visible

19097627
hide	show
and i show hide the loading view by calling this method

width	height
this is much more work a bit constrained because of the width and height lengths

19097843
width	height
what i do not understand is how to set a valid resolution to my image so that every time the user changes the zoom of the map the image width and height is adjusted to cover its real geographical area

19097843
width	height
assume i have an image 400x400 pixel which represents an area of 400x400 kilometers i need to recalculate the width and height of my image every time the zoom factor changes using a formula like this

19097845
hide	show
i m working with a form that is hosted in an external server the form is show in an iframe and on submit the server makes a call to my site saving a cookie to let me know the form has been submitted i need to know when the new cookie is created so i hide the form from view

19097856

as for converting a string a list of chars to an int erlang list_to_integer 1 does the job

19098179
int	double
the fact that traditionally not talking about special programs and frameworks people store approximations of irrational numbers in double or float or decimal variables which can only store a small subset of the rational-numbers set is nothing compared to the approximation of an irrational number by storing it in an int an array index

19098179

inline-functions	inlining
is it reasonable place the following code in inline-functions or it is too big for inlining

19098595
google-chrome	firefox
firefox will fill in default values if you use shorthands like background so while google-chrome reads

19098603
portrait	landscape
i find that when the app is first initializing it works correctly with the not and pulls the correct background whether the app is first initializing but then either rotating from there to landscape and portrait with the wrong app

19098603
portrait	landscape
i could make the conditionals more baroque but what i ve found is that uiinterfaceorientationisportrait returns one style of values when i call it from initializing code and another when called when the device is rotated between landscape and portrait

19098617
inline	inlining
it is not reasonable to put any code for inlining just because you want to replace the function body inline to the point of function call any modern day compiler will do so on its own

19098630
google-chrome	firefox
so for example i will get this for an address in google-chrome or firefox

19098666

currently you only set the width attribute. this will have the same result jquery will be able to accurately compute the height of the entire document whether the images are loaded or not

19098992
int	chars
int argc simply lists how many elements exist in chars argv

19099029
inline	inlining

19099608
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox seem to render all the bullets the same size regardless of font but ie for some reason doesn t

19099615

min	max
you can also use additional aggregate functions min max for other columns where you expect duplicates and you can even mix these up with case statements for more complex scenarios

19099832
jasmine	sinon
but in client side scope you need to guarantee that the code that use the respose of the rest api are good so you mockup your rest api for javascript i recomend jasmine or sinon

19099850
put	get
well you need use ajax to get preview and put the textbox

19099855

19100171
portrait	landscape
my scrollview scrolls when in portrait mode but not in landscape

19100210
client-side	server-side
if you don t have any way to access or change that server-side code you won t be able to do much and if it s in an iframe the difference in source protocol between the frame and your website will prevent you from using client-side responsive techniques to make the idx output responsive

19100216
keyup	mouseup
it could probably be improved by monitoring mouseup and keyup or selection events if they exist

19100291

i m pulling data from a blogger rss feed

19100331
titlebar	window
without a titlebar the user cannot drag the window

i would also recommend that if what you are trying to do is display content for the latest blog post from their website which will change as time goes on then you should be reading their rss feed found here

19100553
rss	feed
your first option might be to search for a wordpress rss widget for external websites alternatively if you want to be more customised about how you retrieve the rss then one way if your using .net is to use system.net.webclient and system.web.webrequest fetch and cache the result and then you can parse the feed using xmlreader syndicationfeed classes

put	get
you need to make sure you include empty values in that string when the corresponding header is missing from the request content-md5 is optional for put requests and meaningless for get requests - you should only include its value in the string you re signing if your request includes that header in the api call to s3

19101464
chunked	transfer-encoding
most likely i would suspect that content-length is actually missing and transfer-encoding is present and set to chunked

19101464
chunked	transfer-encoding
it can return no content-length if it was http 1.0 but it clearly says http 1.1 above so it should be returning transfer-encoding chunked and no content-length or a non-zero content-length if not chunking and returning a body

19105197
google-chrome	safari
this means that with 1000px of visible space and a 17px scroll bar other browsers would report 1017px as a width so far as media query is concerned but webkit browsers such as google-chrome and safari did not do this

asterisk freeswitch etc

19105524

19107901
getter	setter
answer was there a long time from mccainz in the comments added benefit ignoring ie8 and browsers that haven t been updated for years is that you can specify enumerable writable and configurable on instance members and you can create getter and setter that work like an assignment instance.someprop 22 can actually be instance.someprop 22

19107901
getter	setter
arguments are that when using these patterns your code looks just as ugly or even worse than using the new keyword but this would be a personal preference and would not take away the benefit from creating getter and setter or having extra control enumerable writable and configurable

implements	extends
a singleton can extends classes and implements interfaces while a static class cannot it can extends classes but it does not inherit their instance members

19109034
getter	setter
also having getter and setter for static variables makes no sense as they are class variables

19109034
getter	setter
so a better option would be have a singleton class and have the getter and setter methods of the state variable

you have to set width height of your object

19109182
margin	height
then error will disappear because bottom constraint would preserve the height of the mass and next top constraint would shrink the object s height not invading the bottom margin

19109544
superclass	subclassing
the obvious case is that your object would not be resized or updated to reflect any difference in member layout which means that when you message the object and it accesses members present in the subclassing but not the superclass your method s implementation would read or write to invalid memory that s undefined behavior

since you are specifying the width it is respecting your request of a given width but appears to retain the normal height

the d designwidth and d designheight are different than just a height width declaration where height width are applied as actual size

this just seems more like navigating a file system than the previous method - but i don t know if its restfull at all perhaps this is what rest was trying to get rid of because in order to access a comments resource i need to know which user and which post it belongs to

to answer your second question about what functions could be used for point 3 for something not using vba you might consider the vlookup as well as countif as good functions to keep in mind

csv	tsv
however on ubuntu when trying upload 2 files at a time one is tsv the other is csv i can only upload one file at a time but not two

19123714
csv	tsv
the code below won t work if i upload both tsv and csv but it works with other file types

19123761
cos	sin
you need to use std sin and std cos in place of sin and cos so that you will obtain the properly overloaded versions

19123761
cos	sin
so in the case where the c library functions were in the global namespace you would be getting the version of cos and sin that only takes double which is consistent with the behavior we are seeing

19123765
google-chrome	firefox
but here is what we ve concluded the website works fine in google-chrome and firefox on all systems

width	height
here is a way to center content both vertically and horizontally in any situation which is useful when you do not know the width or height or both

19125010
width	height
note that the width and height values are just for demonstration here you can change them to anything you want or remove them entirely and it will still work because the vertical centering here is a product of the way the table-cell display property works

int	chars
you can compress string in webworker to not put unnecessary load on primary thread - there are libraries for strings compression even lzma as far as i know localstorage allows to allocate up to 20mb in modern browsers per page and 200 mb in ie shared through all sites - additional compression - you can build map of ids and classes if there is less than 255 ids and classes and save them as one chars using string.fromcharcode int and save as one big string in localstorage then to decode - inputstr pos .charcodeat 0 for every pair to convert to usable object at page startup

min	max	width	height
the specified width and height and min max properties on this element determine the border box of the element

19125332
width	height
that is any padding or border specified on the element is laid out and drawn inside this specified width and height

19125332
width	height
the content width and height are calculated by subtracting the border and padding widths of the respective sides from the specified width and height properties

19125332

this is the behavior of width and height as specified by css2.1

then you need a function boolean updateexponents result max that iterates through increasing sequences of int between 0 and max

so far an .mbtile file downloaded using tilemill worked great or rather one of their demo proj because internet access is sometimes a big problem for me for that same reason it sounded great when a friend of mine told me he wrote a python script to create an .mbtiles file from a tiles .png folder with the exact .mbtiles format

19126689
post	get
so if you re calling a factory to handle dishing out generic post get calls then right before the call you can call a function on rootscope such as rootscope.startloading and when it finishes call rootscope.doneloading where each of these methods broadcast an event for you to pick up on your directive

19126689
hide	show
then you just handle on your directive to catch the events scope. on startloading func ... and have it insert show a loading div template into the dom and run then also have a catch for done loading to remove hide it

19126740
post	get
the get request keeps getting called after a successful post ...so the template associated with get is getting rendered instead of the one associate with post

19126743
jar	war
now here s my question - how do i create two war files - 1 with the jar file that the customer provided me and 1 without

19126743
jar	war
i started looking into feature toggling - but feature toggling would require me to deliver the proprietary jar file to other customers because the code won t compile since there is still a dependency and i would only have 1 war file

19126757
hide	show
what i would like to achieve to hide show the answer when clicking to the question or in other words hiding showing the content when clicking the title

19126769
int	chars
etc. and you probably want to declare userinp as a chars rather than an int

19126769
cout	cin
use with cin and use with cout

19126799
sudo	passwd
the other thing is perhaps it s hanging on sudo itself waiting for a passwd

19126812

u expect userinp to be a chars but u have declared as int

19126821
curlpp	libcurl
so i know that visual studio is looking in the right place as it is inside the libcurl header file but what it seems like to me is when it adds the header curlpp.hpp it is trying to reference libcurl curl.h which does not exist within the folder curlpp i have confirmed this by looking for it just wondering if someone could help me with this the only thing i have in my code is this

children	parent
from my understanding i am running into problems because i want to first set the children equal to their parent and then change them as necessary

19126915
children	parent
my project is to model a graph search and my problem is with the parent and children

19126915

this indeed happens as i am using a print line to print out the four boolean values for the parent and the four children

19126969
int	double
the pow function operates on double not int

19126969

in general but not always when you convert double to int you call round

how do i build an array of integers inside the for next loop so i can find max and min and last

19126996
int	chars
my best shot is saving a string of 104 chars 52 zero-padded int but that s far from optimal

19126998
distance	polygons
there is a related question calculating the distance between polygons and point in r but i want to find the distance between a line object and a point not polygons point point point

19127020
int	double
pow returns double and so if the result is not exactly 100 but slightly less than it will truncate when converting to an int and you will receive the 99 result you are seeing

19127080
int	double
and the method method operates on x and makes some operation which is compatible for both types int and double

19127091
slidy	slidify
assuming you re using something like slidify of slidy to obtain your html slides you could try this workaround that did surprisingly well for me

post	get
i get the following json back in response to the post

19127305
portrait	landscape
i wasn t sure if there was a better way seeing as how those methods are called every time you change between portrait and landscape

19127320
width	height
that way it will always keep it within container s width and height

19127396
move	drag
the drag function allows you to set up callbacks for the events of start dragging end dragging and move while dragging

19127455
jtextfield	jlabel
for the sake of discussion you could avoid having those panels using an extra initial row with an invisible component with and then having 2 columns one for the jlabel s and the other one for the jtextfield s with the apropiate anchor s

19127488
folder	directory
in case you want to push the folder once in a while you will have to use the --force switch to add anything beneath that directory

qlist	qvector
but i think you should use qvector instead of qlist if you don t need to insert items at arbitrary positions and remove arbitrary items from lists

19127659
teamcity	dotcover	nunit	mstest	ndepend	dotcover
i ve chosen to use it on my most recent projects because you just use the nunit or mstest test runner of your choice which means instant integration with tools such as resharper teamcity dotcover ndepend and of course the integrated test runner in vs2012 and later

19127663
versioning	upgrade
you ll have to upgrade your openssl versioning that supports what go s tls package already implemented

19127667
children	parent
my guess is that they want to save memory since logically a parent recursive method is staying dumb as long as its children recursive method is running and doesn t return anything yet

19127692
stateless	stateful
sharing stateless or stateful code across controllers â use angular

19127702
dictionary	map
in simpler terms i have a multi-level dictionary and a list of strings that map to hierarchies in that dictionary

execvp	fork
the idea is that i prompt for input like a shell and read the entered line arguments as well and then i will call execvp using a fork to execute the command entered from standard input

19127765
put	get
when i try to put a delay inside a timeout loop all of the calls get executed immediately

19127795

works fine in google-chrome and firefox but in ie10 the animation can trigger only once when it s on a before or after pseudo-element

19127975
glfw	freeglut	glut	glfw
the solution is to use something like glfw glut freeglut or similar.

19127975
glfw	glew
i particularly prefer glfw + glew

19128013
firefox	safari
i am having problems displaying utf-8 string in safari and firefox for sending flash messages in rails via x-message headers for ajax requests like this

19128013

in google-chrome it still works but in safari and firefox the flash message is no longer displayed properly

19128013
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
a message like this æš æ³ é é â æ ä½ çš ä½ é å š will show up in google-chrome fine but in safari and firefox would show up like ã ã ã â³â ã ã â ã ã â ã â½â ã ã â½ã â ã â

ubuntu	linux
the tutorial for getting started with facebook apps with android has the instructions to install the sdk for windows and for osx but not for any linux distribution i use ubuntu and already downloaded the sdk but i don t know how to install it

19128271
ubuntu	linux
if you are using an emulator then following the part for osx should work the same on ubuntu since osx is similar in many ways to linux systems

19128324
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
when you use .ajax it returns a special kind of promise which is the jqxhr object but when you call then on the jqxhr it returns a promise object which will not have methods associated with jqxhr - in your case this promise is the value assigned to the xmlhttprequest variable because of chaining

19128325
post	get
how to get a list of member post to display in this new tab

when an option is clicked in a grouping of options i would like to grey out options in the other grouping of options that no longer apply due to the clicked option being chosen to filtering the options

19128405
google-chrome	firefox
if all you want is to embed some html into your firefox browser it might be possible to develop an addon for firefox or a google-chrome extension

19128405
google-chrome	firefox
for example what you are asking is not necessarily to do with c++ itself but the browsers you mentioned firefox google-chrome

19128408
webkit	blink
this looks to be a webkit blink bug because of the transition applied to the image blur filter

19128529
folder	directory
as there is also a vendors folder at the top level of our directory

19128545
cos	sin
it looks like you re putting everything inside the cos and the sin

19128595
multiplying	addition
so if i had two 8 bit numbers in this system and i needed to multiplying them cleanly and the best the instruction set had to offer was a 4 or 8 bit input multiplying operation that had an 8 bit out result and the addition was 8 bits in and 8 bits out

19128595
multiplying	add	multiplying	addition
then split up the addition into columns your add operation can digest...this scales up forever any size numbers you want operated on by any size multiplying and add your processor supports

19128595
multiplying	add
a b c d are bits now and 1011 is a four bit number in binary each digit can only be a 1 or a 0 so 0 times anything is zero 1 times anything is itself so multiplying one number against another when you dont have a multiplying operation simply means for every non-zero bit in one operand you shift the other operand by that amount and add it to your accumulated result

19128607
children	parent
from what i googled and read on so i found out as a solution to use an anchor view centerhorizontal in the parent view and place the 2 children one above and one below that anchor view but it doesn t seems to work

19128628
ng-view	ng-controller
i have an angular page that has an ng-controller directive and an ng-view directive

19128630
ubuntu	linux
so i ve been using ubuntu linux for a few months and loved it for my web dev

19128640
viewdidload	viewdidappear
between viewdidload and viewdidappear there are a number of things going on

19128682
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly without any issues on google-chrome develop s tools and firefox s firebug

19128683
for-loop	loops
a for-loop is a construct that is extremely similar to a while loops except that it provides some extra niceties that reduce boilerplate code

19128683
for-loop	loops
the while loops has all the same features as the for-loop but without the syntactic sugar

19128728
spaces	delimiter
change delimiter to spaces and insert commas manually

19128729
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
if you definitely want the exception to pop up outside that callback you ll have to wrap it into an unchecked-exception one derived from runtimeexception

19128736
for-loop	loops
however a while loops is not exactly like a for-loop since the continue statement and how it behaves is a concern

19128736
post	put
so you would have an init statement before the loop statement then the loop statement itself containing the condition and as the last line in the loop before the closing curly brace you would put the post loop condition i++

19128736
for-loop	loops
in both the for-loop and the while loops the condition is evaluated and if the expression is not true then loops body is not executed at all it is skipped

19128736
for-loop	loops
in the case of a for-loop defining the variable i within the for statement causes the scope of the variable i its visibility to be restricted to the for-loop body which would not be the case for the other types of loops

19128736
for-loop	loops
with this change the for-loop will continue incrementing the variable i because it s post the third part of the for statement is executed at the end of loops

19128742
getter	setter
however another way to solve that issue would be a setter getter routine but i have read somewhere on the web that accessing varialbe via assignments is much faster than via a getter routine

19128751
voip	rtp
i am not talking about voip standard like rtp etc but the mechanism to communicate over internet using private ip addresses

19128751
whatsapp	skype
i would like to know if messengers like gtalk yahoo skype and many of the android applications like viber kakoa talk whatsapp etc use any specific standard for this

19128755
uilabel	uitextview
text-related uikit classes in ios 7 - namely uitextview uitextfield and uilabel - are based on the text kit layout engine

19128812
windows	wow64
if you re using a 32-bit vim both bram s installer and the vim without cream installer often recommended are 32-bit on a 64-bit windows then you ve fallen victim to the wow64 redirection in windows

19128837
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your versioning of rpy2

19128854
hide	show
you could place it there and not display it and then show hide it when you deem fit

19128876
solaris	sunos	unix	sunos	unix	solaris	ubuntu	linux
awk is out of the question because in testing on different machines with different unix linux os s rhel sunos solaris ubuntu etc. it gives sometimes wildly different results on each

19128933
firefox	safari
this script produces the expected results in safari but not firefox

19128933
firefox	safari
and why does it occur in firefox and not safari

19128948
ubuntu	linux
using linux ubuntu with gcc

ienumerable	iqueryable
asqueryable converts ienumerable to iqueryable

19128966
ienumerable	iqueryable
converts ienumerable to iqueryable

most often however traffic classification is done by routers which set the dscp after classifying by layer 3 tcp or udp port number among other things

19129002
inherited	properties
otherwise both objects inherited from viewresultbase and seem to inherited all other properties and methods from the base class

19129003
folder	directory
the move s command moves all files in directory d including any in sub folder up one level

19129005
dataframe	multi-index
and i found myself that i have a problem in creating panel or multi-index dataframe at pandas

19129025
min	max
the servo has two logical end points call them max and min which are set in software and can be changed at any time and the shaft must rotate travel on one arc between the max and min positions

19129025
min	max
for example in the picture the blue arc is valid but the red is not for all travel between and including min and max

19129025
min	max
i am trying to work out a simple algorithm using only integer math that can tell me the distance between any two points a and b that can be anywhere on the circumference bounded by min and max and with either a as the current place and b is the target position or b is the current place and a is the target which is denoted by a negative distance from b to a

19129034
min	max
i have two labeled edit boxes - one for a min value named lblerangecalcmin and the other for a max value lblerangecalcmax

19129034
min	max	range	max	range	min
i want to make sure that the user does not enter a zero for the max value and also that the min value is less than the max value not equal to but less than - i need the range of values max - min

19129059
width	height
i just want to read some properties such as pixel height and width

19129065
mp3	ogg
preloading audio and playing them with the standard method using mp3 or ogg formats

19129088
hash	salt
i feel like this doesn t use much cpu - it s just two iterations of bcrypt and i ve suggestions for 10+ iterations in other security discussions - but let s say bcrypt has discovered to be fully reversible if you knew the salt and the hash one unhashing would now necessitate unhashing it twice - once with salta then with saltb and once vice versa giving you two candidate passwords one of which is a decoy with a 50 false positive rate that is it rehashes to the correct hash because it s first bit is correctly even or odd requiring heuristics or human eyes to correctly identify the real one so you ve at least doubled the computing resources needed and possibly required human intervention

19129088
hash	salt
also the inclusion of the input again as a salt in subsequent hash makes it impossible to actually do the unhashing plus it requires the attacker to hold onto a little extra memory

19129123
daemons	systemd
then again the reason i m considering this is because we have other python daemons in our systemd and those daemons already use rsyslog

19129133
public	protected
slots are just functions and thus may be public private or protected

19129133
public	protected
the words public private protected have no use with working with the signal keyword

19129151
switching	screens
i am aware of the different methods for switching back and forth between android screens

19129165
post	put
instead put post where responses was

19129178

serializable	deserialization
i want to define my own serializable and deserialize methods for student class so i extended typeadapter and override its methods but now deserialization does not work

19129234
int	double
i have tried casting the variables to a double or int and it doesn t seem to help

19129266
ceil	floor
the ceil and floor functions work on double types

19129301
int	double
first an int division happens between a and b so 63 62 becomes 1 and then 1 is casted to double to become 1.0 and then ceil 1.0 is of course just 1.0

19129329
int	chars
this implementation only allows integral types to be used as fields all flavors of shorts int longs bool chars

19129344
folder	directory
i m trying to create an android application that reads a text file of numbers from the assets folder then copies those numbers to an array doubles the value of each number and writes the new set of doubled numbers to the apps external files directory

19129382
for-loop	loops
i know i can use a for-loop and a nested loops to iterate all matches to find the same two elements

19129393
rss	feed
so i m going to write a rss scrapper in bash using xmlstarlet as its xml parser and wget as its rss downloader i done the wget part so no question on it but i got a question on parsing each item in a feed with it and save it with the format channel etc i had done storing it in echo -e format i mean displaying it as stdout now i d like to parse each item in a feed with xmlstarlet and save it with the format channel etc in short i m going to do something similar to this in c#

19129416
int	chars
if they enter a chars the program should ask them to enter an int and ask for input again

19129464
portrait	landscape
there s usually no need to add a ipad at the end because you can only choose landscape or portrait loading images for the ipad

19129489
express	node.js
and i m using this call to render the jade template in express node.js

19129531
ssl	https
i have a website hosted on amazon elasticbeanstalk and now i need to configure it for https and ssl

19129540
uitableview	uisearchbar
i m using uisearchbar as header of uitableview

19129562
post	get
is it because create makes a post instead of a get

19129566
typedef	struct
but it also describes the slot and in the core types_c.h file there is no typedef struct for that.

19129619
min	max
in the example i used above i had a min max and avg temp per city and wanted to grab only the avg temperatures

19129619
min	max
i added filters excluding column headers with strings that included max or min like so

19129619
min	max
i don t necessarily know what the full column name is but in my use case the different variables are always tagged with max min or avg which makes this a workable solution for me but probably not for someone with totally unknown column headers

19129644
mouseover	mouseout
what i m looking for is to pixelate an image on mouseover then refocus un-pixelate it on mouseout

19129700

ready	each
use a grunt node server to develop and test in so you don t have to rebuild each time and then grunt build to the linked ngapp dist folder when you are ready to push to your remote server

19129792
subscript	superscript
if you are rending your output to a web page then you can embed the html mark-up sub subscript text sub and sup superscript text sup into the text directly

19129799
width	height
transparent lines are added in ios 7 when the width or height is a number with floating point

19129881
accelerometer	gyroscope
which is odd because i don t use any accelerometer gyroscope compass data

19129906
superclass	subclassing
why subclassing overridden method cannot throw more exceptions than that of superclass method

19129913
min	max
you can divide total value by total count to get an average and you can easily use min and max functions

19129928
post	get
and use php scripts along with post get methods to send data from device to server

19129946
profiling	debugging	profiling	instrumentation
apple has realized that there is too much information in the instrumentation profiling and that is why in xcode5 it has distilled the important information into xcode directly when running your app click on the 6th icon debugging navigator in the navigator left column of xcode

3.- check if your ajax jquery code is post or get default get

19130458
express	node.js
first its not a bad idea to use node.js to satisfy your requirement the uniqueness of node and added advantage compared to conventional technologies like apache-php is clearly explained in this following video why node.js is better .the notion of node being just used for advanced or complex applications is wrong you can use node for building applications which are very simple to anything of huge proportion.it would be a not so comfortable task for a node beginner to code without using any frameworks but by using this web application framework called express you need not code from scratch and its very easy to setup html pages using its simplified html templating language called jade and route requests also you can even use your html pages if you are not willing to use jade for rendering the views of your application .here are the series of tutorials which would help you tutorials on beginning with node.js basics of expressjs

19147897
for-loop	arrays
the reason you re getting 31 copies is because you re running through the for-loop wiping the writeitem arrays clean each time adding to it and printing it out while still in the for-loop which then repeats 30 more times until i hits 32

vb6	vba
in vb6 vba the closest you get is a collection

19148804
vb6	vba
add a new class module to your vb6 vba project

19148804
vb6	vba
so in order to call the getter for that hidden property we need to surround it with square brackets because an identifier can t legally start with an underscore in vb6 vba

19148804
vb6	vba
the vb6 vba collection doesn t allow directly writing values into its items

19148804
accessor	properties
we can implement a write-enabled list by providing setters for the item properties - because we don t know if our t will be a value or a reference object we ll provide both let and set accessor

vb6	vba
let s just cram these two interfaces into one and call it icomparable - yes you can write and implement interfaces in vb6 vba

19148804

19148862
post	get
with these changes you should get something like this obtained with get_tag_counts over the file you linked in your post in a 1000x1000 window maxsize 260 and capping to the first 50 tags

19148879
fgets	strcmp

19165445
width	height
this is setting your width variable to a constant value of 1 whilst the height variable relies on the height and width of the rectangle that you are passing in which is then being used to calculate the offsets

19165445
width	height
in my experience this can cause the problems you have stated first try stepping through this function in the debugger to analyse the values that the width and height variables hold or try changing

19165469
hide	show
in ios 7 since the keyboard is translucent i was able to accomplish this effect by adding a colored subview behind the keyboard that show and hide with keyboard notifications

multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	add
therefore you have to think about all of the individual add multiplying operations that go into a matrix multiplication and think about how to write a state machine that can perform each one of these operations while keeping track of all the intermediate products

19165490
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	addition	addition	multiplication
even a 4x4 matrix multiplying needs over a hundred addition multiplication operations and you re going to have to describe a processor that is aware of and can keep track of all of these

19165490
multiplying	add
if you want to attempt it start by deciding how many parallel multipliers and adders you can afford to instantiate and then start thinking about how to write a state machine that can keep track of all the individual add multiplying operations and then how to farm out all those operations in parallel to all of the multipliers and adders you have available in as few clock cycles as possible

19165491
scrypt	md5
and as neil mcguigan said in answer above try not to use md5 or single-pass sha - it s better to use bcrypt or scrypt for reasons stated here

19165560
filesystems	ntfs
here is a quickfix assuming your filesystems is ntfs

19165606
width	height
that image will have a fixed height of 100 the body and now the width of the image scales with respect to the ratio

19165606
width	height
so the width of the image is 130 height of the body

19165606
width	height
because we need the image to take the space and we create another absolute div that will hold the actual content that will be right above the image 100 width and 100 height of the common container

19165606
width	height
that works perfectly when you first initiate the page but when you resize the page the browser doesn t always measure the right width and height again so you ll need to refresh to make that happened

19165746
google-chrome	firefox
if you are able to enforce browser usage i find that google-chrome on android preserves line breaks when copying and pasting much better than firefox

19165746
google-chrome	firefox
copying from firefox consistently ignored line breaks but google-chrome copied them without issue

19165747
folder	directory
so i created a few static files in my static directory and then when i ran collectstatic the cli showed the admin static files being moved to the static root folder along with my other static files

19166832
public	protected
saying a variable is public private protected or static simply doesn t make sense in the context of a local variable that will go out of scope and be garbage collected once the method exits

19166840
put	get
i would like it to put the headers there but can t seem to figure out how to get it working

19166872
public	protected
a private protected or public modifier affects the visibility of global variables to objects of other classes so using those modifiers for local variables is non-sensical

19166879
google-chrome	safari
it works fine in safari and google-chrome

19166880
stdout	stderr
the former actually throws on error and supposedly supplies access to the stdout and stderr of the command through e on failure the latter just kills the entire build process for me

19167497
superclass	subclassing
the subclassing method has to be compatible with the behavior of the superclass method

19167497
superclass	subclassing
more exactly you have to be able to substitute objects of the subclassing for objects of the superclass without breaking anything where adding a new checked exception to the throws clause would mean things calling it would have to change their code to handle it

19167497
superclass	subclassing
there are examples in the jdk such as in java.io where the subclassing can t possibly throw an exception declared by the superclass see the bytearrayoutputstream close method

because when i have it in portrait mode the numbers is like this photo and in landscape mode it gives this numbers

19185965
put	get
seeing your code actually i think the array contains only one item that is why you get that out put array push is not required just correct your logic

19185972
width	height
first the size in kbs doesn t mean it will not make the app crash because of the way android handle images internally in the heap the file will take the memory of width height 4bytes a file of 1kb size with huge dimensions could easily become several mbs in order to download and handle big size files you should stick to the android best practices shown in the documentation they provide a mechanism to check imagebounds without loading it and once calculated load the proper image size that fits whatever area you want

19185995
int	boolean
you seem to be assuming that boolean false will evaluate to an int 0

19186185

you can create a directory on your phone and inside that directory you should add all the files you want to deploy relative to the phone root directory so like create an applications folder to deploy those files to application

19186216

19186237
width	height
but how to know the width + height of dialogbox dynamically is another question

19186286

19186362
post	get
the op of that question wrote a nice blog post describing the exact procedure that he went through to get this to work

19186523
ubuntu	linux
i try to use an sh script to start my application under linux ubuntu

19186594
children	parent
it looks like you have navbarbox set to wrap content height and navbardirection height to match parent which means it won t try and calculate how high it should be and just match it s parent which starts at 0 and increases as it s children does so it stays at 0

19186597
for-loop	loops
notice that not all scheme interpreters provide a for-loop most will provide a do loops but i don t think that s the point of the exercise

19186624
int	chars
so the program should return 18 as a chars type then the next line should return 18 as type int

19186662

19191408
int	double
if int and are the same size and double and are the same size and all these types are passed using the same argument-passing convention then this will most likely print the value of the pointer object a as if it were an int and the value of the pointer object b as if it were a double object

19191439
getter	setter
the user domain object is annotated as follows omitting getter setter that are just simple properties

19191496
children	parent
and if you don t like child viewmodels you can put everything inside a single viewmodel and have some datatriggers or something to dynamically change views however a parent - children viewmodel approach is much cleaner imo

19191507
memcached	apc
if your app can get the data it needs from memcached or apc or similar cache then some of your page requests may not need to touch the database at all

19191730
post	get
i saw some post using exec but i don t have any experience with it and i always seem to read about how it can get you into trouble

19191748
getter	setter
what that means is that it tries to construct getter and setter method names from the values that you re trying to hydrate and the way it does that is by calling ucfirst on the field name and prepending get set to that

19191748
getter	setter
d just have weird getter and setter names like getcat_name please don t do this

19191767
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari

19191859
serializable	deserialization
how i can implement faster objects serializable deserialization

19191863
width	height
notice that all these 4 coordinates are inclusive bounds meaning the row column of pixels they represent does contain at least one non-transparent pixel so if you should calculate width and height of your new bounds do it like this

19191863
width	height
by the way for an entirely transparent image all 4 coordinates should be 0 as a result width and height will both be 1 - i guess this is not a problem for you

19191874
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox 17 and google-chrome 30

19191880
x86	64bit
which is what i expected for 32 bit x86 should be similar but twice as many movb-like ops for 64bit

19191938
grouplayout	miglayout
you could also use grouplayout which i like better but which is harder for some to wrap their heads around...but if you re not opposed to adding a 3rd party library i m using miglayout for most everything these days

19191946
post	get
based on what you have said in your original post to get to the properties in your second class you would call them like this

width	height
set the content and background to fill the wrapper using a position of absolute and width height set to 100

19192334
width	margin
to achieve centering at the same time you set left 50 a fixed width for the element and negative half of that width as the left margin

19192353
apache	nginx
in my case i m substituting apache for nginx but it s otherwise the same setup you re describing

19192382
ready	each
i would like take the coordinate set of each layer and put the coordinates inside to make it ready to be used in a javascript array

19192385
hide	show
if you don t want to do this at the server level and have to use media queries then the best option would be to use classes for varying content blocks that are mobile desktop only and hide show them based on the media queries

19192386
pull	push
my vcs route is set to pull from the master branch and to push to a healthy branch however nothing is pushed up

19192425
submit	submission
if the version of your app that is ready for sale has a legal issue you must submit an update for the app and indicate the legal issue during submission

19192435
for-loop	loops
you are using count arr -1 inside the for-loop and it gets re-evaluated every iteration so after you unset the first three times i is 3 but count arr -1 is 1 and you exit loops

19192440
nerdtree	netrw
vim already comes with a file explorer that does a lot more than nerdtree called netrw

19192441
int	chars
sprite unsigned chars const spaceptrin unsigned int xinit unsigned int yinit

19192441
getter	setter
the overhead of doing this is likely to be very low so the fact you are doing it on an arduino shouldn t deter you likewise with getter setter functions as the compiler will most likely optimize them away

19192442
inherited	properties
in the example i have two directives - one that tries to pull in a properties via isolate scope and one that just inherited the parent scope

19192446
openbsd	linux
i am on a openbsd system and i am assuming that linux has the same thing

19192456
google-chrome	firefox
the current code works fine in google-chrome but firefox will stop the execution

19192464
screens	tablet
i generally agree with how bootstrap does it - one for large devices one for medium one for large mobile devices like tablet and one final fluid-width one for mobile phone devices as phone screens resolutions and screens sizes vary all over the place

19192507
versioning	upgrade
it replaces iteritems so if you later upgrade python versioning you ll end up changing the loop back to the way it was

19192550
calloc	malloc
and then you assume the last element in the array is null but you never set it so you either do at the end of words or you do calloc instead of malloc

19192560
put	get
i want a select statement that will go through and get the value from state and say ok it s az put it into a table called az and then in the next one it s ca put it into ca and then the next one may be az so add it to the table az it already created

19192656
subshell	ifs
i think the safest way to restore ifs is to set it in a subshell

19192678
int	chars
all chars correspond to an int value based on ascii so you can do something like this

19192679
mouseover	mouseout
what i need is to add a layer on mouseover event and remove it on mouseout

19192684
sorting	filtering
by default the telerik grid will take the entire collection and do the sorting and filtering client-side

int	chars
is a chars either 1 or 0 which as you have it is equal to 48 and 49 as int

19192745
foldable	traversable
where foldable gives you the ability to go through the structure processing the elements but throwing away the shape traversable allows you to do that whilst preserving the shape and putting new values in.

19192745
foldable	traversable
one of the key facts about any traversable or actually about foldable which traversable extends is that it requires that the elements of any structure have a linear orderâ you can turn any traversable into a list of its elements with foldable.tolist

19192759
addition	multiplication
you shouldn t need anything other than plain multiplication and addition if you have 8-bit input data and 32-bit arithmetic

19192759
int	chars
a quick visit to wikipedia tells me that q7 is essentially an 8-bit 2 s complement int so if the target platform uses 2 s complement then simply describing the byte received as signed chars will give it the correct numerical value when promoted to an int

19192759
integer	fractions
both the integer part and fractions part are in the same 32-bit int during the sum calculation

19192789
typedef	struct
that has almost the same effect as a normal enum and typedef but explicitly dictates the integer type which is really helpful if you ever want to pack these things off somewhere be precise in your struct alignment amongst other uses

19192794
spaces	delimiter
or you can specify an optional delimiter it is a spaces by default but you could use any string characters

19192807
width	height
the image width x height is 3744 x 2104

19192807
width	height
i expected a matrix of width x height i mentioned

19192813
for-loop	loops
but you ve also used it as loops index inside the for-loop

19192831
pull	push
im trying with pull and push and no getting luck

19192883
canopy	qtconsole
also note that the python shell panel in the canopy gui application itself runs ipython qtconsole in pylab mode by default probably the easiest way to run pylab alongside an editor that is linked to that pylab session

19192892
width	height
i am trying to figure out how to re-size an image so that it keeps it ratio of width to height but gets re-sized until the height of the image matches the height of the containing div

19192892
width	height
i have these images that are pretty large and long screenshots and i want to put them into a 200px width 180px height div for display and without re-sizing the images manually

19192923
width	height
i am trying to do this because i can t change the html structure the .more-info div has to fill the #provider-menu box which has a predefined width and height but if i set it to absolute top left right bottom it goes to top and you have to scroll to see what s there

19192937
sin	sqrt	cos	sqrt	cos	sin
i found that many basic functions including sqrt sin cos tan atan and measuring the time do not work at all

19192971
pull	push
remove from your code push and pull that you used

19192977
post	get
depending on what you are trying to accomplish you might get away with having a different page to render a list of post with that category

19192984
decimal	ieee
according to ieee specs the mantiassa will have 52 bit and the bis before the decimal point is omitted but will always be 1

19192984
integer	fractions
therefore one solution would be multiplying the fractions part by 2 53 and rounding it to an integer

19192986
yslow	pagespeed
i think the biggest advantage still --after the implementation of network panel timeline functionality-- is the availability of various firebug extensions like for example yslow pagespeed firepython and so on

19192989
websphere	ibm
create a server.env file in the c program files ibm websphere liberty etc directory and add the following

19192990
width	height
the width and height are necessary in this case because you have the images absolutely positioned

19192990
width	height
if you didn t have the width and height everything would kind of fall in on itself

19192993
ubuntu	linux
today i tried it on linux mesa3d opengl 2.1 ubuntu 12.04lts it works fine but there are some dark lines surrounding the animation

19193007
hash	salt
you want to include a random salt with each password to make it impossible to precalculate the hash so even the same password would have a different hash for each user otherwise an attacker might find out which of the users use the same passwords and use it to their advantage

19193024
hide	show
i use jquery slide toggle to show hide a div when a bttn clicked

19193054

19193106
coalesce	isnull
i googled the use of coalesce and find out it is another words a replace of isnull

19193169
profiling	benchmarking
note the profiling modules are designed to provide an execution profiling for a given program not for benchmarking purposes for that there is timeit for reasonably accurate results

19193169
profiling	benchmarking
this particularly applies to benchmarking python code against c code the profiling introduce overhead for python code but not for c-level functions and so the c code would seem faster than any python one

19193169
profiling	benchmarking
so no you do not want to use profiling to benchmarking your code

19193182
setinterval	settimeout
replace setinterval with settimeout

19193221
hide	show
after starting to use this functionality each show hide column row command should be performed from a customized menu otherwise there ll be errors when iterating through the range programmatically because of the missing excessive backtick

19193259
hide	show
trying to onmouseover show the first div but hide the second then on hover show the second div but hide the first

19193270
groupbox	flowlayoutpanel
just create your picture boxes and add them to a flowlayoutpanel instead of a groupbox

19193270
groupbox	flowlayoutpanel
if you prefer to have the border of a groupbox you can still put the flowlayoutpanel into a groupbox

19193274
getter	setter
a property is just a pair of methods a getter and a setter

19193274
getter	setter
it says nothing about how the getter and setter may be implemented

19193275
post	get
an html form element can post to a url and may contain input elements but those input elements get turned into a query string

19193289
children	parent
i use self.pk there then the root of the tree is simply since it has no pk since it is not saved roottag.children will find any tags which do not have a parent tag and any of these tags can then just continue to have their children function called

19193298
mouse	keyboard
paired a keyboard and mouse

19193298
fastboot	adb
i checked if the system was in adb or fastboot mode and it looked like it was still in fastboot so i tried again

19193298
fastboot	adb
so i tried adb reboot bootloader again and the system seemed unable to boot into fastboot mode

19193308
width	height
if your height is bigger and width is smaller than container width will be stretch to 100 and height will be trimmed from both side

i have an image model and with it are a set of sizes that the image can be resized to that consist of a string name and the max height width for that size

19193442
ocamllex	ocamlyacc
my advice would be to use fslex and fsyacc only if you are facing translating a large legacy ocaml code base that uses ocamllex and ocamlyacc

19193446
width	font-size
you can assign not only to max-height but also em so if you set your html and body to a font-size of 100 this works similiar to a percental width

19193450
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome and firefox but i can t prevent the layout from being rendered

i have tried it on google-chrome v29.0.1547.76 firefox v24.0 and ie9

19193582
try-catch	exception-handling
this is something at compiler level the signature specifies which exception-handling the method is able to throw this enforces a try-catch or re-dispatch in the caller and a throw statement somewhere inside the method is a constraint that the developer places to specify something about the method behavior

19193644
rss	feed
the site has no rss feed

19193645
rss	feed
i get some rss feed and using google api i convert it to a json file

19193645
rss	feed
same as the above i have few rss feed in json format

19193664
lodash	underscore.js
the two corrections are that instead of underscore.js i would switch to lodash which is api compatible but much faster

19193664
lodash	underscore.js
but in your example i would skip lodash underscore.js and just do

19193676
post	get
it is likely that one team will face up against another more than once so i can t pull where home team home_user_id and away team away_user_id i can t pick from the last added row in the mysql table as if the user refreshes they will have somebody else s score not to mention if 2 games happen simultaneously it causing issues and i am not quite sure how to do this without using what i m trying to avoid by changing my schematic the get post method

19193691
bionic	libc
in the android sdk path sdk bionic libc bionic there are the c api resource code such as fork.c ioctl.c etc

width	height
ok so i want to have a series of divs which are the exact width and height of the user s browser window regardless of the screen size

19193803
yslow	pagespeed
you could get a speed profiler something like google s pagespeed service or yahoo s yslow to give you actual numbers for each of the requests so you can tell where the problem might lie

19193817
pull	push
what i would do is use a push approach instead of a pull and use xsl number and position to get the correct rec value

19193822
folder	directory
so for this you can use the good old ls -a folder | wc -l command which lists all files directory contained within folder hiding the entries for the current directory . and parent directory .. from the output which you want to exclude from the count and counting their number

19193833
width	height
you can then later extract the actual pixel width height of the image with

19193863
width	height
now when you try to set your div s later on specify width 100 and the height gets inherited from the html -- body -- div

19193874
datediff	difference
as anup has mentioned your query seems to be working fine i just removed datediff to calculate the difference as i assume columns are not of date datatype from your example i guess that was the issue please find below the modified query

19193882

qthread	qobject
since my qthread decend from qobject i expect to see a list of qthread and more

19193938
int	double
you can define a base class with the appropriate operators overloaded but then you have to constrain t to be based on that class so you can t use any value types like int double etc. or objects not based on the object used as your constraint

19194013
uiview	subviews
in your custom cell xib add a uiview subviews and of course your tableviewcell cell

super	implements
the apis are super simple to implements

19194332

in portrait orientation you should decrease it s height in landscape mode you should deal with it s width

19194355
express	node.js
try including your socket.io.js as server port socket.io socket.io.js or see this link cannot get client server running using express in node.js

19194378
getter	setter
if i make the property in the interface readonly the implementing class has to match those access rights and also declare the property as readonly instead of being able to implement a getter and a setter like in c#

19194392
post	get
the preserve parameters is usually used to turn on or off all the get and or post values but individual parameters may be removed by typing them into the remove parameters field just above it semi-colon delimited

19194407
