i have the mousedown mousemove and mouseup events for the canvas all doing their own thing

15365028
button	checkbox
by default these button groups can be made to function like a radio button or checkbox group but since they use the element they cannot actually be used like a radio button or checkbox

15365028
button	checkbox
in my research i found this site which uses css to make these bootstrap button actually control radio button and checkbox

a for-loop is a block which means that any variable declared with my inside the for-loop is local to that loops and local to each iteration of that loops

15365383
pull	push
developers make local commits pull from upstream and then push to upstream this is our workflow in a nutshell but it may also include issuing pull requests on github from a developer s personal fork of upstream

15365400
for-loop	loops
if you re running this in an interactive console then between statements executed at the prompt the console will perform housekeeping for example displaying the prompt that will significantly delay the next statement whereas for the for-loop loops will be executed in its entirety before the console does anything

15365403
post	get
this will get all the post where the account name matches somebody you follow

15365515
clang	llvm
if you don t want to change any thing in root directory then you can compile and install binutils and llvm in same place it will automatically generate ld ar and as not ld_new in bin directory and since llvm first looks to its own directory to find tools clang -print-search-dirs so you can be sure that clang will invoke ld gold in link time first

google-chrome	safari
reduce the width on by a few pixels and it shows up just fine on google-chrome safari

15365668
int	chars
if you want to handle input better i suggest wrapping your chars recogonition into a function that returns an int which has defines for each handled key

15365670
min	max
you can use rand to achieve this passing in the min and max

15365684
getter	setter
what i would suggest is overriding the width setter getter

15365684
portrait	landscape
this is because sizing can change for example landscape to portrait rotation

15365710
post	get
the problem with this is that when i tried to sign the url and then build a httppost request with it the url got a basestring with the prefix get instead of post which gave another signature then the one the service computed

15365721
getter	setter	accessor	properties
declaring a properties synthesizes two accessor getter setter methods

15365786

how could i display the categories and names using the repeater or should i use datalist using linq datasource in this way

15365829
width	height
i would like to be able to dynamically adjust the figure height and width on the basis of variables in x

15365840
for-loop	arrays
you could then iterate over the arrays with a for-loop and do something with the data if

15365889
gridview	repeater
you will run into significant difficulties using a gridview or repeater

15365905
equals	gethashcode
i know the bug has something to do with policyid overriding equals yes i ve remembered the constraint that if equals says two objects are equals to eachother then gethashcode should also return the same value for the two so gethashcode is overridden as well because a similiar setup is used elsewhere in the program without problems

15365927
width	height
there are predefined units saved which we can simply select with fixed name width height

15365936
width	height
which means in your case xsize and ysize are the width and height and its not necessary that your bi should have the co-ordinates xsize ysize

15365946
for-loop	loops
1 of course with the above conversion the scope of n changes and this is not meant to show how the compiler produces the code for a for-loop - it is just to explain how loops operates

15366075

it is get request but you are using http post

15366102

i have some sample json i want to post to my webapi fo testing but i cannot see to get it to deserilaize my object i am passing in

15366205
for-loop	arrays
i know i could use a for-loop and reference the next item by its index arrays i+1 but it wouldn t work for associative arrays

15366205
for-loop	arrays
consider converting your associative arrays into an sequentially indexed one with array_values allowing you to use the simple for-loop solution

15366244
getter	setter
synthesizing just sets up the kvc setter and getter - and with the modern versions of xcode you don t even need to do that

15366261

hide	show
currently the form works as a multipage form within javascript which is fine it s doing the job nicely but what i can t figure out based on any of the q a guides i ve looked thru on here i ve gone thru many google searches is how to integrate a further show hide script to hide the applicant 2 column if the dropdown at the top has a value of 1

get put post delete

15366721
post	get
you don t use post to simply display database content and you don t use get to update your database

15366737
hide	show
you can use the .change jquery with the dropdown list to see what the value is then based off that hide and show what you need

google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
during the animation it looks fine in google-chrome firefox and any other browser except for safari

15366784
sorting	filtering
for example use caching virtual grid devexpress calls it server mode paging delegate the sorting to an ibindinglistview filtering that does a database query uses database index instead of in-memory sorting no indexing or implement iasyncoperation on your clipboard data so you would only need to populate the data when the user does a paste

15366788
jar	manifest.mf
if you deployed the common jar you need to add a dependency in the manifest.mf of your ear or create a jboss-deployment-structure.xml

a simple way of doing this would be to animate the height and margin properties -

note that if you want real threading you should use jruby or ruby 1.9 the mri ruby 1.9 standard ruby threads implementation emulates threading green threads and does real threading only when one thread is waiting for i o

15366917
apache	nginx
well i also ended up setting up nginx server instead of apache

15366967
multiplying	add
you can add to or any number of fields if you wish to multiplying by volume and price

on debian ubuntu systems it will do apt-get install apache2

15367036
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
this is strange to me because firefox 19.0.2 runs fine but safari 6.0.2 and google-chrome 25.0.1364.160 hang

15367065
mouseup	mousedown
i thought that release would make a repeatbutton work more or less like a regular button--one click per mousedown mouseup

currently i ve managed to get it to show the authors latest post they ve add to the site using query_posts

15367241
superclass	subclassing
the reason why your program moves to the subclassing method first instead of the superclass is because of a principle called polymorphism

15367241
superclass	subclassing
that is a subclassing takes a method from the superclass and alters it s behavior

15367241
abstract-class	superclass
you can t create instances of abstract-class no but with the super keyword you can access the functionality of the superclass nonetheless

15367243
setinterval	settimeout
when a function is called using either settimeout or setinterval the this keyword looses its reference the function is invoked in a new context

15367249
super	extends
since sub extends super the definition of the sub class includes a reference to the definition of the super class

15367256

i have been adding fragments via xml and using show hide

i just downloaded the latest version and using it with skeleton framework it works fine centred in safari google-chrome but not in firefox

15367283
user-controls	datarepeater
you have to create a user-controls for each item and then you can use a datarepeater or a flowlayoutpanel

15367285
width	height
i m creating an html newsletter and i need to show some empty anchor links with specified height width and block-level display but gmail seems to remove empty links so i put in links and it works like a charm but it renders as - character

15367498
arraylist	linkedhashmap
and you will get either list or map specifically arraylist or linkedhashmap by default

15367556
width	height
you can do this by giving the div a proper width and height but it s better to make it dynamically wrap around the content with a clearfix

15367561
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
keep in mind that the reason i don t just give it a static percentage padding or margin top is because as the page gets wider the image height expands as the width does so as you expand the browser horizontally the nav becomes more and more out of place

15367610
atexit	main
what the c++ standard specifies ends shortly after you return from main - it does explain that global objects are destroyed at some point after this atexit and some other we re quitting level functions also get run after main returns

15367613
min	max
i have seen a minsize and maxsize option in the source code but i think these specify pixels not a min max value for the data

15367615
min	max
i m trying to find the max and min datetime s from a csv import

i then want to group the data and show the start time and finish time which is the min max of the respective fields

query the db and get the title of post tagged with red green blue yellow

15367731

you are stuffing non-numeric data into width and height attributes

15367740
put	get
again the sql output is fine but i don t get why nhibernate doesn t put the id i use for the function into the sql query

15367753
accessor	properties	equals	gethashcode
the accessor properties would have to be defined separately for both class types but one could have both types gethashcode and equals methods chain to the corresponding methods of the underlying struct

15367769
postgresql	mysql
when this question was originally posted mysql had no support for json data types and the support in postgresql was in its infancy

15367769
postgresql	mysql
since 5.7 mysql now supports a json data type in a binary storage format and postgresql jsonb has matured significantly

so as i read in web how salt used is like hash salt + password

15367896
hide	show
in my app i listen to the inputpane show hide events

15367919

do git pull --rebase resolve conflicts if any enjoy useless merge commit free history and just do git push

15368051
express	node.js
i have built an api in node.js w express which presently supports oauth 2.0 server-side explicit authentication

15368073
postgresql	mysql
indeed postgresql can build index on immutable functions which mysql can t as far as i know and in recent versions you could use plv8 on the json data directly to build indexes on specific json elements of interest which would improve the speed of your queries when searching for that data

15368091
width	height
i tried setting height and width to 500 which seems to work for alignment but pushes the div to the right way over

15368093

i found that i can install hooks around malloc free realloc in order to intercept memory allocation calls

15368130
vbscript	vba
one alternative that is a bit crazy most vba solutions are and hasn t been mentioned -- you could spawn off dynamic vbscript that can pretty much work as a thread and work in the background and hook them to excel

15368157
hash	salt
user following java code to calculate hash with salt

15368247
hide	show
you would need to use a javascript onchange event handler to show hide the second select option

15368283
free	malloc
you need to install a hook in the malloc to build a table of pointers caching the size of the requested block then when you free search for the pointer in the previous database of malloc d items

this works quite fine in firefox but in google-chrome the hover is not displayed

this is because on the table there is a button add a new row when this button is clicked another row is added to the table with a checkbox

you should extends broadcastreceiver and implements onreceive like this

15368393
prepare	execute
every time you prepare or execute a query you need to check for errors

15368445
ant	maven
its not correct to compare capistrano with ant and maven

15368445
ant	maven
capistrano is mainly deployment tool while ant and maven are mainly for building and managing dependencies

15368449
svg	vml
the following libraries currently have support on ie 6 7 8 as they use a hybrid of svg and vml

15368463

lapply	tapply	mapply	lapply	mapply	tapply
i could easily do a for-loop which is my first reflex as a programmer and because it works for the first line but i m sure it s not the r way and that there is a way to do this with an apply lapply mapply sapply tapply or other but i can t figure out which one and how

google-chrome	firefox
image is showing in google-chrome and firefox but i don t know why it s not showing on internet explorer

15368729
int	boolean
as boolean even if defined as int you state they only have two values i would suspect that neither reviewcompleteflag or reviewitemdeleteflag would be helped by indexes

15368740
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i suspect that you want to create your arrays outside of the iteraterow method and not use a while loops just the for-loop to populate the next slot in your arrays

15368743
filesystems	ntfs
it s more complicated than it might seem to examine ntfs filesystems permissions

15368754
width	margin
and max-width let s us actually center the menu items giving the margin on the right and left when the window is wide enough to fit the menu at full width

15368790
spaces	delimiter
this is important as while you might reasonably want an array an object in java to hold the input characters you probably don t want to allocate and garbage collect thousands of arrays and copy the characters into them to pass the data into something that only expects a single word as delimiter by white spaces hey it s just an example

15368817
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari

integer	unsigned
unsigned integer

15368913
udp	tcp
i have two static classes udp connection and tcp connection

15368913
udp	tcp
these methods will get hit when either udp or tcp class sends data

15368928
spaces	delimiter
a spaces serves as the delimiter so just do a . add.pl 2 3 something like this

15368931
getter	setter
old post but i think its important to mention that it is recommended to access variables via getter and setter so with dot notation

15368936
datalist	repeater
you may use a grid control such as repeater datalist

15369004
put	get
you might even get a bit more sophisticated depending on the needs of your app and put the authentication login method in a base class of your view model

15369026

15374653
getter	setter
a major problem with creating your own version of builtâ in objects is that you ll probably end up wrapping every builtâ in method in a native one like jquery wraps every dom method pretty much and start setting getter and setter on every property or end up with function calls to replace property access jquery s val attr and prop methods

15374660

15375915
bde	dbase
what i would have implemented as master detail in the bde dbase flat-file era i now simply implement as a query for master rows and a second query for detail rows and when the master row changes i refresh the detail rows queries and i do not use the mastersource or related master detail properties in the the ttable-objects at all

15376043
ant	maven
you can t count on ant and maven to execute tests in the same order

15376043
ant	maven
if tests have interdependencies it s also easy to get into situations where tests pass when run individually but fail when run through ant maven or vice versa

15376059

when trying to share a post of type photo if we set a parameter picture with the picture url we get an error that the feed dialog should not use a picture coming form the fbcdn

15376325
portrait	landscape
so it should fit in height and could show nice in every tablet covering the whole display in portrait mode beeing horizontally centered in landscape mode

15376325
width	height
in the code and the browser renders the thing just as is does on the mobile version just with our height as viewport-master instead of the width

15376325
width	height
adding my width to the viewport just makes the browser ignore the height and behave like it should in a phone-version

15376325
portrait	landscape
resulting in landscape proportions even in portrait mode.

15376326
width	height
first we ll deal with width later we want to create a table-like feel for the two columns sidebar and page which means if the sidebar is taller than the content in a page the background of the page column should extend all the way to the bottom same height as sidebar and vise-versa

15376329
post	get
but even with what i ve learnt in this post i still can t get the cython function to produce the same results as the python one

15376329
int	double
apparently if the response array is indexed with a typed variable unsigned int or int the result is coerced to a double using pyfloat_fromdouble even if the type of the array is np.float32_t

15376406
post	get
hi i have this code and i get the error that i must declare a body because it is not not marked abstract extern or partial...by the way i couldnt get it to post it here but right over the public partial class form1 form i also have written bool play1 true

15376597
submit	submission
duplicate the form upon submission and submit the forms to two iframes with different destinations or use ajax

15376597
submit	submission
what s happening to your code is that it will attempt to submit to the second page during the submission of the first page

15376597
submit	submission
upon submission clicking of the submit button duplicate the form

15376620
getter	setter
other than those the getter setter look fine

15376620
division	modulo
personally i would implement that logic by converting everything to inches and then using division and the modulo to determine the feet and inches but i ll leave that as an exercise for you if you care

15376623
client-side	server-side
iisnode is not set up as a .js handler by default since there is far more client-side javascript than server-side javascript so you need to explicitly turn on iisnode as a handler for that file

15376624
thin	unicorn
i have been using thin heroku cedar for my rails 3 app quite happily but i ve just switched to unicorn in order to get pdfkit working

15376624

trying to type affinity 1 ksp.exe into the cmdbox thankfully the cmdbox starts with the directory the .bat file is in which is the same folder that the .exe isin so no problems there simply gives this error

15376720
post	get
the commentsroute can get the model for the resource it is contained in and then fetch the comments with that post id

15376840
getter	setter
i understand how to create a getter and setter

15376868
getter	setter
from the outside the syntax for accessing getter and setter is indistinguishable from that of accessing variables

15376868
getter	setter
assignments translate into calls of setter while plain expression uses translate into calls of getter

15376868
getter	setter
in intellisense the list of getter and setter should open upon placing a dot

15376899
mouseout	mouseenter
now call the slideshow on mouseout event and on mouseenter call pauseslideshow

15376927
getter	setter
getter and setter let you treat the values like public properties

15376927
getter	setter
also as hogan says there are a number of libraries and add-ons mvc.net that require you to use getter and setter functions - even if it s for the trivial case

15377002

you can put it in a partial or use javascript to show hide

15377026

15377044
rss	feed
well i don t know if it s possible with feedzirra but from what i see with the xml all you can get is the title and some more snippets like the description pubication date... i can however recommend a tool for this you should check feedsapi it has a nice simple to use rss feed api and can do what you are tryng to achieve

15377064
width	margin
the trick here is that the width is fixed and the margin is set to auto

15377064
width	margin
it means that the margin outer space will be equally distributed at the sides of the wrapper with the fixed width

15377084
implements	extends
public class mainactivity extends activity implements onclicklistener

15377103
wordpress	joomla
i have considered using wordpress drupal or joomla as a solution but as there will only ever be a single html page jquery jqm and php form submission scripts on the server - this seems overcomplicated

15377105
mouse	keyboard
mouse and keyboard events for example will be posted to the event queue by a native portion of code dependent on the os implementation as i understand it coming from the toolkit but i could be wrong

15377120
portrait	landscape
i know that this class should be used for portrait recording but i need to have it in landscape

15377193
ember.js	backbone.js
webapps like this are usually built with a javascript framework such as backbone.js angularjs ember.js etc

15377211
apache	nginx
another way to do this probably harder but also more flexible in the long run would be to run two completely separate instances of apache or one apache and one other server such as nginx each with its own php version

15377211
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
using a different server such as one apache and one nginx or one apache and one lighttpd will be much easier because their configuration files don t conflict with each other

alternatively a quick-and-dirty way to achieve the same result would be to make your vector inherited from and just have the friendly named properties be proxies for item1 item2 and item3 - microsoft have already worried about implementing a good hash

15386915
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
the function receives three arguments the jqxhr in jquery 1.4.x xmlhttprequest object a string describing the type of error that occurred and an optional exception object if one occurred

15386925
post	get
through trial and error i m a bit rubbish with xpaths i ve managed to get the date of the first post ie the date the thread was created so this should all work now

15386942
width	height
if you choose a different background color you can notice that your imageview changes the width and height based or your requirements but the image inside keeps its original aspect ratio

15386967
ant	maven
hi am trying to run testsuite which has implemented to by using junit ant maven configuration

15386975
int	chars
you are getting and 544 as separate chars because in your input the numbers is not a list of int

15386976
equals	gethashcode
since all vectors must be unique you could use a and implement the appropriate methods gethashcode and equals

15387094
int	chars
you can output the int to a chars array using sprintf then replace the . with a space and read back two int using sscanf

15387095
zoo	xts
r s zoo and xts packages on which this depends

15387101
addition	multiplication	floating-point	integer
generally addition or multiplication of a value with integer type with a value of floating-point type is performed by first converting the integer to floating-point and then by performing the arithmetic operation

15387101
floating-point	integer
if the integer value cannot be exactly represented in the floating-point format then error is introduced even before the operation is performed

15387101
floating-point	fractions
one is that the number of bits or digits generally when not using binary floating-point needed to represent the significand fractions portion do not fit in the floating-point format

15387109
g++	gcc
this also compiles and runs fine with gcc g++ in cygwin version 4.5.3

15387119
distance	polygons
these vertices should be placed on distance sf from original vertex in direction of normal vector for edge incident to polygons vertex

15387136
floor	math.h
the 30 can just be extracted by rounding down floor x in math.h

15387209
decoder	encoder
for me it is the bardeco qr code decoder encoder generator 1.0.0.8 which i need to disable and remove that icon

15387229
geocoding	geocode
you can make it a little more efficient by storing the results of the reverse geocode and not reverse geocoding the point again if it has been clicked before like this

15387329
inherited	subclassing
and obviously moving them to the subclassing would reduce the inherited interest

15387380
mp3	ogg	mp3	wav	wav	ogg
i wrote this code to transfrom mp3 and ogg files to wav files

15387380
mp3	ogg
the code above will not return any values when processing neither mp3 or ogg files

15387380
wav	ogg
may there be any workaround to convert ogg file to wav

15387380
mp3	ogg
after reading everthing on the manual i learned that using two different kind of spis like in this case mp3 and ogg can cause problems

15387380
mp3	ogg	mp3	wav	wav	ogg
i will be happy if i can get ogg to wav transformation to work i can transform mp3 in another way

15387390
width	height
graphics offers a convenient overloaded method of drawimage that allows you to specify width height allowing you to avoid doing this.

15387427
int	boolean
i have an object that has one value but that value can either be an int string boolean or tdatetime

15387551
ssl	spdy
so we have nginx + spdy running for our ssl requests responses

15387551
ssl	spdy
unfortunately spdy is ssl only at this point

15387551
google-chrome	firefox
would it be worth spending what will probably be a couple of hours to make google-chrome latest firefox send our ajax requests to our ssl handler and have our ssl handler reverse proxy them where they need to go

15387551
google-chrome	firefox
a this will only be active for a select group of white listed browsers eg google-chrome latest firefox latest

15387593
internationalization	translation
i am trying to use globalize3 gem for model translation to active record internationalization for database

15387594
coalesce	isnull
in almost all cases i prefer coalesce over isnull

15387596
switching	screens
there have been many screens switching performance issues that i believe are due to the vm where linux video modes flip around for a couple seconds while camera access is made by the opencv application

15387622
superclass	subclassing
i need to subclassing something but i only want people using the library to have access to the child class not the superclass

15387630
inherited	properties
because of prototypal inherited setting the properties value on child scope which gets created when you use a child controller creates that properties on the child scope rather than updating the parent scope properties

15387640
pull	push
the sync works fine if i do a git push or git pull but the next time i want to sync using github windows i get the same error

15387679
sorting	grouping
i have a double field on which i am trying to apply sorting after match project and grouping in aggregrate framework

15387682
int	double
the one stumbling block i have is that one of those json fields needs to contain a 64bit int however natively node.js only support 64bit double and therefore does not include the level of precision required

15387725
accessor	properties	jpql	hql
please note that you are using properties access meaning that because the accessor method is annotated you need to name the properties in your query according to the javabean standard getid means that hql and jpql will access the preperty as id

15387746
implements	extends
now any class which can implements foo2 should extends intermediate and any function which requires functionality foo2 should ask for a variable with at least type intermediate

15387753
tcpdf	fpdf
i tried yevgeny solution but that required some more editions to my pdf generator code i have lots of pdfs outputs written in fpdf and i wanted to minimize the process of miograting them to tcpdf so i used this more simple solution

15387838
range	minimum
i am trying to pull minimum and maximum values for the range from numeric up down controls

15387842
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
my first option would be to put image as background url image_path to span and give height width and margin to align it properly

15387870
sorting	grouping
you can use this feature to get better performance by avoiding unnecessary column sorting and grouping

15387948
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i ve been running this code in safari firefox and google-chrome - all latest versions - and it doesn t work

15388045
folder	directory
when you hit ctrl+b it will call the build command with the first open folder as the working directory

15388045
folder	directory
so in order to build successfully you need to put your gruntfile in the folder as the working directory and then open the folder in sublime text and hit ctrl+b

15388104
mouseleave	mouseenter
my first instinct would be to just add a mouseenter mouseleave event

15388112
bufferedreader	printwriter
i am sending data through printwriter and receiving them using bufferedreader

15388117
integer	unsigned
since size_t is essentially an unsigned integer it cannot handle negative numbers and so using it for any real geometry is not possible

15388204
post	get
search for information about the xmlhttprequest object and how it supports get post requests and how to pass parameters

15388214
udp	tcp
i would not use tcp for voice transmitting see the differences between tcp and udp

15388231
draggable	droppable
i have a draggable image and a gwt canvas wrapped in a droppable

15388247
width	height
you can then set width height as required 100 in my sample

15388271
post	get
after you get the transaction id you post a form to paypal that includes the transaction id and your identity token a string value that identifies your account to paypal

15388290
ubuntu	linux
i have done this successfully with my ubuntu studio 12.10 workstation and tablets laptops running xbmc on linux or android

15388326
for-loop	loops
the reason that others are suggesting you look at how for loops work is that the code in your for-loop is only executed one time which is presumably not what you want to do

15388345
enlive	hiccup
i ve looked at enlive but i m not sure how to use that with hiccup

15388364
udp	tcp
since you re considering voip you might want to consider a udp socket instead of tcp assuming you use tcp for your chat

15388441
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
also if you need to dynamically set the height width of the image to make it the same size as your grid cell you can bind the height and width properties of the image to the itemscontrol s actualheight actualwidth and use a converter to figure out 1 10th of that size i have a mathconverter on my blog which would make this easy

15388454
children	parent
however i am trying to get my head around how this works for a prolog program that implements lists to determine children of a parent i.e

15388455
getter	setter
getter and setter are there

15388477
implements	modifiers
using the internal access modifiers enables the hiding of members that should not be visible outide the implements assembly

15388539
puts	gets
this just gets my latest tweet from twitter converts any urls to anchor tags and puts that in a div with an id of tweet-text

15388539
folder	dir
and then create a php file which would act as a proxy helper in the theme folder in a dir called ajax called get_tweet.php which would do the oauth stuff and just echo the latest tweet which would be used by the javascript

15388543
folder	directory
the pivot table generated would be called edition_format when i made the model you first have to create a directory edition and in that folder create a file called format.php so you would have the following

15388601
hash	salt
verify password then takes only 5 characters off for the salt not 8 so the verify will always fail as it s using 5 characters for the salt and not the 8 that was used to create the hash password

15388601
hash	salt
this gives you what i think was intended which was not only to include the salt inside of the hash but also add it to the outside of the hash so it all could be stored as 1 column value in a database and then used to recreate the hash on the user entered password using the stored salt value and get a match

15388727
google-chrome	firefox
this happens on google-chrome and firefox but in ie8 the list image is displayed perfectly

15388792
pascal	delphi
excellent native support is available from delphi object pascal

15388800
width	margin
incidentally you can then get rid of the margin on .main and it will automatically occupy whatever space is left so you can then change the width of aside as you see fit or even add extra columns â i then gave the aside margin-left 10px to dictate the gap it needs to keep your layout constant

15388809
pull	push
it s not uncommon to create a new remote branch named development or whatever you choose so the team can push pull their changes

15388885
post	put
the comparison between put an patch is not quite trivial as it may seem because you also should consider post since post can also be used for partial modification

15388912
std	ostream	ostream	istream
then you can make std istream and std ostream using that streambuf

15388914
versioning	upgrade
if i have a client on versioning 1 of my application and i want to upgrade them to versioning 5 of my application i would have no problems doing so if their database had no data

15388914
versioning	upgrade
my current strategy for managing data requires i maintain a script for each versioning upgrade 1 to 2 2 to 3 etc

15388914
versioning	upgrade
the prospect creating custom upgrade scripts for every client or managing upgrade scripts to go from every versioning to every greater versioning is exponentially unmanageable

15388973
integer	unsigned
â otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater than or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand the operand with signed integer type shall be converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type

15388978
dlsym	dlopen
in linux or any posix system this would be based on dlopen dlsym and look more or less like this

15388985
min	max
look at the java.lang.math class there are min and max methods there that will help simplify the math

15388986
button	checkbox
if you want the users to select only one option perhaps a dropdown or radio button list is more suitable rather than checkbox

15388994
opera	firefox
tested on firefox 19.0.2 opera 12.04 chromium 25.0.1359.0

15389000
min	max
consider if we create history archive table for data in the table will give advantage of following query which uses min and max functions

15389025
implements	extends
it is possible to pass function name as first argument to and implements call to extends save to internal dictionary association between names and implementations extension point

15389037
width	height
i need the images height and the images width so that i can set another form with a form docked image box to the size of that image

what you need is to md5 the string dummy string in our case and unhexlify it s hash

15389157
onkeyup	onkeydown
i m using nicedit to have a rtf textarea and i need to add a onkeypress onkeyup or onkeydown event

15389157

15389215
ubuntu	debian
these are the fedora package names but i m sure that the ubuntu debian names would be similar

15389219
primefaces	icefaces
you may want to consider using jsf it has various flavors icefaces myfaces primefaces etc...

15389252
put	get
if we get put the date in sql and convert to a float we get a different number 41344.0

15389320
children	parent
when you ignore a folder file the parent folder is marked as modified until the next commit but it does not change the status of its children

15389334
tinyint	boolean	int	boolean
and use a boolean for your denied flag instead of an int it sets the column to a tinyint which is a bit neater and allows the boolean style

15389391
post	get
i have just copied some relevant code to a new file i can not post entire code here because of policies and copyrights and i get some silly errors like object expected although the value is already an object

15389407
uilabel	uibutton
best way is add uilabel to uibutton and use

15389452
exponent	modulo
the public exponent and the modulo must be chosen such that the exponent is relatively primes to p-1 for all primes p which divide the modulo

15389452
exponent	modulo
if you are just arbitrarily setting the modulo to a binary representation of a password pwdkey it s unlikely that you are choosing an appropriate exponent modulo pair

15389459
put	get
get rid of that button or put it next to the cursor not under it

15389516
width	height
you don t have fixed width and height fluid

15389516
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
as specified in w3c the margin properties including margin-top and margin-bottom refers the width of the containing block not the height if set in percentages

15389545
width	height
you can then set width height as required 100 in my sample

15389549
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
i m not sure about svcutil.exe but wsdl.exe generates c# partial classes

google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox but not in google-chrome

15390125
prepare	bindparam
i know about prepare statements of mysqli but using bindparam for each variable seems a little overkill to me

getter	setter
i m receiving build errors in the class properties when getting setting an enumeration of another class that has it s own separate getter setter

15390185
min	max
i have a field on a real estate search form asking for min to max number of bedrooms

15390290
rss	feed
listen to the rss feed events from outside

15390296
oncreate	onstart
if you are using singletask be sure to put your intent logic in the onstart function instead of in oncreate as others have trumpeted as that will allow you to link into your app whether it s already running or not

15390352
sorting	grouping
you can use this feature to get better performance by avoiding unnecessary column sorting and grouping

15390356
int	double
use one of math.round math.floor or math.ceiling to control how double floats are converted to any int type

15390441

15390651
versioning	upgrade
you could upgrade to beautifulsoup versioning 4 and use .stripped_strings

15390680
versioning	upgrade
assuming that all of your code is correct you may need to upgrade your versioning of jquery ui and the corresponding jquery as well

15390680
versioning	upgrade
this is because although the documentation you were looking at says autocomplete widget versioning added 1.8 the response event was not added until 1.9 see the jquery 1.9 upgrade guide response event this also means that you will not be able to bind an event listener to the autocompleteresponse event as the guide states

15390680
versioning	upgrade
once you upgrade to a jquery and jquery ui versioning which supports the autocomplete response event this code will work as expected

fadein	fadeout
you need to change the classes after the fadeout fadein so you need to do something like this

15391358
primes	modulus
the modulus must conform to a specific structure it is the product of two large primes whereas your guid in binary form generally will not be

15391358
primes	modulus
in order to decrypt the rsa-encrypted data you must know the two primes used to generate the modulus

15391358
primes	modulus
even if your random modulus was magically the product of two large primes you wouldn t be able to determine them since this would require factoring the modulus which is an intentionally difficult thing to do indeed the difficulty is the entire basis of rsa s security

15391358
rsa	aes
if you want to encrypt more than this the general method is to use a symmetric cipher aes to encrypt the data and then use rsa only to encrypt the aes key

15391421
width	height
localstorage i ve created a fiddle that for demonstration purpose uses sessionstorage for storing the width of a div and localstorage for storing the height of the same div

15391421
width	height
you will see that when you initiate a new session of your client browser the width will variate while the height will stay the same because local storage is per domain

side note - you still have some problems because the stop condition in the getallchildren is iterating through children when it should not if it is not a parent it should not have children

15405253
implements	extends
i implements an input method called remoteinput simply extends inputmethodservice without inputviews and no keyboards

15405254
children	parent
you probably want to recurse through all children if the book is a parent

15405258

15405426
implements	extends
remember you need forced by the compiler to implements override those abstarct methods in your concrete class which extends your abstract class

15405426
superclass	subclassing
e.g when superclass is considerd to be public in that case overriding method present in the subclassing would not be public or private

15405426
inherited	subclassing
if instance methods are inherited by subclassing in that case only they might be overridden

15405446
outputstream	inputstream
closing this socket will also close the socket s inputstream and outputstream

15405478

as my opinion just create multiplier values for width and height according to which simulator you are coding in and multiply your each width or height parameter with this as below

15405529

google-chrome	firefox
this script is working in firefox or google-chrome but only gets half way in ie9 which is the top browser for our websites

15405853
width	height
the only way i ve found to fix it is actually playing with the width height in the sms plugin markup but unfortunately it will mess up how it appears on the other browsers

15405853
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
two solutions i ve found option one is to wait since opera is switching over to web-kit option two is to plug in a simple alert jquery script that detects if a user is browsing with opera and notifies them to use a supported browser instead ie firefox safari

15405882
maven	pom.xml
i also thought maven might run the tests in parallel so i tried setting forkmode to always for surefire plugin in my pom.xml but it didn t change anything

this way you can have a for-loop that loops every two seconds for example

15412964
getter	setter
getter and setter are used because if you decide half way through your project to change the way that your variable works or if you want to modify the value from the original you would have to go through your code and change all calls to that public variable

15412964

however with getter and setter you can just change how the variable is handled inside the method

15413548
google-chrome	firefox
this can t be a new problem because if i have to create weird custom code for whether i am running locally or whether it s remote and whether it s google-chrome and whether it s firefox then this whole automation is robust and awesome because you can do cross-browser testing and scale across environments is some mayo-mustard packed cheesecake

typedef	struct
not having much experience with c++ i also thought it might be that c++ doesn t allow const struct members as those typedef are mostly used in struct typedef for collections of registers but that doesn t seem to be the case either

width	height
you wont not get width and height until screen has focus

15415183

as far as i know when using 2 s complement and the first number is a 1 then you flip the numbers and find the value of the new byte and make it a negative.the javadoc says that integer.parseint string s radix and integer.valueof string s radix both should return a signed integer object but when i test it out with this

next i tried removing the iframe and html tags from the first box this works in the sense that the loading giff is visible for the full duration of the ajax request - however it also ignores the width and height parameters and draws a massive colourbox - the size is only corrected when the ajax request comes back again another video showing this

15438514
vb6	vba
in vba vb6 the above means declare variable d that magically always contains an instance of dictionary

15438517

however what i would do is make sure the script is in a wrapper with a set width height

15438517
width	height
then set the script to 100 width and the height to 100

15438521
google-chrome	firefox
but it works only in firefox and not in google-chrome

15438634

15438656
int	double
a b c d are double and you are parsing them as int

15438725
createfile	getlasterror
your call to getlasterror returns 0 because there are other apis called after createfile returns and your exception code executes

15438742
width	height
in this code -sizetofit is mainly used to keep the text within the width and determine whether the initial height of 40 can be reduced when we have a short string of text

15438799

my other option is to place all the images in img tags and hide show them as you use slide through the array index

15439059
google-chrome	firefox
interestingly the first is a no-op in google-chrome but is synonymous with the functional call in firefox

15439104
pull	push
i can pull branch push all that good stuff

15439122
thin	webrick
you are using webrick the problem may be there given it s not prepared to be used on a production you should try adding thin to the gemfile

here s a starting point with cross-browser support added for firefox and opera jsfiddle demo

15439135
capitalize	uppercase
the lower can be replaced with upper or firstcap to indicate all uppercase or capitalize the first letter respectively

15439157
weka	libsvm
i am using the weka gui to train a svm classifier using libsvm on a dataset

15439241
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is as far as i can tell this is nonstandard behavior - and yet firefox and google-chrome both handle those paths as absolute

15439252
hash	md5
the typical way to generate an api key is to create a uuid usually by creating an md5 hash of some subset of user information + somewhat random information like current time

15439252
hash	md5
the hexadecimal hash created by md5 meets this requirement but there are certainly other methods

15439268
gson	jackson
the typical way to do this for json request bodies is to implement messagebodyreader and use a json parser of your choice like gson or jackson

15439276
sorting	filtering
it s important to understand that if the user changes sorting of some column or sets filtering or chooses another page of the grid

you can use system.setout and system.seterr to redirect stdout and stderr to arbitrary output streams in your case a network i o stream

15439527
pull	push
this reject seems that i didn t git pull before push

15439530
overwrite	preserve
you have to move thistimeout to a higher scope so its value is preserve and you have to clear it before you overwrite the previous value

15439576

the problem is that warnings in r are printed to stderr instead of stdout

15439592

the whole functx library is available for both xquery and xslt

15439647
hash	salt
so my solution to this was to create a python script that takes the salt and users password and returns the hash password

15439665
superclass	subclassing
i don t know why this works but the only difference i seem to find is that the logger object is now being instantiated inside the subclassing instead of inside the superclass

15439698
sum	coalesce
i coalesce the sum with 0 to have a proprer value when the result would be null

15439701

getter	setter
this will not create new getter or setter functions these are still called in the superclass and does not introduce a new instance variable as backing store

15439715
width	height
you ll need to calculate the width and height based on the starting x and y values and the ending x and y values

15439730
super	abstract
the super class is abstract defined in a list and i have full access to it

15439756
width	height
using values for the width and height of the image should work

15439778
qitemdelegate	qtreeview
if you want to display custom dynamic content or implement a custom editor widget use qtreeview and subclass qitemdelegate

15439778
qitemdelegate	qtreeview	qtableview	qtreeview	qtableview	qitemdelegate
qitemdelegate and its sub classes perform all drawing facilities for items inserted into qt item views like qtreeview qlistview qtableview etc..

15439778
qstyleditemdelegate	qitemdelegate	qlistwidget	qitemdelegate	qlistwidget	qstyleditemdelegate
having implemented a similar approach for a qlistwidget i recommend using qstyleditemdelegate in lieu of qitemdelegate as it allows you to more easily integrate this widget with your application s style layout

15439793

the example will show how to create a state-machine aasm based email confirmation model using rolify and cancan for permissions

15439833

even for-loop can be used to process and loops through all elements of arrays with the following syntax

15440263
udp	tcp
the socket will take any data you hand it and wrap that data within a packet of its own creation tcp if using socket udp if using datagramsocket as you are

15440263
udp	tcp
in your case the data you are handing the socket is itself a packet and thus you end up with a packet within a packet likely a tcp packet inside a udp packet

15440263
tunnel	packets	tunnel	vpn
now when you have a real vpn tunnel the server-side of that tunnel is probably pulling your wrapped packets payload out of the udp packets it receives and is then handing that packets directly to a network interface that can interpret the packets itself

15440263
udp	tcp	tunnel	vpn
without this real vpn tunnel your vpnservice impl essentially has to become a virtual network interface itself handling the tcp udp etc

15440263
tunnel	vpn
i really hope i m wrong about all this and someone has a simple virtual network interface written in java that could be used to take the place of the real vpn tunnel

15440282

filesystems	ntfs
since your windows host has an ntfs filesystems the linux guest doesn t properly cache the file with sendfile and so apache needs to send the file itself

15440396
put	get
in that case if you have access to the central server configuration put the rules there instead of a .htaccess file because instructions in the server config get stored in memory and are faster

15440428
superclass	subclassing
as a stand-in solution i realized i could just create a wrapper class d which i can then modify on an app-by-app basis to subclassing from the appropriate superclass for the task at hand

15440440
for-loop	loops
i am trying to create a space invaders game for a project but im having a bit of trouble with the for loops i want to create 10 instances of an enemy without having to type out each one i know a for-loop is the answer im just not sure how to initialise it

instrumentation really is the right answer but if you can t figure out how to use it then another option is the profiling in the built-in activity monitor application

15441173
implements	extends
public class world_heritage extends activity implements view.onclicklistener

15441189

width	height
if i would set the width and the height of a video element it s not always so that the dimensions of the movie video will be the very same

15441366
width	height
so i only entered the width of it and hoped that the height would fix itself which it did

15441374
children	parent
you might find possible to implement your own kind of vector so that you reallocate it manually and thus are able to change all children parent accordingly

15441462
cstring	bstr
if the bstr doesn t have nul s embedded inside you can simply pass it to a cstring constructor that will make a deep-copy of it and you can locally work with your cstring

15441462
cstring	bstr
modifications to that cstring won t be visible on the original bstr

15441462
cstring	bstr
basically the idea is to use bstr wrapped in a raii class like ccombstr only at the boundary and do the local work using std wstring or cstring

15441473
cstring	bstr
cstring svalue bstr

15441520

ideally it should be a cross-browser solution ie8 ie9 google-chrome firefox and safari

15450357

box-sizing	border-box
try using the property box-sizing border-box

15451257
width	height
under the normal content-box model padding of an element is not included in the height calculation so you are adding 10px to the 20 of the image therefore the sum of the image and the text will be 20 + 10px + 100 which of course exceeds the parent width

the situation vera++ s checks are designed to prevent occurs when misbehaved system headers â most famously â define min and max macros that interfere with application-defined functions of the same name or even with standard library functions such as and

15451427
min	max
as is typically the case with min and max

15451427
min	max
if you control inclusion of you can also #define nominmax prior to its inclusion which will instruct windows.h not to define the min and max macros

15451442
google-chrome	firefox
now i would normally if inheriting someone else s simpe html css site just use the inspect element feature in google-chrome of firefox and then see whereabout to edit the code

getter	setter
i have some experience with javaswing development where most of thinks i m writing manually without any gui builders and what i usually do in mvc is to access the view s controls via getter setter

15451624
width	height
what you can do is send the full html to the server via ajax along with the width and height of the browser window and then use a headless browser library on the server to reconstruct what the page probably looked like and save that out as an image file on the server

the two styles you ll need to play with are tabcontrol and tabitem

15451978
integer	fractions
note that there a couple of differences between these last two methods and the first two they preserve the sign of the argument so if you use the final example for -12.99 you ll get -99 back and they treat the fractions part of an integer as 1 so if you use the final example for 12 you ll get 100 back

google-chrome	firefox
cutting-edge versions of firefox and google-chrome have support for webrtc which among other things allows peer-to-peer data exchange so if you really wanted to you could build your own decentralized p2p database on top of that experimental technology â but it s is going to be hard

glibc	tcmalloc
tcmalloc is faster than the glibc 2.3 malloc available as a separate library called ptmalloc2 and other malloc s that i have tested

15452794
free	malloc
ptmalloc2 takes approximately 300 nanoseconds to execute a malloc free pair on a 2.8 ghz p4 for small objects

15452794
free	malloc
speed is important for a malloc implementation because if malloc is not fast enough application writers are inclined to write their own custom free lists on top of malloc

15452795

15452907
iboutlet	ibaction
yes i think you should definitely spend a little time getting accustomed to working with interface builder ib to make nibs and storyboards and let ib create the iboutlet and ibaction references for you for those controls with which you need to interact

15452907
iboutlet	ibaction
in terms of letting the controller interact directly with the iboutlet and ibaction references this is common practice for simple user interfaces

if width and height are 0 then changing them has no effect because trying to scale 0 results in 0

15453731
width	height
to get the height and width i set a var like this

15453747
oncreate	setcontentview
you have not used setcontentview in your oncreate ...i guess that is generating nullpointerexception...put your logcat output for more information

i am trying to write a line of bash that copies all these files in a directory containing foo as last part of the name to the folder above the respective foo folder

15455803
width	height
fit_center means its going to start out with height and width equal to your image what your images looked like in the first screen shot before you added weight

15455810
comparator	comparable
it should be similar to the way that you can make an object comparable but still override that behavior in a specific collection by providing some other comparator

15455867
stdout	stderr
okay the simple answer to your question is to redirect stderr to stdout

15455875

15455985
int	chars
when identifier is preceded by a type such as int or chars then identifier is declared as a reference to the type

15456001
fgets	strcmp
if the two files are text files then honestly i would start from scratch with a much simpler program that uses fgets rather than getc and compares line by line using strcmp rather than character by character

15456002
bash	subshell
using the construct ensures that if the inside of your loop sets variables changes directory state or does similar things those changes will survive the right-hand side of a pipeline is in a subshell in bash so piping into a while loop would mean that any changes to the shell s state made inside that while loop would be discarded on its exit otherwise

and you can send the keyboard mouse events to another thread via a blockingqueue

15456364
joptionpane	jdialog
use a modal jdialog or a joptionpane to display your dependent window

15456372

the problem that now faces me is that without a titlebar the user has no way of telling which window is the active window when they are manually moved apart so they are not overlapping

15456387
udp	tcp
goal to change a image on a form when either udp or tcp uses its send method

below code i try to make for check how many folder in dir and create new one folder by ascending number

15456430
folder	dir
if 1 2 in dir - it will make a folder named 3

15456430
folder	dir
if 1 5 in dir - i hope it can make a folder named 2

15456464
inherited	properties
some languages have this properties but c++ does not making it harder to get templates and inherited to play nicely together

15456487
versioning	upgrade
if you re using a pre-release versioning of vs 2012 like the rc upgrade to the released versioning

15456539
comparator	comparable
method comparator in both comparable and comparator serves another general purpose

15456539

15456574
accessor	properties
i recently had a similar issue but wanted to use accessor properties also

15456638
versioning	upgrade
i would upgrade to the latest versioning of backbone and underscore too

15456661
min	max
i tried to use min width and max width properties but when i maximize i find application located in center

15456670
post	get
i have an ultra-simple loop to get my post from inside _posts

15456687
unsigned	short
i found that unsigned short is 0-65 535 and unsigned int is 0-65 535 or 0-4 294 967 295

15456687
unsigned	short
and if for example when c is an unsigned short and d is an unsigned int

15456701
width	height
in theory it should then be as simple as setting the width of the parent div to the width of the widest child and the height of the parent div to the height of the tallest child

15456721
unsigned	short
similarly if your short is 16-bits in length then it can represent one of 2 16 different numbers 0 - 65 535 if unsigned

15456728
client-side	server-side
the one titled server-side login is the conventional oauth flow while others are different approaches that support different use-cases like mobile app sign-in and access from client-side javascript embedded on other sites

15456741
post	get
what i have used in json applications is to send a post to the get method when i want the same results for both

15456744
put	get
i m trying to make a library and want to copy the header file to the dylib but when i put libac.h in libac_files i get this error when i compile

15456751
unsigned	short
well first you must understand what an unsigned int and short is

15456755
stdout	stderr
redirecting the stdout to stderr or from stderr to stdout

15456788
width	height
the height and width properties of an element aren t set until the element is rendered in html

15456800
int	double
we can t say a variable type name short int long double etc. has to point specific bit length across all microprocessor architectures or programming languages

15456800
unsigned	short
generally signed unsigned short should have i would expect half bit-size of signed unsigned int

15456812
min	max
the criteria to filter is get the min and max qty from table and get only the first value when exists duplicate qty values in the same unit and client column

15456815
google-chrome	firefox
the urllib2 library seems to be able to handle logins sometimes the help of a cookie manager like cookielib is also needed. the catch is that each e-mail service will be a bit different and you have to go digging through the source code for that page ctrl+u in several browsers like firefox and google-chrome to look for the names it uses for the various variables

15456817
children	parent
a solution could be that the parent children would be loaded only on demand but that would mean that the domain objects would have to know about the mapper in order to pull data from it.

15456817
children	parent
the domain models instances of the page class should know nothing about the data mapper layer separation but still be able to perform those tasks retrieving parent children

15456865
lxml	elementtree
i ve been using lxml instead of elementtree but i think the write out part should still work i think it s mainly just xpath stuff that elementtree can t handle. i m using lxml imported with this line

15456889
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
you ll have to change the collation encoding of the column from a case-insensitive encoding to a case-sensitive one such as utf8_general_cs or latin1_general_cs

15456904
pull	push
i haven t tried to pull code directly from heroku but i m not sure why you would need to since git push heroku master just pushes the master branch of your code from your git repository to heroku

15456929
junit	unitils
if you are using some off the shelf junit framework like unitils etc they have methods like assertreflectionequals similary other framework does where you can any two objects using reflection

15456951
min	max
first select the records with min and max qty to a single table and then select the min datetime for those records

15456956
oncreate	ondestroy
you re reading in oncreate but saving in onpause which should work but is unbalanced oncreate s yang is ondestroy

15456956
onresume	onpause
onresume goes with onpause

15456999
memcpy	memset
but they all have something odd in common they didn t use memset nor memcpy resorting instead to hand-written loops to do the job

15456999
memcpy	memset
memcpy and memset are very likely to be linked in the executable anyway because the programmer would use it directly or indirectly through another library

15457000
google-chrome	firefox
in the case you are using javascript with a google-chrome extension or a firefox add-on then you must set permissions in your manifest file to have access to those sites you want

15457022
getter	setter
since none of the code will work without implementing a bunch of getter and setter i d prefer to stop them with a #error instead

15457024
stdout	stderr
standard input is the keyboard the standard output is stdout ie monitor which also functions as the stderr file stream all this is by default

15457024
stdout	stderr
so when you use something like 2 1 you are basically telling the os to put the stderr 2 data into the stdout 1 data stream

15457036
accurev	cvs
my company ha been using accurev since early 2010 coming from starteam before that and cvs in the very distant past

15457036
put	get
if they can t get implement this correctly don t put the f ing option there

15457036
pop-up	dialog
anyway when we say promote this file first it pop-up with another modal dialog after the required waiting while it does more stat processing then it presents a list of all tickets it has pulled there are a lot...too many to reliably find anything

15457166
hide	show
i m trying to show hide sponsor logos on my site show hide one after the other endlessly

15457177
for-loop	loops
rather than using matrix multiplication with reshape etc in a double for-loop it might be better to reverse the process and loops over the shorter dimensions like this

15457177
for-loop	loops
as a result rather than doing 40000 loops through a double for-loop you do a total of 9 loops

15457189
explode	implode
implode or explode

15457203
nexus	artifactory
a maven repository like artifactory or nexus acts like a private version of maven central

15457209
children	parent
note how when adding nodes the redness is always passed up in color flip two red children become black locally balanced while coloring their parent red

15457236
stdout	stderr
a standard reason is so a shell script reports errors on stderr instead of stdout

15457239
stdout	stderr
as a good deal of library code assumes stderr is byte oriented and some even makes the same assumption about stdout i would strongly discourage ever using wide-oriented functions on the standard streams

15457274
versioning	upgrade
xulrunner has been a little neglegted by the mozilla team at some time they wanted even to abandon it so ibm had to interveen so the versioning deemed fit for xpinc use is still 3.6 some upgrade work would be needed here i have no visibility into ibm s plans here

15457276
width	height
im guessing its a width height problem

15457309
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
after completion to copy it to the final server and after changing the settings of the database and the domain the site does not open in ie firefox google-chrome and safari but if i view the source code in the browsers he is corrects only opens the opera

15457357
portrait	landscape
this allows the preview to display properly in both portrait and landscape orientations of the screen

15457380
width	margin
however the better option is if your div has a set width use a left and right margin of auto on the element you want to center

15457393
post	get
if i ve got the source code like pom or .ds.xml or output exception i ll post it here as i get them

15457415
ubuntu	debian
it s worth noting that on debian and ubuntu where some headers have been moved for multiarch so that multiple architectures of a package can be installed at the same time the ruby config.h file since it is architecture-dependent has been moved to a subdirectory

15457498
children	parent
breadth-first can be better when the target is near the starting node or when the number of nodes doesn t go up very quickly so the parent children arrays in your code stay small another answer mentioned linked list as worst-case for dfs

15457511
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
anything that extends runtimeexception including nullpointerexception are unchecked which means they don t need to be explicitly handled via a try catch or by declaring that the method throw them

15457517
prepare	execute
well activerecord implicitly checks whether the codeblock was given and either execute the underlying sql statement and iterates through result or returns an iterator with prepare but not yet execute sql statement

15457529
put	get
i also put in a print command to see what i did wrong and this is what i get if i enter in a western conference team name like the spurs in the search box select teamrecords from nbateam where teamnba spurs

15457530
width	height
the width of the clickeable areas o the elements is alright but i cannot set the height it s to big and i can set it in a small size

15457531
implements	extends
at runtime to extends main scan the entention dll for classes which implements the needed interfaces in interfaces.dll invoke the methods as needed

15457705
post	get
i know the post multiple map views in same app covers a similar issue but the poster didn t seem too friendly and didn t get any answers due to that

15457804
post	get
your code is vulnerable to sql injection you need to escape all get post and request and the better approach will be using prepared statement

15457815
prepare	execute
you should be using prepare to prepare a statement not query as that just execute a query

15457837
rss	feed
my problem is that i dont know how to get those contents from these sites...i tried creating an rss feed using feedburner but that failed

just imagine how the buttons are placed apply elementary school math like subtraction and division and the rest is trivial

15457908
integer	unsigned
the type of each operand of the unsigned right shift operator must be an integer data type or a compile-time error occurs

15457908
int	chars
if the type of an operand is byte short or chars that operand is converted to an int before the value of the operator is computed

15457987
integer	unsigned
in your case unsigned integer size is 4 bytes

15457996
modifiers	sealed
there is a very little performance improvement when a sealed modifiers is used

15458000
int	chars
but the sizeof chars is one and sizeof int is 4 so total of 5 bytes are required but the compiler allocated 8 bytes

15458042
integer	unsigned
an unsigned integer can represent positive values only

15458053

mouse	keyboard
this totally combats my knowledge about device drivers i know that everything you insert to a computer that has an input to be understand needs a device driver ei mouse keyboard it s hard for me to believe that the computer controls the mouse since it can t because that is senseless because the standard mouse is only for input

15458199
superclass	subclassing
if you want to update it use var in the superclass and assignment in the subclassing

15458216
modifiers	sealed
nowadays however the rationale behind the sealed modifiers is far more about design choices controlling how client code interacts with your library

15458244
junit	testng
i don t think there is any specific advantage of using testng in preference of junit with regards to the parallelizing of tests

15458254

when the program for which that page of memory belonged to attempts to access it this is called a page fault - the os detects the page is not in ram but on disk and has to read it into ram before execution continues

disk	ram
this is relatively slow since reading from the hard disk is slower than reading from ram

i was wondering whether calloc is preferable to a malloc followed by a memset

15468146
memset	malloc	memset	calloc	calloc	malloc
combining malloc and memset gives calloc a chance to request a page that is known to already be zeroed

15468146

having said that the memory may not be the only thing you need to worry about when dealing with new delete instead of raw malloc free

15468197
calloc	malloc
however one other reason why you may not see as many calls as you would expect is that a lot of larger projects use wrappers around malloc calloc and friends that do error handling usually terminating the program on memory allocation failure

15468197
memset	malloc	memset	calloc	calloc	malloc
one reason to use calloc over malloc plus memset is that calloc may be more efficient

15468200
int	boolean
so in my fifth line of code i m getting an error with my or statement saying the operator || is undefined for the argument types boolean int

int	chars
the first clause pulls out the first chars of the field the second clause converts the remainder of the field to an int

15468279

you can achieve the same results by using zfcuser backed by a zend authentication adapter http combined with bjyauthorize which handles the listener logic on unauthorized actions

15468704
versioning	upgrade
so my recommendation is that you upgrade to versioning 6

15468704

if you can t upgrade you may want to download the source of the old versioning of the facebook c# sdk from github and take a look if you can step through the code to find the problem

15468732

mechanize	splinter
you can do it several ways but since you have not given so much information i would recommend going with mechanize or splinter both work as a browser so you can read what s on the html and even fill submit forms and much more

15469337
getter	setter
the problem isn t with your setter getter although they read a bit weird the problem is you re ignore them in your constructor.

15469399
google-chrome	firefox
edit note however that input elements are difficult to style because each os win linux and or browser ie firefox google-chrome can provide their own styling of input elements

width	height
however i d go with making the array 2 larger n each dimension let row vary from 1 through height and col vary from 1 through width and ignore what happens at the edges

15469673
width	height
in your code you seem to be pairing row with width and col with height which seems backwards to me

15469688
put	get
so i do the same for a codeigniter project i am working on and i put it to my test subdomain etienne.yorkdigitalsolutions.com and create the a zone like i should in linode s dns manager and when i have just a flat html file it all resolves and works nice otherwise with the codeigniter project i get error 500

put	get
the internal bucket structure will actually be rebuilt if the load factor is exceeded allowing for the amortized cost of get and put to be o 1

15469845
put	get
note that if the internal structure is rebuilt that introduces a performance penalty that is likely to be o n so quite a few get and put may be required before the amortized cost approaches o 1 again

15469858
hash	md5
since password policy is storing the history of the passwords as md5 hash in drupal 6 this could cause issues if phpass did not take this into account

15470447
getter	setter
then in the nodeinterface define getter and setter which should take as parameters as well as return nodeinterface type

15470501
width	height

superclass	subclassing
then from your superclass you want to have an object of your subclassing which you call the tostring method on so something like

15485873
google-chrome	firefox
just built my new site looks perfect in google-chrome but when viewing it on firefox os there is roughly 15px space at the bottom of the page

15485946
vmware	virtualbox
there is no easy way to tell if you re running in a bare metal or in a virtual computer the best thing you can do is to get some hardware info and made an educated guess for example if the machine have a network adapter which contains microsoft vmware oracle hyper-v virtual or virtualbox most likely it s a virtual machine given that neither microsoft oracle or vmware fabricate network cards

15485949
getter	setter
i really need to set its prototype property to be a different object because of js5 getter and setter

15485949
getter	setter
with this code i can get and set properties on instance using the getter and setter defined in the prototype

15485953
ready	each
should i instead wrap each class contained in each coffeescript file in an on document ready function instead

vb6	vba
office vba is a cut down version of vb6 so why not record some macros in word open the vb editor and look at what it does

google-chrome	firefox
my suggestion would be to first start by inspecting load times under the net tab in either firefox or google-chrome

15486081
pop-up	dialog
i am using jquery dialog for opening pop-up windows on button clicks

15486095
post	get
when posting my form it does not post any values but when i use get it does

15486195
hide	show
the reason double-click is working to show and hide the table is that the first time you click it compares link.innertext which is undefined because that property doesn t exist to + header image 1

15486258
post	put
i ve read a bunch of people s post about wildcards but i am still confuse in terms of where i would put it with my current code

15486285
hide	show
this is my way to hidden the #edit there is a loading image in body when the device is ready it hide edit and show loading image

15486301
httpconnection	downloading
it would seem reasonable to assume that the maven dependency resolver running with the jvm would utilize the httpconnection class of the jvm to downloading the library

15486347
bit-shift	xor
it also supports the bitwise logical operators | and and or xor and not as well as left and right bit-shift and some other utilities

15486389
trie	tree
if your keys are of certain types integers strings etc. you might be able to use a more specific data structure like a trie or van emde boas tree to get extra performance

15486391
getter	setter
i assume that you must add getter setter to your model class and also id field private long id

15486455
shim	polyfills
i d strongly advise using media queries and css3 selectors and then using a shim or polyfills

15486487
qdatastream	qbytearray
i m using qdatastream to populate a quint32 array from a qbytearray on an little-endian arm machine like below

15486503
structuremap	webactivator
if you ve used structuremap before the nuget package nicely adds the resolver and runs initial setup using webactivator

15486509
hide	show
create a link_to for every item in your dropdown and show hide them conditionally based on the value of the dropdown after an onchange event

15486520
children	parent
i want to have a model with 2 fields children and parent

15486541
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
you can enumerate the accessories attached and begin communication via a fileinputstream and fileoutputstream all documented here

15486586
post	get
the way i understand it a generic view considers three states get post - valid post - invalid

15486595
width	height
the width and height of the dragged item seems to depend on where it s being dragged from - i can only drag it from a rather small area but i need a bigger preview

15486621
air	flashdevelop
i m working on a mobile air app using flash pro cs6 and flashdevelop 4.3.0

15486623
post	get
please read the guidelines on how to post appropriate question so you can get the best of the community

15486658
min	max
i need to restrict user input according to specified a min max and increment

15486664
int	chars
i thought that the truncation was happening in implicitly casting unsigned chars to chars but cong xu pointed out that int constants are assumed to be signed and any one greater than 0x7f gets promoted from chars to int

15486664
int	chars
by using the suffix u i can specify an unsigned int constant and if it s no greater than 0xff it will be an unsigned chars

15486673
min	max	range	max	range	min
in essence it means that for integers by default there is no min max value range since any integer can be represented

15486709
mdpi	hdpi	screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi
layout-sw320dp 320dp - a typical phone screens 240x320 ldpi 320x480 mdpi 480x800 hdpi etc

15486709
tablet	mdpi
layout-sw720dp 720dp - a 10 tablet 720x1280 mdpi 800x1280 mdpi etc

15486751
width	height
it is very easy to make a view s width always be a fixed proportion of its height

15486777
xslt	xquery
most xslt and xquery workloads involve a finite vocabulary that is the set of element and attribute names and the namepool will expand until it holds this vocabulary and will then remain stable

15486801
qtableview	qabstracttablemodel
i have a qabstracttablemodel displayed by a qtableview

15486804
int	double
the queue will contain a message objects each one of which will have a double timestamp as well as an int counter which keeps track of how many acknowledgments have been received for that message

15486850
width	height
i want the image to take up 100 of the width or height i guess whichever is larger

15486879
google-chrome	firefox
works in firefox and google-chrome though

15486886
width	height
you can of course also reverse this if you wish to match a container s height instead of width

15486886
width	height
as pburgess suggests if you wish your image to match either width or height you need to declare both

15486909
switching	screens
your audio plays even with the screens locked and with the ring silent switching set to silent

15486939
ddms	adb
use an emulator and ddms or adb pull see this blog post for a shell script for the latter

15486940
put	get
the getbucket function works fine and retrieves a result when i host the php app myself but when i put the exact same code into a aws ec2 instance default aim - linux apache php i get the following error

15486979
terminate	timeout
these hung sockets don t seem to timeout die or otherwise terminate

15486988
post	get
the only obvious problem i know of it that the server being queried uses get instead of post

15486998
min	max
should setunknowntokenboundaries be updated to pick the min max among all of the children instead of just using the first and last child

15487005
nsurl	nsstring
nsurl url nsurl urlwithstring nsstring stringwithformat

15487016
range	max
i solved the issue by setting the max x range value to be a small number 3

15487033
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari this works with no issues but ie10 for windows 8 when run from the start opens the link in a new tab instead

15487057
spaces	delimiter
your question is a bit vague so i make the assumption that the fields are delimiter by a spaces for cut and a in awk

15487081
chunked	transfer-encoding
for some reason whenever there is no data the content-length header is present but when i send back a body a transfer-encoding chunked header is present instead of the content-length header

15487081
chunked	transfer-encoding
i have read that the existence of a transfer-encoding chunked header will override any content-length header but i can t figure out how to remove the transfer-encoding header or even why it is there in the first place

15487101
for-loop	loops
in addition i noticed you start your for-loop with so if your historysize is 2 loops iterates only one times

15487138
children	parent
if you wish to cache use whatever you want caching of query somewhere store all children in parent as a flat list of pks but don t forget to handle new entities to update this list

15487144
put	get
what should i put so that every time i get whole fresh data

15487158
isnull	nvl
according to your database use nvl isnull ifnull

15487176
homography	keypoint
my program finds keypoint and matches them correctly but when i try to use findhomography + perspectivetransform to find new corners for the image usually returns some nonsense type values though sometimes it returns correct homography

15487204
google-chrome	firefox
i can t figure out why this gradient isn t working in google-chrome firefox ie

15487360
textview	imageview
so what i want to achieve is when i press click-able imageview week 1 it hides the textview hinttext and executes weekone.xml on the same activity

15487371
put	get
i am using the php and mysql to create a profile page using the get methode to get the username from the url like this so i used the .htaccess but the problem was that the root folder where i put the .htaccess was disappear and i get an error msg from the browser

15487387
post	get
this webapp works with post and an api call get looks like

15487402
mp3	wav
all my sound clips are in mp3 so i do not really feel like translating them tp wav

15487407
for-loop	loops
use a normal for-loop instead of a foreach so that you get an explicit loops counter

15487411
int	double
i m running hive 0.10.0 and getting the same error as you col_b col_a looks like a double but should be an int

15487411
int	double
if either col_a or col_b are double or you want the result to be floating point division ignore everything else i said and just change 0 to 0.0 so it no longer looks like an int to hive

15487460
keydown	keyup
i have tried the change keyup keydown functions but they still do not seem to clear the textbox of the last value entered

15487463
fuzzy	stemming
my solution was to rewrite the prohibited clauses using the standardanalyzer which don t do stemming fuzzy

15487529
ftp	telnet	tftp	telnet

serializable	deserialization
first it s worth to test whether the serializable deserialization works really as expected

15487571
super	self
self super initwithstyle --------uitableviewcellstylesubtitle------- reuseidentifier reuseidentifier

15487583
portrait	landscape
i ve created a master detail application using the ios 5 sdk intending to have a uiviewcontroller displayed modally when the device is portrait and a uisplitviewcontroller when the device is landscape

15487583
portrait	landscape
but the uisplitviewcontroller never gets the rotation event so ends up in it s portrait mode within the landscape window

15487609
tweetsharp	twitterizer
i have tried various tutorials such as those using open source libraries twitterizer tweetsharp etc and i am completely lost which leads me to believe i am missing some fundamental concepts

15487668
width	height
requirement print a receipt which is of a4 width and half of a4 height and print it rotated so it can be printed on continuous a4 ccp

15487668
portrait	landscape
create custom paper size defined as 210 x 147 and print portrait and landscape

15487668

hide	show
so far the jquery code i have will show the div clicked but the hide part wont work

15487715
put	get
i put this now but i still get the same results

15487716
getattr	subclassing
so the major difference between __name and _name for your private internal names is that __name will become a major pita whenever you start wanting to use getattr or hasattr even within the correct class dynamically attach methods or have a subclassing that does want to share the private name

15487750
uiview	subviews
this works i see my alert uiview upon subviews the host view

15487750
uiview	subviews
so apparently i m only getting a good result when i merely display one 1 uiview the alertview upon subviews of the uicontroller s view

15487758
for-loop	arrays
then after you complete the inner for-loop over the newarray check boolean to see if no matches were found then push to other arrays

15487858

force and test merge are handwork checkbox and button on next step not automated

15487970

depending on the application onblur or onchange

15488115
installation	upgrade

15488200
hash	salt
when i put an echo statement for unhashpass or salt before the hash it works but after it does nothing the whole php script just gives me a white screen

15488202
oncreate	setcontentview
in fact setcontentview which you are using in oncreate internally calls something very similar to place your xml in the main application window

15488230
getter	setter
this is a very common mistake among newcomers in oop programming and it can be solved quickly by fixing your getter and setter so that the original instance is never shared outside of your object like in following example

15488230
getter	setter
for example following code is buggy and hard to debug when applying your currently broken getter setter

15488231
google-chrome	firefox
i ve been testing locally on ie9 google-chrome and firefox on a 1920 x 1080 resolution and it the header looked fine

15488276
versioning	upgrade
i try to upgrade the php versioning to 5.4.4 which apparently isn t the most simple thing todo

15488320
goto	break
goto in a loop or in any block of code break the loop block

15488332
bash	zsh
also this depends on your shell being a standard posix bourne-shell derivative sh bash ksh zsh all qualify

15488335
maven-assembly-plugin	pom.xml
modify the application client s pom.xml in order to use maven-assembly-plugin for obtaining a jar with dependencies

15488376
folder	directory
if your vendor directory is not relative to your project folder which is what i presume git is managing then git will never be aware it exists

15488376
folder	directory
you would need to create the folder somewhere underneath the root directory that git is managing

15488387
serializable	deserialization
also have a look here c# xml serializable deserialization

15488420
sudo	passwd
it works with the following repository notation but i have to enter a the passwd for the user git sudo -u gitlab -h git clone git localhost home git repositories gitolite-admin.git tmp gitadminab

15488429

this was captured on firefox but it behave exactly the same in google-chrome and opera

15488446
google-chrome	firefox
now when i go on windows here is what i see in firefox google-chrome both are most recent versions

15488450
jax-ws	saaj
it can be used by any true web service api like jax-ws or saaj if you manage to force saaj to work that way

15488450
jax-ws	saaj
nowdays forget about saaj use jax-ws + mtom support which is provided by most jax-ws implementations

15488467
pascal	delphi
i have looked into the internet and did not found any code example for dfs depth first search nor bfs breadth first search in object pascal so i may implement them in delphi

15488486
maven	pom.xml
maven signals that there is no servlet-api dependency in your pom.xml

15488527
allocator	stl
i d like to use this scheme to define a custom allocator for stl containers

15488527
allocator	stl
in fact if my understanding is correct an stl allocator should support rebinding from a type t to a type u because containers like or other node-based containers like std map use allocator to allocate nodes that are not actually of type t but of different type u containing t and other header overhead information for the node

15488579
min	max
adding a min and max width to the fixed columns and making the width auto on the central column

15488590
min	max
you may want to set min and max font sizes but i don t see the point

15488671
hash	md5
i think the best approach if you don t want to implement push which is not too had but certainly will take you longer than an hour... is to create a md5 hash of the json content and hash the new json enabling a very quick and accurate determination of whether or not something changed

15488698
oncreate	onstart	prepare	execute
in other words and in a simple manner the main ui does have a message queue already prepare and that s why you don t see that error when calling new handler within oncreate onstart onresume etc... but for any worker thread created the system needs a queue to send the messages to when using handlers although the code doesn t show it i bet that code is being execute in a worker thread either normal thread or doinbackground method of an asynctask and that s what causes the error to avoid it remember to always call looper.prepare before creating a handler from a worker thread

15488729
maven	pom.xml	nexus	artifactory
if it can t find the artifact then it reads your pom.xml parent pom.xml super pom.xml user level setting.xml global setting.xml - in that order to find external repositories to download the artifacts from usually these repo are either directly from the internet like the pre-configured default maven repositories or local private repo managers like nexus artifactory

15488729
nexus	artifactory
i would recommend artifactory much better than the nexus

15488758
winpcap	jpcap
this has to be done at least the first time that you run jpcap after the system has been restarted so that the winpcap library is authorized to access network resources

integer	fractions
this question seems to be equivalent to yours finding the closest integer fractions to a given random real

15489736
implements	extends
it s not so useful though a far more useful solution would be to have them either extends a common class or implements a common interface

15489746
google-chrome	firefox
however this is supported in firefox ie10 and google-chrome not for ie10

15489791
folder	directory
for example the following batch file open the cmd prompt when it is executed via a double click in the explorer go to a specific directory c program files and run an exe in that folder

15489817
queue	fifo
i haven t used queue or stack classes but you ll see the q lists are fifo and the s lists are lifo

15489838

hash	hmac
it is considered safe to include timestamps user ids in the token as long as they are encrypted with a strong symmetric secret key like aes blowfish etc that only the server has and as long as the token includes a tamper-proof hash with it such as hmac which is encrypted with the secret key along with the user id timestamp

15490642
hash	hmac
if you don t include the hmac or other hash in the encryption then it is possible for users to tamper with the encrypted token and have it decrypt to something valid

15491034
outputstream	inputstream
for a typical synchronous service you would write a request message to the socket outputstream and then try to read the reply message from the inputstream

15491036
serializable	deserialization
viewstate while it does not use as much memory on the server as session or cache still requires serializable deserialization on the server requiring some temporary memory usage in addition to providing your users a large payload of data on each request to from the server just take a peek at view source in any browser and you ll see a very large hidden input with base-64 encoded data

15491036
serializable	deserialization
session generally isn t a good idea either as it also requires serializable deserialization which adds additional overhead in addition to the strain on memory per user

15491050
qtcpsocket	qdatastream

15491121
free	malloc
i have dynamic memory allocation with malloc but i have no free s in my program

15491121
free	malloc
you need to fix this problem first by adding a matching call to free for each call that you have to malloc

15491121
free	malloc
but when you go over your code searching for all of the calls to malloc in order to match them up with a corresponding call to free that s also a good time to check and make sure that each of your calls to malloc are correct

15491139

15492088
google-chrome	safari
i created a simple app controller and used it to get your template code up and running here - tried in both google-chrome and safari in both cases app works with no js errors

15492109
skip-lists	tree
if you plan to add and remove keys from the dictionary continuously you really want something that uses an appropriate data structure for the problemâ not a hash table or a hash table plus a list as with the sortedordereddict -type recipes but a balanced tree or an equivalent like a skip-lists

15492109
skip-lists	tree
if you re dealing with one of the rare cases where the tree performance really is critical you should probably look at the various red-black tree splay tree skip-lists etc

15492117
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
that s ie 10 firefox 4 google-chrome 10 and safari 6

you must ensure that you add a name attribute value to form elements if you want to reference their values on the server following a post or get request

15492339
restrict	shared
load data infile query is much better option but some servers like godaddy restrict this option on shared hosting so only two options left then one is insert record on every iteration or batch insert but batch insert has its limitaion of characters if your query exceeds this number of characters set in mysql then your query will crash so i suggest insert data in chunks withs batch insert this will minimize number of connections established with database.best of luck guys

15492415
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
if i install application using any of these options per user per machine just me everyone and then install an upgrade versioning with different option then the installer does not detect the earlier versioning and does not uninstall earlier versioning which leads to duplicate entries of same application in control panel as well

15492896
filtering	grouping
a grouping intersects the crossfilter s current filtering except for the associated dimension s filtering

15492896
filtering	grouping
thus grouping methods consider only records that satisfy every filtering except this dimension s filtering

15492896
filtering	grouping
so if the crossfilter of payments is filtering by type and total then grouping by total only observes the filtering by type

decimal	ieee
if a decimal string with at most 15 significant decimal is converted to ieee 754 double precision and then converted back to the same number of significant decimal then the final string should match the original

15493561
decimal	ieee
and if an ieee 754 double precision is converted to a decimal string with at least 17 significant decimal and then converted back to double then the final number must match the original

15493561
decimal	ieee
this gives from 6 to 9 significant decimal digits precision if a decimal string with at most 6 significant decimal is converted to ieee 754 single precision and then converted back to the same number of significant decimal then the final string should match the original

15493561
decimal	ieee

inser is right a span is an inline element and only gains layout when it has content thus gaining the width and height of its content - in this case the width and height are 0 so not visible to the if you add this css rule

15493731
google-chrome	firefox
scrollbas in google-chrome or firefox does not have handle

15493970
equals	compareto
in cases were the data member is not initialized you are exposed to nullpointerexecption in the equals hashcode and compareto methods

15493983
getter	setter
always access the instance variable directly inside the setter and getter

15494023
width	height
use a constant for width and a variable for height and then use the regular setpreferredsize method

15494036
getter	setter
by default the compiler synthesizes an ivar for that and matching setter and getter

15494044
setinterval	settimeout
you can use either settimeout inside the function or setinterval outside

15494094
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux

if you have an object to put into it instance of short int double etc. use convert.todouble value or if you have a known short or int it will be implicitly converted to a double

the problem is that you re giving it 100 height and 100 width but then you re giving it margin

in reference to your comment here about the sizechanged event not firing that is probably because you have your objects in a stackpanel which will grow shrink to fit the size of it s children not to match the size of it s parent the grid cell

15500904

inherited	properties
i tried several approaches including putting the desired properties on an interface and then use inherited mapping as described on the wiki

15501360
inherited	properties
i know a solution is putting the related properties in a separate object and create a typeconverter straight for that object and use it but refactoring of those pocos is not an option right now and besides it seems strange there isn t a way to make inherited and di work together

multicastdelegate	delegation
i mean if i had a variable of type delegation and another one of type multicastdelegate different method overloads e.g getinvocationlist will be called

15502925
button	checkbox
that said custom styling for checkbox and radio button as opposed to select boxes date pickers etc seems to work pretty well in my testing

since google-chrome never actually pulled the plug out for h264 support firefox kept it as well and is planning better support of the format

15503171
ostringstream	std
of course the easiest and safest solution is just to forget about sprintf and use std ostringstream .

15503193
min	max
you certainly should not be using r.nextint max - min + 1 since that will occasionally give 3 which is an out-of-bounds index

15503193
min	max	range	max	range	min
is appropriate when min and max both need to be included in the generated range of random integers

15503193
range	max
when the desired range is up to but not including max the formula should be

15503193
min	max
my suggestion is to use this but with 0 and 3 substituted for min and max respectively

15503205
width	height
anyway use frame instead of bounds cell.positionedlabel.frame.origin.x or better yet cgrectgetminx cell.positionedlabel.frame because cgrectgetminx will correctly handle nonstandard cgrects like rects with negative width and height

15503229

min	max
nb i know i could just say random.length sample min max 10 but i need the loop in my real code.

15504533
qobject	qwidget
a better way than passing nullptr is to use the qobject tree you are already using assuming that the parent of the networkmanager instance is a qwidget

15504533
qobject	qwidget	qmessagebox	qwidget
if you use nullptr the qmessagebox will appear as centered over the topmost window qwidget rather than the window that actually appeared higher up in the qobject tree of your networkmanager class

i already referenced nunit and moq in a class library project

15506291

you can implement selectmany using collect by applying a map to the collection of children that you want to return for each element of the parent collection

15506291
children	parent
assuming you have some source and want to get children using getchildren for each element in source and then you want to calculate the result using selectresult that takes both child and parent you can write the following using selectmany

folder	directory
okay so essentially what i m doing is i m taking all the directory inside of the servers folder and moving them to a secondary hard drive mounted at media backupdrive

15506835
folder	directory
this script is ran once a day so it makes the directory with the name of the date and should copy the folder directly over there the reason i have to do it this way is because my client has limited disk space on his main hard drive and his worlds are upwards of 6-7gb each

15506835
folder	directory
anyway i can get them to copy the folder to media backupdrive currentdate but then when i try to compress it it says it can t compress an empty directory or something along the lines of that

now the application turns into landscape since it s a tablet and gets this resolution height 800 width 1232

15506904

15507293
width	height
you have enabled the maintain_ratio option so ci will try to create the thumbnail that is as close to the target width and height as possible while preserving the original aspect ratio

15507293
width	height
this corresponds to a 192x143 thumbnail or a 123x92 thumbnail using your specified values for width and height

15507307
downcasting	upcasting
if they choose to type erase it by upcasting it back to basetext then they ll be responsible for recovering the type information correctly either by downcasting the key before retrieval or downcasting the resource afterwards

15507314

or if you can make symmir to output the question and the answer to different streams - one to stdout and one to stderr you can redirect only one of them

15507363
versioning	upgrade
if any of your code uses jquery ui also look at those release notes and upgrade guides for the interstitial versioning

15507363
versioning	upgrade
decide on which versioning you want to be your upgrade target based on the work required to get there whether your project is using any third-party libraries that require a certain versioning of jquery other factors only you can consider etc

15507363
bower	npm
investigate and maybe decide to use a package manager like npm or bower to manage jquery versions and other third party libraries you might use that depend on it

15507363
versioning	upgrade	migrate	upgrade
again once you re past versioning 1.6.4 make sure the migrate plugin is part of your upgrade workflow

15507363
versioning	upgrade
whether or not you plan to upgrade every time there s a new versioning there will be ongoing maintenance tasks and habits that you d probably want to keep as general development best practices

15507363
versioning	upgrade
there should be no breaking api changes within the same major versioning so you should generally be able to upgrade to the most recent minor versioning with minimal effort no refactoring required

15507363
versioning	upgrade
major versioning upgrade require more research more refactoring and more testing

post	put
how has this been done before there are lots of post asking how to do this but none stating best place to put the code

15507596
range	infinity
what i think was wrong is that in the first place there s no way any number can be at the same time less than 1 and more than 1000 so obviously the valid input should be outside the specified range that is from -infinity to 0 or from 1001 to infinity

15507597
spaces	delimiter
by default the delimiter are spaces comma semicolon tab but can be varied to any set of single characters by listing those characters between the and of the clause which would set a b c as delimiter

width	margin	width	height	margin	height
padding adds width and or height to your elements you should handle padding or margin with the children of your li elements

15508271
free	malloc
if you do free a malloc ed region to know whether this causes an munmap or equivalent or brk you have to know the internal state of the malloc as well as how it s implemented

15508275

unfortunately the rss feed on the site only contains summaries of the articles so doing an rss import of that is not particularly useful

15508293
rss	feed
find a wordpress plugin that will handle custom import of individual articles not the rss feed on a large scale

15508293
rss	feed
rewrite the rss feed generator on the news site to include all other pertinent information and not just summaries then import that

i have got this working on firefox google-chrome however on internet explorer gives this error

15508400
stdout	stderr
the started process writes to stdout and stderr and this text needs to be stored somewhere in memory until your process reads it

15508400
stdout	stderr
so you have a classical dead lock here your process waits for the other process to terminate and the other process waits for your process to read from stdout stderr

15508400
stdout	stderr
to solve this you need to start two threads after calling exec that continuously read from stdout and stderr

15508407
filtering	grouping
next you are filtering the list to the rows where ts the max ts for that grouping

15508652
width	height
it validates height width and depth but it ignores quantity

15508692
width	height
to maintain aspect ratio you have to increase both width and height by the same percentage thus we need to take a square root of this 1.3222 this is rounded down at 4th digit

15508692
width	height
multiply your dimension by this receive 3940 4257 totaling 16772580 pixels and both width and height are less than 8192

15508692
width	height
so your image can have at most 3940 width and 4257 height

i tried to pass this value by implementing the unsafe method explained in my original post for error 1 it passes 0x0277aab8 again seems some memory address but could not get connected to it getting serial port timeout errors

15512836
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
note though the os will often do its own processing of tcp and udp packets including sending icmp port unreachable or other responses for ports it doesn t have listeners for ...and doing your own processing on top of that is bound to cause wackiness

for-loop	loops
if we are using the default static scheduling and place pragma on the outer for-loop then each thread will do 25 of the outer loops i work and eqaul amount of inner loops j work hence the total amount of work done by each thread is same

right before openssl_sign function then it displays hello but if i put right after then i get internet explorer error cannot display page connection has been terminated or whatever the message goes.

15513064
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade to the latest versioning of app engine which is usually a good thing and just works

15513073
width	height
note that it would be possible to use the use tag to reference the def but then you loose the very useful height width attributes of the image tag

15513075
google-chrome	firefox
i m at a loss to understand why i m having html elements display in different places in firefox compared to google-chrome and ie

15513075
google-chrome	firefox
i m using position absolute to place the title and subtitle text in a header where i want them to be but there seems to be about a 30px difference in the horizontal position of the text elements between firefox and google-chrome ie

15513095
post	get
therefore the browser initiated a post request which no route satisfied since all my actions are get s

15513110
nsmutablestring	nsstring
your property would probably be better to have the copy modifier rather than retain .â foundation types that have mutable subtypes nsstring has a nsmutablestring subclass are subject to being passed a mutable subclass that can be changed from the outside.â generally this isn t what you want and leads to bugs unless of course you ve asked for an nsmutablestring explicitly and using copy makes sure that whatever you re passed stays that way

15513122
free	malloc
this is the first program i ve written using malloc and free

15513135
hash	salt
in case of my code sample i ll have to store only one hash in the database instead of two password hash + salt hash.

15513151
post	get
therefore the browser initiated a post request which no route satisfied since all my actions are get s

15513158
hash	salt
furthermore if a salt is derived from the password then identical passwords show up as identical password hash

15513158
hash	salt
the whole point of storing a unique independently-generated salt for each password is so that every single password is hash with a unique hash function

15513171
post	put
i have no problems with the post method to add an email_alias or with the put method to move a users folder from one owner to another

15513209
int	chars
if you use stringbuilder which you should generally use when you want a modifiable string then you can just use stringbuilder.setcharat int chars

15513213
autocompletetextview	spinner
there i have a spinner and when i select an item i should set my autocompletetextview from holoeverywhere based on user choice of spinner

15513220
int	double
access to int is often atomic but access to double is usually not

15513225
hash	salt
adding a separate salt is the equivalent of using a different hash function for each password thus you would need a separate rainbow table for each possible salt making the attack extremely expensive

15513268
jar	war
even this is a feature provides the maven war plugin this does not include the src main webapp to that created jar file

15513296
google-chrome	firefox
i looked at your test page in firefox 16 and google-chrome 25 - the div elements are aligning correctly in both browsers

15513353
post	get
now when i run the above script and check off post 10 8 and 4 and press the hidebtn button i get

15513447
hash	salt
could you not just skip out the salt and hash and just create auth_key as a long pseudo-random string

15513484
children	parent
the parent is read only from children

15513565
button	checkbox
but when the user ticks or unticks a checkbox rather than clicking a button

as the title of this post implies when i put it all together the combined version will send strings but it doesn t quit when it is supposed to

15513596
hide	show
i ve a jquery code which show hide some disabled fields based on an user select option

15513609
hash	md5
it s not obvious at first but if it was purely a randomized string of some sort and had no identity tied to it before the md5 hash - then you could have issues where two users end up with the same auth key

15513609
hash	md5
that said md5 will probably work for you but technically should be phased out numerous collisions have been found with it making it no longer viable - try looking into a newer one-way hash such as sha-2

15513618
int	boolean
what i can t figure out is how i can determine using suds whether sortby wants to be assigned a string or an int or a boolean or what

15513620
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
subclassing only inherited variables and methods in the superclass not the other way around

15513631
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
for other browsers like safari google-chrome opera firefox my impl functions just the way i want it to

15513635
hide	show
then use jquery s .show and hide to show or hide them

15513635
hide	show
so then all you would have to do is follow that same convention for identifying additional pages where the ids for the nav div are given like namespace-pagename-type and when you add an additional page name to pagenames the show hide functionality would just work

15513676
explode	implode
using explode - array_pop - implode like this

15513678
folder	directory
i was attempting to write a part of my code that would get the folder in a directory and then use the names of those folder to populate a jlist so that the user could select which folder from the ones in a specific directory they wanted to use

15513704
put	get
the above are steps simply to get the point across - you need to put this common functionality in a place it can be easily accessed by any part of your application

15513718
nsurl	nsdata
in my app i take pictures and put them in a queue for upload i still haven t implemented the upload part but i ll upload array of objects container which consist of nsdata uiimagejpegrepresentation but obviously nsdata s will consume too much memory so i have to come up with something smarter instead of holding nsdata in my container class i want to hold nsurl of the nsdata

15513722
int	chars
so for instance though this all varies based on your implementation s padding behaviour and type sizes it may be expecting a single-byte chars followed by three padding bytes followed by the four-byte binary representation of an int

15513724
content-length	content-type
add at least one header - maybe content-length and content-type

15513730
post	get
i read in another overflow post that adding a query string to the defaultredirect would get rid of the aspxerrorpath which it did but the actual rewrite is still not occurring

15513738

15513794
width	height
i configure the cell with my data object on the fly and then call a method i have on it which calculates the height of the cell with a given table width can t always rely on the cell frame being correct initially

15513794
width	height
this method determines the height by figuring out the correct width of the label and then doing a calculation

15513808
min	max
am trying to get the net changes on cdc enabled table by passing min and max dates

15513808
min	max
but it gets all net changes from min max lsn s

15513808
min	max
what i need is to get min and max lsn of cdc instance for given date and get the net changes for that date

15513868
width	height
the problem is that when setting the window width and height it includes the border in that size so your actual size is smaller than what you specify

15513888
submit	submission
there s no way to do this since when you submit the form you re submission all the fields except checkboxes sometime

15513889
postgresql	mysql
the main reason for use an orm is related to a non functional requirement this is that you need port your application between different rdbms oracle mysql postgresql and reduce the impact of implementation

15513948
udp	tcp
i would prefer to use tcp and or udp but i don t have to

15513957
google-chrome	firefox
other browsers google-chrome firefox seem to run the test correctly on windows 8

15513971

it s up to you to figure out how to use these with the chart axis object min max length left top values in order to calculate or approximate the axis-value of the cursor when the axis is selected

15513972
width	height
try setting width and height to values greater than the crop width and height values

15513981
int	double
normal value types struct or int floats double cannot be null

15513999
temp	tmp
php sessions are often stored in the temp or tmp or var lib php5 directory it varies - although the default session.save_path is set to you can set the location by using

15513999
chown	chmod
if you don t then you would need to adjust the file permissions or change them using chown and or chmod or on your file-system

15514009
google-chrome	firefox
it works as i expected on google-chrome but firefox has a problem in that the image isn t resized

mouse	keyboard
so using val more or less simulates you fiddling with the form elements using the mouse and keyboard

15514049
put	get	post	get	post	put	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari include an origin header on same-origin post put delete requests same-origin get requests will not have an origin header

15514117
width	height
you set the width and height to the panel inside of the window instead

15514187
getter	setter
lesson reinforced should access setter getter rather than accessing their associated local variables when extending classes

15514190
treeview	expander
i need to get something that looks like a listbox with a grouping expander but i have to use treeview for data representation

arduino	teensy
i m using a teensy similar to arduino to send the midi data

15514366
innodb	myisam
the problem is that there could possibly be hundreds of thousands of rows for each category so running rand is out of the question and i would prefer not to create a myisam table that matches my innodb table and then full text search for related

15514371
submit	submission
submission a form by pressing enter without a submit button

15514385
hide	show
if you want you can hide the button by setting the alpha value of the button to 0 and when the textfield is at least one character long then set the button s alpha value to 1 to show the button

15514477
777	tmp
chmod 777 var package tmp package.xml

15514487
hide	show
if you call plot_date and pass in it will set the axes as if the series was plotted but will hide the plot so the data points don t show

15514488
getter	setter
attr_accessor relies on this behaviour and doesn t do anything except define a getter setter

15514612
google-chrome	firefox
been trying for hours to figure out why this doesn t count down in google-chrome but it works fine in ie7 ie8 ie9 firefox and on an android device

15514639
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your oracle client to a versioning that is 10.2.0.4 or later

15514668
google-chrome	firefox
the proxy also works fine cause if i configure proxy in google-chrome or firefox i can access any web page

15514685
for-loop	loops
for-loop where i can create a variable i and have access to i in loops body only

15514708
google-chrome	firefox
and that question begins with what browsers will you be supporting. if ie10+ and latest google-chrome and firefox you should go cors

15514725
express	node.js
i m creating my first project with fineuploader using node.js express and coffeescript

15514745
stdout	stderr
if you just want the script to send output to the file instead of the console use io#reopen to redirect stdout and stderr

15514756
post	get
you are submitting the first form via the get method which puts the values in the url and the second form on the process.php page uses the post method which puts the values in the body of the request and not the url

15514756
post	get
you should use either get or post consistently and for a search engine i d recommend get so that users can pass around links to results you can t bookmark a post ed page

15514786
post	get
basically contains both get and post to be safe make sure there are no conflicting get post params with the same key name

15514787
post	get
you are looking for the geolocation values in the post request when in fact the initial form is sending the values as a get request

15514925
post	put
this forum post on msdn social seems to imply that you cannot put anything in the web root unless you have iis

15514925
folder	directory
you could try changing the virtual directory that ssrs serves from to the webroot itself and place the favicon.ico file in the reporting services report manager folder but i m not sure that will work and i can t test it at the moment

15514932
hide	show
what is normally recommended in the case of modifying multiple styles on a single element is to either do them all at once by adding or removing a class or hide the element do your manipulations and then show it which means only two repaints and possibly reflows

15514947
superclass	subclassing
there s got to be some way to call a superclass method from a subclassing created by type but i m dashed if i can see how

15514951
implements	extends
i believe interfaces are borrowed from java which introduced them to achieve polymorphism classa can be of type ifoo and ibar at the same time without inheriting from multiple abstract classes you can only extends one class but you can implements any number of interfaces

15514956
min	max
the first such object for min makes sense but for max maybe the last such object would make more sense

15514959
hide	show
you need to put some image and hide the title of the button if you dont want title to be show

15514961
width	height	screens	mdpi
2.1 by above if you mean same size on each device then figure out the maximum possible width height on a mdpi 320x480 mdpi emulator for each textview say 100px width and 80px height and is what suits you for the note then in the xml for the textview widget for note use android layoutwidth 100dp android layoutheight 80dp where dp would give you device independent pixel size meaning the size will be adjusted according to the screens density on which the emulator is running

15514991
versioning	upgrade
i would recommend you to upgrade to the latest library which will enable you to use much more features than what you have in your current versioning

15515049
solaris	aix
just like you can write a .zip file on powerpc aix and read it on a sparc solaris and x86 windows so you can write an elf file on any os

15515059
post	get
please lead me to a fast and efficient way to get these post actually i would be having approximately 100 values in the array and that would be inefficient to compare each value with the post

15515123

but honestly i see no point in following the post create put replace patch update philosophy religiously and i see nothing wrong in using only post

15515182
gridview	onclientclick
i cannot perform onclientclick event for my gridview

15515243
hide	show
you can set the layouts to a keyboard shortcut so while again it s not automatic you can map for example tools.loadwindowslayout1 to your layout that show the properties window and tool.loadwindowslayout2 to your layout that hide it and then simply switch between them by hitting your shortcut key

15515244
google-chrome	firefox
i know due to security reasons google-chrome gives me a c fakepath filename and firefox gives me only the filename

i have used the following code to show hide div using javascript function

15515440

you can specify the min max number of matches for a regex token using syntax so you could use a snippet such as this to match either 1-3 or 5 or more digits d surrounded by non-digit characters d

15515537
autocomplete	typeahead
my questions is why does they have this different and how can i repair so that my custom typeahead work perfectly as the built-in autocomplete

15515541
google-chrome	firefox
still there are some browsers like google-chrome and firefox that allows you to send a file using xmlhttprequest but that isn t allowed on some browsers like ie8- so you have to use an iframe in order to make the file ajax uploading work

15515561
google-chrome	safari
i think one could definitely argue that if khtml had never been made neither safari or google-chrome would exist

15515561
webkit	gecko
that means you need to familiarize yourself enough with the code of webkit and gecko enough to understand the design decisions they made but you shouldn t be attempting to copy their design because otherwise you might as well just use their code

15515569
int	double
just wanted to know why was this not happening earlier when used with int and double

15515569

i am able to store an nsobject into a nsmutablearray and display it in the uitableview but i need help understanding how to store the data in nsobject to nsuserdefaults

15515833
nsobject	nsuserdefaults
so my question is given the code i used to define my nsobject and how i store said object to a nsmutablearray how do i store the nsmutablearray to nsuserdefaults on app shut downs

15515915
put	get
when you create an object and displaying it in uitableview you work with the memory address you just fetch the alive object from nsmutablearray while you are trying to save the object in nsuserdefaults and re-run the application you get nothing because the reference will be killed so instead save the data put in your class object inform of string or dictionary

15516020
stdout	stderr
i m trying to write to stdin and read from stdout and stderr from an external program without changing the code

15516029
width	height
you don t need ownerdrawvariable mode or to handle the measureitem event because the width and height of each item cannot vary in this case

15516104
int	chars
put this piece of code inside your catch block to consume the non int chars along with the new line chars which is stays in the buffer hence infinitely printing the catch sysout in the case where you ve given a wrong input

15516170
serializable	deserialization
the problem with using dateutil is that you can t have the same format string for both serializable and deserialization as dateutil has limited formatting options only dayfirst and yearfirst

15516197
keydown	keyup
the difference between keydown and keyup events is that keydown fires before adding the pressed letter to the content and keyup is fired after it

15516199
stdout	stderr
vice-versa for the stdout and stderr pipes

15516199
stdout	stderr
in the parent process simultaneously write to the child s stdin pipe and read from the child s stdout and stderr pipes

15516199
stdout	fflush	fflush	gets
normally when stdout is going to a terminal it s line-bufferedâ it gets fflush after every newline gets written

according to the template hierarchy if you re looking to output an archive of all post under custom post type xyz then you would create a file called archive-xyz.php and put it in your page-templates directory

15516382
for-loop	arrays
add another for-loop to iterate through the arrays value and check if the difference between the value and the outer value is less than 0.01 in which case don t insert the new value into the arrays

15516383
onclientclick	checkboxlist
since i prefer using javascript for validation i have tried onchange onclientclick event for checkboxlist and onclientclick event for submit button but none of them works

15516383
onclientclick	checkboxlist
after initial posting i tried to replace onselectedindexchanged showotherinfo with onclientclick showotherinfo this for checkboxlist

15516385
for-loop	loops
there are other micro-optimizations you could apply like changing the for-loop into a decrementing while loops to save on a compare but you gave no indication that the performance is a problem

15516451
nsscanner	nsstring
if you are trying to sanitize phone numbers with an arbitrary format the approach you re using is reasonable however it would be slightly more idiomatic to use an nsscanner as described in the answer to remove all but numbers from nsstring

15516468

instead of hard coding an int into the left function in the above query i need that int expression to return how many similar chars the two strings share

15527265
g++	gcc
graphicsmagick won t compile on os x 10.7 lion or 10.8 mountain lion with the default llvm gcc g++ compilers

but in the properties pane the onblur onfocus events are null for this element

15527319
jar	war
i just wanted to add that i was using embedded ejb bundled in a jar which is itself linked to my war

15527326
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
after the for-loop check the value of the boolean and if it s still false no swaps were made so the arrays is sorted so break out of the while loops

15527336
int	double
not dim ing currentrow makes it a variant by default but even setting both of them as int or currentrow as byte does not throw an error so using double as the return type is redundant

15527345
int	chars
and i m trying to call the method factcountbycountryid which returns an int when given a 3 chars string

15527358
hide	show
for show hide textboxes you only need to set or

15527373
nexus	artifactory
you have to setup the distribution repository to your private artifact manager nexus or artifactory in your settings.xml

15527400
int	double
dimensioned currentshipment as int double long or variant all worked fine.

15527401
googletest	gmock
i read in the googletest primer that this is possible but that googletest has to be compiled into a dll then and i guess the same thing holds for gmock too

15527420
searchview	autocompletetextview
i did take a look at the implementation of the searchview widget and as i though it uses an autocompletetextview for the text input

15527420
searchview	autocompletetextview
since the autocompletetextview is derived from the edittext widget i don t really understand why the style is working for the edittext but not for the autocompletetextview and therefore for the searchview

15527463
popover	tooltip
for performance reasons the tooltip and popover data-apis are opt in

15527573
width	height
they should have the same height and width as the â œadd new setâ button

x86	mips
according to my understanding you need the system images for mips and x86 only to test native code which was developed using the native development kit ndk

15527882
width	height
on a normal div without height or width it would make the div the entire size of its container

15527882
width	height
putting height and width on that div would constrain it and while it would try to fill its container it would respect the set dimensions

15527913
hash	md5
the hash you re storing is too short for a md5 hash - it s 30 characters long

15528002
width	height
in other words if the image is wider than high the width will be 100 and the height will scale accordingly

15528002
width	height
if the image is higher than wide the height will be 100 and the width will scale accordingly

15528016

15528322
google-chrome	firefox
that was my assumption but when i run the code below in either firefox using firebug or google-chrome and use the built-in dev tools i seem to get the final value of an array rather than the value of the array at that time

15528356
int	chars
instead of that you can compare the int and chars to each other and return that value for instance this code works instead of the return -1

15528406
viewdidload	viewdidappear
then in main s viewdidload or viewdidappear set code1 s text value to that string

15528409
mouseup	mousedown
what you need to use instead is mousedown and mouseup

15528410

hide	show
i m hitting the sections of code that check the checked unchecked property correctly just not getting the actual show hide code correct

15528562
min	max
with the forms scrollbar you can easily link its value to a cell but not its min and max value and those you will want to link to the number of records in your set minus the number of records shown in your table .

15528562
min	max
you will have to set the min and max properties through some code in which case i always prefer the activex control as it interacts with vba much easier imho

15528566
versioning	upgrade

portrait	landscape
sometimes a single or a very few of the views needs to be displayed in portrait or landscape only or in that very orientation that the remaining app does not support

15528854
portrait	landscape
and of course we need to make sure that the device is rotated back to portrait when the view controller in landscape mode is dismissed

15528858
google-chrome	safari
this is not a viable solution yet but with google-chrome and safari you can use writing-mode in css3

15528881
width	height

15528881
width	height
and using minimum height and width fits them on narrow windows

15528882
hive	hdfs
now this would explain why you would see ascii 002 popping up if you were reading the file contents off of hdfs but it looks like you are seeing it from the hive command line interface which should be aware of the collection terminators and therefore use them to separate elements of the array instead of printing them

15528898

15533151
background-color	font-size
even if you re not doing something like changing the background image of a button in fullscreen mode you should always be able to make some trivial little css rule change to one element -- especially if it s something that won t actually be visible like the background-color of an element that s invisible or the font-size of an element that doesn t have any text -- and test for that in javascript

15533157
for-loop	loops
the outer for-loop would rotate through each character in the alphabet maintaining a count which needs to be reset each time the outer loops executes. the inner loops cycles through the hello world string incrementing the counter if the character serving as the current argument of the outer for-loop is found

15533179
int	chars
complement representation used for both chars and int

15533179
int	chars
on the other implementations on which the sign-propagation disappears the promotion of a chars object to int would have zero-extended the 8-bit representation essentially treating it as an 8-bit unsigned quantity

15533179
int	chars
but if plain chars is signed then 0xff an expression of type int is converted to chars -- but since 0xff exceeds char_max assuming the result is implementation-defined

15533657
min	max
it s easy to make question-guess code but on the other hand it d be boring if he d ask you 50 times if your number is 50 starting from 0 so one side of making it more interesting is making a variable for jumps but keep record for max min is important also you can add machine learning over the jump variance to make it intelligent

15533659
laravel	codeigniter
i m new to laravel switched from codeigniter and eloquent orm is still a bit of a mystery at some point

15534214
textview	imageview
i believe that you should replace your textview with a horizontally oriented linearlayout containing an imageview and a textview

15534214
textview	imageview
set the height of the textview to wrap_content and set the scaletype of the imageview to center like this

15534214
textview	imageview
the linearlayout will have the height of the text in the textview and the imageview s scaletype will force the bitmap to be automatically resized during the layout

15534214
textview	imageview
of course you will have to adjust the layout parameters in xml for the linearlayout imageview and textview so they are centered justified and oriented in the exact manner you want

hide	show
if i needed to show or hide an element in the datatemplate based on a boolean property of the viewmodel i could just bind the visibility of the element to the property on the viewmodel and use a converter to return a visibility

15534584
integer	unsigned
probably isn t very helpfully named since i very much doubt the architecture you re using defines an int as an 8 bit unsigned integer additionally you re not initializing this to zero and then later you re writing to only part of it leaving the rest as garbage

15534584
int	chars
why don t you read the value into an actual chars and then simply assign that to an int since this will deal with the conversion for you and will make your code portable

15534594
hide	fadeout
afterwards you would call fadeout or slideup to hide the graphic

15534629

15534933
robocopy	xcopy
but if you re happy with dos commands xcopy robocopy then you may find it much easier just to use exec to run an xcopy robocopy command

15534933
robocopy	xcopy
the example shows pretty well how to do what you want but in your case you can probably just replace the command attribute with the entire xcopy robocopy command or even the name of a batch file you want to use so you won t need to set up the itemgroup etc

15535554
hide	show
note to be able to show hide everything as a unit like this i m assuming that you use a single uiview object in interface builder as the container sized and placed where you want it and then add your controller buttons as sub-objects inside that single view

15535554
hide	show
this allows you to show hide everything by just setting .hidden property for the containing view

15535608
children	parent
i have a record structure where i have a parent record with many children records

post	get
i thought that maybe the issue was with the post data so i tried to do a get request using the twebbrowser but it still froze on me

15536038
post	get
also while in the twebbrowser - if i hit the start over button which clears most of the post get data and then enter it all in myself and then process the information it works every time without freezing

15536038
post	get
so the only thing i can come up with is that the freezing only seems to occur when sending post get data via the twebbrowser.

15536046

15536596
hide	show
there s a drop down selection which show hide rows in the table depending on the selection

15536596
google-chrome	firefox
my code is working just the way i want it in ie9 but in google-chrome and firefox every time a row that was previously hidden is shown the contents of the row are shifted way out of position

15536710
width	height
when you resize a window you implicitly set the aspect ratio of the viewport with your call to glviewport 0 0 width height

15536710
width	height
however for calls like glortho or glfrustum the viewing frustum s aspect ratio is controlled by the width and height of the viewing volume

15536710
width	height
taking the orthographic case you mention and the same discussion works for perspective projections the width of the viewing volume here right - left similarly the height is top - bottom and the ratio of those two quantities is the viewing volume s aspect ratio

15536710
width	height
we do that by either modifying the width or the height of the viewing volume based on the viewport s aspect ratio which is what you see in the code you provided

15536764
hide	show
this code assumes you set up the xib for this rootviewcontroller with the toolbar and bar button that you wish to hide show later

i have a simple server program written in c and the program is running on an ubuntu linux distribution

15538098
int	double
you re trying to print double variables with d printf then will take the memory of double or part of it as memory of int variable since printf use va_list as a pointer to arguments if you assign a inappropriate format the type of arg point will go wrong too

15538110
int	double
also everyone else has mentioned that you re using d to print double instead of f d is an int format string so i ll mention it too because it s part of the problem

15538114
google-chrome	safari
it occurs in google-chrome and safari

15538153
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox inspectors i ve read that this could be caused by jquery but the last jquery scripts to load are the ones for the slider as far as i m aware

getter	setter
along with the moveleft moveright movedown rotateleft rotateright printgame and getter and setter for all fields

15538261

16-bit	64bit
the same logic for 16-bit or 64bit machines

15538302
submit	submission
since you re submission manually from jquery try preventing the default event of the button which also submit the form

15538303
hide	show
if you just want to show and hide the columns as needed then you can try the following

i have done a lot of automated ui-testing using other tools that work by introspecting the windowing toolkit swing swt native windows and found that sikuli runs much slower than those however that is understandable given the amount of image-processing it needs to do behind the scenes

15538521
sorting	filtering
for example uniques may be obtained avoiding countif index and match with data sort filtering â advanced copy to another location selected unique records only checked and copy to set to c1 though my version is a bit temperamental and at present also requires deleting c1 and sorting

sorting	filtering
but with sorting select a b data sort filtering â az then subtotal can be used insert a new row as row1 select a b data outline â subtotal ok ok defaults are probably as required at each change in column a use function sum add subtotal to column b replace current subtotals summary below data then click on small â 2â at the top left

the problem is that though the mp4 and webm files play perfectly in google-chrome ie the ogg code does not work at all in firefox

m2e	pom.xml
the eclipse m2e plugin this is a simplification reads the pom.xml file and translates it into instructions for eclipse so that eclipse can do its thing

15539325
maven	m2e
some more advanced maven actions with plugins are not supported by m2e and so those actions just won t happen

15539325
maven	m2e
some simple stuff like the classpath is different from how maven does things -- m2e uses the test classpath no matter what because eclipse can t predict what you ll want to run

15539325
maven	m2e
if you just want to develop a maven project i find the m2e integration works very well

for-loop	arrays
you can use a mutable arrays to store all your 200 addresses and run a for-loop to limit the sending request less than 50 like 20 or 30 depends on your arrays count of address arrays

15548826
for-loop	loops
and divide with your limit to decide how many times this for-loop should loops if you have 200 address then if you divide with 20 so that total 10 times your for-loop will run and each run it will send 20 addresses for geocoding

15548885

put	get
i noticed that i get exactly the same result if i simply put the callback url into the browser directly without any parameters supplied

15549210
width	height
the solution to maximize the chart is to set the theme to maximized as described in the google api or to set the width and height of the chart area to 100 percent if you don t have any outside labels or a legend

15549228
post	get
ok i switched the devise authentication s log out to post request to get rid of caching problems and used following angular.js code

15549466
post	get
i used name age and address as example variables and got some of the answers kind of working but i still can t get it completely working so i should post the whole code

the answers given i kind of got to work except the reader is separating the variables by spaces and in a situation like name and address both have spaces in them the spaces delimiter isn t giving me the results i need

15549497
free	malloc
only those objects allocated manually with malloc must be free d very uncommon in c++

15549497
free	malloc
also do not use free and malloc in c++ - use new and delete instead

15549501
for-loop	arrays
you can do a for-loop to iterate over your cell arrays and extract the necessary cells one by one and store each one in a different variable

15549539
min	max
child 512 is required and has min and max occurrence of 1 and marks the beginning of a new record node

15549623
post	get
basically it doesn t matter if you use post or get

15549623
post	get
but http says that you use get if you want to retrieve data from the server and use post if you want to send data to the server

15549626
width	height
my site is responsive so i don t mention height or width in my html or svg and then i set in my css

15549636
post	get
in any case both session and post would be a great improvement to your security in comparison to get that s for sure

15549639
listview	gridview
also works very well in a recyclerview listview gridview

15549639
imageview	fresco
fresco uses drawee s to display images you can think of them as of imageview s

15549655
postgresql	mysql
mysql supports substr on numeric values but not postgresql

15549658
post	get
post is as unsecure as get

15549678
try-catch	exception-handling
if that code were to throw an exception-handling then it wouldn t be caught by the try-catch statement surrounding the call to the async method since control will have already left that try-catch statement by the time the exception-handling is thrown

15549679
implements	extends
this is used in public class gui_controller extends canvas implements keylistener runnable

15549770

inherited	subclassing
a subclassing does not inherited the private members of its parent class

15549949
superclass	subclassing	public	protected
however if the superclass has public or protected methods for accessing its private fields these can also be used by the subclassing

15549974
public	protected
only by using the public default protected accessor methods defined in class a

15550115
google-chrome	firefox
i have checked it in firefox and google-chrome

15550164
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome ie 10 and safari it produces the following layout

i tried to put a keychain so it will give only once for a device but if someone takes another device and logs in with their account which they bought the game they will get the points again

15550234
google-chrome	firefox
used google-chrome firefox

15550237
apache	nginx
this is inefficient to serve static files it s more efficient to serve allow a web server like apache or nginx to serve them directly without going through any python code

15550247
inherited	subclassing
for technical reasons dateproperty and timeproperty are subclassing of datetimeproperty but you shouldn t depend on this inherited relationship and note that it differs from the inherited relationships between the underlying classes defined by the datetime module itself

15550280
hide	show
so another thing to be careful of when show or hide give unexpected results check the nesting of divs you re trying to show

15550282
button	checkbox
i have a button to trigger the popover and a checkbox on the popover

15550284
floating-point	fractions
also took some time to work out that where it says ole automation date is implemented as a floating-point number whose integral component is the number of days before or after midnight 30 december 1899 actually means on or after 1899-12-30 00 00 00 and that the fractions component represents the time on that day divided by 24

15550320
getdate	dateadd
i know mysql has it s own functions equivalent to sql servers date functions getdate datediff dateadd and day

15550327
post	get
you could bypass the check by using a request wrapper which returns post instead of get for getmethod

15550353
jquery	simplemodal
i am using jquery simplemodal

15550428
wcftestclient	basichttpbinding
this request works with wcftestclient wcf webservice with basichttpbinding

when ng-include or ng-view or other angular constructs are used to pull in additional content after the initial page load that content will be compiled by angular before it is displayed

15550689
hide	show
if they click yes the text box remains hidden or hide if they had clicked no and show it

15550721
boost	eigen
note that for c c++ improving compilation time is sometimes limited because of headers included through the preprocessor in particular when using header-only libs for instance boost eigen which hopefully will be replaced by the proposal of modules in a technical review of c++11 or eventually in c++1y

15550731
implements	extends
i would make a new widget extends in this example an absolute panel that implements the hasclickhandlers interface like this

15550763
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
put the uitabbarcontroller as rootviewcontroller on viewwillappear check if the login has been made if not just show the login s uiviewcontroller

15550784
int	double
in the first case int int result is still int then convert int to double

15550789
spaces	delimiter
i am new to fortran and i need to write a code that would allow me to read a text file .dat containing an array of data 1876 columns x 3126 rows with irregular spaces irregularly delimiter and write it to a new file with consistent formatting

15550797
portrait	landscape
once they click on that video they can change the orientation to either portrait or landscape

15550813
int	double
in the second case you are evaluating a double double expression which will evaluate to a double value hence preserving the fractions and int parts

15550836
switching	screens
we had a really heavy application thousands of controls it was an aircraft cockpit all in wpf each button switching screens were movable by gesture or mouse

15550861
children	parent
it s a long standing problem when using core data to-many-relationships that it is very hard to sort a fetch request using nssortdescriptor on a parent entity based on the number of children are in a one-to-many relationship to a child entity

15550931
express	node.js
i have an node.js express app that serves as an rest api for emberjs restadapter

15550973
getter	setter
in java we use setter to be able enforce new invariants without breaking code and getter to return safe data but in c# you can always rewrite foo into this

15550979
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari no lines appear at all which is the desired outcome

15551020
superclass	subclassing
single table - where all the classes both subclassing and superclass are mapped in a single table that has as columns all the fields from all the classes

15551027
google-chrome	firefox
it did work fine in firefox and google-chrome though

15551030
getter	setter
the getter and setter of a property including automatic ones have a method call cost

15551031
getter	setter
the setter and getter methods are generated automatically for you as well as a backing field for the actual value

15551033
lisp	racket
i am learning racket a scheme-like lisp and i have tried to do something like apply + 1 2 but without using apply and i failed

15551054
rss	feed
i am currently working on a mobile app where i want to be able to take say 4 rss feed and then combine them into one feed so that i can use them with buzzbox sdk

15551054
rss	feed
i have setup buzzbox and got it working with one feed but i think the inbuilt rsstaskreader only accepts one take at a time so i can only use one rss feed

15551054
rss	feed
if someone could tell me how to either hook into some sort of api that will let me generate one rss feed from many or use buzzbox s built in rsstaskreader with multiple rss feed that would be great as i am stuck on this at the moment s

15551076
width	margin
you need to set a negative left margin equal to one half of the width of the element such as

15551087
accessor	properties
1 you can add private accessor to get or set and control access to properties

15551101
iboutlet	ibaction
you can then control -drag or right-click-drag from the button down to assistant editor window and create either an outlet an iboutlet or an action an ibaction

15551136
onkeydown	onblur
because i am having some problems about when using onblur onkeydown for tabs etcetera

15551143
letter-spacing	fontfamily
among other things there can be subtle differences in letter-spacing kerning anti-aliasing sub-pixel anti-aliasing and even specific fontfamily glyph choices not just across operating systems but even browsers

15551150
screens	tablet
in this case at times it would be useful for the second screens to be showing part of what is on the main tablet s display

15551173
for-loop	arrays
then to operate coordinates you can tour your arrays with for-loop

15551180
mouseup	mousedown
one refinement is to keep track of the location of the mouse click on the - mousedown and see that the delta on the mouseup location is small 5 points or less in both the x and the y

15551184
width	height
the issue is that height and width of anchor doesn t change

15551188
getter	setter
my entity has the tipo property setter + getter

15551215
width	height
inline elements can t have width and height

15551215
width	height
so if you want inline elements to maintain it s native property be in the normal flow of line and still have width height and vertical-align properties

15551251
for-loop	arrays
if you first specify a list of all the denominations that you have and then you can use a for-loop to iterate through each of the denominations and then use a list comprehension to output an arrays of substrings

15551271
inherited	subclassing
you need to configure inherited at the base class level and it can t be overridden at the subclassing level

15551312
post	get
but will occur before any calls to your post get method in your serverresource

15551336
folder	directory
but when i click â œtry the demoâ it takes me to xampp default web root shows directory listing of this folder

15551338
button	checkbox
the problem i see with your approach above is that your radio button and checkbox are defined in your view

15551338
button	checkbox
then your viewmodel you will need to define a prop for a single selected option from a dropdown or a radio button list or a collection of the selected option from a checkbox list

15551382
inherited	subclassing
type inherited means that when you have a base class t and two subclassing of t s and c that s and c are incompatible types because they cannot safely be resolved to each other

15551417
uitableview	nsindexpath
implement the uitableviewdelegate method - cgfloat tableview uitableview tableview heightforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

15551448
google-chrome	firefox
i does what s expected in firefox but not in google-chrome

15551499
width	height
combined with the hosted window width and height you now have the bounds of the window

15551501
mp3	ogg
someone suggested to convert the mp3 -file to an ogg -file what would make it possible to loop it without having a pause

15551528
post	get
ensuring the data matches your criteria in php so that people who just post to your server without ever using your page don t get away with injecting all manner of fun stuff they weren t supposed to be able to do

15551531
google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome and firefox where i get

15551621
google-chrome	safari
when i manually put localhost 3000 #about into the browser address bar it opens up to the correct spot in the page in google-chrome and safari

15551639
qevent	qwidget
to get that you will have to override qwidget changeevent and then check if the event is of type qevent languagechange and then set the required strings for that qwidget accordingly don t forget the tr while doing so

15551661
width	height
- width height are from the 2d array

15551693
range	max
this is great for undo and versioning but not for requirement #1 because you cannot get the changes within a date range and then find the max value without calculating most of it in ruby

15551701
filesystems	ntfs
my software requires reading filestreams directly via the ntfs filesystems so i have set filestreameffectivelevel to a value of 3

15551715
children	parent
the above assumes all projects are located in the same directory parent project next to children but you can change relative paths as you wish

15551735
stdout	stderr
the output is being piped to stderr and stdout - to see it you ll also need communicate

15551761
rss	feed
so the parsing part is similar for all of the links all links are json feed from rss

15551821
jtextpane	jeditorpane
you need to set the content type of the jtextpane to text html jeditorpane api

15551851
gson	jackson
4.caches results in json with both jackson and gson or xml or flat text files or binary files even using orm lite

15551885
jerkson	jackson
use jerkson - this is a wrapper library over jackson

15552046
post	get
the image is a google image chart generated according to parameters passed through get or post to

15552046
post	get
here is how i use post to get the example chart complete code you may want to copy it and run

15552053
express	node.js
using node.js express passport-http

15552053
post	get
i can hit the get route with digest without issues and i can hit the post route with basic auth without issues but when i try to do the post with digest auth i m getting 400 - bad request

15552053
content-length	content-type
it looks like curl puts the content-type on the initial digest request with a content-length of 0 so it knows enough not to send the json body on the initial digest-auth request and my side express fails with invalid json empty body

15552079
g++	gcc
just run this g++ commands when compiling main.cpp assuming you are using gcc

15552082
google-chrome	safari
now i want to execute the first just in google-chrome and safari and the second in other browsers

15552090
pop-up	dialog
the dialog widget is the actual datepicker that pop-up

15552124
rss	feed
you could read the multiple rss feed with the use of rome

15552124
rss	feed
and then combine the entities to generate a new rss feed

15552156
put	get
i d prefer not to mark my own answer as accepted so refine my suggestion and put it into you own answer and i ll promise to mark one of those as accepted if i get any good ones

15552162
min	max
i m trying to count the lines in a file then build arrays from the data and display arrays of max and min values form user inputs

15552201
google-chrome	firefox
when i run it into the browser latest google-chrome or firefox but this doesn t matter i notice a consistent slowdown when passing from the 7th to the 8th tab in the latter i put a jtable with a custom tablemodel in that tab and in eclipse it runs just fine

15552208
int	double
you have to cast the int division to double

15552219
getter	setter
at the moment i d put all my object attributes into a private structure like mamanbarprivate register it with g_type_class_add_private and define properties getter setter to access them

15552259
post	get
when i use this code to get specific category post on my front home page

15552306
public	protected
try by making the event handler public void instead of protected just to see

15552310
union	distinct
once you do this you may not need the union all or the select distinct

15552328
width	height
each block should be 50 of the width and 50 of the height of the container two on the top and two on the bottom

15552328
width	height
i ve tried to make four div elements with 50 height and width and i ve tried to place four images with 50 height and width

15552357
hide	show
this code show the paragraph first and hide it when clicked on toggle

15552494
int	boolean
this exploits the boolean cast to int as 0 or 1

15552495
inherited	subclassing
but native hibernate support regarding inherited mapping is more powerful than standard jpa and single table per class hierarchy or table per subclassing mapping strategies are more suitable for polymorphic queries and associations than table per concrete class strategy

15552524
button	checkbox
what i need is very specific i want when the user presses the menu button and the optionsmenu appears with combine option to dynamically draw a checkbox over each grid item in order to multi-select some items very much like in gallery but with objects instead of images and then combine them

15552532
portrait	landscape
on a device running 5.1 for example if you open the app and hold the phone in the correct landscape right position you will see the view rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise as if it think it s supposed to be in portrait mode unless you add something like this

15552570
width	height
scale the images up to be the same size before applying the rounded corners method otherwise if you pass in a different image with different width height the rounded corners will look quite different depending on what image is passed in

15552598
width	height
since you don t have a set width height for your element that just means its wrapping behavior is changed

15552669
min	max
i have a widget with validation params such as min and max

15552691
google-chrome	firefox
i m using bassistance jquery.validation and it works on firefox and google-chrome but not on mobile and ie

15552691
google-chrome	firefox
the examples on the website works fine but once in my project only firefox and google-chrome

15552722
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
uinavigationcontroller - uiview - uitabbarcontroller

15552727
salt	md5
for example username_for_cookie md5 username . salt

15552782
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in both google-chrome and firefox the correct option is selected and all relevant placeholders reflect the selection

15552788
adium	ichat
however when sending that same sequence of messages to a user on ichat or on adium all of the hi s get shown

15552858
try-catch	exception-handling
try to use a try-catch block with your code to test if it is launching some exception-handling

15552954
for-loop	loops
also i d recommend a standard for-loop instead of a for..in loops

15552964
ubuntu	linux
i am working from my schools computer in ubuntu linux and was wondering what i need to do to link a local copy of glew in my project

15552964
sdl	glew
my school s computers has sdl gl and glu installed of course so linking with them is easy but they do not have a copy of glew installed and i don t have the user rights to move my compiled glew into the appropriate folders for easy linking

15553010
prepare	execute
the data is sent completely separately from it as you execute queries on the prepare statement

15553050
addeventlistener	preventdefault
ie8- use attachevent instead of addeventlistener and e.keycode instead of e.which and there is no preventdefault but you can use return false

15553078
bmp	png
save it into a different format png or bmp and look at the array for that one instead

15553135
width	height
absolute vs relative position width height

15553155
portrait	landscape
this is due to the creation of the view for the orientation if you are in portrait mode and you change to landscape it creates again the view and you need to set the onclicklistener again

15553155
portrait	landscape
the same happens if you start the activity in landscape mode to portrait

15553157
folder	directory
i installed git extensions on my friend s pc windows 7 did the same steps as above but when going to that directory none of the folder or files have green or red ticks

15553172
squash	branch
when done i squash the commits and rebase them into current thematic branch

15553186
post	get
try sending the content via post rather than a get there s no universal limit in theory

15553201
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
my intention is to have this for-loop echo 50 consecutive arrays values 0 -- 50 but stop if array_position reaches the end of the arrays before all 50 loops iterations complete

15553218
width	height
the solution should handle grids of arbitrary width and height

15553254
post	get
after installing .net 3.5 sp1 you may get validation of viewstate mac failed exceptions when doing post backs on asp.net pages

15553292
for-loop	loops
i think that the solution here is to create a regular for-loop syntax within blade to handle loops

15553310
profiling	instrumentation
in order to attach a debugger to your app or use instrumentation the provisioning profiling needs to contain entitlements that allow this

15553310
profiling	debugging
the development provisioning profiling and certificates which you generate in the portal allow you to do this debugging whereas the release profiling for the app store disable it

15553310
profiling	debugging
this is why you have both release and debugging configurations for a project each with different provisioning profiling identity pairs selected

15553338

and then simply use an if statement to either show or hide the read more button depending on how many lines the paragraph has

width	height
i am trying to set the width of the .full_height_div element using pure css based on its height

15582927
width	height
the reason for this is that the parent container .set_rectangle_height is already a div with height relative to the page width

15582927
width	height
so .rectangle and .set_rectangle_height make up the parent container which has a width as a percentage of the page and a height relative to this width

15582927
width	height
but the problem is that then i want to place a div inside the parent with height 100 and width relative to this height

15582927

i know i could find the blue square percentage height in javascript then set the width to be equal to this height but it would be really handy if there is a pure css fix for what i am trying to do

15593234
filesystems	btrfs
i don t have any benchmarks to hand but just as i d pick a station wagon to move several petabytes of data quickly over a sports motorcycle i d go with a suitable filesystems such as btrfs or ext4 - zfs would do the job too but it s not a good choice on anything other than solaris - and it s questionable whether solaris makes any sense for a webserver

int	chars
a chars is generally 8 bits and an int is generally more

15594045
int	chars
any int value over 255 is going to be converted to its modulo 255 - unless you want to convert the int into as many chars as is takes to hold an int

the easiest way to proceed imho would be to get the bounds of your view to get the min and max values of your data on both x and y axis

15594282
post	get
in my zend framework mvc application i am using only two request methods get and post

15594282

15594382
punctuation	words
words that i am counting can have punctuation in them such as hyper-speed or 12 30 but if the punctuation is at the end of the words it should be trimmed

15594398
put	get
also as a side note the code you put if i had 3 images 1.jpg 2.jpg foo 1.jpg you wouldn t get the third because the name matched the first image there are also a lot more image extensions than jpeg jpg

15594407
int	chars
that is returns the stringbuilder itself and stringbuilder has an apply ix int method that allows you to get a particular chars

15594416

15594723
for-loop	loops
the error occurs at the second for-loop inside the first loops

15594740
put	get
although it is not necessary because a random integer from 1 to 100 is either or 50 it is good to get in the habit of defensive programming so maybe put in this little else statement

15594768
google-chrome	safari
since window.innerwidth remains constant regardless of the scroll bar state it is not a good option for use with google-chrome or safari

15595067
hex	binary
count is a hex number because it is bcd binary coded decimal

15595067
hex	binary
the reason motordirection is 0x02 is because he wants motor direction of 10 but it is a 2 bit field so i am assuming that he means 10 binary which is 0x02 hex

15595075
hide	show
show hide gridlines

15595089
puts	gets
when a lucky soul puts a link into the box it gets post to a php script

15595178
division	modulo
have you ever used the modulo to obtain the remainder of a division

15595178
octal	binary	octal	decimal

bionic	glibc
also dynamic loading with wrappers to make a run-time glibc bionic layer allowing a dual android linux binary

15595318
int	boolean	int	chars	int	double
just make sure you don t pass anything more complicated than a short string or one of the other basic types byte int16 uint16 int32 int uint32 int64 uint64 single float double chars boolean string guid seem to be supported since otherwise you won t be able to use the built-in state saving mechanism of the frame control when you want to save the state when the app gets deactivated and you call frame.getnavigationstate to save it layoutawarepage does it

15595330
postgresql	mysql
however if you really can t do this there are a couple ways you can access the mysql tables from within postgresql and this would be a second-class solution to a full migration but it would work

15595330
postgresql	mysql
in postgresql 9.1 and higher you can do read-only queries using foreign data wrappers for mysql

15595429
stdout	stderr
another difference is that alone doesn t redirect the stdout stderr so if there are any output or error those are displayed on the terminal

15595429
stdout	stderr
nohup on the other hand redirect the stdout stderr to nohup.out or home nohup.out

15595460
for-loop	arrays
so now we have that we can revisit your for-loop again and bind the handler to the click event of each element in the arrays for example

15595467
typedef	struct
now write a basic typedef like this that means i define mtrstatus_t to alias struct motorstatus

15595468

hide	show	children	parent
i have an n level menu structure where i have to hide the child menus in all levels at first and show them on hover of the parent menu..i had been trying this i got to hide all the children and show them on click but the issue is when i click on other parent the menu which is previuosly opened has to be closed and its child should be in hidden state if i go click that menu again and i want some easing and animation effects while opening and closing the menu it should work as a toggle

15595667

google-chrome	firefox
checked in google-chrome and firefox windows only

15595689
width	height	portrait	landscape
now if i set the width of the div to 100 it wouldn t be a square as most screens are rectangle so i thought i could get the current height of the div in pixels and set the width as the height in landscape mode and do the opposite in portrait mode but i have no idea about how to go about this

15595693
division	modulo
the modulo gives you the remainder after division

15595726
listview	gridview
example although listview instead of gridview reddit is fun app

15595738
width	height
if you are doing mobile tablet design you could use media queries to change the width and height of your div

15595738
width	height
and if you want it to be square you could set the width and height to be the same with css

15595738

15596102
width	height
i chose to use half the element s width and height as the tolerance for corners in the code below this can of course be modified if it is not well-suited to the shape of your draggable elements

15596102
width	height
it looks like you are not taking the helper element s width and height into account in your computations

15596117
popover	tooltip
for some reason the tooltip appears on elements where i didn t initialize it - meaning that there is a clash between my popover and tooltip

15596117

if you are using home somethingelse and it s not the default route then i don t quite get what you re trying to do since you would be required to specify the controller action to post to it

15597729
kivy	pyglet
that is where i say your question misses the context of what you want to do at first you just want to test some scheduling - but afterwards you will want that inside a larger system - that system should be built using an appropriated framework for your real task at hand for example django tornado pyramid if it is a web-server system gtk qt tk if it is a gui program pyogre kivy pyglet if it is a multimedia program twisted for a generic network server of another protocol or some other thing like celery or camaelia - these are only general examples

width	height
the aspect ratio of an element describes the proportional relationship between its width and its height

15598130
width	height
for an x y aspect ratio no matter how big or small the element is if the width is divided into x units of equal length and the height is measured using this same length unit the height will be measured to be y units

15598131
width	height
the aspect ratio of an element describes the proportional relationship between its width and its height

rss	feed
i m generating an rss feed from my blog

15598362
rss	feed
my rss feed contains title description link guid and pubdate elements for each item

15598362
rss	feed
the feed itself contains lastbuilddate which is set to the time that the rss feed was generated when it was requested

15598362
rss	feed
as far as i can tell there s nothing in the rss feed that flags the item as being changed

15598362
rss	feed
if so can i do something in the rss feed to mark this as a minor update thus preventing google reader from showing it as unread

15598372
onfocus	onblur
but i just need onblur and onfocus to execute on ie7

take a look at user interface fundamentals of titanium docs.additionally you should use always dp device-independent pixel for all sizes height width top left etc.

int	chars
chars is an int type just like int and family

15598759
int	chars
an int chars constant is a sequence of one or more multibyte chars enclosed in single-quotes as in x

15598759
int	chars
an int chars constant has type int

15598759
int	chars
note that the int can be converted to a chars

15598760
width	height
the canvas specification places no restriction on width or height being negative so if they were negative the rectangle would draw in the opposite direction

15598760
width	height
the svg specification says that if width or height are negative then the rectangle is not drawn

15598760
width	height
if you want to implement this in svg you ll have to make sure the rectangles width height are always positive and calculate the x y accordingly

15598792
put	get
furthermore it is important to put in all required values elsewise your childpane will just not get displayed

versioning	upgrade	ready	each
e.g. say iâ m working in azure and each customer has their own versioning of the solution rather than a multi-tenancy arrangement because that way i get to be able to offer them newer versioning of the product if they want to pay to upgrade and they get to stay with older versioning of the product that they are comfortable with until they are ready to upgrade rather than having new features imposed upon them

15598972
versioning	upgrade
i have a script that uses a combination of teamcity fluentmigrator etc to be able to take the versioning a particular customer has and upgrade it at will whilst preserving their existing data

15599050
qgridlayout	qframe
i have tested adding widgets qframe to a qgridlayout at the same position it is working fine

15599057
post	get
if you want to preserve the current get params so that results from the post can use you will also need to modify the javascript triggered on the heading links so that as well as or instead of modifying the query string they write the same data to hidden form fields which of course then get posted in the body of the request

15599082
width	height
here is a full code with height edit option in addition to the width

15599109
margin	height
keep in mind that the calculated middle is very dependent on other height variables like padding margin and borders

15599109
box-sizing	border-box
another option is to use box-sizing border-box

serializable	deserialization
i m dealing with serializable and deserialization in files

fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream
moreover i m stack about using fileoutputstream with objectoutputstream

15599173
sctp	tcp
we observed the performance and we noticed that in order to transfer 3 files a singole sctp association 3-streamed is much less performant that 3 tcp connections

15599173
sctp	tcp
studying the theory we expected at least the same performance overall because sctp multistreaming should reduce tcp overheads

15599188
punctuation	words
in my mysql table article title is in normal form with punctuation and with spaces btw words

15599188

fast-forward	merge
it is possible that when merging your development branch to master you did a fast-forward merge

google-chrome	firefox
the home page works perfectly on google-chrome and firefox but it does not show up properly on ie 9

15599536
post	get
i think you should use post instead of get and store your printer and manufacturer information in a array

15599544
post	get
but also noticed that there has been some head get post attacks also coming in to the web server as well using the exact same string on user agents

15599554
extjs	gxt
at the end of my research i determined extjs widgets render slowly so from gxt you don t have many options

15599600
width	height
however since i started learning and writing in c# i noticed that most of the classes that are native to the language expose their properties for example to set get the location or sizes of a rectangle system.drawing.rectangle you can simply access directly the x y width and height properties

15599607
width	height
first of all the video doesn t cover the whole background on my resolution so set the width and height of the video element to

15599612
children	parent
packages can have parent and children so it is a graph structure

15599683
awt	swing
classes that start with j such as japplet and jframe are swing and applet and frame are awt

15599756
getter	setter
however the next best thing is to use a getter and setter object to change the variable holding your instance itself

15599789
getter	setter
in c# you use properties instead of getter setter methods since they provide the same functionality

15599796
width	height
the solution was that i had to make header divs position relative and then make another div inside of it that was position absolute and width height 100

15599814
multiplying	add
here s how you add a multiplying by two function

15599837
int	double
in addition to be used as a number elsewhere in the program the string has cast to an object of type double or int

15599844
radio-button	dropdownlistfor
i guess what s tripping me up is that a user can select more than one option as opposed to a radio-button list or dropdownlistfor

15599851
post	put
as answered in the other post we ve released a library that makes the sliding layer work for you just drop it in your xml as a normal container and put whatever you need inside

15599885
put	get
you can google how to get user input in java and then just take the input put it in a variable and print it out on error

15599931
width	height
the problem is that the webview width is all the screen while the height is about 300px

i pointed visual studio solution include lib directory to respective folder from newly installed location copied dll to my application location

15600005
superclass	subclassing
if a possible subclassing does not share basically all of the properties and methods of its superclass i start to wonder

15600005
superclass	subclassing
but when you hit that awkwardness when some of the superclass properties methods are not applicable to the subclassing it gets creepy

15600009
uicollectionview	uitableview
i haven t used uicollectionview or uicollectionviewcontroller yet but i have used uitableview and uitableviewcontroller and my general rule of thumb is never use uitableviewcontroller if you want to do anything complicated

15600013
jboss	glassfish
i have implemented a simple statless local session bean and deployed in my glassfish server also have tried in jboss server

mouse	keyboard
this question can seem quite odd but from all my experience i ve gotten used to setting keyboard focus to the focusable element just by clicking it with the mouse

15600017
mouse	keyboard
however usercontrol with the properties and came as a surprise to me because it gets keyboard focus via tab but stays ignorant to mouse clicks

15600056
for-loop	loops
i mean how do i evaluate the statements inside the for-loop considering that each statement has a different outcome at every step of loops

15600070
ssl	https
the reason why you should use https for the entire site even though there is no sensitive data on the landing page is because encrypting the communication is only half of what ssl does

15600157
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
note amazon-web-services also has support for paas through elastic beanstalk but that s still in beta

15600261
post	get
click on and you will get an archive page of all the regular blog post instead of the custom post types post for that category

i also did this from the command line which downloaded and installed the files in the same directory as to where i downloaded the linkedin files from gist just all in my user folder

15600344
many-to-one	one-to-many
there is backbone plugin backbone-relational.js which provides one-to-one one-to-many and many-to-one relations between models for backbone

int	double
for example ralf brown s list says that the int 09h interrupt double as both the keyboard data ready hardware interrupt and the coprocessor segment overrun exception

15600350
implements	extends
your input format extends inputformat of the mapreduce package it extends rather than implements and the signature matches that of the new api yet your job configuration is using the old api jobconf rather than job

15600375
int	chars
with x being a short this print an int whose value is x -- with x being a chars this prints the chars corresponding to x

15600385

inherited	properties
now i d like to make this log object available in all my classes by letting all the classes inherited from a baseclass which has a ilog properties and is supposed to be set by properties injection rather than constructor injection

15600466
integer	unsigned
make the integer literal unsigned

15600473
min	max
take that min and max usage as an estimate

15600473
x86	mips
cpu gpu compatibility another important detail is that if an app has c c++ code that code might not run on some of the cpu types mips arm or x86

15600477
post	put
it s not as hard as it sounds. simply put removeviews inside a runnable and use post on any view

15600498
nasm	fasm
also from another source a sample fasm assembly source needs some translations if you use nasm to call a system function via linux-gate.so finding linux-gate.so.1 in assembly

15600511
mouseleave	mouseenter
so with a mouseenter and a mouseleave the class hover is added to the menu to make it visible or toggle it off to make it invisible again

15600511
mouseleave	mouseenter
a single click will act as a mouseenter but clicking the button again does not act as a mouseleave and so the menu never closes again

15600538
versioning	upgrade
the client can send the accept header with both versioning included which enabled the server to respond with the one he likes most a smart client might implement versioning 1 and 2 and now sends both as accept header and waits for the server to upgrade from versioning 1 to 2

15600538
versioning	upgrade
the server will tell in every response whether it is versioning 1 or 2 and the client can act accordingly - he does not need to know the exact date of the server versioning upgrade

15600539
slideup	slidedown
use jquery slideup and slidedown instead of animate

15600602
getter	setter
when implementing a getter or setter for an nsstring it appears as

15600615
int	chars
one could also argue that for fundamental types or types for which copying is fast such as int bool or chars there is no need to pass by reference if the function simply needs to observe the value and passing by value should be favored

15600660
int	double
use copy for pod int bool double ...

15600693
temp	tmp
just contains the filename not the filepath that would be something like tmp randomfilename or c users xxx appdata local temp randomfilename

15600709
portrait	landscape
what actually worked for me is selecting portrait and both landscape orientations in app summary then creating a category on uinavigationcontroller since kobold2d uses a navigation controller as rootviewcontroller on the window

note that they are supported in all major browsers google-chrome firefox ie10 but not in older versions of ie ie9 ie8 etc

15600773
post	get
i wrote a blog post about that very topic showing a little bit about using angular s built-in mocks and writing your own mocks maybe it helps you to get a deeper understanding

15600788
width	height
then get the flash to query its on width height on load

15600805

google-chrome or safari 6 do not seem to have this problem

15600828
width	margin
i need left_div to be on the left to have 100 width but with fixed right margin 320px

15600828
width	margin
left_div must be width auto and right margin must be fixed 300px

15600960
g++	gcc
on linux i would suggest to compile with g++ -wall -g with a recent compiler gcc 4.8 has just been released

15600994
postgresql	mysql
you can go with traditional dbrms postgresql mysql oracle ... or take hot technology h2 mongodb ..

15601026
inherited	properties
for example if the parent of the node has font-size 16px the fontsize properties will not be inherited

15601032
inherited	properties
some of my domain objects inherited from the base abstract class domainentity that contains shared properties such as id datecreated datemodified etc

15601066
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
well basically mozilla opera safari google-chrome support the same approach

15601092
vsto	add-in
we have developed a .net 4.0 vsto excel add-in in vs2010 that we are deploying via clickonce

15601092
vsto	add-in
it becomes even more of a problem when we are developing debugging as we are renaming removing add-in instances on the fly - so much so that developing vsto on windows 7 is no longer feasible

15601107
mdpi	hdpi
i have published an app which have an mdpi hdpi xhdpi and xxhdpi image for the app icon

15601142
nscoder	nsdata
in your code you are writting nsdata to nscoder so you need to read nsdata then convert it to array

15601147
put	get
it stores an array of linked lists and whenever get or put is called the key is hashed and modulo d by the array size

15601147
put	get
the get or put is then called on the resulting linked list which i also implemented

15601147
put	get
for example initializing it with the red-black tree type would make a table of red-black trees and the get and put functions would delegate to those red-black trees

15601204
width	height
this is because i am trying each possible width and height of cloth piece

15601204
width	height
and for each possible width and height of cloth piece i try each possible vertical horizontal and piece sized cut

15601214
put	get
rest may be cached provided the requests in question are idempotent ones get put and theoretically delete

15601214
put	get	post	get	post	put
instead when that request doesn t correspond to a simple fetch of some resource you post or put that complex document to the server and get the result of the operation as a separate stage

15601234
getter	setter
however if you declare a property as anything but strong and then implement both the setter and getter by hand you ll have to manually declare the backing ivar s ownership qualifier as well

15601235
pthreads	fork
the low-level clone 2 syscall creates user-land schedulable tasks and can be used both for creating fork -ed process or for implementation of thread libraries like pthreads

15601341
for-loop	loops
i know i probably ought to have replaced the while loops with a for-loop for simplicity s sake but i m more comfortable with the while

15601356
int	double
for example arm eabi requires aligment of 64-bit int and double on 8-byte boundaries

15601389
udp	tcp
internet s connection oriented service is tcp and connection-less service is udp and both resides in the transport layer of internet protocol stack

15601395

i have a piece of d3.js code that draws a chart and it width height etc

15601395
width	height
then i copy-paste another piece of d3.js code that draws a bar chart and its width height etc.

15601398
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately the jquery doesn t work when i open my webpage with google-chrome ie or firefox

15601429

addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
3 develop your own data structures may be in terms of strings where 100 char length could refer to 100 decimal digits with its custom operations like addition subtraction multiplication etc just like complex number library in c++ were developed in this way

put	get	post	get	post	put
i joined two table to get the name field from the other table so i can show them on my add data view when i need to add new data and i manage to do that but i m confused about how to put the upload code function cause i have this add_data function that i use to save what i post in tambah_mahasiswa view to the database

15601571
hash	md5
as pointed in the comments to this answer the md5 hash of the integer s text representation may not be what you want

15601571
hash	md5
to have the hash of the binary the md5 signature accepting a bytea parameter should be used

15601583
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
you can not free addresses other than you get with malloc realloc call

15601605
udp	tcp
so onces a packet leaves a destination it can go along any path mostly as long as it gets to the desintation regardless of the higher level protocol such as tcp or udp

15601606
maven	pom.xml
the dependency should be in the provided scope rather than the default compile scope in your maven pom.xml

15601618
jscrollpane	jviewport
in addition to the great advice given by rob camick you re also removing all components directly from and trying to add components directly to the jscrollpane ignoring that the jviewport should not be messed with and that visualized components need to be added to the jscrollpane s viewport not to the jscrollpane itself

15601622
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
this has happened in both vmware virtual machine with ubuntu and dedicated linux mint netbook so it might be that i m missing something

i m kind of new to express and node.js and i can t figure out the difference between app.use and app.get

15601713
hash	md5
fcea920f7412b5da7be0cf42b8c93759 but i want the md5 hash to be generated as d38f0d62daf542c5f10d8f29adacae17 as it is generated by md5 function of php

15601718
mpfr	mpc
path for libraries is where the gmp mpfr and mpc libraries are present

15601757
springboard	backgrounding
etc. ios runtime is not allowed to do proper shutdown and cleanup -- in fact springboard still thinks the app is running in the backgrounding even when the process no longer exists

15601769
strsplit	grepl
this simple one-liner in base r makes use of strsplit and then grepl and is fairly robust but will break if it has to count matches like jjjjjj as 3 lots of jj

15601829
children	parent
what parent has the most children excluding the root

15601829
children	parent
this is a revised question with added sample data after ltree find parent with most children postgresql was closed

filewriter	printwriter
each time you call it it is going to recreate the filewriter and the printwriter take the input add it to the file and then close it again

15601865
getter	setter
these are the getter and setter

15601873
google-chrome	firefox
tried it on google-chrome and firefox

15601900
put	get	folder	directory
bcuz ios apps run in sandboxed environment.each and every app is allocated some folder space it can put and get from that only for example documents directory library dierctory

15601941
fast-forward	merge
the merge mk to master fast-forward

15601948
getter	setter
if the condition is true then number becomes 5 to get this data you can create getter and setter

15601950
ssl	https
meteor.com handles ssl by default by just adding https

15601953
wgs84	utm
the command converts your input shapefile a file format for geographical data input.shp into universal transverse mercator utm wgs84 format this is what the t_srs string means more on wikipedia in output.shp regardless of the coordinate system used in the input

15601999
folder	directory
important the code above has one issue you should unlink delete files and directory before delting the folder

15602036

a major problem of building tables in hdfs has been eliminated by hive

15602122

15606529
folder	directory
the solution chosen for this question is to put the subl symlink in the .rvm bin folder which is definitely not a generic solution as this directory is part of a program he has installed

15606529
folder	directory
although any directory in the path will work the most common solution is to create a bin directory in the home folder set it in the path by putting in .bash_profile and then running the link command as shown in the original question with this new path

15606570
int	chars
seems like the fact that mysql is letting it work would make for a faster query because int s would be faster to search through than variable length chars strings

15606822
put	get
htable is the client api used to put get scan records

15606831
min	max
i think what the op is asking is why are we not storing the max element similar to the min element why do we propagate the max element down into the tree and whether this treatment cant be reversed

15606831
min	max
we need both max and min elements outside the tree for the successor and predecessor operations

15606831
min	max
i believe it should be possible to keep either of the min max elements outside without propagation and still maintain o log log u time per operation since we do this just to know if a structure is non-empty

15606840
uilabel	uibutton
uibutton has a private uilabel to display its text and a private uiimageview to display its image

15606840

15607487
post	put
basically it is potentially unsafe to put the post with and

15607502
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
for one thing you re using a for-loop inside of a while loops which seems strange to me for iterating over a multidimensional arrays

15607502
for-loop	loops
also instead of resetting cols and incrementing rows at the end of the while loops try changing it to a for-loop

15607588
multiplying	multiplication
this would be a lot better if you made a multiplying function to do long multiplication

15607660
int	boolean
in your case you are implicitly converting the boolean true into int which the value will be 1

15608133
post	put
im sorry if this makes no sence i guess what im asking in general is how can i put the in a format that i can post it like - this makes sence to me but when i post it the value is empty

from the looks of it i d say you re in the good to go category only because your app doesn t sound like a high-profile target to crack and you mostly want to deter the casual cracking attempt from a frustrated developer who doesn t like your licensing scheme and the obfuscation alone would deter most when it comes to reverse-engineering your code

there is no way you will manage to put a uitextfield which is a subclass of uiview as a child sublayer of a calayer which expects an object with a calayer ancestor

15619011
uiview	calayer
however you certainly can find the superview of the calayer which inherits uiview and put the uitextfield at the good place for the time it is displayed and set the calayer as the delegate of the uitextfield to keep the content synchronised as you type see uitextfieldtextdidchangenotification notification or -textfielddidendediting delegate method in uitextfield

15619463
submit	submission
so if the is tied to a request scoped bean and thus the data model is reinitialized on a per-request basis then you ll risk the to actually reference the item at the wrong index during the processing the form submit because between the requests of displaying the form and submission the form the db might have retrieved a new item or have removed another item which would potentially move the desired item to a different index

15620404

15623845
int	chars
i ll be happy if i found a way to convert int to chars directly

test whether buffering the logged data in ram helps improve performance writing a thousand 20 byte log records will mean 1 000 function calls and could cause a lot of disk seeking and other write overheads while writing a single 20 000 byte block in one burst means only one function call and could give significant performance increase and maximise the burst rate you get out to disk

15624152

this can be done dynamically if needed by calling getextremes adjusting the min and max accordingly and calling setextremes

15624206

also i can get images which in a tags when put this path in xpath

15627315
children	parent
of course the listview#onmeasure implementation is smart enough to stop measuring children once it has enough height to fill its parent view and its going to getview those same positions during ondraw anyway so the efficiency argument appears to be moot

15627345
filtering	grouping
but if a unique constraint was not enforce on grouping for every user distinct keywords is needed to filtering out unique grouping

15627383
width	height
you can then use the aspect ratio of the width height of the rectangle in mkmappoint coordinates to determine the aspect ratio of your ground overlay uiimage

15627383
width	height
once you have the aspect ratio you ll just need to experiment with actual sizes ie guess a width calculate the height from the aspect ratio to find one which looks okay

15627383
width	height
instead of the map view width height you would use your uiimage width height and you d use the bounds of your rectangle instead of the bounds of the desired view

15627383
width	height
you also wouldn t need to calculate the scale from both the width and height as the scale should be the same - so just use one of them

checkbox and radio button are determined by your operating system and can t be styled in the same manner as text boxes for example

button	checkbox
normally styling checkbox or radio button involves hiding the original input and then creating a new div or a label and styling that maybe with a pseudo-element

15627494
width	margin
instead you need to set left 50 and the left margin to negative half of the element width

15627499
get	http-post
essentially to get an http-post binding on the saml authentication request you need the profile options passed to the org.springframework.security.saml.websso.webssoprofileimpl#sendauthenticationrequest method

15627506
width	margin
margin auto is for the object that has width and set the left-right margin equally

for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
this will loops through your arrays and if it hits a null even once it will return true if it gets through the entire arrays without hitting a null object then it will run through the entire for-loop and then proceed to the return false statement saying there is no null objects within this arrays

15628546

udp	tcp	sctp	udp	sctp	tcp
time-sensitive applications often use udp because dropping packets is preferable to waiting for delayed packets which may not be an option in a real-time system. 2 if error correction facilities are needed at the network interface level an application may use the transmission control protocol tcp or stream control transmission protocol sctp which are designed for this purpose

15629640

while i press the lock screen button of my phone when my activity is at its landscape mode i noticed in the debug messages i output to eclipse the activity is re-created to its portrait mode while the screen is all black of course

15645611
portrait	landscape
as i remember not 100 sure though and what i expect is my activity should only undergo onsaveinstancestate and onpause while lock screen in landscape mode like what it does in portrait mode

15645611
portrait	landscape
rather than re-creating the activity to portrait and going back to landscape again

15645611
portrait	landscape
it seems that on mobile phones the running activities that are in landscape mode are switched into portrait mode upon screen lock is a normal behaviour

15645611
switching	screens
but the assumption that the running activities switching back to the device s default orientation upon screens lock as in most devices the locked screens is in portrait is quite logical

i d recommend spending some time learning about the basic commands of your command-line and get familiar with either vim or download sublimetext and try it

even if you hide the malicious code in between a bunch of legit code remove all whitespace create one giant pool of spaghetti code with pointers and gotos give everything a random misleading name if possible override every single operator to do something weird do a bunch of useless operations like calling twitters api to get obamas 5th tweet to use the 3rd letter to complete an sql query obfuscate the code compile it to lolcode and back and then to brainfuck get cthulhu to eat your code and spit it back up try to parse html and email adresses with regular expressions you cannot prevent that someone with enough dedication can figure out what happens

the same speed as addition though still faster than multiplication

15668718
subtraction	addition
i m curious about why bitwise operations were slightly faster than addition subtraction operations on older microprocessors

15668718

all i can think of that would cause the latency is that the circuits to implement addition subtraction depend on several levels of logic gates parallel adders and whatnot whereas the bitwise operations have far simpler circuit implementations

15669365
stdout	stderr
strangely however powershell by default sends all its streams including write-host and output to stdout when invoked from cmd.exe even though mapping powershell s error stream to stderr would be the logical choice

15669365
stdout	stderr
you will see no output except cerr from which writes directly to stderr - all of powershell s streams were sent to stdout

15669365
stdout	stderr
with a stderr redirection powershell selectively sends its error stream to stderr irrespective of whether stdout is also redirected or not

15669808
stdout	stderr
you have to write to stdin read from stdout and stderr until you know they re done and leave everything open for the next time through the loop

15669808
stdout	stderr
so the only real option is to create a reader thread for stdout and another one for stderr or to get one of the async subprocess libraries off pypi or to use twisted or another framework that has its own way of doing async subprocess pipes

15669808

15679108
put	get
there are a few different solutions currently used much like the one linked in the comments which will allow you to put all your references into central typescript files then just reference them from your individual scripts or the approach you put forward where you do the same sort of approach but rather than manually writing it you get your build script to generate the references for you and get the compilation process to inject the references in rather than explicitly referencing them in each file

when i put this annotation on eclipse-generated methods hashcode equals tostring i just put eclipse although org.eclispe.eclipse might be better

15680117
factors	mean
for your example you need to also take into consideration the replication factors and checksum files but essentially adding lots of small files less than the block size does not mean that you have wasted available blocks - they take up as much room as they need again you need to remember that replication will increase the physical data footprint required to store the file and the number of available blocks will be closer to your second calculation

15680160
hide	show
instead of emptying you can simply hide and show the items

15680172

hence in multi object file compiles your best shot is to inspect the generated assembly however within every single object file the inlining is possible assuming the function to be inline is in the same compilation unit however most compilers do not do inlining at this point as it doesnt know where this function may be called from and whether it should itself be inline

15704447
clang	llvm
also i do believe that if you compile your code with clang llvm you ll get a c output file with inlining tho i haven t tried it

width	height
i have a div which has a height of 1200px and a width of the browser window

15704872
width	height
one can probably do it considering the horizontal vertical scrolling positions the width height of the browser window and the position size of the element on the page but i have little experience in jquery so i don t know how to do it

15704879

post	put
to disable post revisions put the code below in your wp-config.php file

15705103
mouseleave	mouseenter
just return from your mouseenter and mouseleave handlers if the element is being animated you can do that with .is animated

15705103
mouseleave	mouseenter
update my above solution will exit when the element is animating but that also included the own animations of the mouseenter mouseleave handlers we want to only exit if it s the fadein animation so to distinguish that i set a property called fading when starting to fading an element and remove it when it ends the fade effect so we can check for this property in the mouseenter mouseleave handlers

15705149
coalesce	isnull
based on your comments below it seems like you re looking for coalesce or isnull depending on which dbms you re using which you didn t tell us in your question either

15705171
width	height
as mentioned above each content div could be any variable height and could change if the printing width changes

here is a more cross-browser friendly version tested in google-chrome 25 firefox 19 ie10 ie9 safari 5 opera 12

15705295
opera	safari
in ie safari and opera it bounces a bit

15705295
opera	firefox
particularly opera due to its fancy smooth scrolling makes me appreciate firefox more because it has smooth scrolling and was perfect

15705296

15705296

15705515
getter	setter
0.8 and xcode 4.6 you do not need to explicitly specify synthesize for each property you declare in the interface â unless you re going to overwrite both setter and getter or if you want to use a different name as highlighted in your example of

15705515
getter	setter
you can also overwrite the getter and setter if the property attribute is not readonly as your code

15705619
width	height

lxml	elementtree
import elementtree from lxml

15705767
post	get
bear in mind that your data might get big if you have lots of users and post at which point sharding really becomes necessary

versioning	upgrade
the nice dashboard is up and now i want to download some plugins even upgrade the versioning first as i got the .zip few weeks back

15705815
google-chrome	firefox
with this simple code i get some bottom-padding in the table cell under the image at least in firefox google-chrome

15705913
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

15705929
bash	zsh
i think a good solution would function under both bash and zsh and it should probably work by taking two arguments an integer for the history command number and a name for the shell script to poop out in a hardcoded directory which contains that one command

15705929
bash	zsh
furthermore under bash it appears that multi-line commands are treated as separate commands but i m willing to assume that we only care about one-liners here and i only use zsh anyway at this point

15705929
bash	zsh
the stumbling block here is that i think i ll still be running shell scripts through bash even when using zsh so it won t likely then be able to parse zsh s history files

15705962
ubuntu	debian
the following runs fine from debian squeeze but in ubuntu 12.04 always returns aggregate instance is down regardless of whether the instance is up or down

15705962
ubuntu	debian
i wrote and tested the script in debian but need it to work on ubuntu also

15705963
datediff	difference
is there perhaps a datediff function that accepts a period as an input i know for example in vbscript you can get the difference between two dates in whatever period you want be it weeks months days whatever

15705980

and of course you need getter setter for patientsoapbean and radioinnersubjective

15706019
gmail	hotmail
email providers like gmail yahoo hotmail do not load images in the email directly

15706034
polymorphism	specialization
you should try to exploit parametric polymorphism in a different way by providing specialization of the classes

15706040
jobs	cron
i am running a bunch of cron jobs etc so maybe it s the output of a cron job somehow

15706044

when the user clicks a row a dialog form pop-up giving the user the ability to edit the selected item

15706070
inherited	properties
the menuitem control has the convenient properties isenabled inherited from uielement

15706075
google-chrome	firefox
the issue didn t arise in google-chrome firefox or ie10 but it did happen in ie9 and lower

15706091
nsstring	nsdata
it operates on nsdata rather than nsstring

15706148
width	height
when my label.text is so longer than the window size the last part of the text doesn t appear.how can i dynamically re-size the height and width of the label text with respect to my window.that is when the text is longer than the window then the text will be appear at some lines instead of one line

15706173
rss	feed
i m using django celery eventlet and dnspython to asynchronous parse about 500 rss feed

15706210
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

15706265
spaces	delimiter
osx the for-loop treats spaces as delimiter breaking directory names that contain spaces

15706283
width	height
i must say that some polylines are created by a loop according to the desired height and width

15706296
portrait	landscape
it s autoresized because you have changed it s ancestor s frame or when the user s switches portrait landscape mode

15706351
ws-addressing	soap
with ws-addressing the transport-specific data are copied over to the soap headers

15706366

i have a group of controls edittexts buttons etc.. which i want to show hide programmatically without showing hiding them one by one

15706376

implements	extends
public static class testsettings extends preferenceactivity implements timepicker.ontimechangedlistener

15706464
hash	md5
addendum 6 april 2013 it turned out i had to generate a new md5 hash for my sig but even after doing so the method does not work

15706485
inherited	properties
rather due to the way javascript prototypal inherited works the child scope will find the properties on the parent scope

15706522
width	margin
edit i added the set width and margin to #scroller and set left 50 and margin-left -250px

15706535
width	height
from what i ve read i thought setting the width and height tags using a percentage would work but it is only working for horizontal resizing

15706553
super	extends
however if you are extends a base class you will need to create a constructor to call super at a minimum

15706576
inject	interceptor
i found some topic talking about a struts2 interceptor to inject data in myaction with reflection

15706585
int	chars
since you declared the name as single chars and user enter more than single chars test first chars is assigned to name and rest are placed in the buffer as it is and because those are not int cin doesn t care to ask you at console

15706591
fontfamily	font-size
moreover i also want to get only the css property name in the style such like font-size font-weight fontfamily and not their values

15706613
subclass	accessor
the goal of this thread subclass hpcheadthread is mainly to host the instances of a few asynchronous control mechanisms and provide accessor methods to said mechanisms for other threads to use

15706616
width	height
i read the parent width and height on the onwindowfocuschanged method of the activity

15706629
width	height
shrinking the width height of the rectangle will allow you to more tightly control the arrow s position

15706726
width	height
if this is correct the problem with the image appearing to be stretched after transformation is due to the fact that both image sizes 1000x800 for the large version and 189x104 for the smaller version don t share the same height width ratio

15706726
width	height
calculating the width down from 1000 to 189 while maintaining the aspect ratio the corresponding height would have to be 151 800 189 1000 pixels

15706726
width	height
gimp always calculating the correct width height for you if change either of it

15706726
width	height
if you make sure both shown values are chained as indicated in the icon gimp will even calculate the appropriate width if you enter the desired height of 104 pixels

15706750
virtualbox	parallels
another option would be to try to get it working under a vm virtualbox fusion parallels etc. by installing windows in the vm on your mac

15706758
google-chrome	firefox
works in google-chrome firefox ie10

15706807
put	get
it s working on local machine but when i put it to the external server i get error page

15706853
submit	submission
you can detect which button you press within the submit form simply by renaming the button name and then detect it within the post on the submission page

15706881
next	except
how can i do to get all others rows except the previous and the next event

15706898
width	height
the text box looks good with the required height and width

15706950
expandablelistview	expandablelistadapter
i can t seem to find any answers on getting the expandablelistview to show in the slidingmenu without hacking it and using a listfragment - which results in not being able to use the stadndard setadapter on the fragment to set the expandablelistadapter

15706978
implements	extends
this would mean changing extends the way schemas are implements in talend open studio

15707000
put	get
you could put the long-running task on an executor which would execute the task asynchronously using a thread pool and return a future that you can use later to get the answer

15707012
gif	png
i need this because default image is gif animated and mouse over is static png pictire and as people hold the mouse for a second animated picture comes back

15707015
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
with unchecked-exception the method doesn t have to declare it can throw the exception for example runtimeexception

15707015
try-catch	exception-handling
i d also recommend you use some ide such as eclipse it will instantly tell you if a line can throw exception-handling and you re not handling it -- you can then wrap it with try-catch or have the method throw it just by single mouse click

15707034
getter	setter
in python we generally avoid getter and setter

15707034
getter	setter
in java you have to use getter and setter because using public fields gives you no opportunity to go back and change your mind later to using getter and setter

15707034
getter	setter
so don t write getter and setter

15707045
inherited	properties
an input text element will inherited font-size and line-height properties from its parent or else the user agent settings

15707077
comparator	comparable
we d like to implement comparable such that comparator is consistent with equals using hashcode like so

15707079
draggable	droppable
drag a draggable item not in the sortable into the droppable

15707138
min	max
easiest way is to simply set your y axis min and max values

15707175
getter	setter
you may of course still use getter and setter and you can somewhat emulate private members by prepending __ to your attributes

15707175
getter	setter
in the above example instead of using the getter and setter we could simply use obj1._myclass__my_attr

15707181
stdout	stderr
as below redirect stdout and stderr of your child process to pipe then you can use communicate method to get the stdout and stderr of your child process from pipe

15707194
google-chrome	firefox
i also see different behavior - in google-chrome the icon does change but the size is really tiny whereas in firefox icon doesn t change

15707202
stdout	stderr
it can easily deal with both stdout and stderr only stdout by default though

15707209
for-loop	arrays
for the latter approach you d have to rewrite the for-loop and the arrays access in assembly

15707231
post	get
i ll post a screenshot when i get one but here s the code

15707304
width	height
in other words your rectangle s origin point should be negative half its width and negative half its height â don t use the origin it had before because you already used that in the translate step

15707391
post	get
i was trying to get some information from another server using ajax post call as

15707397
button	checkbox
if the user checks any of them on the first page and then clicks the next button to navigate to the next uc i want the checkbox in the dependent uc also checked

15707400
centos	linux
i connected the device to my linux machine running centos 5.3 but something isn t working right

15707406
folder	directory
it seems that because xcode is an integrated development environment simliar to visual studio is has this concept of a build configuration and when software gets build output files in up in a directory path that includes that configuration concept many build files end up in a path that ends with folder named something like debug release etc.

15707409
cobertura	checkstyle	checkstyle	cpd
it contains many external checkers like pmd cpd checkstyle findbugs and can integrate with some other useful tools like cobertura test coverage statistics

15707412
ssl	https
i work with a lot of ssl https pages that must be 100 secure so the lock is green and not yellow

15707469
pull	push
now when i pull or even push i just get this error

15707479
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it on google-chrome and firefox as well

15707499
interpolation	splines
if say you want to generate a curve through some of the bounce-points you want a catmull-rom splines instead since that passes through points the two splines forms are interchangeable but they have different interpolation properties with catmull-rom much more useful for things like trajectory rendering

15707544
interpolation	splines
a splines that travels through your points is easily constructed as a catmull-rom splines which map to bezier curves but represent the interpolation differently

15707659
fgets	feof
the data returned in each case is always the same as in every time i make a call with a query string of the page returned contains the same data but sometimes the full page is delivered by fgets feof and sometimes not

15707711
bash	zsh
this is a zsh specific script i ll worry about bash later never

15707760
int	boolean
right now it accepts every type string boolean int etc. except i would like it to only accept children types of worker like fileworker or meshworker

15707773
plot	heatmap
i m trying to do a density plot of my data with matplotlib heatmap but somehow my data is getting reversed rotated in a strange way

15707773
plot	heatmap
it has to be something in the way the heatmap plot is coded i would think but i don t see where the breakdown could be

15707794
pop-up	dialog
i have to pop-up alert dialog on long press of group row in expandable listview .and it works when i implemented it in ongroupview method of my baseexpandablelistadapter class.but after this expand collapse functionality is not working

15707812
inherited	properties
so to override a s color you change it s color properties from inherited to whatever you want

15707944
width	height
very simple but you should set width height of output - longer strings will be cut out

15707965
int	boolean
it could return boolean or int and if it return false you will perform insert query

15707986
getdate	dateadd
i like adding triggers to my sql database on fields like dateadd and datemodified so that they automatically update with a getdate as required

15707990
children	parent
well in the non-fullscreen mode of the browser the rotating drawable and the webview are both children of the same parent whereas in the fullscreen mode the drawable becomes a child of the webview

15708016
highcharts	highstock
i have searched for answers to this using various combinations of the following search terms with no results to speak of highcharts highstock area centerpoint zero center

15708018
cassini	iis
you can use cassini or iis express for actually testing your web applications

15708019
gruntjs	yeoman
gruntjs is also part of the development toolset yeoman

15708104
xlib	xcb
talking about c as mentioned in your question the xlib has long been the one and only one implementation in wide use but there s also another binding called xcb

15708104
xlib	xcb
speaking xlib i ve never ever used any xcb until now so i can t tell you too much about it might be the following methods that might be of use

15708160
pdfbox	itext	pdfbox	itextsharp
highmastdon - it is actually really simple to get the font names at least in itext itextsharp pdfbox as well - but i don t have the code around right now but in itextsharp you would do the following

15708187
jar	manifest.mf
if you do it inside the jar or outside it then you should make a classpath entry to your manifest.mf

15708231
knitr	latex
my question is about the knitr option fig.cap when using latex

15708341
put	get
i don t have an assembler to test but you get the idea - remove the need for a floating address put it in the beginning

15708383
rubygems	bundler
just got feedback from another source and found out that it was actually an issue with rubygems not bundler

15708485
google-chrome	firefox
as of march 18th 2016 is only supported in google-chrome and firefox

15708513
clang	llvm
if you run clang from usr bin it will be looking for the llvm library in usr bin .. lib libllvm-3.3svn.dylib usr lib libllvm-3.3svn.dylib at least that s what the dynamic loader is telling you

15708513
clang	llvm
another approach is to build clang and llvm from source

15708513
clang	llvm
this should also build clang with the llvm libraries statically linked

15708545
jtree	jxtreetable
i dont see a similar method for the swingx jxtreetable class and it seems that jxtreetable doesnt extend jxtree which extends jtree

15708556
int	chars
now i see that php does not have a chars data type so i want to define a two byte unsigned int like this

15708576
post	get
i made a question previously on so to get help with a show last 5 post from specific category issue

15708588
min	max
another is not recalculating the min max all the time since there s a certain amount of redundancy here

15708588
min	max	range	max	range	min
range c d - range from min c d to max c d

15708604
post	get
if you get stuck post specific questions with code

15708658
width	height
however this returned true if just the width was 1250 but the height was any value

15708665
min	max
i think you mixed up max and min

15708693
for-loop	arrays
you should create arrays of jlabel and then fill up the text on them in for-loop

15708707
viewdidload	viewdidappear
autolayout set some constraints after the view loads so pick your code that sets the content size in viewdidload and put in viewdidappear and your code won t be rewritten

15708736
put	get
with this code and an insane index value 10000 - i get a same picture no matter what values i give in 0 1 or even when i put negative numbers in

15708748
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
you can then write and read these objects using socket s objectinputstream and objectoutputstream

15708781
google-chrome	firefox
this problem is only visible in firefox google-chrome seems to be fast enough

15708798
post	put
i want to crop each of these post to the specified length if they exceed it and put a continue reading link can be a soft crop here doesn t have to be rigid

15708814
inherited	subclassing
the subclassing implement the interface which they inherited from datainterface

15708832
post	get
and to get around the styling for the permalink page for text post that i had done i had to insert a bunch of block date tags around everything

15708853
width	height
when i drag an object to a view in the xcode storyboard it assumes the full width and height of the containing view rather than the default dimensions

15708853
width	height
for instance i drag a uibutton to an ipad view and suddenly it s 1024x768 pixels and for some reason the width and height properties are grayed out in the configuration window with the ruler on the right

15708864
width	height
i am trying to access my profile pic at a specified width height using php sdk via the following code

15708919
qtcore	qtgui
but it seems i can import some packages eg qtcore but not others eg qtgui

15708937
children	parent
i do .wrap parent to extract the element i selected in addition to its children see this question

15708937
google-chrome	firefox
and it works in google-chrome firefox ie9 etc.

15708950
ubuntu	linux
i am aware of tools like jslint but i m not looking for style correctness i need a tool or utility preferably one that runs on linux bonus points for being in the ubuntu package manager that can verify the syntactic correctness of a javascript file

15708994
realloc	malloc
if you need your array to grow you can make it dynamic with malloc and realloc

15708999
bmp	png	gif	bmp	gif	png
the supported image formats are bmp gif jpg png

15709015
post	put
i ll updat my post and put my code

15709034
mouse	keyboard
here is my camera class which can be used and can be easily moved around the scene using mouse keyboard

15709094
int	double
if it is an intensive data processing trying to find the specific type might slow it down so returning a double or int is totally fine

15709099
gridview	objectdatasource
also define the objectdatasource in your code outside the gridview

15709111
post	get
there s also _get and _request which seems to merge both post and get data

15709111
post	get
there are a couple of options like making a request get from your first page or post the data from your first page

15709162
google-chrome	safari
however when viewing the same page in google-chrome or safari it looks like this

15709217
puts	gets
so i wrote this method for my chrome plugin which does an ajax request to run this method and when it runs file_put_contents shows an id of what ever was inserted but then when it gets to the insert ignore into songs it puts in 0 for the artist_id

15709242
post	get
my goal is to reproduce this in c# so that i can authenticate get the cookie and then post data and retrieve results from this site

15709320
hide	show
i use css to show and hide elements at certain break points

15709320
hide	show
i also use jquery toggle to show hide elements

15709320
hide	show
i then use jquery to show hide the menu when the icon is selected

15709353

cloned the repo using egit

15709550
hash	md5
then you would update your md5 hash with the newly read byte

15709550
hash	md5
edit since a typical md5 implementation would have to break the input into chunks of 512 bits before processing you can get rid of that overhead in the implementation itself not recommended though and just read 512 bits 64 bytes from the file and update the hash afterwards directly

15710443
children	parent
but the children are using also the image as the parent item

what you did was to read one line into and loops over that one item in the for-loop

15710595
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome are both based on webkit and as such have no inherent differences when it comes to css rendering

15710595
google-chrome	safari
however if your google-chrome browser is using a different version of webkit than your safari s you could potentially see some issues

15710595
google-chrome	safari
code would really help but i can suggest checking the respective versions of safari and google-chrome and perhaps update them both to their latest builds

15710642
pop-up	dialog
normally when i work with jquery non-mobile i am more involved with the click event opening of pop-up s dialog

15710646

std ostringstream os1

15710675
width	height
and height as 100 and changed width by 100+i 80

15710688
sorting	grouping
the reason order by is working for you is that it kind of tricks the query optimizer into sorting the results before grouping which just so happens to produce the result you want but be warned that will not always be the case

15710691
ostringstream	std
apart from that you should also to be able to use std ostringstream

15710707
button	checkbox
then make your checkbox button set to your xml file...as below

15710816

15710920
min	max
for example you may chose to have max or min of these values

15710982

settimeout and setinterval have a minimum overhead time of about 2 to 10 milliseconds therefore firing thousands or millions of timers is going to be slow for no reason

15711008
int	double
i want it to be able to take int floats double strings and

15711035
width	height
just drawimage bg width height 0 0

15711057
google-chrome	firefox
as far as i can see it is not implemented in google-chrome nor in firefox otherwise you would be able to use it from the google-chrome or firefox console as for example the domimplementation object you can find this object as a global variable in the browser s consoles

15711057
google-chrome	firefox
who is implementing the dom interface for example browsers like google-chrome or firefox

15711068

a better approach may be to manage your dependencies declaratively using ivy and have both the ant build and the eclipse project using ivyde take their libraries from there

15711079
easymock	powermockito
we re using powermockito already but powermockito easymock is also on the list of approved libraries

when they click on a unit i d like to hide all the inputs in the same section then show the relevant ones

15711193
intersect	contains
the observation is that either the segments of the triangles intersect or if one rectangle is entirely contains in the other one

15711193
intersect	contains
we break it down to a couple of checks if lines intersect or a rectangle contains a point

15711208
nsoperation	nsrunloop
to schedule the timer in a background thread i think you need to use nsoperation subclass and schedule the timer to nsrunloop currentrunloop from inside the operation s main method

15711228
hide	show
reduced code demo removing tabs hide show

15711233
flask	django	flask	pyramid
now that i m in pythonland i find that many frameworks such as flask django and pyramid use a file called views.py to contain functions which implement the routes

15711243
folder	dir
if i use chdir folder then later when i call getcwd dir filename_max then i ll get the string c folder instead of the case correct string c folder

15711243
folder	directory
as soon as i start changing the working directory then the casing always matches my strings instead of the actual folder casing

15711251

...but again this only fixes this same problem in google-chrome not firefox

15711290
google-chrome	safari
this happens in both google-chrome and safari on my ipad

15711330
post	get
if it s successful you will get a post to your callback.php with the subscriptionid of your new subscription

15711330
post	get
everytime you get a post to your callback.php you need to fire a request to instagram for their latest media that matches your tag

15711331
hide	show
if you choose to hide all elements which isn t the simplest solution at all then you must show much more inputs that what you do as elements visible in hidden aren t really visible

15711331
hide	show
a simpler solution would be to hide show only one level of elements

15711337
mouseleave	mouseenter
you really should use mouseenter mouseleave events based on and in your fiddle you have a part setting the data for a parent element on click that could be simpler

15711339
calloc	malloc
since you are creating a dynamic # of these nodes you should allocate these info structs on the heap with malloc calloc etc

15711347
macports	homebrew
on my system i installed xcode4.6 with command-line tools also macports and homebrew

15711408

there are alternative ways to plot such as ggplot2 or lattice graphics sometimes it is easier to make complicated plots using these tools and sometimes it is harder

15711504
width	height
i m changing the height and the width of my customview which extends android view in runtime like this

15711504
width	height
where the width and height i specified are at the same size of the green rectangle

15711516
post	get
your submit button could include the arguments in the url get instead of post

15711528
hide	show
default functionality is set via the small logo display name short name and show name settings but you can specify binding right in your tile update to hide logo name for certain tile updates

15711535
getter	setter
the create getter and setter for all variables

15711542
google-chrome	firefox
you can find css class of bootstrap and live edit with inspectelemets tools on google-chrome and firebug addones on firefox borwser

15711564
width	height
the simplest way to find the width height of an element in jquery would just be

15711567
post	get
i ve got the bulk of it but unsure what to get and post and how to reference it in the jsp

15711594
accessor	properties
note that get_name accessor for auto-property appears twice because myclass hides name properties of the base class

15711607
xmlpullparser	domparser	xmlpullparser	saxparser	domparser	saxparser
i ve looked at and attempted countless tutorials on xmlpullparser domparser and saxparser and i m now struggling

15711609
next	except
vector has o 1 o log n length prepend append and random access is asymptotically smaller list is 3-4 times bigger due to vtable and next pointers and supports cache efficient and parallelized computation while list has none of those properties except o 1 prepend

15711668
free	malloc
my thoughts on the subject is that either there is something i don t understand about malloc and free or there is a bug in the library in how it determines the size needed for the incoming data and after using a longer string i am getting garbage as part of a memory block that was to big

15711681
g++	gcc
i m trying to compile gcc g++ 4.8 on a 64-bit fedora 17 server

15711696
viewdidload	viewwillappear
in the viewdidload method and have hidden the navigationbar in the viewwillappear method using

15711709
gruntjs	package.json
basically the thing is i m working on a project that uses gruntjs for build tasks and as i have a few dependencies here and there i thought it was a good idea to declare those on a package.json so that my co-workers can npm install without being required to manually install every package at the correct version

15711716
mamp	ampps
i don t see why anyone would use mamp or ampps or any other packed 3rd party out-of-box webserver app when mac os x comes with apache and php by default

15711716
sudo	passwd
like matt gibson said start terminal and type sudo requires your root passwd

15711756
google-chrome	firefox
this appears to be a bug in ie since it works just fine in firefox and google-chrome

15711781
versioning	upgrade
a week ago i upgrade my os to the latest versioning so glew nvidia drivers g++ qt etc

15711788
width	height
controls width and height

15711829
int	chars
chars constants sizeof expressions whose results are int

15711841
ubuntu	linux
- should be able to run on linux ubuntu

15711907
explode	implode
given that the string is a csv you could explode it process each value and then implode it

15711923
post	get
i read a post that the item needs to be created with the non-lookup column values retrieve the new item s id then insert the value into the lookup column but i get the same error

15711958
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
accessor and mutators are just fancy names fot a getter and a setter

15711958
mutators	setter
a setter mutators sets a class s variable or its value

15711958
getter	setter
so let s add a getter and while we re at it add a setter as well

15711964
folder	directory
i converted the app_code which has sub directory for vb and cs it renamed to the folder to old_app_code

15712036
for-loop	loops
i had a lot of trouble thinking about how to carry over the results from one iteration of a for-loop to the next or to outside loops so i could sum them

15712040
hash	md5
must be a hex-encoded md5 hash 32 digit hexadecimal number of a concatenation of the following parameter values separated byâ â values should be in lower case

15712068
rpm	yum
i dont use centos but i looked in the rpm package files section yum is an rpm frontend wrapper of sorts if i recall

15712068
centos	linux	rpm	yum	post	get
lastly you might want to post this on serverfault that seems like it might be more appropriate and you might get better linux package related responses i answered anyway in case it helps but again i m not a centos guy and haven t used yum rpm in a long time so grain of salt and all

15712078
tcplistener	tcpclient
i initially thought that this would be too complex but it got a lot simpler once i realized that i could pass a reference to the calling tcplistener or tcpclient in the state object

15712099
int	chars	int	double
so the function is like void showallstring int argc chars argv to receive double pointer as argument

15712126
viewdidload	viewdidappear
if i hide the status bar in viewdidload and do the log in viewdidappear i get 1024

15712133
folder	directory
if it would sufficient to copy the directory contents then just clean your build folder you can try this

15712134
put	get
instead of putting the quantity on the url as a get parameter and trying to update it with javascript just put a attribute on the input field and it will get posted with the form

15712134
post	get
in general since you re posting a form you probably want to send data as post parameters instead of get

15712134
put	get
i would probably put the other get params in hidden fields on the form too

15712156
children	parent
in other words i m trying to make the children to become the siblings of their own parent

15712172
post	put
you could easily change that to a progressbar and put your http post code in doinbvackground

15712212
bash	zsh
i don t use bash but zsh

15712219
width	height
the origin is always expressed in pixels but since you know the physical width and height of each pixel it is easy to convert from the physical space you want back to pixels using division

15712234
getter	setter	public	protected
other way is to define protected public getter setter function in class introducing this property

15712236
post	put
i wasnt gonna edit all my code with an indent just to post it here so i just put it on pastebin

15712237
multiplying	division
i presume that you know that using a division is a lot slower than multiplying by decimal number 5 is always slower than 0.2

15712244
integer	fractions
if i want to multiply fractions by integer using function everything works very well thanks to conversion constructor p

15712272
multiplying	add
this function starts with 1 and then tries to either add 5 to it or multiplying it by 3

15712279
width	height
both the height and width of the seekbar are set as fill_parent

15712304
addition	multiplication
the third path is actually a branch in that it recurses twice once to try the addition once for the multiplication

15712315
integer	fractions
the other alternative is to make your constructor explicit rather than the conversion operator so that the compiler won t be able to silently instantiate a fractions when a single value convertible to an integer is provided

15712386
hide	show
i was trying to code jquery js logic for hide show description based on radio button being checked or not

15712452
width	height
a custom viewportlayout can take this into consideration asking its parent for the allowed height and thereby allowing the scrollpanelayout to adjust the preferred width accordingly

15712463
pop-up	dialog
i don t know what this would be called in order to search it myself it took a long time to realise a pop-up window was actually referred to as dialog within android

15712465
width	height
i have a android app using a webview to load a webpage however in the graphical layout and in the app it shows a white thick border i tried resizing and i tried changing the width and height in the xml layout file but no change

15712505
post	get
if i can get more time to invest in this i ll update my post but in the meantime uninstalling ie10 resolves the issue

15712527
serializable	deserialization
store in filesystem using serializable to store and deserialization to read

15712536
keydown	keyup
keyup fires after the keypress event has been handled and keypress is supposed to not fire for non-printable characters though there are some inconsistencies across different browsers so preventing the event s default action right at keydown is the best course of action

15712561
email	dkim
common industry practices include reviewing email for the presence of a spf validation sender id and dkim records within email received

15712561
dns	spf
spf sender policy framework is essentially an extra dns record that directly specifies where remote mail servers should be expecting to receive mail from

15712561
email	dkim
you can send an email from a test domain.com to check-auth verifier.port25.com when sent an email will return stating the verification of dkim domainkeys spf spamassassin and sender-id

15712605
client-side	server-side
so if you are setting a value server-side which checks the box this client-side javascript should evaluate it properly

15712617
viewdidload	viewdidappear
okay i figured it out i needed to have the contentsize code in a viewdidappear method not in a viewdidload method

15712700
int	chars
yes addition for chars is defined by adding their int equivalents

15712707
pull	push
bzr pull will automatically use the parent branch but bzr push requires that you specify the parent if you want to push to the parent like so bzr push parent

15712707
pull	push
you can see what the parent push and pull branches are for your local repo using the bzr info command

15712711
width	height
it might be looking for height and width properties to get the measurements of the objects on the page

15712721
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i have this working great in everything but ie safari google-chrome chromium firefox

15712741
width	height
now all of the images must be sized in millimeters they are square images btw so height width

15712741
mdpi	hdpi
if i load all of my images into the hdpi yes i know it is an mdpi device so it will be sized by the android os the height of the image using my example dumps as 164px and appears at roughly 50mm

15712741
width	height
set the imageview height and width using layoutparams to the height of the image 246px

15712746
jruby	mri
also the implementation - ruby 1.8 mri with green threads vs ruby 2 mri vs jruby etc - will play a role in how race conditions if any will materialize

15712790
udp	tcp
downloaded an application from play store called udp tcp server it send packets to a specified ip and port and i was able to get the sent data to my server

15712881
min	max
i am working on a homework assignment that requires i generate the ssn and grade for each student as well as calculate the min max and avg score while displaying the ssn of the student with the max score

15712881
min	max
it all works except i get an iteration of the min max and avg for every student instead of the total and i dont get the ssn for the max score student

15712886
post	get
i m trying to get a webpage parse a part of it and then post it as a value

15712902
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
the page text is supposed to look like so link to page use modern browser like google-chrome safari firefox

15712990
uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource
your class viewcontroller must implement all methods that are required by the uipickerviewdatasource and uipickerviewdelegate protocols

15712990
uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource
see working with protocols uipickerviewdatasource protocol reference and uipickerviewdelegate protocol reference

15713024
firefox	safari
this is the same on firefox safari and ie10 so i think it s my fault and not a bug

15713043
int	double
change the sort method to get int instead of double

15713081
free	malloc
implementations of malloc will vary but its safe to assume assume that calls to malloc can return a pointer to a previously free -ed chunks of memory and that the memory returned will not have been zeroed out

15713095
width	height
actually the width property of the transformed element will actually change it s visible height now and the height property will change it s visible width

15713095
width	height
set the height property of each transformed element to it s width in pixels

15713109
mdpi	hdpi	folder	directory
as we all know an hdpi device will use an image from the drawale-hdpi folder while an mdpi device will display the same named image from the drawable-mdpi directory

15713109
screens	mdpi	folder	directory
however when an mdpi device cannot find an image in the drawable-mdpi directory it will eventually choose from the drawable-hdpi folder but it will down-scale the image for display on the mdpi screens

15713153
width	height
what is happening is i set the tilesource to something like version 1.1.1 request getmap service wms srs epsg 3a4326 bbox 0 width 256 height 256 layers bundeslaender

so for a hypothetical processor with 8 regs for int pointer args and 8 regs for float double args you might have something like

15713216
chown	chmod
ops are wary of changing group permissions using chmod or chown

15713262
post	get
so what you should probably do now is read up on avcapturevideopreviewlayer try to get a sample project working and post here again if you get stuck on suitably self-contained code fragments

15713265
versioning	upgrade
you should probably also upgrade your versioning of wordpress as new security holes are discovered in that kind of software all the time

15713616
folder	directory
it will all be located in a single folder directory

15713616
folder	directory

15713742
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
i would like to divide split this lengthy program into sub-programs like add.java for addition sub.java for subtraction mul.java for multiplication and so on

15713789
put	get
the advantage of this approach is you get everything you would have from the enum but your code s now much more flexible so should you need to perform different actions based on the value of question you can put logic into question itself in the preferred oo fashion as opposed to putting lots of case statements throughout your code to tackle each scenario

15713799
width	height
that is double the height of the frame for uibutton and the width necessary to have the facebook f with space

15713878
children	parent
pop last array element and push it inside its parent element s children array

15713912
children	parent
you ll want to first put all of your items into a sparse array indexed by their id and translate everything except the children which should be present but empty and including the parent id

15713912
children	parent
then you ll want to go through all of the items adding children to their parent

15713912
children	parent
the reason your method didn t work is that if any children have a parent with a greater id number the parent element will not exist

15713924
nsurl	nsdata
when i compile this under 10.8 i get warnings because all the carbon functions are deprecated and we re supposed to be using opaque bookmark nsdata objects out of the nsurl api

15713984
hide	show
if i disable it it works fine.but my requirement is hide and show

15713999
accessor	properties
if you really can t use type comparison because of derived classes that will both be of type staticreference but you want to differentiate via name not shown in your example - but if that s not the case use type comparison instead you can use a static properties for the name but access it via virtual accessor

15714011
setcontentview	findviewbyid

cos	sin
i assume that the above formulas are calculating the coordinates using the form y mx + c with sin cos equaling the gradient m

15714230
int	chars
your issue is that fgetc returns an int not chars

15714230
int	chars
you need to define c as an int so that you can identify the eof otherwise it will overlap with some valid chars s value and as you discovered may not be detectable at all if chars is unsigned

15714294
free	strdup
don t forget to eventually free each string returned by strdup when you are done with them

15714296

15714298
implode	htmlspecialchars
see implode array_map and htmlspecialchars

15714306
cos	sin
if you do that you find x cos t and y sin t

15714306
cos	sin
this is basically the definition of sin and cos so there s not a lot to understand it s just that if the position in terms of t is then angle then the position in terms of x and y is cos t and sin t

15714306
cos	sin
if the circle is not of unit radius then the instead of x cos t and y sin t you have and

superclass	subclassing
what you have here is a field in the subclassing b that hides the field in the superclass a

15714409
superclass	subclassing
but if your subclassing refer directly to fields of the superclass then the superclass fields must have the right access modifiers to allow this

15714409
superclass	subclassing

postgresql	mysql
these don t affect the speed of select statements in postgresql and i don t think they affect select speed in mysql

getter	setter
your current setter methods should all be discarded except perhaps setradius ... and most of the calculations be done in the respective getter methods

15714526
post	get
although it is possible to do this by playing random number god and just creating an algorithm with the post time post id and other things in order to get a single random number for each post based on post meta i would like to know if it would be easier to make it so that the image chosen was stored in the database instead

children	parent
use the inverse_of option for the association on the parent so the children will have a reference to the parent when they are built

15714841
int	double
those and parameters should be ref double and ref int on the c# side

15714844
implements	extends
all of those objects appear extends movie and implements profitable so you will able to access everything this way

15714915
min	max

15715059
width	height
do i only set height and width in rectangle

15715074
width	height
this way you can construct squares with a single argument and it will invoke the rectangle constructor with that argument as width and height

rpm	yum
so when you install an rpm it creates what is called a rpm database lock and this lock file keeps you from running another instance of rpm and by association yum

15715528

i imagine this was put in place to ensure the transaction doesn t get screwed up when multiple packages are trying to install

15715627

as it is under svn so i dare not go mucking around with the working directory by copying it to another directory checking it out and copying it back because there is zillions of .svn folder and that will screw up svn s house of cards.

15716749
folder	directory
apparently default android.mk presumes that the imagetargets folder is located at .. vuforia-sdk-android-x-x-xx samples imagetargets-x-x-x but after i had downloaded the samples and extracted them to the samples directory the location was the following .. vuforia-sdk-android-x-x-xx samples vuforia-sampleapps-android-x-x-xx imagetargets-x-x-x

15720960
int	chars
originally the type signature i put was chars - int but that didn t work it said something about eq but i m too new too haskell to interpret it properly

15720975
children	parent
for what i ve managed to understand from the javascript function the div that has the label and dropdown for the children should appear hidden once the page is loaded and appear once the user selects a parent from the first list currently this is not happening and instead everything shows up once the page is loaded

15721067
int	double
in the int version it works but then it s only for int types and doesn t accept double or string types as the problem asks

15721077

15721260
virtualbox	parallels	vmware	virtualbox
i.e. currently the first piece of software to try would be virtualbox parallels workstation or vmware workstation and the next piece of software to try would be some linux distribution running on your windows machine under the virtualization software

15721260
winpcap	libpcap
yes i have to find the time to do some libpcap infrastructure work to make it easier for the winpcap people to make their remote capture support work with newer versions of libpcap

15721260
libpcap	wireshark	winpcap	libpcap	winpcap	wireshark
a workaround for that particular issue would be either to save a capture from wireshark in pcap format rather than pcap-ng format or to use wireshark tools such as editcap which can handle pcap-ng files on windows as they don t use libpcap winpcap to read capture files to convert from pcap-ng to pcap

15721260
winpcap	libpcap
there are a couple of python wrappers for libpcap winpcap - python-libpcap and pcapy

15721262

box-sizing	border-box
use box-sizing border-box

15721310
put	get

so you have to implement them in the derived class as it was said in other answers and by implement i mean just declare a getter and a setter you can even copy paste the code from your interface into your class

15721612
post	get
if i assign featured post true to post-111 the value of post-123 s featured post -custom field needs to get the value false or deleted entirely

superclass	subclassing
what i am trying to do is access information variables methods etc from a superclass and it s subclassing

15731256
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
if what i know about inherited is right by accessing the superclass we have access to it s subclassing by default

15731284
superclass	subclassing
you have access to it s subclassing by default.so i m thinking i only need to be able to access the parent superclass

15731284
superclass	subclassing
no by accessing the superclass you have access to only those methods of subclassing which is overridden by subclassing

15731284
superclass	subclassing
the methods which the subclassing creates for own even if it is public couldn t be accessed by the object of superclass

15731300
treemap	linkedhashmap
use linkedhashmap to traverse in insertion order or treemap to traverse in comparison order

15731312
superclass	subclassing
by accessing the subclassing you have access to the fields of the superclass limited to the visibility and finality of the field

15731313
asterisk	freeswitch
i am very much new to asterisk freeswitch integration to web apps running on php node.js or any other server side languages.what i would like to achieve is to create a new sip user in asterisk freeswitch conf files or database files from within a web application

15731322
superclass	subclassing
i m seeing a basic misunderstanding of what superclass and subclassing are

15731345

versioning	upgrade
if you re using an older versioning of python can t upgrade and don t have pip installed you can find more information about installing pip at the following links

15731529
hide	show
then you could use the asynctask to simply show hide a dialog and cancel restart asynctasks on rotation which is done by shelves example as you mentioned

15731539
persistent	transient
this is quite a hassle and you will have to be careful with any cascade operations that you are relying on because you will probably need to avoid overwriting persistent objects with transient ones

15731575
super	abstract
create an abstract method in the super class

15731595
youtube	vimeo
what you are seeing is not actually playing the video from youtube or vimeo

15731596
jobs	cron
i would rather stay away from cron jobs if it is possible to implement this without it

15731628
pull	push
it only takes a git push on your machine and a git pull on the production server to make your changes live globally

15731668
folder	directory
however an issue arose when i converted those chars strings and related functions to their wide counterparts wchar_t wstring findfirstfilew etc. now the program is throwing an exception when recursively scanning directory with more than a small number of folder files

15731695
folder	directory
also note that multi-configuration generators like msvc will still append a per-configuration directory to this project root bin folder

15731698
google-chrome	firefox
i am currently writing a simple proxy server that is like interface between my browser firefox or google-chrome and web server i set firefox to send request to specific port 7777 and i listen to this port for getting request and send to internet for getting response

15731781
int	chars
i think you can convert the binary to int which occupy less space because they have less chars eg

15731790
children	parent
i ve tried to make a program that creates parent with two children parent creates unnamed pipe writes into it and the children are supposed to read from it per 1 byte and then output the results in two different terminal windows

i hide .contentleft and .contentright when i resize as it causes lag when it s show

15732130
hash	salt
but session limiting and database for that matter are best with salt keys or hash

15732139
post	put
of course you will still have to put limits on your search for related post but that s just a matter of using limit

15732167
hide	show
you should hide your radio elements with css and show images instead

15732184
hide	show
it s really just one form but uses javascript to hide the first panel and show the second when the user clicks the next button and moves on to step 2

15732194

this bug appears in firefox and ie8 but it does not appear in opera google-chrome and safari

15732400
width	margin
the negative left margin is usually half of the width of the element but in this case you will be pushing to the left more so make it a bigger negative number if needed

15732426
boost	allocator
i haven t used boost interprocess but i think you will need to use boost interprocess string or a std basic_string with a non-default allocator for your key

15732437
next	except
in doublechainedlist class except the constructor destructor and the next 4 methods which are working fine i made a method called get_prim which is supposed to get me the address of the first element from the specified list

15732527
macbook	isight	macbook	bootcamp
i want to use the built-in isight camera of my macbook i m under bootcamp

15732624
puts	gets
i run your code with gets and puts and it worked

15732683
g++	gcc
i guess it is lucky that this worked from gcc and unlucky that g++ did not

15732686
google-chrome	firefox
i came up with kind of a solution yet to test on other browsers other than google-chrome and firefox but working so far

15732720
fflush	gets
however my suspicion is that the query cache is at the heart of this - re-running the same query will seed the query cache and unless the underlying data changes or the cache gets fflush you re likely to benefit from the caching

15732735
width	height
set top left height width accordingly

15732769
scikit-learn	nltk
i am getting quite different results when classifying text in only two categories with the bernoulli naive bayes algorithm in nltk and the one in scikit-learn module

15732769
scikit-learn	nltk
in particular the nltk naive bayes classifier would give more type i than type ii errors while the scikit-learn -- the opposite

15732777
dictionary	map
instead of defining hundreds of named variables like that you should use a list of names a list of values and build a dictionary to map them

15732790
for-loop	arrays
this above segment is where i add the images to the arrays and when i want to check for things like intersection between my character sprite and the ground i use a for-loop like this

15732799
opera	firefox
i tested my site in firefox and opera and it worked as expected

15732821
uninstall	upgrade	dpkg	apt
pip is a package manager which can install upgrade list and uninstall packages like familiar package managers including dpkg apt yum urpmi ports etc

15732823

an md5 hash is twice as fast

15732827
put	get
from there you can get all the data from your db and put in the intent for the next activity

15732838
hash	md5
use something like md5 to hash the html then use two dictionaries one mapping url to content-hash and another mapping content hash to actual content

15732868
ubuntu	linux
iirc some builds of mysql for ubuntu linux were vulnerable but that s only known binary distribution of mysql or any derived product that was vulnerable

15732868
versioning	upgrade
the vulnerability is fixed in any case if you upgrade to versioning 5.1.63 5.5.12 or 5.6.6 or later point-releases of each of these branches

15732868
versioning	upgrade
if you have a mysql server package that is vulnerable only ubuntu packages are vulnerable as far as i know or you compiled mysql server from source yourself in a way that is vulnerable then you should upgrade mysql server to at least one of the versioning i list above

15732877
folder	directory
when your updating production create a folder called 1.1 and put the new application in there whether manually or through some vcs then symlink the public html directory to it

15732885

15732885
uilabel	uibutton
i want to apply styles only to the uilabel and uibutton contained inside my object instances

15732932
hash	md5
i d go with md5 since it s fast-- it s a disadvantage for cryptographic purposes but using an expensive hash like sha512 for indexing is just a waste of your cycles

15732956
post	get
i wrote a blog post to share my experiences and hopefully give back to the community that helped me get there which may help understand my answer

15732957
post	get
in that i get the data from another process and add it in the post field of the request

15732957
content-length	content-type
but i want to just change the content-type to binary how should i change only content-type it without need of manually changing of other fields like content-length agent

15732994
getter	setter
then you add a getter setter for amount so you can use #amount all over the place

15733007
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it all works perfect in google-chrome firefox safari and opera

15733008

i am writing a parser that removes all punctuation from a text file and puts the words in a map that associates each words with the number of times it occurs in the file

15733078
post	get
there s the post and then a get for the css files and another get for the jquery library

15733089
spaces	delimiter
what s happening here is that explode splits the string at the given delimiter here the spaces character

15733142
calloc	malloc
i used calloc instead of malloc and instead of i used calloc sizeof mytype_t

15733184
int	double
after the addition x is still 7 so the double is being cast to an int and rounded down to 0 but this is done without any explicit cast in the code

15733187
folder	directory
it reads the appropriate file located in the apps package contents however when it tries to write to that file it creates a new folder in the same directory as the app itself and writes to a new file with the same name instead

15733187
folder	directory
i have tried naming the write to location the explicitly same link as where the exported app stores the data folder inside the package contents contents resources java data assets but this creates a copy of this directory in the same file as the app

15733192
width	height
the content of the div is responsive means if the window width changes the divs content height changes too

15733349
width	height
i don t need to wrap each line in a p tag i can instead use an inline element such as an a span or label tag with display inline-block and a height + width to act as a new line element

15733402
post	get
i have a few requests get and post that will be direct pass throughs to another service

15733433
bindparam	bindvalue
if you don t know if you need bindvalue or bindparam go for the former

15733437
hide	show
in this example hide all series and after that show the last serie serie3 the grid show bad

15733440
onresume	onpause
if you need to persist some state regardless of whether the activity is destroyed or not save it usually to sharedpreferences in onpause and retrieve it in onresume

jcheckbox	jradiobutton
the jmenu has 3 jradiobutton and 2 jcheckbox that appear when menuitems are scrolled over

15733458
jcheckbox	jradiobutton
the problem is that when i click on a jradiobutton or jcheckbox the whole menu disappears

15733466
google-chrome	firefox
it looks fine in google-chrome but it doesn t seem to work for firefox

15733502
opera	google-chrome
this is optimized for opera google-chrome and ie10

15733502
firefox	safari
firefox and safari follow an older flexbox specification and look best when the lists have a balanced number of items

15733515
joptionpane	jdialog
fill your jdialog or joptionpane with a jpanel that uses appropriate layouts and that may override getpreferredsize

15733532
getter	setter
getter and setter methods are usually necessary but it is the job of the constructor to initialize variables of that object

15733542
min	max
hello everyone i have a question on printing the max to min based on the number of items in the dictionary

15733586
fadein	fadeout
i thought fadein and fadeout are enough

15733594
post	get
when trying to post an activity to facebook from a native android application i get the following response after executing the request

15733608
post	get
when i post a .txt file i get the following error which is expected since the default allowed format is image jpeg image png

15733608
post	get
but when i post a .jpg file i get the following error instead

15733646
profiling	instrumentation
there is no need to recompile or instrumentation the application in order to profiling it with allinea map - which makes it unusually easy to get started with

15733715
oncreate	recreate
then you can get stored value inside the oncreate which is called as the activity gets recreate when orientation changes

15733761
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
regardless of the inotifycollectionchanged that s just for inside collection - you still need to notify any subscribers that the whole collection has changed - and that using inotifypropertychanged - on that anulling which is unnecessary btw. you need to call onpropertychanged collection or whatever is named

15733770
hash	md5
store the images in the file-system re- name them after the image s hash md5 has a proven chance for collisions try sha1 or ripemd-160 store the hash as index in the db together with all meta data source ip original name dimensions uploader author etc you d like to link store with that image

15733770
hash	md5
i have used a variation on some occasions md5 fixed length hash output appended with crc32 fixed length hash output

15733770
hash	md5
this is still the same total output-size compared to a 160-bit hash but i think the collision-chance is minimal probably none existent however should you actually find 2 different files having both the same md5 and crc32 you can collect your 5 minutes of internet-fame

15733789
3des	aes
you should do cbc with 3des or aes with no-padding

15733799
debian	linux
debian linux 6.0 linux 2.6.32-5-amd64 on x86_64

15733829
addition	multiplication
i have worked out addition and scalar multiplication but i am struggling to develop the multiplication of two matrices

15733878
serializable	deserialization
that might be problematic to serializable though due to deserialization

15733879
mouseover	mouseout
if you add some console.log statements to the mouseover and mouseout handler functions you will see that they get called way too much

15733879
mouseleave	mouseenter
jquery provides a good solution to this problem the mouseenter and mouseleave events

15733879
mouseover	mouseenter
read about them in the api docs specifically the section describing the difference between mouseover and mouseenter

15733894
sudo	passwd
installing requirements for osx might require sudo passwd

15733921
put	get
the problem now is that i get a nullpointerexception for anything any number i put in other than 2 and 3

15733929
multiplying	multiplication
nevertheless be warned - especially if you re multiplying small matrices on modern processor architectures speed heavily depends on matrix data and multiplication order arranged in a way to make best use of in cache lines

15733954
viewdidload	viewwillappear
according to this answer you should place your -loadrequest call in viewwillappear not viewdidload

15733965
put	get
so you need to check when you finally have the image but before you put it in the uitableviewcell that the cell is still assigned to the same indexpath as when you started to get the image

15733979
width	height
a media query consists of a media type and at least one expression that limits the style sheets scope by using media features such as width height and color

15734031
google-chrome	firefox
this results in a 401 unauthorized response to the options request which lead to google searches like why does this work in google-chrome and not firefox

15734040
children	parent
because modal parent height is calculated according other children

15734045
unsigned	short
in early ms compiler versions wchar_t was just an alias for unsigned short which is a violation of the c++ standard so that explains the implementation in strmbase.lib

15734045
unsigned	short
now you can flip this switch so that it matches the lib but there are downsides to this that you can t overload with wchar_t and unsigned short then

15734049
children	parent
this parent has children that should be positionally locked to their parent s rotation but their own rotation needs to be independent and not inherit from the parent

15734049
children	parent
my attempt was to invert the rotation of the parent in the children

15734051
hide	show
you can hide the cursor while the animation is running then show it again after it has finished

15734058
post	get
while the core dart io library has the primitives for http clients see httpclient the http package makes it much easier to get post etc

15734077

when i extends a class from zend_rest_controller the 5 abstract method is implements index get put delete post which is used for crud

15734126
i2c	spi
i was explaining i2c spi serial protocols to my friend when he mentioned there s a way to send data between two devices using one wire with the 4b5b protocol

15734181
bufferedreader	printwriter
1st question is to call the bufferedreader printwriter etc

15734220
dictionary	map
i want to assign these to a dictionary which i can later use to colour in the counties map

15734229
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works fine on google-chrome firefox opera and safari

15734249
packets	multicast
note that the behavior of operating systems is not entirely logical nor consistent in terms of binding when receiving udp packets especially for multicast traffic

15734249
packets	multicast
this means for example that multicast udp packets received by an interface with ip 192.168.1.100 will not be received when binding to ip 192.168.1.100

15734249
packets	multicast
incoming udp packets are not filtered by this ip so multicast traffic can be received even when binding to a concrete ip

15734261
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to run a program to have it launch an external linux program in ubuntu 12.04

15734323
i2c	spi
the short answer is that 4b5b isn t a protocol you can use while i2c and spi are

15734323
i2c	spi
i2c and spi qualify as osi network level 1 and 2 specifications covering both physical electrical specifications of connection between devices and how the connected devices use the connection to communicate

15734334
switching	screens
or you could have logic in the viewdidappear method of a common initial controller and have it switching the root view controller of the window to on of your three screens

15734337
hash	md5
the best approach for that would be that you use the md5 hash of the uploaded file

15734364
width	height
now i have the maximum width and height for my wrapper

15734364
width	margin
for instance if your buttons are just 120x90 pixels correct the width of #buttons to 120 + 10 margin + 120 250px

15734381
folder	dir
after 1 hours remove folder in dir

15734381

15734392
equals	compareto	equals	tostring	tostring	compareto
enum objects have special tostring hashcode equals and compareto implementations

15734430
post	get
try to see if you get any post vars at all

15734433
put	get
the problem starts when i try to run this with a single worker when i start the worker i put it to run all queues and set 8 concurrent workers then it starts an begin to acknowledge the tasks but it seems that no matter how far in future a task is set to a worker will get it and wait for the its scheduled run meaning that this worker is locked until then

15734483
scheme	prolog
the variable naming scheme var0 var1 ... var where var0 means the initial state in some context and var denotes a final state is a generally useful naming pattern when describing state transitions in prolog

15734489
g++	gcc
i found the following code of an imap mail client but when triing to compile it with g++ gcc 4.6.3 it shows some errors that seem to have something to do with the scope of the used namespaces

15734506
nsurlrequest	nsmutableurlrequest
nsurlrequest nsmutableurlrequest

15734520
oncreate	onstart
i have tried putting the while loop in oncreate onstart and onresume and in all the while loop runs forever without letting the gui get drawn therefore making the task impossible to complete also sometimes i get a anr message

15734663
width	height
i have an image 3width x 15height the first and last pixels are rounded on the corners and i want to create a button the height of the button is always the same 15px but the width changes that uses this image no matter what size it is kinda like uiedgeinsets on ios

15734710
firefox	safari
i ve emptied the cache in firefox checked that the files are in the same folder double and triple checked the code structure and placement in the header on the html page and tried safari as the preview browser

15734710
firefox	safari
firefox and safari see and read the html page fine but none of the css style attributes are cascading

15734746
pull	push
you could either push tasks from gae towards aws or have your aws instances pull tasks from gae

15734754
width	height
i am able to set the height and width of this control but i can t seem to control it s position

15734758

works perfectly fine on latest google-chrome firefox opera ie10 and ie9

15734800
width	height
i have a textbox and as its content grows i want it to grow and as its content shrinks i want it to shrink in terms of both its height and width

15734852
google-chrome	firefox
i realize this isn t exactly what you re looking for but at least in google-chrome ie7+ and firefox 3.5+ this does what you ask - scroll the underlying div when the div overlaying it receives scroll events

15734903
min	max
in addition to updating min and max also keep an index variable and update it

15734928
min	max
change max and min to indexofmax and indexofmin because by storing index of maximum you can access both maximum index and maximum value

15734929
min	max
you also need to remember the indices for max and min when you scan the array

15734931
profiling	debugging
there are several profiling available that you can check but most of them target execution time and are based on debugging hook

15734977
box-sizing	border-box
on newer browsers it works cause the box-sizing border-box calculates the box size differently

width	height
i have a question about dynamic scaling of images within a div container i m building a portfolio website which have 3 col s of project images all scalable in width but static in height div container width 33.33334 height 250px

15735011
superclass	subclassing
i have a superclass and wish to be able to create a new object of any of the subclassing with a method like the the following

15735016
memmove	malloc
as suggested by cartroo i m attempting to use memmove with the dynamic data that uses malloc

15735057
children	parent
here s an example of how style a style of a parent itself based on how many children it at least has

15735072
ubuntu	linux
it also works fine with r2013a on ubuntu linux

15735090
children	parent
you want to have children of a parent object whose positions are relative to the parent but whose rotations are independent of the parent

15735090
children	parent
the easiest way to do this is to have dummy object3d objects as children of the parent and then add the children to the scene not the parent and have the children get their world positions from the dummy objects

15735094
min	max
however you should get used to stl containers vectors lists and all that stuff if you are going to do some intensive algorithms like finding max and min

15735109
quicksort	heapsort
using a fast sorting algorithm like quicksort or heapsort the sorting can be done in o n log n time and each query takes only time o log n to do two different binary searches

15735119
width	height
try setting only height or width not both this will respect the ratio of the image

15735119
min	max	width	height
you can also play with min max width height

15735158
mouseout	mouseenter
i have a ul each li has a row of images and i am trying to bind a function to each li so that on mouseenter the row of images appears and on mouseout the row of images disappears...i call bind on the div within each li based on a an #id so that they work independently

15735158
mouseup	mousedown
everything is working except that the bind function seems to be binding each discrete function to their respective div and then to each subsequent li beneath it...not above though...so as i move the mousedown through the lower list items which are currently collapsed the focused row of images flashes in and out...if i have one of the lower rows of images un-collapsed only one can be un-collapsed at a time and move the mouseup over the above list items this glitchy behavior does not occur.

15735235
put	get
i m using the generic type t to hold an object that s not related to the put and get methods

15735256
folder	dir
i copied the debug keystore fron the android sdk folder and put it a shorter path dir because im lazy

15735257
plot	heatmap
i ve got a scatter plot heatmap generated from two numpy arrays about 25 000 pieces of information

15735310
put	get
so for a raw genericclass the get and put methods also lose their generics

15735335
google-chrome	firefox
i test html5 features in mobile browsers firefox and google-chrome

15735335
google-chrome	firefox
i have this problem in both firefox and google-chrome android device

15735360
spaces	delimiter
delimiter a spaces

15735366
getter	setter
if i have a class holding a private boolean made public by a setter and getter method

15735455
hide	show
my goal is hide the image then show it when the mouse is inside the circle

15735468
width	height
i would suggest creating a framebuffer with a lower resolution maybe half your width height so that you can reduce the bandwidth requirements

15735472
downcasting	upcasting
note upcasting is possible for downcasting you need the astype method

15735491
getter	setter
yes making setter and getter synchronized is a good idea

15735551
lzo	snappy
you might want to consider using lzo compression .gz extenstion instead of snappy

15735604
subtract	add
it returns a number between 1 and -1 which will add or subtract from the current value

15735741
sorting	grouping
you can use this feature to get better performance by avoiding unnecessary column sorting and grouping

15735743
folder	directory
create a folder in your project directory

15735777
put	get
now this works fine and if i put in -2 i get 2 or 4 2

15735785
folder	directory
i added the jdk directory to the path system variable but not all commands are recognizable some commands in the jdk1.6.0_37 bin folder are recognized like java javaw packger and others i d have to type the full directory name for it to work like jar javac javah javap this applies for both cmd and nb

15735786
free	malloc
there needs to be a call to free to match each call to malloc so you need to free each string that you allocate and then free the initial array

15735786
memcpy	strncpy
you need to use something like strncpy or memcpy to copy the string into the allocated block

15735786
printf	strncpy
i suggest printf for convenience because strncpy has the problem that it doesn t guarantee to nul-terminate the result but it s up to you

15735786
memcpy	memmove
fourthly you re still using memcpy and not memmove to shuffle items around

15735786
free	malloc
this function should work whether you use malloc and free or new and delete but it assumes that you ve already copied the string item into an allocated buffer that you will keep around because of course it just stores a pointer

15735801
post	get
assuming you are using post as the method for sending the form those checkboxes are in you can get the values array with

15735806
width	height
you can specify the x y coordinates height and width of this group

15735826
asterisk	freeswitch
asterisk and freeswitch is compleatly different

15735840
portrait	landscape
i ve basically need to have 3 images in a row these may be 2 size either a landscape or portrait both same hight but different widths i need to centred each image with in it s column

15735848
banking	payment
created by checkfree intuit and microsoft in early 1997 open financial exchange supports a wide range of financial activities including consumer and small business banking also with image download and loan and amortization download consumer and small business bill payment bill presentment and investments including stocks bonds and mutual funds and tax download

15735858
getter	setter
you could do something like this if you want both getter and setter for example

15735870
mouseup	mousedown
then the mouseup event is fired on a consistent basis meaning one is fired whenever mousedown is clicked

15735870
mousemove	mouseup
but as you can see from the fiddle if mousemove is binded then its not always the case mouseup is fired

15735872
base	fractions
the values are inexact because they are binary and we are used to writing in decimal and as it happens almost all of the decimal fractions strings we are likely to write do not have an exact equivalence as a base 2 fractions string

15735880
bazaar	git
there is bridge support for mercurial and bazaar now distributed as part of git git-remote-hg is in the git tree under contrib remote-helpers

15735885
int	chars
assume i have a string or an array of integer-type variables uchar chars int whatever

15735962
uicollectionview	uitableview
i have a sliding menu in my app that is a uitableview and what i d like to happen is that when a cell is selected the topview will be updated to a uinavigationcontroller that loads my uicollectionview

15735965
getter	setter
another alternative would be to use a class and define getter and setter

15735968
post	get
i think you could carefully read all the answers to this post to get a better grip on mathematica

15735970
pull	push
ajax push and pull

15735975
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i m having problems putting the team.findbykey methods into some sort of for-loop which can loops through the arrays teamids and for each team in the arrays

15735976
gif	png
but offhand a super easy way for you to achieve this would be to serve up a png or gif for ie8 and below

15736027
textview	imageview
i have a gridview in android where each element is inflated from xml and contains a linearlayout holding an imageview and a textview

15736051
cos	sin
i need to print f n m integers nothing to do with sin cos etc

15736057
flask	django
if you want to run python code that generates an html page you can use a framework like django or flask which will require a server that supports this kind of framework long running processes

15736063
width	height
if you start fixing the width and height on content you will see other effects such as the paragraphs flowing outside of content

15736063
width	margin
if you remove the padding from the wrapper you may not notice the right margin shift because the elements will extend to fill the full width of the parent container or the page width depending on the specific details of the html css

15736102
post	get
you ll need some post processing to get the results you re looking for

15736118
hash	salt
i understand the need for hashing and salting but i do not understand how storing the salt in the same potentially compromised database as the entire hash is secure

15736140
hash	salt
precomputed lists of hash based on common passwords known as rainbow tables cannot be applied to salt passwords at least not without taking into account all salt

15736140
hash	salt
you may obtain slightly better security by separating the hash and the salt because an attacker without the salt would have to bruteforce the salt

15736143
hash	salt
given the password the salt and the hash you can quickly check if the triple is right

15736143
hash	salt
recall that the reason the salt is needed in the first place is to avoid equal passwords produce equal hash

15736143
hash	salt
without the salt attackers would be able to hash the rainbow table and check hash against the encoded dictionary

15736148
acs	adfs
adfs wif microsoft.identitymodel.dll acs 2.0 etc

15736149
hash	salt
having a different salt per user means that they would have to expend all their resources to brute-force a matching hash just for a single user

15736194
uitableview	nsindexpath
uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

15736214
put	get
also you have to put them into the same form if you want to get them both at once

15736292
post	get
so i was able to get the post from my app using the graph exlorer so i geuss they are getting sent

15736296
ng-show	ng-hide
once you have a variable in your rootscope say isloggedin then you can use the ng-show and ng-hide directives to determine what subsets of the dom you want displayed

15736307
onclick	onsubmit
somehow if i do it with onclick function and the image will move and things are good but if i use it with onsubmit function then it wouldn t work

15736329
getter	setter
this is my setter and getter but i seem to have some warning on my getter

15736356
fadein	fadeout
you could use jquery fadein jquery fadeout for this

15736407
jruby	rubinius
you would need to use a ruby implementation that supports real threads such as rubinius or jruby

15736422
unsigned	short
also i don t know how to pass parameters correctly through callback function like wsastartup its parameters word unsigned short number of version lpwsadata reference to wsadata

15736430
for-loop	loops
what i have done was i took the existing code and placed it inside of a for-loop that runs the check based on the current item of loops

15736433
puma	unicorn
a solution you can use in rails is to use servers like unicorn which forks as many process workers as you want and each one will be working independent of the others puma for creating multi threads etc

15736495
postgresql	mysql
i m wondering if there is any tool that can translate mysql sql to postgresql sql so that we can avoid to rewrite those sqls one by one manually

15736512
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
my understanding is that the difficulty lies in the usage of a secret key to salt the md5 hash password for added security and that this key resides in the configuration.php file

15736522
children	parent
i wonder if there is someone out there that had used the framework called flexorm is pretty useful but i m having a problem i need to create a self referencing association for a parent with children table like this

15736531
int	chars
according to c99 specification all chars types are promoted to signed int because an int can represent all values of a chars signed or unsigned

15736550
mxml	haxe
haxe nme is not designed as an answer for an alternative to a flex mxml ui project so if you choose a flex ui you are confined to the limitations it has

15736566
int	double
2 the average might not be correct as this is an int and not a double try type-casting on the sum and count of the tree elements and then return their quotient. br

15736591
daemons	systemd	daemons	launchd
you can configure a launchd daemons to be started only when new file systemd events are detected

15736591
daemons	launchd
see the apple docs on os x launchd daemons here

15736591
daemons	launchd
your launchd daemons executable can then just be a simple main program

15736591

15736772
width	height
top object width object height at

15736811
client-side	server-side
so you have support for locking it off server-side and client-side

15736846
width	margin
when it s set to content-box it only factors in the width of the content and not the margin padding or border

15736847
mouseleave	mouseenter
you should wire-up a single mouseenter and mouseleave to each control that needs this functionality rather than writing a new version of each method for each control

15736847
mouseleave	mouseenter
if you write the following code first then this method will appear in the property s mouseenter and mouseleave events drop-down lists

15736847
mouseleave	mouseenter
this might get out of sync if something odd happens where your mouseenter event is fired for another button before the corresponding mouseleave is caught

15736887
hash	salt
you might have a value that can produce a specific hash but your pre-computed rainbow tables don t account for the salt

15736887
hash	salt
a salt completely changes the hash

i suggest you create a function that open an pop-up the from the page load event at server-side let s register a client script when this script will call your js script to open the dialog box

15737287
width	height
first two integers are base width base height

15737427
rss	feed
it never tells us to create a separate mysql database for the rss feed so i m guessing all the cache is done locally

15737479
entities	entitymanager
this way the entities wouldn t be materialized so i ve publicly exposed the mergeentity function in entitymanager to do this manually and voila an understatement things worked

15737500
rss	feed
i am using yahoo pipes and trying to manipulate a link from an rss feed

15737601

you must use widen the function scope for overriding methods means public or protected

15737664
public	protected
modify your code like this with override and protected or public

15737673
slony	bucardo
this is not an out of the box solution but with something like bucardo or slony it can be done albeit with a fair bit of work and added maintenance

15737692
getter	setter
but in my case it is a bit different an argument to a function decides whether that function is a getter or a setter so i am looking for a function name that will indicate such function

15737693
put	get
to get the preprocessed output replace the -c option with -e on the command line and change the -o obj alert.o option to -o alert.ii to put the preprocessor output into the file alert.ii

i m running a simple program where i convert a string into an array of chars and then convert the chars into int where i then add or subtract numbers to them in order to encrypt the string

15737717
put	get
i could put it on the remote server and use jquery get equiv. to submit and check the name but this would be as fast as the users connection

15737723
decltype	auto
it s not very helpful to see documented that the return type of a function template is auto whereas seeing it documented as decltype t+u creates a published interface you can hopefully rely on

15737730
mamp	wamp
the reason it works on remote servers is because replacement is done by the web server so if you want research to work then you will need a local web server such as wamp on windows or mamp on mac

15737736
vb.net	vb6
the microsoft visual basic power pack 3.0 component adds back to vb versions 2005 and higher a set of controls that were available in pre-.net versions of vb vb6 but removed in the first versions of vb.net 2002 2003

in the same way if i start using the ipad as landscape view and rotate the ipad in to portrait view

15738247
portrait	landscape
it is showing the sizing of landscape but not portrait

15738253
int	chars
f is an array of 10 pointers to functions taking a pointer to int argument and returning a pointer to chars

15738254
int	chars	int	double
an unformatted function means the function considers the stream as a sequence of chars even if it is double or int

15738295
google-chrome	firefox
you can do that in google-chrome developer tools or firefox firebug and check if it is able to get the script loading with no errors

now next easiest way to achieve would be using a trie tree

15738533
trie	tree
you will find a ready to use trie tree implementation here

15738567
qsort	bsearch
if you have a large number of items you ll see significant performance increases by using standard c s qsort and bsearch with minimal complications or changes to your code necessary

15738575
nsurlrequest	nsmutableurlrequest
nsurlrequest and nsmutableurlrequest are objective c objects which abstract away the raw bytes that are sent up to the server

15738609
google-chrome	firefox
login would work on ie but not on firefox and google-chrome

15738645

luckily we recently added support for this so if you upgrade your versioning of the webfontloader or use the one on the google cdn you ll get support for it

15739273
folder	directory
create a folder with the name sprites in the images directory - place all your images in here

15739273

15750114
width	height
i am using span to fill the entire width and height of a div inside of an anchor tag so the entire div is clickable

15750157
free	malloc
and you must never use malloc in c++ as it does not call constructors always use new to create dynamic objects and delete to free them

15750208
margin	height
if you do the position fixed approach you ll need to add a top margin or spacer of some sort to bump the page contents down by the height of your header

15750245
highcharts	highstock
if you are considering stock data consider using highstock instead of highcharts

15750311
put	get
to get this information you need to declare a variable and pass a reference to it so the nsstring class object can put the information into it for you to read later if you need the information

15750346
setinterval	settimeout
i ve tried the delay settimeout and setinterval functions but nothing seems to work thanks evan for the ideas

15750439
hide	show
i am trying to simply hide show an element depending if you re on mac windows iphone ipad etc

15750529
width	height
i think this is because the slider javascript is loading before the div is open so it is not finding the proper height width dimensions until after i resize the browser

15750549
post	get
and then i ll use the post variable on the page to display all of the post but right now when i navigate to i get an unknown action error and it says the action index name could not be found for committeescontroller

15750577
sysml	uml
visio stencils for uml and sysml

15750583
submit	submission
the browser is probably interpreting the button as a submit button and submission the form thus causing a page refresh

15750629
folder	directory
that ll create a new folder in that directory inside that there s a bin folder run source on activate in that bin folder

15750629

hex	binary
i thought that saving as a binary file would show only binary values in a hex editor but it also shows text and then ascii version of that text

15750766
action-filter	onactionexecuting
override onactionexecuting your base controller or in an action-filter as suggested by jrummell

15750802
folder	directory
this allows the user to enter an existing folder name to save to that folder but only if that folder already exists and is in the my documents directory

15750830

15750870
width	height
but the 10x10 will depend on the height and the width of the image

15750882
opencart	vqmod
opencart doesn t let you extend core controllers so don t worry too much about putting it in the view but if you want to do it properly have a look at something like vqmod to insert it into the controller

15750882
opencart	vqmod
there s a vqmod-ish-type-thing built in to an upcoming version of opencart which should hopefully let you edit the controllers without being dirty and downloading vqmod - but i couldn t say how long it ll be till that s released

15750957
unix	sunos
in posix-related operating systems unix sunos macos linux etc. there is no difference beetween w and wb

15750965
for-loop	arrays
if that is an issue you can use a for-loop instead but it will be slower for very sparse arrays

15750993
post	get
then in the index get action in your controller or whatever the get action is just check for the value and call the post action

15751031
spine.js	backbone.js
i can t see how conforming any legacy app that didn t have an explicit mvc structure into a spine.js or backbone.js or angular etc

15751037
bash	subshell
the bash function works by setting up a chain of subshell each one reading from the next one something like this where each box is a subshell and below it i ve shown its output as it reads each line of input i used to make nothing visible

15751047
post	get
then in the index get action in your controller or whatever the get action is just check for the value and call the post action

15751048
getter	setter
as a possible workaround you can provide a pair of static getter setter wrappers that - respectively - set and return the value of the atomic boolean flag but not before making sure it has been initialized at least once and not more than once to the desired initial value in a thread-safe manner you can consider this some kind of lazy initialization

15751052
addition	multiplication
you can do that by storing the variable you called elapsed as an instance variable initialized to zero and use addition rather than multiplication when calculating the new value

15751101
distance	pdist
pdist returns a vector of distance 1-2 1-3 1-4

15751118
octal	decimal
also because in non strict mode you don t have a clue if test variable was defined as octal literal or decimal so test.tostring 8 will give you of course different results if test was defined as 0132 or 132

15751135
getattr	setattr
this is not a bullet-proof solution but like you suggested you can check if a property is being setattr ed by trying to access the property object from class s attributes using getattr on the class object

15751135
super	self
edit replaced with super test self .__setattr__ a v as seen on blckknght s answer

15751160
puts	gets
when i refresh the page the gradient gets messed up and it seems like it puts in 2 gradients 1 really small example below

15751171
punctuation	words
as standard procedure one pre-process the data removing punctuation stops words etc

15751221
background-image	background-color
you can combine the background-color in the first and the background-image in the second into a single background declaration

15751233
for-loop	loops
i have researched a lot mostly in so about settimeout being not blocking and so being not suitable to be used inside a for-loop since loops keeps going on and one while the function calls keep building up

15751243
mdpi	hdpi
beside mdpi one might use ldpi hdpi or xhdpi too

15751244
screens	mdpi
mdpi refers to a medium-density screens about 160 dpi used on an android device

15751276

filtering	grouping
use one dimension for filtering and the other for grouping

15751444
filtering	grouping
this way as far as crossfilter is concerned your filtering dimension and grouping dimensions are separate

15751487
public	protected
that field has protected visibility and is not exposed through any public property or method

15751488
maven	pom.xml
they re using maven but the pom.xml file is actually edited by the build script to replace the version number with the jenkins build number and then that same number is used to replace the version of other internal projects which will be used at build time by this project

15751489

by default the request class uses the https scheme so the standard ssl encryption applies

express	node.js
i was elaborating a node.js + express tutorial and all the time i ve saved the file the build was starting the node.exe binary what is something that i dont want only solution was to tick the build system for example for jslint but it still tries to build when i m saving a file

maven	pom.xml

15751714
maven	pom.xml
however when i try to run the jar file of my parent maven project the one with packageing pom.xml i still get the same error

15751785
google-chrome	firefox
iâ ve figured out how to prevent such things in google-chrome and firefox via pseudo-selectors

15751792
jar	war
what goes in a jar and what remains out depends on the packaging agent so this is definitely ide-dependent and also depends on the configuration options used to build the archive for example if it s a lib jar if it s an executable jar if it s a war and so on

15751829
google-chrome	firefox
the weird part is that it works perfectly fine on google-chrome firefox

15751832
button	checkbox
violating this guideline by associating additional actions with the change of state frequently confuses users because they are used to configuring data in entry controls such as text boxes radio button and checkbox and then invoking an action control such as a push button to initiate the action to process the data

15751878
d3.js	crossfilter
i don t think it should be a problem for d3.js as this crossfilter example demonstrates with a dataset of several hundred thousand rows

i solved this with adding campreview.setvisibility view.gone in onpause and campreview.setvisibility view.visible in onresume

width	margin	width	height	margin	height
margin determines place on the page padding determines space on the page beyond your height and width attributes

15752251
int	double
i don t think the problem happens to your codes posted out because i just tested them in my visual stuido 2008 they runs well by your printgrid function except varable ir i defined it gloably and your printgrid function double defined x and y you defined it in function head but in the loop using for int x... which means no sense

15752285
post	get
often times developers protect access to a page through get requests but fail to protect post because they don t expect it to be used

15752285
post	get
however many web frameworks have default settings to handle gets and post the same by using either the get query string or the post parameters

15752285
post	get
it may also interest you to know that most web app pen-testers start by mapping the application and making post requests for get resources and vice-versa

once the job is complete what approaches can i use to have this directory folder available via browser so that everyone can see the test results and logs from the browser rather than logging into the host and reading files from tmp testlog-uuid

15752620
google-chrome	safari
it displays great in mac google-chrome mac safari pc ie 10

15752625
folder	directory
note main.class.php in class folder functions.php in includes folder and config.php in root directory and test.php in admin folder

when i do this in internet explorer all these divs cover for the effect of body and i canâ t see but this problem for example no happen in other brownsers as google-chrome or firefox the code itâ s very long by this no put all here if itâ s necessary i put no problem

15752736
versioning	upgrade
just be careful you don t get too new a versioning that upgrade your old database then meteor s older mongodb won t be able to understand it

15752736
put	get
if you find something very perplexing it might be a mongodb issue more than a meteor one have a look around for the error you get here on stackoverflow and if you can t find it put a question up and swarms of helpful people are hopefully ready to help

also a rectangle will have a x y width and height but it doesn t know how to draw itself the renderer draws the rectangle

15755155
thin	unicorn	thin	webrick	unicorn	webrick	passenger	unicorn	passenger	thin	passenger	webrick
in production it is much better to use a more sophisticated server like phusion passenger or unicorn since they have better performance than thin mongrel or webrick

15755155
passenger	unicorn
if you choose passenger or unicorn you would not configure the server within your sinatra application file itself but instead typically configure it separately using a rackup config.ru file

15755181
int	double
the f format specifier requires an argument of type double by the way float would automatically promote to double in this context so float would be okay too but you passed it an argument of type int

15755191
int	double
those passed in are two int s and then a double and and int are read off

15755191
int	double
because the double is read off the stack first when the int is read it is not from where the value of i was passed hence the bogus value

15755191
int	double
most likely the double covers enough of the stack to include both the passed int s

15755258
scikit-learn	libsvm
instead of going through libsvm in order to access it with python i installed libsvm through macports and import svmutil fails you might want to install the popular scikit-learn package which contains an optimized version of libsvm with python bindings

15755528
hash	salt
best practice is to use a one-way hash with salt

15755568
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
in case you are using https it should be enough but you can never be cautious enough so i would at least hash the password with md5 + a salt value

15755568
hash	salt
you could use a hidden field to store the salt value and then generate the hash trough something like

15755568
salt	md5
you can make any variations of md5 ing the password and salt value and combining those md5ing and so on

15770436

i m using a basic php for-loop to iterate through a json arrays to retrieve the image paths you can see that here

udp	tcp
the udp protocol uses the same strategy for checking packets with errors that the tcp protocol uses - a 16 bits checksum in the packet header

15771439
udp	tcp
the udp packet structure is well known as well as the tcp so the packet can be easily tampered if not encrypted adding another checksum for instance crc-32 would also make it more robust

i have a database of legacy passwords that were salt and hash using md5

15774418
hash	salt	scrypt	salt	scrypt	pbkdf2	pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash
the first option is to transition the users to a new hashing scheme salt + scrypt or pbkdf2 hmacsha256 when they login and deactivate old users after a certain period of time so they have to use the password recovery feature which would automatically update their hash

15774418
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5	scrypt	salt	scrypt	md5	scrypt	pbkdf2	pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	md5
another option that would allow me to instantly upgrade everyone would be to take the existing md5 hash add a new random salt value to each and then hash the result using the new hashing scheme salt + scrypt or pbkdf2 hmacsha256 and store that value to the database and delete the old value

15774418

15787035
rcurl	rjsonio
using rcurl and rjsonio packages is very handy to retrieve rjson results

15787148
hide	show
another approach would be to make the new view owned by the presenting controller instead of a second controller and simply hide show views as needed

15787205
post	get
i use the post redirect get trick to prevent refresh-resend of forms

15787205
post	get
although i tried all javascript examples i found they all conflict with post redirect get

15787230
mouseup	mousedown
the problem arises because the click is generated from a mousedown + a mouseup and if you do it in the edge of the transition the mousedown is in one element and the mouseup in another and that doesn t generate the click

15787292
int	chars
you write int which is 32 bits but read chars which is 8 bits

15787322
pull	push
it provides a number of blocks that have behaviour such as queuing requests sending requests etc you could use it to simulate the push and pull of these virtual resources

15787361
int	chars
also casting your string to int and back to chars will insert spaces between your chars which you don t take into account in your reading operation

15787373
children	parent
like the title says when i add children to an existing parent all existing children are retrieved

15787373

getter	setter
in my java class i have various getter and setter which all work correctly include those associated with the checkboxes and dummy ajax method which does nothing but appears to be required

15787389
filtering	grouping
then use -match to filtering out the lines the that match the regex a -replace with a backreference to the capture grouping to do the trim and another replace to replace the literal parts of the text then outupt the result to another file

15787469
children	parent
the parent has two children but they re both floated so nothing occupies space in the parent

15787469
children	parent
there are three common ways to make a parent contain its floated children so that it s at least as tall as its children

15787469
children	parent
this forces the parent to contain the floated children

15787469
children	parent
like adding a clear div this forces the parent to contain the floated children

15787482
put	get
it s up to the client to put in another call to get the rest of the data or the next bit

15787545
mongodb	bson
mongodb does not use json but bson

15787573
google-chrome	firefox
in my code i am listening for the ended event and then in the handler for this event firing the cancelfullscreen method and this works absolutely fine in google-chrome it even works in flash fallback mode for ie 7 8 but it is not working at all in firefox 19 - the window just stays in full screen mode

15787573
google-chrome	firefox
oh and while we re on the subject of bugs on ended the loading spinner shows on google-chrome but is hidden in firefox

15787740
int	chars
the sun column also can t be parsed as an int there are only minus chars there

15787746
x86	64bit
if you re trying to make two packages one of which is 32-bit and includes x86 dlls and the other is 64bit and includes x64 dlls you should pursue the mirrored components in different features so you can use release flags to exclude the set you don t need and two different product configurations in the releases view

15787752
int	double
also as another person said make sure you read a double for the values you want to store as a double and int for the values you want to read as int

15787754
hide	show
i want to be able to set the minimum height of the content size within a uicollectionview so i can hide show a uisearchbar similar to the way it s done on ibooks

15787784
width	height
for this you may use css3 media queries to change width and height of the picture

15787843
setcontentview	findviewbyid
unless you call setcontentview which defines the layout this activity will create you cannot call findviewbyid

15787865
versioning	upgrade
so i ve had es versioning 0.19.4 and wanted to upgrade to 0.20.6 as my clusters didn t have any information that i couldn t easily recover i deleted the indices s and completely cleared down my es data folder removed the 0.19.4 versioning and as i start up i somehow cannot use my original cluster name the es starts fine with any other cluster name but not with aggr the one i used before as i wanted to make sure nothing else is using old elastic search i even rebooted the computer don t have any on startup software on this test system so essentially everything is clear but i can t use the old cluster name.

15787885
for-loop	loops
i also dilemma to choose in between whileloop and for-loop but think that while loops is more suitable because unknow how many time need to insert the words

15787910
hash	salt
client hash the string with a known salt and sends this string back to the server

15787915

check if the lib is contained in the lib folder of your app it might be possible that you left it via packaging via ant or maven

15788009
jar	war
verify you select the project you wish to debug and it corresponds to the version of the deployed war ear jar in the appliation container

15788021
button	checkbox
i have checked first two rows checkbox and i clicked button

15788055
hash	md5
i suppose if i use default md5 function that would create same hash for the same string accross different applications

15788055
hash	md5
but if another application uses default md5 they won t get same md5 hash value

15788069
margin	height
you might have to change the height margin for the image in the style to fit your needs

15788097
hash	md5
it ll still be an md5 hash and it will be unique to your application

15788108
button	checkbox
at the moment when i press the home button it keeps the checkbox checked when i go back into the app

15788109
stdout	stderr
i m trying to redirect stdout to . output worker01.log and stderr to . output worker01-error.log

15788111
int	chars
if you want to strip off the chars w from each list entry just use slicing and convert the resulting string to an int

15788120
free	malloc
but there are some architectures with complex argument passing semantics and va_start could even potentially malloc memory then you d need va_end to free that memory

15788130
width	height
i have done a similar thing in the past - if i recall correctly you have to set the width height property of the new table object to something bigger something depends on the layout of your sheet

15788158
ssl	https
no matter if the client is browsing the site in ssl mode or out at least it will work cross-browser now and can always find its content - and by forcing https at all times we ensure we don t get any content-mismatch warnings in the process by setting the base path to an http location while browsing a page using https

15788161
hide	show
so implement your client validation and use jquery to show hide submit button like this

15788198
google-chrome	firefox
this problem only appears in ie7 ie8 ie9 not in firefox or google-chrome

15788245
mojolicious	catalyst
i am quite happy with catalyst and there are other options as well such as mojolicious and dancer

15788263
sorting	grouping
the disadvantage becomes an advantage once after you have the data once loaded it s fast really fast grouping sorting 50k or even 500k rows

15788263
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
since you need to load data first it s long and it s consumming bandwith but once you have it loaded anything play you do with the data is afterward done on the client machine for example sorting grouping filtering etc.

15788289
fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream
close the fileoutputstream also along with objectoutputstream

15788376
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if your view controller containing the scrollview has either a uinavigationcontroller or uitabbarcontroller the view will resize itself to fit the bounds which after the 44 pixels from the navigation controller would be 724 therefore the scrollview can scroll 44 pixels

15788429
minimum	max	min	max
well first off you might consider changing the uislider so that the minimum and maximum values matched the output that you want -- min 0 max 99

15788459
post	get
i m trying to get a friends list post on a wall and eventually perform other actions but i m unsure how to proceed

15788536
ienumerable	ilist
i don t actually know why doesn t support ienumerable but ilist

15788634
min	max
perhaps you could try to use numpy.concatenate to join the arrays together and then find the mininum and maximum of each row...then create c as a matrix of the min and max of each row

15788659
client-side	server-side
however as we re moving towards client-side ui generation i m not sure how to gain the same benefits that are available in server-side markup generation

15788683
try-catch	exception-handling
if you want to process the exception-handling you need to catch it and for that you ll need a try-catch block

if you d like to see a human-readable interpretation of the binary content you ll need something like a hex dump program or hex editor

15788901
udp	tcp
tcp udp activex dde file transactions or perhaps just directly calling a dll are the solutions that come to mind

15788901
udp	tcp

15788917
hide	show
to hide a dom element in jquery you use hide to show it again

15788937
setinterval	settimeout
if you are worried about the race condition you could check for undefined and if jquery has not loaded use settimeout or setinterval for 1000 milliseconds and test again it should have made the request by then but you could loop that until you re sure jquery isn t loading

15788968
children	parent
i have parent class entry which has two children income and expense

15789030
min	max

if i simply select by .class jquery returns the count of all matching elements on the page rather than the number of matching children of a specific parent #id

15789035
hide	show
send to the function and use that to show or hide

15789041

before reading on my issue is to know what are the optimal methods to find an objects height width position as there seems to be some conflict about this

15789335
width	height
get the position height and width of square in your js

15789362
width	height
the easiest way to accomplish this is to add your car sprite movieclip onto another sprite where the x and the y coordinates are half the width and height properties

15789400
int	boolean
i ended up casting the field in the query to an int because it was being pulled in as a boolean instead of an int

15789404
width	height
try specifying width height of list like this

15789419
equals	gethashcode
maybe you are using groupby distinct intersect except join or other methods that use your overridden gethashcode and equals if gethashcode returns an equals value

15789431
dictionary	map
map the alignment string to functions with a dictionary

15789434
hide	show
i know how to show hide the keyboard

15789457
apache	nginx
nginx apache server to vend all content with an external pub sub service for realtime

15789478
for-loop	arrays
but the size of arrays may vary from 1 to 40 and making 40 different shaders just because of the for-loop is stupid

15789495
post	get
for example to get all the post on my blog i request

15789495
post	get
to get the post with id 123 i would request

15789495
post	get
but to filter my list of post and get all post since jan 1 2013 i would request

15789500
loops	if-statement
i think you can do it in server side also in the code you can add an if-statement to check inside the _post _search if this is true then loops inside _post find if the dropdown-search condition been post if no echo something blank or whatever to stop the code if yes then continuing loading data from db

15789565
rss	feed
well i m trying to get rss feed from an website

15789801
width	height
createbitmap takes bitmap start x start y width height as parameter

15789838
width	margin
using margin-top and default position in this context is tricky because of margin collapse with the outer div but if you can use it then you can use margin 0 auto to do the horizontal centering which is nice because then you can ignore the width

15789862
width	height
just play around with the width and height

15789888
min	max
when you group generally you want the max the min or some other values to represent your group

public	protected
as long as checkgender and checkage are not accessing any private protected or internal member of the classes in hierarchy and are public functions and their logic is the same for any instance being a b or c it is a better design to have these methods in another class

15796797
put	get
the higher your volume of concurrent put and get requests the more impact this will likely have

15796797

15797358
put	get
you will need to put the loadxmldoc statement in the loop since you want to load 20 different xml files but you can t assign the result of every call to the same variable t - as once the button is clicked the handler will evaluate t and get only the last value

15797375

for the difference between submitting data using get and post methods read here

15797418
post	get
get versus post requests on html

hide	show
a better way might be to make jquery fire a hide event when you call hide and disable the inputs when that happens and similar for show

15797423
hide	show
then you can keep your code the rest of your code the same and the fields will be disabled enabled automatically when you call show or hide on the li tags

what i am trying to do is to show post with let s say at least 10 upvotes on the homepage and hide the post with not enough points

15797652
hide	show	post	put

post	get
as the code started to get abit too long to read i didn t post my other classes

you can use window.scrollto x y function for scrolling to anywhere you like in javascript and for animating you can use settimeout or setinterval function in javascript.i write a function for you

15798863
printf	atoi
well a workaround would be to simply read a string all the time and use atoi or printf to convert the desired string to a number if it contains no other characters except 0-9

15798900
folder	directory
i will use sequential folder and then hash the file name to some thing very unique and store into the directory

15798903
implements	extends
for completeness i must add that it could be made to work as you expected but it would require a special provision from the compiler namely the compiler could consider than any type extends scala.dynamic -- and implements the required lookup methods -- is compatible with any structural typing and implements the call not via reflection as is normally done but by calling the corresponding lookup method

15798932
nsstring	nsdata
you might try using the nsstring initializer designed for reading nsdata

15798936

i tried to put it in double but i still get the same results.also i want to include the first int that i input to the sum but i have no idea how.please help

15799048
put	get
just so you know what to expect it isn t easy - you can get away without the tags for a surprisingly long time but if you just accept it and put them in from the get-go it will be easier in the long run

15799048
spaces	linefeed
so that is anything consisting only of cr linefeed tab and spaces between and

15799053
children	parent
if you look at most web-based applications that display tree-data which a categorized view really is then the usual approach would be when a parent node category is selected then this would trigger all its children being selected

15799058
hex	binary
if you just want your id s zero filled for the application then handle that in a library or helper for when you render it to a view because since php is loosely typed it could think you are doing a bit comparison or dealing with hex or binary and not an int

15799092
monomac	xamarin.mac
i m very new to c# monomac and xamarin and am trying to play some generated audio with c# and xamarin.mac using this awesome example

15799098
int	double
even if you declared average to be double the sum and counter variables are int so java still uses int division before assigning it to average 5 10 results in 0 instead of 0.5

15799101
int	double
even if you make average a double sum counter is still int division which will yield an int answer

15799135
extjs	gxt
you need to select your gwt module file and right-click to select the google web toolkit configure for using extjs gwt gxt command

15799135
extjs	gxt
once extjs gwt gxt has been added to your project several new extjs gwt gxt palette categories will appear

15799151

ubuntu	linux
this seems to happen in every version up to ie10 and even on firefox on linux ubuntu

15799425
firefox	safari
for some reason safari is calculating min-width as 250px and firefox as 100

15799425
firefox	safari
so the box layout turns out 250x100 in safari ok but 240x50 in firefox

15799432
uicollectionview	uitableview
it s nowhere near as smooth as the scrolling experience of a uitableview or even the same uicollectionview without the uiimageview

15799445
getter	setter
in java or .net it consists of so-called setter and getter

15799450
serializable	deserialization
it occurs to me however that i might be able to discard one of these forwards or reverse respectively when doing each of serializable deserialization

15799453
traceroute	packets
if you are actually trying to get the average rtt to each hop along the path to a destination then you can just average the three times on each line displayed traceroute sends three packets by default and gives you the rtt for each

15799453
traceroute	packets
that will give you the average rtt for each hop small sample obviously you would want to adjust traceroute to send more packets to each hop for more complete average

15799460
integer	unsigned
i followed this question and answer to convert an ip address number and dot notation to its respective unsigned integer equivalent

15799481

all scripts work fine in all browsers - google-chrome firefox ie 7 8 9 safari

15799497
boost	allocator
in c++98 you may use boost optional + boost in_place - there is no heap allocator becuase boost optional reserves enough place

15799562
width	height
the x y and height width coordinates of the entire group

15799573
children	parent
when run for â œbigâ sets 800+ parent 1300+ children it is very slow 30 - 60 secs

15799573
children	parent
basic idea is to fetch all parent records and their respective children fitting a certain search criteria along with 3 additional pieces of information that will have to be computed

15799604
for-loop	loops
now the while loops works as expected while the for-loop freezes the browser

15799620
width	height
image width and height

15799620
width	height
integer percent greater than 0 and less than 100 of the width and height

15799633
put	get
incase someone else is viewing this page to get the plugin to work...you need to put the flash plugin itself from adobe into a proper directory see qt website for this first and make sure it is the right one 32 64bit for your app s not necessarily your system.

15799674
keydown	keyup
usually these plugins work for the concrete input using it s value for searching and autocompletion and triggered after keydown or keyup events so you would have to change modify this behavior slightly.

15799709
superclass	subclassing
what s the rational behind this restriction on superclass object ancient access in subclassing c

15799727
put	get
if you try to put a b object in it will be sliced and you ll get only the a part of it

15799739
put	get
in practice you normally want to put declarations of functions types constants etc. into headers so you can include them in more than one source file so all those source files get matching declarations

15799740
client-side	server-side
you could consider trading off server-side branching for client-side branching which arguably makes the code more readable but more importantly is an intermediate step to my final suggestion bear with me

15799767
xmltype	clob
personally i would probably convert the xmltype to a clob with the getclobval method and then use the clob2file procedure in the dbms_xslprocessor package to write it out

15799786
getter	setter
consider creating oop-compliant classes non-static fields and methods and with public getter and setter methods and this way other classes can affect the behavior of this class

15799799
gentoo	linux
the gentoo linux distribution has a version that works on interix x86 windows

use slidedown + slideup or simply show + hide functions for this or even fadein + fadeout

15799812
implements	extends
to use one of these methods it is enough to write a class that extends dynamic and to implements the methods there

15799812
getter	setter
if we don t do this we will get a compile error - this rule is similar to the implementation of a setter which only works if there is a getter with the same name

15799814
post	get
the first result received above is regarding the usernames fro users who post the news while the second result is for the text_news itself and the third line for the date when that text_news has been posted by the users and the code that i used to get the above result is as below

15799858
unsigned	short
although we can certainly hope it s unlikely in practice it s conceivable that uint32 could really be say a 16-bit unsigned short

15799858
unsigned	short
in this case dword+1 would involve math between an unsigned short and an int the implicit type of 1

15799885
phpmyadmin	adminer
i recommend using adminer as an alternative to phpmyadmin

15799964

15800049
calloc	malloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
in c memory can be allocated dynamically by calling malloc calloc or realloc functions

15800052
post	get
the same data is used both to populate dropdown boxes on forms and also to validate the submitted get post data

15800083
ienumerable	iqueryable
for this to work you need to order ienumerable instead of iqueryable since iqueryprovider don t know how to deal with local list indexof method when it sends query to server

filtering	grouping
i have the results sorted with a grouping by and i have the results filtering into a table through mysql_fetch_array

15800223
mouseup	mousedown
a step toward solving it is to bind the handler on mousedown and unbind it on mouseup

15800270
rss	feed
although if that is an rss feed i d probably use a dedicated rss parser

15800314
filtering	grouping
5 you can combine any other filtering you wish in the select btw which is a sneeky way of doing multi-grouping btw you just form 2 unique lists of grouping and iterator over the product of them not extremely efficient if you have lots of grouping but can work

15800330
post	get
i just cannot get how to encrypt this message right and how to convert it to string that i can then send as post parameter

15800342
codeigniter	cakephp
php frameworks like zend framework codeigniter symphony cakephp and a multitude of others make this relatively easy

15800378
box-sizing	border-box
add box-sizing border-box to the wrapper element

15800381
google-chrome	firefox	box-sizing	border-box
adding box-sizing border-box fixed it for me google-chrome 26 firefox 19 ie9 10

15800381
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
adding box-sizing border-box instructs the browser to include padding and borders in the width calculation

15800400
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
if you add box-sizing border-box to #wrapper then the padding will be included in the width

15800413
cpu	processors
with this algorithm if your system can detect 4 images per second while taking a preview at 60fps for example you will be able to get a smooth video with a new result about each 20-30 frames on a single processors device under the realistic assumption that detect_image is cpu intensive while the camera preview display are i o intensive

15800422
client-side	server-side
also should i be considering using regular expression client-side in java web application since the data to get matched aren t really necessary in server-side

firefox	safari
in other browsers safari firefox i don t see the html

15800539
google-chrome	firefox
i m not aware of an actionscript way of finding the redirect chain for any request but if you want to do it for a specific chain you can use httpfox for firefox or hit f12 in google-chrome and look at the network tab when making a request to the url that redirects

15800559
qlistwidget	qpushbutton
deletebutton is a qpushbutton but itemclicked clicked looks like the signal from qlistwidget with wrong signature

15800561
bash	subshell
run with bash -x but you could run it with just bash and you d only skip a little of the output because it includes a set -x within the subshell code

15800612
mouseleave	mouseenter
in this way every time the mouseenter event is fired you will add a is-hover class to your element and when the mouseleave event is fired you will remove the class

15800615
oncreate	ondestroy
because the class is not an activity class there is no oncreate or ondestroy callback methods

15800657
min	max
they basically find the max and min of a set of images and encode the original images as differences with respect to either the max or min image depending on whichever is the smaller difference

15800657
min	max
compute the min and max char buffers

15800664
oncreate	ondestroy
i suggest you refactor to have your code get called in oncreate and ondestroy instead

15800682
google-chrome	firefox
it worked in firefox but not in google-chrome

15800685
int	double
calling tryparse 1.5 double.class will work fine and you can remove all the unnecessary primitive casts like int double etc

15800704
width	height
however i would like to get the image width and height without having to load the image in memory

15800782
ready	each
i am trying to make a light box with jquery so on dom ready it applies the thumbnail class to each image in the wrapper div and then on click it toggles the full class

15800782
width	text-align	width	height	text-align	height
i just want to add a div that will be width and height 100 and 50 opaque which will have text-align set to center

15800795
move	drag
it s pretty obvious that the calls do work though because the window does move as i drag it

15800801
width	height
these correspond directly to the series information that was passed in on chart creation with the x y width and height attributes that i believe you re referring to

15800836
filtering	grouping
i am trying to only return users where they are a member of a grouping i need to filtering by the grouping string value not the actual grouping object

15800864
post	get
when i sent all of the required post params i indeed saw my bounce handler get the request and log the appropriate information

15800872
int	double
the object classes such as int and double will be able to handle the primitives and return objects.

15800874
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
everything works great in ie but the animations are occurring early in safari and google-chrome and late in firefox

15800908
children	parent
the tree has to be a perfect binary tree all leaves are at the same depth or same level and in which every parent has two children and so it is the only tree whose black height equals to its tree height

15800924
post	get
link_to issues get requests and button_to issues post requests

15800947

folder	directory
all i want to do is have a failover script that will copy files from a directory on my server and paste it into a different folder on a different server on the network

15801117

my script encan.js is setting the width height of a container for an image once the image has been resized

15801133

this works great in google-chrome but doesn t work in firefox mac

15801139
lxml	beautifulsoup
i m trying to parse this web-page by the categories of the headers searchable by special summoned from hand by etc i ve looked around for a good parser for 3.3 but all i could find was beautifulsoup which i can t install because it s still coded in 2.x and lxml which i can t understand

15801167
onclick	onmousedown
a better solution is to use onmousedown instead of onclick

15801235

int	double
hi i am new to java have and wondering why is that string is a class and int double etc. are not

15801338
int	double
primative types sunch as int double etc

15801338
int	double
consider string class methods and instance methods int double etc dont have these

15801341
int	chars	int	double
int double chars are primitive types where as string is a class

15801342
int	double
int double etc

15801342
int	double
are primitive data types and there are equivalent classes for these data types in java namely int double etc

15801358
put	get
this seems a bit cheap to just put in the values for 0 and 9 and i d love to know how to get the character value itself rather than its key

15801426

radio button and checkbox are passed to the post as arrays

15801428

15801492
operands	decrement
so the difference in your example is that the address stored in the a3 register would be decrement by 4 the size of the operands long word before p is copied into it

15801504
put	get
if i put the amount to 100 so basically more json data i get the following

15801510
uidatepicker	uipickerview
you will need to use a uipickerview instead of a uidatepicker

15801533
google-chrome	firefox
it appears that google-chrome and firefox at least do attempt to optimize this in the sense that if you re not providing any way to reference the x variable it doesn t show up as being available in the debugger

15801533
google-chrome	firefox
running this with a breakpoint inside a closure shows x as unavailable on google-chrome 26 and firefox 18

15801553
ssl	https
if the connection is in ssl the transparent proxy cannot know to which server it should connect to since it has decrypt the host name in the https request

this works great in google-chrome and firefox and seems to work in ie8 but no amount of massaging seems to make ie10 render anything other than an ugly system font

15801754
put	get
it works but if i put const on the function as it should be i get the error

15801770
innodb	myisam
if it s a myisam table this command will give you the exact number of rows but if it s an innodb it might not be as accurate

15801781
basecamp	trello
it s working awesomely in excel 2010 and 2013 and most likely 2007 and i ve got it working with salesforce trello basecamp google maps and it should work with pretty much any webservice

15801791
client-side	server-side
is it stored server-side or client-side

15801810
for-loop	loops
so none is passed to isvalidscore that tries to iterate on it in the for-loop and that fails because none is not something you can loops on

15801814
addition	modulo
i m trying to perform modulo addition with two bytes in java getting a third byte as a result

15801814
subtraction	modulo
however this has problem cases - when byte1 is 0x7f and byte2 is anything but 0x00 my modulo subtraction code doesn t return 0x7f - it returns 0x80 instead

15801838
freebsd	linux
if the os is anything modern windows os x linux freebsd etc then you want to tell the os s scheduler to run other tasks for 1 second to avoid hogging cpu time for no reason

15801899
ienumerator	idisposable
the only exceptions are base classes that implement idisposable in case some derived implementations have something to dispose eg ienumerator component or textreader

15801909
checkbox	auto-populate
when i choose a subject credit hour will auto-populate and click a checkbox to agree calculate the cgpa

15801909
button	checkbox
but when i click calculate button after add new subject the calculation process not run and checkbox return to false

15801909
button	checkbox
so i ve to click the checkbox again and calculate button to make the process work

15801939
subtract	add
then add 0 s to it according to its length - 1 aka subtract the 0

15801974
short	base
so in short if you explicitly implement multiple interfaces with the same method signature your derived classes will not know which base method you want to override

15802023
nant	cruisecontrol
build machine is set up with cruisecontrol and a nant script for automated builds with devenv

15802040
oncreate	setcontentview
activity oncreate -- setcontentview is called here

15802069
portrait	landscape
the only problem im having is that when going in landscape mode the tabs dont fill the whole width of the screen and are small unlike in portrait

15802076
width	height
this code can let us adjust the width and height of the form snapshot so later we wanted to print it it would just settle its own to the way we had setting

15802097
button	checkbox
basically both the checkbox and the radio button do not support transparency so will default to the grey background

15802097
button	checkbox
the workaround is to either change the background bitmap to suit the grey background of those controls or to create the radio checkbox button with no text and then create transparent text labels right next to them where the text should be

15802115
post	put
i came across this post here that seems to be useful borrowed the block of code in it and put it in my gameworldlayer but it didn t work

15802158
put	get
need to put the data in a table and if the data is similar to the maximum number of matches you get to the parent

15802192
dictionary	map
using that data i populate a map with a bunch of mkpointannotations each one representing the data in a given dictionary

15802228
width	height
what i m trying to do is set the width and height of the image during runtime

15802228
width	height
so this is also in relation to my previous questions images in my horizontallistview changes it size randomly and imageview dynamic width and height which received a very little help

15802228
width	height
im also confused as to where i will set the height and width of the imageview

15802232
octal	decimal	octal	hex
if you pass 0 as the base argument strtoull recognizes 0x and 0 prefix to indicate hex and octal respectively and defaults to decimal otherwise

15802237
strtol	atoi
that said use strtol or atoi but only if you must if you need the value or if you just want to validate digit content isdigit may be a better fit

15802261
gridview	rowdatabound
first the rowdatabound event is raised when every single data row is bound to data in the gridview control

15802307

call showloading and hideloading at will from within other javascript functions to show and or hide the animated gif image

15802333
jar	war
i have assumed that the jar files in the project are used by the war file and packaged within its web-inf lib directory

15802378
width	height
if you want to set the width and height manually at runtime grab a reference to the imageview s layoutparams after the view has been measured by the layout system

15802378
width	height
if you do this too early in the rendering phase your view s width and height as well as its parent view and so on will be 0

15802378
width	height
inside the onpredraw method your image and it s parent will now have their width and height values assigned to them

15802378
width	height
you can make your calculations and then set your width and or height manually to the layoutparams object of your view don t forget to set it back

15802398
portrait	landscape
i can give explanation to this when ever you change orientation portrait - landscape

15802402

15802422
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
you could use bufferedreader and bufferedwriter to read from write to a file in java

15802422
filewriter	bufferedwriter
analogically there is also bufferedwriter and a filewriter and a write method for writing

15802452
screens	tablet
there is a good reason that ui technologies like wpf came out around the time that touch screens and tablet did

dropbox	icloud
the information displayed in the view controllers will come from a xml file that i ll include in the project s resources or direct from dropbox or icloud

15802873
width	height
from what i understand the children of a display objects are taken into account when looking at the display object s width height parameters

15802873
width	height
why is the container not given the same width height values as the button as it is the only thing inside the sprite

15802907
hide	show
this is code to show and hide div of inches and centimeters

15802914
switching	screens
if i switching to another program that takes up one screens like my code editor or qtassistant designer hides its undocked panels

15802920
phong	shading
phong is a more nuanced shading model albeit a more hacky one which says that light is composed of ambient + diffuse + specular components

15802920
phong	shading
phong shading using the normal at the three vertices interpolate the normal in the interior and compute the shading using this interpolated normal at each pixel

15802920
phong	shading
this is why as raytoal pointed out if your specular highlight falls in the interior of a triangle none of the vertices will be bright but phong shading will interpolate the normal and there will be a bright spot in the interior of your rendered triangle

15802941

15803169
bazaar	cvs
i know bazaar info can list it but haven t found its cvs equivalent after searching for a while

15803186
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
the best way to resolve this is to use some negative margins minus half width times the factor for the left margin and minus half height times the factor for the top

15803209
button	checkbox
here is an example of the problem the button and checkbox became visible from mouseover and the text from selecting

ssl	https
http is far more tolerant to unreliable networks and can be encrypted using ssl https

15803310
inherited	subclassing
whenever there is inherited and sub class object is created the constructor of subclassing calls the constructor of all super classes in hierarchy. till object by default it calls a no-arg constructor

15803310
superclass	subclassing
to avoid this you have two option either have a no-arg constructor in superclass or call any existing constructor of super from subclassing constructor using super

15803314
vbscript	jscript
the inf-file could also be echoed or written from the batchscript jscript vbscript

15803350
printwriter	bufferedwriter	filewriter	bufferedwriter	filewriter	printwriter
i know bufferedwriter is to buffer the output and put it all at once but why would they use filewriter and printwriter

15803376
firefox	safari
tested locally on both of the latest versions safari and firefox

15803389
libxml2	libxslt
this was the magic formula for getting libxml2 and libxslt happily running

15803417
portrait	landscape
in iphone 5 i am facing the problem that when i do orientation from portrait to landscape the font size of the text in uiwebview changes

15803449
printwriter	bufferedwriter
printwriter prints formatted text you can provide format string along with the data to be printed though it can directly work with any writer outputstream just to provide buffering writer outputstream is 1st passed to bufferedwriter then to have formatted text is passed to printwriter

15803472
printwriter	bufferedwriter
both bufferedwriter and printwriter have to be given another writer to write to - you need some eventual destination

15803472
printwriter	bufferedwriter
the printwriter is passed the bufferedwriter as its destination

15803472
printwriter	bufferedwriter	filewriter	bufferedwriter	filewriter	printwriter
so the code below the section you ve shown will presumably write to the printwriter which will write to the bufferedwriter which will when its buffer is full or it s flushed or closed write to the filewriter which will in turn convert the character data into bytes on disk

15803477
charindex	substr
you can do this by passing charindex as the length parameter for substr

15803478
filewriter	bufferedwriter
a filewriter object is passed to the bufferedwriter as the intent here is to write to some output file using a bufferedwriter

15803490
int	double
i am developing a common struct of int short double multi-dimension array with template in c++

15803495
super	implements
you can then get the super class and implements interfaces as follows

15803540
folder	directory
i assume your upload folder is on root of web site directory

15803546
filewriter	bufferedwriter
so filewriter as a result is what bufferedwriter wraps and is the innermost object

15803552
folder	directory
is there any way to retrieve all the folder and files present in that directory using ant build script

15803593

15803624
mocha	sinon
i am using mocha as the test framework and sinon for mocking stubing and spying

15803624
mocha	sinon
so from the mocha test you can then create a dummy account object and mock it with sinon in the actual test

15803640
spaces	delimiter
however since mtab is delimiter on spaces you can just use split

15803691
google-chrome	firefox
i tried it in firefox and google-chrome and it looks as expected

15803691
width	height
maybe when you call init there are some images not loaded which move the content down even though you explicitly set width and height on the img elements.

15803700
integer	fractions
your indices variable rather than being polymorphic over the num typeclass as you might expect is defaulting to integer at which point you can t multiply it by 0.1 since 0.1 will resolve to some fractions type

15803733
button	checkbox
i use a checkbox in my app as a button turn something on or off but the action load a file from the network is done in an aync task so i don t want the check to come on until the async task finishes successfully like this

15803737
jtable	jscrollbar
i have two jtable s aligned horizontally inside jscrollbar

15803768
width	height
height and width define the size you want your element to be

15803768
actualheight	actualwidth
during the rendering of your visuals the available size for your element is calculated in relation to everything else and the actualheight and actualwidth are updated

15803768
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
height and width do not change as a result of this calculation but if height and width are changed the actualheight and actualwidth are recalculated

15803822
apache	nginx
here is an example with apache but it seems to be very similar in nginx

you are trying to refer imageview with textview

15803896

and onpause method use have written textview instead of imageview like above

15803896
textview	imageview
change textview to imageview

smarty	phpbb
it was modelled after php templating engines like smarty phpbb s but without much complexity.

15804020

the problem is much easier if you stick to floating-point and integer types that match typically 32 or 64 bit types that way you can see the routines as plain integer routines as for example addition takes two 32 bit integer representations of floating-point values and return a 32 bit integer representation of the result

15807250
uiview	subviews
when it comes to the zposition it makes somewhat interesting..changing the zposition to a higher value makes the view visible without making any change in index position..so in this case subviews on the index zero also might be visible completely but it doesn t mean it going to receive all the touches because it is still on the zero index.....if you want to make the zero index subviews to receive all touches then use methods of uiview class to bring it on top of others...

15807267
min	max
you could use min and max functions to do that

width	height
only when you add the pdfptable to a specific document the exact width and the height will be calculated which is too late for you

15812159
width	height
if you want to know the height in advance you need to define an absolute width not a percentage

15812159
width	height
tables with the same content and a different width will have a different height

please feel free to get the creative juices flowing and post suggestions

15813978
folder	directory
i resolved my issue - i am not sure whether this would apply to others but i created a new website in vs2010 unlike i did as a project earlier and copied all my files except the web.config into this newly created website and then created a new virtual directory in iis 8 and mapped the folder in wwwroot and converted that to an application and now my iis serves the .aspx pages without any issues

cos	sin
there are many effects you can get if you start to overlay simple functions like sin or cos

15814119
hide	show
to code it yourself would be fairly straightforward the jquery below takes a string from the input #inputstring and will iterate through the list items ul li and show hide depending if they match the input string

15814155
google-chrome	firefox
the behaviour is correct under firefox and ie but not in google-chrome where the box is cut by the bottom of the page

i use a regular nsurlrequest and nsurlconnection object and its delegate methods to make asynchronous calls and use nsjsonserialization to parse the json into a nsdictionary

15814167
google-chrome	firefox
of course you can like others have used gwt to produce js run in google-chrome and firefox plugins etc

15814199
domcontentloaded	addeventlistener
and of course it won t work as is in ie8 or below as a domcontentloaded is relatively new and wasn t standard when ie8 came out b ie8 uses attachevent rather than the dom-standard addeventlistener and c ie8 isn t going to care about required anyway as it doesn t technically support html 5

15814209
width	height	children	parent
you could try wrapping the parent container in a viewbox and set the height and width of the viewbox to 1024x768 or 1366x768 and see if that resizes the children correctly

15814214
listview	gridview
in xaml you use different controls - gridview for a horizontal list of items that fill by column and wrap when they run out of vertical space and listview for a vertical list of items that fills by column and does not wrap

15814214
listview	gridview
set it to new winjs.ui.gridlayout for the equivalent of a xaml gridview and to new winjs.ui.listlayout for the equivalent of a xaml listview

15814222
hide	show
the problem is that when calling .collapse hide or .collapse show on an element that s already hidden show causes it to do the opposite

15814222
hide	show
i was thinking to solve this by testing if it s already collapsed before calling .collapse show | hide but i don t know how

15814222
hide	show
also i found this issue if the first call to collapse is hide the collapsable will show instead here which seems related but i added the with no effect

15814228
put	get
the advantage of doing a method is that you get a layer of indirection and can put more advanced logic in there

15814297

getter	setter
it means that you generated getter and setter and that you access the property by calling it _operandstack

15814374
getter	setter
if instead you use self.operandstack you are using the getter setter generated by the property not the synthesized one

15814397
hide	show
my guess is that the modal. show function is not being call because when i insepct in crhome the modal element the class is modal hide fade and not modal hide fade in and other attributes stay the same

15814415

15815185
public	protected
pick an arbitrary non-conflicting name while leaving the declaration as public is probably almost never the right course of action one should either change the declaration to private change the declaration to protected overridable and change the name to something better somemember_impl or else change the name to match the interface member and add either an overloads or shadows keyword as appropriate

15815185

15815493
notepad	textpad
first to develop an asp.net project on notepad or textpad is very unwise unless you want to test your coding skill or having some other reasons

15815493
notepad	textpad
if you write your code in notepad textpad and test them in vs it kind of defeat the original purpose

15815493

uinavigationcontroller root view controller is uitableviewcontroller and when clicked on cell uiviewcontroller appears which has to be locked in landscape

15815835
superclass	subclassing
it s difficult to pull all the functionality into the superclass without the superclass essentially being aware of every place that something could be different defeating the encapsulation subclassing is meant to buy us

15815844
children	parent
one would expect that in the document that you described that all children would be relevant to the root parent

15815844
children	parent
in other words we would normally answer the related query give me all parent that have any children that have a specific date

15815852
sorting	filtering
the design of jqgrid is oriented on server side sorting paging and filtering searching

15815852
sorting	filtering
it could be important for the user the total time of the paring sorting or filtering operation

15815852
sorting	filtering
if the number of rows under some 1000 rows i use loadonce true and so client side paging sorting and filtering of data

15815852
sorting	filtering
if the total number of rows larger as 10000 i use always server side paging sorting and filtering

15815859
hash	md5
what you do is you hash the password with md5 and compare it with the original hash value in the database

15815859
hash	md5
since md5 is one way if the passwords are same hash value is same

15815859
hash	md5
but this md5 is a one way hash function

15815859
hash	md5
in password creation you take the password and you hash it using md5 in your case .then this hash value is what you are going to store in a database

15815859
hash	md5
then you again take the password and you again hash it using md5

15815893
min	max
but i need my main pivot column to be the year and then each year would have its 2 sub columns for a min and max price and i m not quite sure how to do that

15816238
folder	dir	folder	directory
i have moved the images folder to the same directory as my lytebox.css and lytebox.js moved them to another directory moved the images into the same dir as .css .js but nothing seems to get them displayed properly

15816245
post	get
at best you could write a script that authenticates with your credentials and try and duplicate the post and get requests that come and go from the dev console web interface to try and duplicate the functionality

15816282
try-catch	exception-handling
to fix this problem you can add try-catch block to catching this exception-handling when the client disconnects

15816312
width	height
two fixed width full height columns with seamless transition to blank space

15816391
typedef	typename
typedef typename std remove_cv type noconstt

15816458
folder	directory
so my workaround was simply to move the script to a different folder and then pass in the directory containing the files to be changed

15816461
put	get	post	get	post	put
i had other conditions that says if not all the post for array_one is not same as array_two then only get a unique post from array_one and put it in array_two everything else remains same in array_two

15816466
postgresql	mysql
this works for mysql postgresql and sqlite3

15816469

- target direct children of the parent element not children of children

15816544
margin	height
description get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements including padding border and optionally margin

15816545
implements	extends
by implements these functions in your own class that extends basefacebook it is possible to change to any type of session handling you desire

15816559
tcpclient	sslstream
i m trying to connect to a server via a sslstream tcpclient

15816573
x86	64bit
i want to generate a single msi targetting x86 patforms that checks whether the os is 64bit or 32bits

15816579
put	get
without having a way to get plotedit s current state i have no clue how to temporarily put it to off and restore its value once my function has finished

15816597
range	minimum
actually note that out minimum is now not fully off it is 1 not 0 and our maximum is out of range 256 not 255

15816696
portrait	landscape
my situation is that i have a single column of images that are fluid fit their container 100 in width works fine for landscape images but portrait are huge as its the width being fitted therefore tall and skinny image portrait is having its width fit to container thus making it massively tall

15816696
portrait	landscape
my solution was to think about the container if in the instance of a portrait image i set the container to be 50 of the landscape container then when i fit the images width when portrait to a smaller container i get them proportional ish

15816696
portrait	landscape
so wat you want is 2 containers to use one for portrait and landscape the landscape one will be the maximum width you want so 450px

15816696
portrait	landscape
now make your portrait container half a width so 225px half of the width if all your images are the same aspect ratio then they should all match nicely and give you a structured grid - or if single column the portrait images will be more or less as tall as the landscape images are wide

15816696
portrait	landscape
the example is an email please don t moan about poor coding its not finished template i m making where i have a single column of images its responsive both portrait and landscape - use a class on the table that contains the portrait image class portrait but this could easily be a div

15816696
width	height
my main point is to stop thinking about trying to control the height just control the container let the image fill it and by adjusting the width of the container making it smaller you naturally reduce the height of the image

15816696
portrait	landscape
aspect ratio of the images in general will ensure you can predict the layout as you have a baseline of sorts - portrait images relate to the landscape ones

15816720
abstract-class	superclass
i am not a java guy but in addition to the superclass abstract-class you could use interfaces and dependency injection along with the repository pattern

15816773
pop-up	dialog
in the dialog that pop-up you will see something like

15816777
hide	show
basically i now show hide the alert from within the updatetotals function

15816777
hide	show
i changed from using the show hide events that happen after the collapse and am now using those events that fire before the collapse happens

15816777
hide	show
attempting to show the alert when it s show does not hide it and vice versa

15816780
folder	directory
i decided the best way forward would be to create a php script to loop around all directory in the images listings folder and copy every image in to a new directory as specified above

15816822
hide	show
at first ajax call everything works fine and each click show or hide the next row but on second ajax call on click event of odd row show and hide next row on third call show hide show after forth call show hide show hide and it goes on and on increases with every ajax calls

15816928
int	double
i know that java has the class polygon but i had to use path2d and point2d because polygon don t allow double s just int

15816947
folder	directory
if there are a lot of filesystem operations that have to use the directory index for a folder that large it can drastically reduce filesystem performance

15817011

15817122
min	max
so we can t use a lot of the built-in functions python has to offer we haven t even covered the append method so i had to use another way to add to the list.. max and min are also not allowed

15817129

i ve used all inspectors for the three browsers firefox opera google-chrome to see if there is anything to tweak with no success

15817206

but it seems hibernate expects getter setter to be symmetric

15817390
spaces	delimiter
for this you will need to read all the characters up until some delimiter such as cr or spaces collect them up and then convert

15817398
width	height
you could get window.innerheight and window.innerwidth do your calculations and then set the width and height of the div s explicitly

15817399

15817820
execl	fork	stdout	stderr
i d expect aside from platform specific code this is a project that requires a few thousand lines of code and if you know where to start that is you are familiar with fork execl etc in linux or their equivalents in another os and familiar with redirection if stdin stderr and stdout using dup2 and similar functions again with reservation for os specific names you could have something that roughly works in a few weeks

15819885
post	get
but when i try to choose a data range using the normal notation i get the same error that is reported in the other post

15820266
trie	tree
there is no real difference between a ternary search tree tst and a trie implemented with a binary search tree at each node

15820266
trie	tree
also hybrid solutions exist where the trie structure is only used for the wide decision nodes at the top of the tree

15820314
min	max
i was also using min max with dygraph s custombars which is why this code as pasted is using arrays for columns even where it probably isn t necessary

15820331
post	get
if you re still having problems i suggest you post a the smallest piece of sample code that demonstrates your problem and b the particular error message you get problem you encounter

it will generally be an attributeerror about the lack of __exit__ but even if it isn t the fact that the traceback says it s from your with line ought to tell you the problem. and if you have an object that seems like it should be usable as a context manager and isn t you might want to consider filing a bug bringing it up on the mailing lists etc

and hide next row on third call show hide show after forth

15820390
hide	show
call show hide show hide and it goes on and on increases with every

15820473
printf	strcmp
you can see that i also have prototypes for strcmp and printf in my prefix file so i don t need to cast these. you don t want to put too many things in here - this file is prepended to every expression you evaluate in lldb and it will slow your expression evaluations down if you put all the prototypes in usr include in there

15820687
screens	tablet
i have a basic web page that responds correctly to screens size and orientation changes using css media queries when displayed in chrome on an android tablet nexus 7

15820687
width	height
media queries using screen dimensions do not work correctly because according to the following javascript the screen width and height remain constant through orientation changes

15820687
width	height
when running in chrome on android the width and height values are displayed correctly taking device orientation into account

15820687
width	height
when running inside the webview the width and height remain constant regardless of orientation

15820693
inherited	properties
f.prototype is just a properties it does nothing with inherited in this moment

15820719

15820902
mouse	keyboard
in other words there s no prewritten farmville.getunplowedcells to use but you can write a program that takes screenshots analyzes them to find the unplowed cells and then generates the mouse keyboard input that would make your character plow his unplowed cells

put	get
i could theoretically put all the global data in a shared worker and have each script worker send it messages to get and set data but access is common enough that the message-passing overhead would completely destroy performance especially since a simple read would be far more expensive than a write and potentially require some sort of cps implementation just to make it work

15821955

how would you form the sql to find duplicate item_id_nm s but only the ones when the values of the height or width or length or weight differ by 30

15821999
width	height
so sorry for not being clear but the 30 difference would be possible for each value of height width length or weight and if one of those have a 30 difference it would count as a duplicate of the other ones

15822004

int	double
a particular record may have say 8 known types then a variable number of indicator combinations of either string int double or string int double double and some lines may include no indicators

15822026
int	double
in vb6 i would just input the data split the data into a variant array then determine the number of elements on that line in the array and use the vartype function to determine if the final indicator variables are string int or double and parse the field accordingly

15822067

15822407
udp	tcp
and stripe the ip tcp udp header and then put the data payload part in the

udp	tcp
so this means there are only bytes in the buffer and the bytes are not divided into parts each of which corresponds to the payload of a udp datagram tcp segment

15822407

i would like to make each checkbox into a toggle button

15822572
int	double
undefined behaviour aside what probably happens is that setting f.a only changes the least significant bits of the significand sizeof int is probably 4 sizeof double 8 so you get a value that is close to the 12.0 you set initially and the difference is too small for standard printing to show it

15822612
