there are quite a few timer plugins but they are all just abstractions of settimeout and setinterval anyway and i m not sure they re really much simpler to use

2400307
int	chars
to create those key strokes from chars i would recommand you create them using before to transform them into int values using

2400307

jta	persistence-unit
and i put persistence.xml with persistence-unit type jta in src main resources

2400395
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops

2400570
multiplying	add
the add reg reg instruction is 2 bytes per instruction so thats 6 bytes of instructions and 0 bytes for constants to multiplying by 3 that s smaller code than imul plus a 4 byte constant

2400570
multiplying	add
plus the way the add instructions are used it works out to a pretty literal translation of 2 3 so this may not be a size optimization it may be the default compiler output whenever you multiplying by 2 or by 3

2400570
multiplying	add
add is usually a faster instruction than multiplying

2400606
int	double
problem is that compareto throws an exception when trying to compare between different types int and double

i think the better way is to describe all your dependencies in a single place the maven pom.xml or leiningen s project.clj and then start a swank session with those dependencies

2400821
integer	fractions
when you divide two integers c# uses integer division where the fractions part is discarded

2400821
int	double
to get floating point division cast one of the arguments to either double float or decimal depending on the level of precision you need which will cause the other argument to be implicitly converted to the same type and the division carried out using floating point rules instead of int rules

2400843
inherited	properties

flashobject accepts several arguments the 3rd and 4th of which represent the width and height attributes of the element

2401037
width	height
course this won t really work if the width of the swf is a percentage as the height of the whitespace wont be constant

2401037
width	margin
if you set the width to a constant such as 1040px you can set the negative top margin accordingly

2401076
google-chrome	firefox
it works ok in firefox and google-chrome

2401086
stateless	stateful
the web is essentially stateless and mvc helps you to go down to the metal that is mvc does not try to make something stateful that isn t which is mostly the path of ye olde asp each request is a request of it s own and it shouldn t know anything about any other request that has been performed in the past

2401097
pascal	delphi
that said i myself walked a way from borland pascal and delphi quite some time ago over php and asp.net using c#

pull	push
as you can see the pull looks reasonable but the default push does not

2401267
nsnull	nsstring
i think the problem is i mean the second warning is that you re comparing nsstring object which could be set to null to an nsnull object

2401292
width	height
the images that get uploaded have a big variety of sizes while my holder has a width of 239 and height of 179

2401293
getter	setter
this uses _x _y and _z to internally store the incoming values and exposes them via the use of property with getter setter

2401295

you can in theory put your classes and jar files there so that you don t need to do anything to get java javac to find them

2401328
debian	linux
debian linux with iceweasel basically firefox

2401341
ssl	https
we need a ssl https connection to the webservice but we didn t find any documentation or hint how to activate it programmatically via the embedded api

2401343
put	get
both of the answers previously given missed a fundamental point you can t put nil into an array so you ll never get nil out of an array

2401358
width	height
or if you want to maintain the same image then you could find out new height and width maintaining the aspect ratio and apply it accordingly to the height and width properties of the img tag

2401358
width	height
you can use these to resize the image or find the height and width

2401393
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i m already aware of some browser-specific dom documentation out there gecko dom reference for firefox msdn for internet explorer and of course the ecma and w3c specs but i wonder if someone has compiled a good api reference that covers all common browsers firefox internet explorer opera safari chrome...

2401625
put	get
but more importantly - try to get rid of fill in the missing coordinates or better don t put addresses with missing coordinates in the list

2401662
inherited	properties
you can create a non-generic interface that has the caneditentity properties on it make secureddomainviewmodel inherited off that then call the properties through the interface.

2401671
many-to-many	many-to-one
this is all quite a manual process but satisfies requirements such as migrating data from one model to another expanding a boolean flag to a set of options or converting a many-to-one association to a many-to-many

2401679
junit	testng
alternatively you could switch to using testng which is very similar to junit but has a default html report as well as several other cool features

2401726
width	height
inline elements do not have a height or width so the whole background is being displayed instead of being cropped by the image size

the cfile model supports any kind of filesystems ntfs but also fat and cdfs for cd-roms

2401914
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox when i alert matchparts it is an array containing the text and then the url

2401928
int	chars
for example if only int are allowed then you ignore any keying of the decimal point along with all letters and most special chars

2402005
inherited	properties
i create a new customcontrol which inherited control i couldnâ t use neither selector or treeview because i wouldnâ t have been able to manage the selecteditem properties from the derived class

explanation gets a line from file1 and puts its value to variable t

2402117
firefox	safari
for firefox and safari this does the trick

2402124
getter	setter
this object setter and getter are needed in different parts of the application

2402161

you can use o n time to check the min max sum sumsq etc

2402435
children	parent
i am cross-referencing children of an xml parent node once the user types in a word or phrase into the text field

2402445
public	protected
the absence of private protected and public means use of default

2402493
jquery	jqtransform
your best bet is to use a plugin like jqtransform uses jquery

2402517
int	chars
if yes you could just remap the ranges of the int values of the chars

2402566
hide	show
ok i believe than radio buttons is the best choice because just one choice is needed but to use it i need to use visual basic script to handle the code hide and show text

2402569
xslt	schematron
the alternative solution is to use schematron but you won t get so handy and user-friendly tool for that as you get in-case of xsd and xslt

2402627
idictionary	ilist
you could also make custom version of the ilist and idictionary which using chunking to avoid stuff ending up in the loh in the first place

2402639
folder	directory
i want to create separate folder for my layouts like this in my resource directory

2402671
ffmpeg	libavformat
i suggest looking at libavformat output-example.c or perhaps the source of the ffmpeg command line utility itself

2402673
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works in ie8 firefox safari and google-chrome but probably not in older versions of ie

2402700
width	height
you d need to add your own positions sizes the top left width and height properties as appropriate

2402722
keydown	keyup
i do not find any keyup events thrown from keydown

2402722
keydown	keyup
and waits for a keyup before listening for another keydown

2402726
mdpi	hdpi
i haven t found anything else on the web that references this structure but the following blog post shows an example where the author uses ldpi and i m sure mdpi and hdpi instead of small normal and large as the android reference docs online would suggest

2402746
rss	feed
if the page is your own you could try increasing the number of entires included in the rss feed

2402746
rss	feed
otherwise there is no way to retrieve entries from a page via rss if those entries are no longer available in the feed

2402751
perforce	svn
i concur that svn seems like a pita when you come from a perforce background

2402773
width	height
this means that they flow inline like text but also have a width and height like block elements

2402776
width	height
they are block elements in that they have a width and a height

2402777
memcached	apc
besides all optimization that is not in the language reverse proxy memcached apc ect i want to avoid to build the application using events only to find out that they become a major bottleneck due to bad performing implementation

2402782
double-pointer	pointers
you d need a double-pointer argument or a pointers return value and you have neither

2402821
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
having the handler return false works for me in safari and firefox and google-chrome

2402823
rss	feed
i m looking to integrate a bunch of rss atom sources into a feed for our intranet

2402849

you can use the classes in the system.servicemodel.syndication namespace to read write and merge rss feed

2402860
richfaces	trinidad
i have worked only with trinidad and richfaces

2402860
richfaces	trinidad
i have used trinidad tree in one recent application i developed and it was easy to use and fill trinidad components - richfaces components login required

2402860
richfaces	trinidad
regarding skinning i feel trinidad default skinning to be more basic than richfaces one but i think both have ways to make them as beautiful as your css skills allow you

2402860
richfaces	trinidad
i think richfaces has a more mature ajax integration and their ajax components and events are more easy to use for me than trinidad ones

2402888
disk	ram
looking for a ram disk api or equivalent set of software to implement to store file s temporarily for read write operations outside the physical hard disk environment

2402888

uiview	calayer
i ve got a uiview and thus a calayer which i m trying to warp or bend slightly in 3d space

2402936
disk	ram
a ram disk is an operating system level construct because it has to implement a file system and device driver to emulate a disk

2402936
disk	ram
otherwise reading the files into a data structure in your application will have the same performance characteristics as using a ram disk

2402936
disk	ram
typically a ram disk is used when the application is unaware of the fact that it is running off of ram cached files

2402948
entity-relationship	diagram	entity-relationship	entities
determining the functional dependencies in your schema should be simple once you produce an entity-relationship diagram and decide what data is part of the entities posts attachments media and what data is part of the relationships

2403077
m2e	pom.xml
not with the level of detail you provided like your pom.xml especially your spring dependency your eclipse version the m2e version...

2403193
expression-blend	silverlight
expression-blend - as a beginer blend 2.0 is enough for you to get started with wpf silverlight xaml

2403202
firefox	safari
the script is working in ie for a change it works there but i cannot get it working in firefox or safari

2403202

2403271
perl	tcl
berkeley db is written in c with api bindings for c++ c# php java perl python ruby tcl smalltalk and many other programming languages

2403307
super	extends
i just wanted to add that there is a reason for this there is a strong aversion to adding keywords because such additions break existing code so when new features are added existing keywords are used if they make a reasonable fit such as super and extends for generics and default for annotations or they are just skipped as in the colon used in the enhanced for-loop

2403323
actionscript	mxml
adobe - coding with mxml and actionscript

2403367

keep in mind that the above code will cast an int to a float double for the arithmetic and it can be changed back to an int for the final return

2403659
serializable	deserialization
that said i ve never really bothered with the whole entity serializable deserialization reattach thing as it seems fraught with peril

2403665
google-chrome	firefox
i thought it might be my new firebug version 1.5.2 or firefox in general but they re not working in ie or google-chrome either

2403680
multiplying	division
you can do this by performing integer division by 10 rounding up and then multiplying the result by 10

2403701
submit	submission
you could make this call from the click handler of the submit button in the other form or you could make one submission dependent on the other by submission from the actioncomplete handler of the other form

2403766
x86	64bit
it will return either x86 when a program is running in 32 bit mode either because it is running under a 32 bit os or because it is running on a 64bit os but as a 32 bit program under wow64 or either ia64 or amd64 if running as native 64bit program on a 64bit os

2403773
post	get
note that get post and getscript allow you to bind function to success only

2403784
put	get
if you don t do this someone is going to figure out a way to get by whatever stop-gap you put in place and they will come back to you saying hey i thought i told you to lock this down

2403789
pdfbox	itext
i do have itext and pdfbox at my disposal

2403790
keydown	keyup
if on the other hand you wanted to set off the repeat function every time someone keydown only the r key but then do another function when the r key is released keyup you would need to use event handlers

2403834
hide	fadeout
even when i try to fadeout or hide the content on click nothing happens

2403840
google-chrome	safari
to get a background image on a table row that works in ie8 also safari and google-chrome you have to apply a background image to the table cells of the row rather than the table row

2403886
multiplying	transpose
however the documentation states that to get the location of the camera one must multiplying the transpose and inverted rotation matrix by the translation vector

2403889
getter	setter
it uses a class decorator which i think is slightly simpler to understand than a metaclass and martineau s idea of simplifying the getter and setter with default values

2403889
getter	setter
they take one argument the attribute name as a string and return the setter or getter function respectively for that attribute

2403889
getter	setter
the main difference is that autoproperties expects the user to define getter and setter factories instead of manually defined getter and setter

2403922
opera	firefox
when i open this page in firefox and opera everything works fine but ie does not allow me to attach anything to the url

2403946
int	chars
for comparison if chars variables occupy 4-byte stack slots in the calling convention they might say that the compiler is actually passing an int

2403947
mouseover	mouseout
if you do mouseover twice you get two mouseout event handlers that will both be called.

2403962
put	get
i have this working but it seems a bit kludgy get the value from the posted form put it into viewstate put the value of the viewstate var into a hidden field get the value of the hidden field in js split it into an array iterate thru the array comparing ids

2403965
width	height
i want to know the width and height of the html elements like divs body and tables

2403965
width	height
i want the calculated width height and not the one that i apply to the elements

2404040
int	chars
remember that nvarchar requires 2 bytes per chars so if an int is 4 chars then to use the same space you could only use 2 chars in the nvarchar column

2404079
post	get
if i try the code from the original post i get the following exception which makes sense

2404101
min	max
setting both the min and max to 512 is good if your program allocates a bunch of stuff but is not situational always uses about the same amount of ram

2404127
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome and other new browsers there doesn t seem to be any issues when one of the services go down

2404160
post	get
instead of rehashing - here is an mvp post that should get you pointed in the right direction

2404199
firefox	safari
i have not tested on all browsers but it seems to work for me in safari firefox and msie8

2404242
tripledes	aes
as for block ciphers you should use aes instead of tripledes

2404285
getter	setter
alternatively i was thinking about modifying the models such that all getter setter will uppercase any string coming and going

2404319
post	get
i would not use get as the method you should use post if you are going to save data

2404322
post	get
on the other hand i ve been quite successful at using the ef 1 on its own terms and have managed to not allow claims people make in blog post to get in the way of making it work for me

2404356
hide	show
the latest version of apple s uicatalog example application includes zero code in the textfieldcontroller for handling keyboard show hide events and yet the table view still slides up and down beautifully with the keyboard

2404364
16-bit	64bit
in non-sse 066h switches between 32-bit or 64bit and 16-bit operation

2404376

2404423
postgresql	mysql
sphinx for mysql or postgresql or xml pipes

2404446
width	height
when it has both height and width defined in the browser ff ignores the height set and renders a very small div

2404465
multiplying	transpose
the multiplying the transpose and inverted rotation matrix by thing is the backward transformation

2404525
min	max
you could use max min too

2404550
mouseover	mouseout
try using hover instead of mouseover and mouseout

2404559
pull	push
then you can push or commit to your own branches and pull update or merge from everyone else s branches

2404564
firefox	safari
ie uses ntlm by default if your using firefox safari etc

2404569
try-catch	exception-handling
edit i have added a try-catch statement to catch the exception-handling

2404581
mouseover	mouseout
add the mouseover handler to #div_1 and the mouseout handler to #div_2

2404581
mouseover	mouseout
this way #div_2 is shown when you mouseover #div_1 and it is hidden when you mouseout of #div_2 instead of as soon as you mouseout of #div_1

2404631
jsf	wicket
based on what you have posted i presume you come from building websites using a server side framework jsp jsf wicket php or similar

i don t know that you can do that as a url mapping however files and folder in the same directory that your web.xml file is in will be accessible in the way you describe although you can t control the mapping under your webapp

2404635
strncmp	strncpy
you need to pass the size along with the array just like it is done in many library functions for instance strncpy strncmp etc

2404717

2404763
gcj	javac
i see here that ant supports gcj compilation through the javac tag

2404818
getter	setter
synthesize will generate the getter and setter for you

2404851
fgets	strlen
caveats do not use strlen aname - 1 because a line returned by fgets may start with the nul character - thus the index into the buffer becomes -1

2405064
put	get	for-loop	arrays
i need to get a range of pages using ajax and put them into an arrays where their given place in the arrays is equal to the i of a for-loop it s a caching-like function for blog pages and the range of the for-loop is entirely variable

2405134
hide	show
all the columns are included in the report designer and i use parameters to hide show columns based on the user s choice

2405166
int	boolean
if you need to be able to answer the question of whether an x y z triplet is in your data set you either store an impossible w value -1 perhaps if they re otherwise positive int or int_max if they re otherwise finite or at each point you store a struct of a w int and a boolean is_present flag and set the flag to true false for whether that index is present in your data set

2405234
strtok	getline
actually if it s within the constraints of your assignment i d recommend abandoning and strtok in favor of string istringstream and getline

2405261
width	height
i have a winforms gui in c# that allows a user to draw a rectangle on a display of a tiff and save the position height width etc

2405261
width	height
basically what i want to do is take the saved position height and width of the rectangle and clip that area into a sep

2405288
multiplying	transpose
transpose and multiplying the rotation matrix does not change the rotation matrix --- a rotation matrix is orthogonal which means it s transpose is equal to its inverse and therefore r t -1 r

2405307
post	get
using this you will get array of category object for each post the loop is currently processing

2405336
google-chrome	safari
for some reason when a user attempts to print any article of this type from a webkit-based browser i ve confirmed this in both safari and google-chrome the pages are all blank

2405341
folder	directory
then ensure that you create a bin folder in each of the virtual directory and copy the library into there as well

use to hide and to show

2405611
rsa	aes
windows vista and later supports sha-2 in the microsoft enhanced rsa and aes cryptographic provider for cryptoapi and the .net framework has supported sha-2 since .net 1.1

2405621
versioning	upgrade
update i upgrade memcached to versioning 1.4.2 packaged on lucid repos with the exact same result

2405633
opera	google-chrome
the problem i am encountering is that for my login form i have to login twice for the session to register properly but only in google-chrome my version is 4.0.249.89 and opera my version is 10.10

2405662
user-controls	elementhost
specialusercontrol is the user-controls with wpf textbox within an elementhost object

2405714
google-chrome	safari
as that doesn t solve problems of testing in ie google-chrome safari

2405781
free	malloc
this is how it is with malloc free this is how it is with

2405781
free	malloc
in fact in a typical implementation raw memory allocations for calls are eventually processed by some implementation-specific malloc free -like pair which means that doesn t really have to care about how much memory to deallocate it simply calls that internal free or whatever it is named which takes care of that

2405827
aggregate-functions	sum
my cube has a measure called amount with a aggregate-functions sum and transactionnumber with a agregate function count and a time dimesion transactiontype dimension and others

as others have mentioned the right mouse button can be detected through the usual mouse events mousedown mouseup click

2405896
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
apache has mod_proxy nginx has http proxy lighttpd has its own mod_proxy.

2405915
post	get
note that the latter three views are still accessed via get even though they are processed via overloaded post

2405915
post	get
get article add - displays a form for adding a new article fetched via get processed via post

2405915
put	get	post	put	post	get
get article 123 edit - displays article 123 in edit mode fetched via get processed via put overloaded as post

2405915
post	get
get article 123 delete - displays delete confirmation for article 123 fetched via get processed via delete overloaded as post

2405915
put	get
a better implementation of the above might be to put the add edit delete keywords into a get parameter - since they do not change the resource we re working with it might be better to keep the base uri same for all of them

2405939
fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream
i don t know how good the rubyzip implementation is but with java.util.zip implementation the outputstream can be set to bytearrayoutputstream fileoutputstream filteroutputstream objectoutputstream outputstream pipedoutputstream ..

2406130
width	height
then the scroller has a scrollerlayout which sizes the scroller if it has an explicit width height it uses that otherwise it uses it s content sizes

2406151
unix	bsd
mac os x was based on bsd unix so is it possible

2406157
int	double
you can t overload + for int types and similarly you can t overload for double types

2406180
cpu	processors
for complicated reasons having to do with the internal electronics of the cpu for most modern processors it is faster to perform a direct branch where the destination address is encoded in the instruction than an indirect branch where the address is computed at runtime

2406222
width	height
coordinate java.awt.rectangle x 0 y 0 width 0 height 0

2406222
width	height
coordinate java.awt.rectangle x 5 y 5 width 23 height 16

2406255
html5lib	beautifulsoup
the main alternative i think would be html5lib -- i haven t tries it on app engine but i believe it does run there quite slowly -- if that s a problem i think you need to stick with beautifulsoup this service runs on app engine and is based on html5lib

2406258
hide	show
either pass autodestroy false this can be set at the tabpanel level as well and hide existing components after removing them then simply show them on subsequent clicks or you ll have to reinstantiate them before adding each time

2406288
awt	swing
why don t you learn swing instead of awt then you can use a jtextfield

2406324
getter	setter
modify the getter setter not via configuration though

2406342
post	get
so if you can initially select each post parse it get the first paragraph and insert it into another table then have your plugin do that when each new post is saved you re home

2406353
folder	directory
however i have migrated the mock-up folder to the root directory and in implementing these rules for the site some files are not being served in the pdfs folder

2406374
int	chars
when you try and assign that int to a chars there is a possible loss of precision 32 bit signed to 16 bit unsigned

2406380
int	chars
both userinput.charat 0 and 0 are of type chars but they are implicitly converted to int for the operation subtraction and hence when the int result is assigned to a chars java will given an error

2406466
urllib	httplib
beautifulsoup and mechanize should both work out of the box on app engine - it provides a wrapper around httplib and urllib that uses urlfetch as a backend

2406488
public	protected
the jvm only knows package-protected protected public and private visibility

2406491
children	parent
i have a class called man parent class and two children namely toddler and old man they are its children because they override a behaviour in man called as walk

2406512
subtraction	multiplication
once you understand what the code does my suggestion would be to implement vector subtraction and multiplication

2406523
vmware	virtualbox
another good option that you might want to investigate is running linux inside of virtualbox or vmware on your windows machine

2406526
int	double
for example you can typically use the binary + operator to add numeric values floats int double etc.

2406531
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
google-chrome 5.0.307.11 failed to render the image while other tools firefox 3.6 opera 10.10 inkscape 0.47 gimp 2.6.7 render something vaguely similar in style to the picture in the specification but no two are truly the same

2406541
post	put
right now i am rewriting all the action to use form tags post and add in a hidden value called _method which would be delete for deleting action and put for updating action

2406576
width	height
on the image you could set max-width max-height giving support for ie 7 and everything else and then pick whichever you really need the most between width and height using an ie6 conditional to set that

2406592
getter	setter
the second case is better when you want to provide a setter deleter docstring as well as the getter or if you want to add a property that has a different name to the method it derives its value from

2406595
hide	show
if you are sure that at some point the run-time user is going to want to create a datagridview why not create it in advance visually style it create columns etc. and then hide it when the form loads then show it on demand

2406628
switching	screens
is there a way to switching views in a viewflipper just like on home screens where we have small dots at the bottom of the screens and on clicking on them we can switching views

2406675
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
although you tagged as firefox google-chrome safari and opera 10.5 also have support for audio

2406676
int	chars
for example if you use the increment decrement operators ++ and -- on an object the compiler will not understand what needs to be incremented decremented in the object because it is not a primitive type int chars float...

2406696
condor	checkpoint
checkpoint is the only condor feature not available on windows

2406708
explode	implode
i would show yet another version that may shorter and involves using implode and explode but i m sure that s enough for now

2406721
umask	sudo
if you forget to use this and your default umask is more restrictive or less restrictive then you will need to re-run the non- sudo

2406743
versioning	upgrade
we had lots of tug-of-wars with customers that didn t want to upgrade for whatever reason or wanted to do their own qa on the new versioning

2406847
wordpress	expressionengine
is there any cms such as expressionengine or wordpress that allows a user to click a button and convert all the text to another language it would have to be human generated otherwise it has too many mistakes probably

2406929
html5lib	beautifulsoup
for normalizing html using a pure python library i have had better experiences with html5lib than beautifulsoup

2406955
inherited	properties
inherited is about how properties trickle down from an element to its children

2406955
inherited	properties
certain properties like font-family inherited

2406955
inherited	properties
specified properties override inherited properties

2406955
inherited	properties
more targeted selectors are given priority over inherited properties from parent selectors

2406959
int	boolean
in python you can concatenate boolean values and it would return an int

2407018
pascal	delphi
there are free serialization libraries for delphi also for free pascal

2407018
omnixml	nativexml
xml omnixml and nativexml

2407018
serializable	deserialization
update i would not use the constructor-based approach while maybe looking trivial in the beginning deserialization can become a complex process which would add more and more non-class-specific code to the classes which need serializable

2407021
width	height
that value is then used to change the sizer width and height thus updating the scrollviewer s scrollbars

2407080
pop-up	dialog
i want show a pop-up dialog box when i click on to button

2407080
pop-up	dialog

google-chrome	firefox
it appears that the element indices are different in ie and in google-chrome firefox as .eq 2 returns different values depending on browser

2407308
google-chrome	firefox
the element i m looking for shows up as .eq 2 in firefox google-chrome but .eq 3 in ie

2407319

am new in qt programming and i would like to develop a program which i want to run in windows linux ubuntu and mac

2407322
fiddler	charles
try fiddler or charles

versioning	upgrade
our upgrade process now involves building synchronized replicas of the two versioning taking extracts from the live query logs and playing these against both versioning and comparing the results

2407357
qmenubar	qmainwindow
if you want to remove the menu bar from the qmainwindow you can use the qt_no_menubar preprocessor to remove all uses of a qmenubar

2407357
qmainwindow	qwidget
if you are not using facilities provided by qmainwindow maybe you can use a simple qwidget as main window in your application

2407365
google-chrome	firefox
ï ½ odd character when request file via ajax method and also ext.ajax.request.only problem on firefox browser.internet explorer 8 and google-chrome no effect.the file i request come from windows iis server

2407371
allocator	stl
i am not sure about the granularity of the stl allocator in the current configuration you are working on

2407415
children	parent
but if you really need to roll your own i d suggest having an object with parent name directories children and files

2407475
stdout	stderr
you can obviously do the reverse with as 1 refers to stdout and 2 to stderr

2407475
stdout	stderr
for piping stderr to stdout

2407475
stdout	stderr
for piping stderr and stdout to stdout

2407490
multiplying	add
the common idea to get hash is to multiplying each bitpattern of a float with a prime and add them together

2407510
width	height
starting at width 0 height 0 for when it is in contact with the background when it moves over the edge expand it by a reasonable amount eg 5px per loop until it has a hittest

2407529
apache	nginx
i would configure your webserver nginx or apache to look for a maintenance.html page and serve that up with a 503 status if it exists

2407545
pop-up	dialog
an error dialog will pop-up showing you every directory that was searched - you should be able to confirm that the directory with pocomsg.h in it isn t there

2407583
width	height
turn of docking for the tablelayout and set its width height larger than the form

2407602
post	put
i once wondered about this too so i figured it out and put it in a blog post

2407648
udp	tcp
you might mean providing an end-point for a tcp circuit or udp stream

2407648
udp	tcp
the entire point of the assignment it seems is to show you understand the raw layout of ip packets and possibly tcp udp

2407679
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
its working fine in ie firefox and safari but the event does not trigger in google-chrome

2407729
nexus	artifactory
i would suggest that you setup your own repository such as archiva nexus or artifactory

2407788
int	chars
if you explicitly cast your chars to an int it ll use the ascii code else it s not doing the cast by itself to int so you get the strange results you are getting

2407806
subtract	add
so really you just need to get the local timezone offset and feed it into the basic equation timezone.getdefault + 6 and you ll know what to add or subtract to your local db

2407818
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
afaik it is supported by ie5.5+ firefox google-chrome safari and opera but you can test any of them properly at quirksmode.org s test page

2407983
getter	setter
using explicit getter and setter for properties on the object like the example you gave for set_name instead of directly accessing them gives you among others the following advantages

2408012
uinavigationbar	uisegmentedcontrol	uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
in my app i have a uitableview uisegmentedcontrol and uinavigationbar

2408012
uinavigationbar	uisegmentedcontrol
once uisegmentedcontrol gets one of its segments selected i want to show a uiactivityindicatorview on the uinavigationbar and then parse an xml file and present the results in a table

2408031
hash	md5
you are probably computing md5 or sha1 hash which change drastically on minor change of the input

2408080
put	get
i feel you get back what you put into comments 5 minutes commenting a class well will in 3 months time when the class needs to be changed by someone else other than the original author indeed sometimes by the original author will take much less time to get to grips with

2408165
post	put
see this codinghorror post for a nicely put explanation

2408188
google-chrome	firefox
this solution worked just ok in firefox and google-chrome but than i found out

2408201
gif	ico
ico and gif files support only single bit for transparency - every pixel is either fully opaque or fully transparent

2408208
content-disposition	content-type
the way to force the browser not to handle the file internally is to change the headers content-disposition prefereably or content-type so the browser will not try to handle the file internally

2408212
udp	tcp
i have tried socket.receivebuffsize it has no effect at all for udp and it clearly said that it is for tcp window

2408241
getter	setter
as a counterpoint to christophed s answer if your instance variable is strictly for private use i wouldn t bother with writing a getter setter and just declare the instance variable private

2408241
getter	setter
in addition using a getter setter also shields other parts of the same class from knowing about its own implementation which i ve found very useful on occasion

2408265
jboss	weblogic
then changing to a different database would simply mean changing the separate datasource configuration in jboss jetty weblogic etc

2408281
post	get
i get the country from the post i query db with that get cities and craft cities back into a dropdown

2408306
put	get
in other words how do i get the sliders to freeze and stay put when the minimum value slider and the maximum value slider come next to each other

2408353
put	get
when i try to put the return values of a method that returns a profileentity into the wrapper i get the above error

2408364
google-chrome	firefox
it shows up from left to right on firefox and google-chrome but not ie

2408437
fortran	ada
it leverages production parser front ends to work with c c++ c# java cobol php python fortran ada .

2408531
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
made this nice little loop for hiding and showing div s works as a charm in firefox and opera but ie safari and google-chrome say s no...

2408537
vsto	add-in
centralizing vsto add-in exception management with postsharp

2408565
post	get
with php the get variable is a global variable along with others the big ones being post and cookie that the php script can retrieve by getting the value passed from the server to script in this case in

2408574
implements	extends
create a class that extends defaulttablecellrenderer and implements the gettablecellrenderercomponent method something like

2408580
getter	setter
getter and setter are optional but you need them if you want to be able to set their properties using the properties window

2408589
base-class	subclassing
add another protected virtual method to the base-class which called initarrayimpl and order the creator of the subclassing to fill the array in it

2408670
stdout	stderr
read data from stdout and stderr until end-of-file is reached

2408679
stdout	stderr
communicate reads data from stdout and stderr until end-of-file is reached

2408707
width	height
the image itself does not have any width or height set but its size is correctly controlled through the columndefinition set

2408707
width	height
from this i would assume that the image controller actually has a width and height set but when i try to bind another element to its width and height it doesn t work

2408740
distance	polygons
bill chadwick s google maps api demos scroll to distance point to polyline or polygons

2408747
ienumerable	ilist
since findallsites seems to return an ilist which is descended from ienumerable you should be able to use system.linq s extension methods select

2408803
hide	show
it show a div with a loading message when the img is loaded it hide the loadig message and call a function with the visual transition transizione

2408805
getter	setter
you should have setter getter methods

2408805
getter	setter
no need to declare members or setter getter functions

2408806
onresume	onpause
furthermore using the onresume onpause etc is somewhat necessary

2408807
rss	feed
zend_feed_reader to read the rss feed

2408826
webrat	cucumber
i had originally configured factory_girl to be looked for config.gem but not loaded in the cucumber environment and fully required in features support env.rb same as cucumber does for webrat etc

2408843
dynamicmethod	reflection.emit
replacing with typed delegates dynamicmethod etc - or taking it hardcore reflection.emit

2408857
single-quotes	double-quotes
it assumes this between signs test 0 is a parameter of your tag try substituting single-quotes with double-quotes and make it html xhtml compliant

2408857
single-quotes	double-quotes
so single-quotes and double-quotes will be correctly set

2408887
int	chars
the reason for failure is that is replaced with the contents of stdio.h and when you replace int with chars within the content you break some declarations

2408887
stdio	gets
from usr include bits types.h which gets included indirectly through stdio

2408887
int	chars
clearly when you replace int with chars it becomes

2408895
int	chars
there are defined variables of type short int long int and so on which obviously fails when you change them through define to short chars and long chars

2408896
int	chars
since errors are from types.h it must modifying some stuff like short int to short chars etc

2408973
folder	directory
this way you can create your folder in shared directory and symlink it upon deployment like

2409077
regasm	regsvr32
i understand that regsvr32 and or regasm needs to be used to register my dll not sure which i have found conflicting advice

2409146
allocator	stl
why not use stl but provide your own allocator and deallocator for example stl vector is defined as you can create and set your own allocator that request memory space from your memory pool

2409169
stdout	stderr
the command time sends it s output to stderr instead of stdout

2409175
post	get
javascript can only send values to serverside php via post or get

2409196
kde	gnome
my impression is that people tend to stick to one widget toolkit gtk for gnome and qt for kde but on the other hand i would be surprised to see that someone isn t using a good application he she needs just because of the toolkit

2409241
free	malloc
the most obvious scenario would be integration with a legacy system the requires you to pass or accept ownership of some memory as you shouldn t mix new free or malloc delete

2409247
hide	show
i need to hide or disable then enable or show site menu i mean visible content

2409273
realloc	malloc
even then malloc is rarely the right thing to do but sometimes you may want to take advantage of realloc be able to resize the underlying storage more efficiently

2409285
hide	show
if i understood correctly you want to hide show menu base on user authenticated or not

2409303
stdout	stderr
there are other ways by which an application can start a new process by the _system library function but i strongly suggest to use createprocess directly in your code since you can control the child process behaviour completely you can select the priority pass stdin stdout stderr handles decide the startup window s characteristics...

2409311
implements	extends
doing a little more research i did find a few things on how to get the dependency injection to work where you are implements extends an instance provider a service behavior and a service host class.

2409317
as.date	posixct
the only way i could get it to work was by converting my posixct timestamps using as.date

2409323
public	protected
create public or protected instance of accessor class that will wrap m_arr and m_field_initialized

2409323
int	double
accessor should have setval int i double val method which will set and additionaly flag to true

2409336
getter	setter
just create a private variable with getter and setter that you continually update

2409340
maven	pom.xml
xmlbeans maven plugin conf in pom.xml

2409350
qiodevice	qudpsocket
if you want stream orientated behaviour you could use the fact that qudpsocket is a qiodevice with a data-stream but it sounds as if you want per-datagram behaviour

2409363
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uinavigationcontroller don t deal with uiviews they deal with uiviewcontroller

2409410
min	max
in addition to the min max size constraint i want the control always being painted with

2409431
folder	directory
i m thinking of something that looks similar to windows explorer with a directory structure on the left in a panel and then when you click on a particular folder you would be able to view some text or html that describes the folder in the right hand panel

2409444
pop-up	dialog
my problem is that by clicking on add button from dialogdemo.jspx not any pop-up window or dialog box is opened

2409462
swt	swing
based on these requirements i ve narrowed down the selection of toolkits to qt and wxwidgets since none of the other toolkits that i know about including java s swing and swt flex air etc. satisfy the native-looking requirement

2409549
pull	push
according to the help pull push commit etc should act on the subrepo as well

2409572
int	boolean
like raveren said you can t send int or boolean to php

2409593
extjs	qooxdoo
i compared qooxdoo with yui and extjs and i think qooxdoo is the way to go for programmers - yui isn t that polished as qooxdoo from a programmer s point of view and extjs has a not so friendly licensing model

2409595
submit	submission
one solution may be to use the jquery ajax forms plugin which will submit the form to the server and give you back the result of the submission which would avoid breaking the page lifecycle

2409598
hide	show
this is a form validation that will hide the submit button if the input field s are not valid and show it if all the input fields are valid

2409604
rss	feed
i want to provide an rss feed for this

2409625
folder	directory
i think you won t get around manually exporting all folder in project b that came from project a thus removing the faulty .svn directory and re-add them

2409637
rss	feed
when feed aggregator fetches this url the servlet i believe this is how they are called in java world fetches a list of recent products from the db or wherever build rss feed and then sends it back to the requester which turns out to be a feed aggregator

2409700
inherited	subclassing
here s an instance from the nhibernate documentation or if you use inherited you will only need to map your derived classes as subclassing and specify the datatable name for each of them from within your base type class mapping

2409719
put	get
therefore i d like to simply ensure that all access to the backend which will be a few rest queries to get and put data will be via a valid iphone application and not some script running on a machine

2409725
fflush	gets
the most common reason for this fail is that the headers have already been fflush and body output has started before php gets to the header script

2409732
width	height
i have 2 vbox containers inside a viewstack and the viewstack is inside hbox i ve set both the height and width of the vboxes to 100 and the same for the viewstack

2409771
rss	feed
the control it meant to read in a twitter rss feed for a specific account and write out the last 2 tweets

2409771
rss	feed
i often see this error message on the prod site so i m wondering if it s making too many requests to the rss feed

2409801
vmware	virtualbox
if you run vmware or workstation or maybe virtualbox i m not sure if it supports mac os x but may and then mac os x server client can t legally be virtualized

2409815
implements	extends
to exectue java code whenever this request arrives at your server just create a class which extends httpservlet which listens on an url-pattern of run and has the dopost roughly implements as follows

2409832
ssl	https
but when we configure ssl https it is not working and throwing the below error

2409847
mouse	keyboard
if you have to get input into fullscreen mode you can try to make a virtual keyboard an example and user will use the mouse to press the keyboard key

2409867
google-chrome	firefox
i have need to move the mouse cursor position in the browser i can use any method as long as its in google-chrome or firefox one or the other

2409881
apache	nginx
you can use for example apache with mod_mono or nginx on linux

2409908
jquery	jqmodal
you re probably looking for jquery ui dialog or jqmodal

2409931
stdout	stderr
i ve got a script that calls out to a bunch of commands some of which are noisy to stdout some to stderr some to both

2409970
java.util.date	simpledateformat
i ve got a question about simpledateformat class and the java.util.date s compareto method

2409975
button	checkbox
my users found it very confusing to have to insert a special mark in the body even though fck editor provides a button and to use the checkbox to say whether the teaser should be included in the article

2409992
hash	md5
find md5 hash of url while fetching them

2409992
hash	md5
i fetch one table as an array run a loop through it and insert the values from other table where md5 hash is the same

2410045
put	get
if you can get away with less space 512 i think for nvarchar than you could put uniqueness constraints in sql and index on the column which would make the search so much faster - definitely my recommendation if you think you could cut the message length

2410068
memcpy	strcpy
i tried with memcpy strcpy etc etc

2410077
many-to-many	one-to-many
example let s say i have a blog post which has a many-to-many with tags and a one-to-many with comments

2410081
getter	setter
i understand the properties are just getter and setter so i m not sure how it would work

2410087
strcpy	malloc	strcpy	strdup	strdup	malloc
if you have it you can use strdup to combine the malloc + strcpy into one call

2410087
strdup	malloc
obviously this lacks error handling malloc and strdup can both fail

2410105
instances	transient
my solution was to create a new property injection strategy that kept track of previously activated instances that were not transient in scope and skip the default property injection strategy for activation requests for such instances

2410116
min	max
updated to max instead of min

2410134
klocwork	coverity
i think itâ s better software engineering to do the false-positive marking outside the code as in coverity and klocwork and do your enforcement based on that

2410162
width	height
and your desired width and height

2410188
equals	icomparable	equals	compareto	icomparable	compareto
you might implement icomparable without implementing iequatable for a class where a partial ordering makes sense and where very definitely you wish the consumer to draw the inference that just because compareto returns zero this does not imply that the objects are equals for anything other than sorting purposes

2410194
ant	maven
you can extend buckminster by writing new readers to obtain source from other locations or new actors that provide build steps - these actors can reuse maven or ant thus providing extra functionality

2410227
int	chars
the issue is that when you read into an int variable using c++ streams the input method expects chars that can make up a number such as + - 0 .

2410227
int	chars
if you want to see the ascii value you will need to output the chars variable as an int generally requiring a cast before output

2410239
opensuse	linux
i m using qt 4.6.3 on opensuse linux 11.2

2410291
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
use viewwillappear or viewdidappear

2410309
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sortedlist sorteddictionary or sortedset if you re using .net 4.0 probably do everything you need here with only a fairly small amount of work

2410425
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
for every object you want to save in the recordstore pare it down to its component strings and primitives then serialise it to a byte array using a bytearrayoutputstream wrapped in a dataoutputstream

2410441
post	put
you could post the details view action and put the extra parameters in the form rather than the url so the user can still bookmark the url

2410508
getter	setter
the class you are using is a generated method from your application settings and the generated properties only have a getter on the property and no setter

2410593
rss	feed
our email vendor supports rss feed for dynamic content which we use successfully for daily headline type emails

2410594
post	get
but before you start doing this note it is a really really bad idea to simply take every post and get variable and spit it into the global namespace

2410613
shadowing	named
also please don t use such named as sum for your variables you re shadowing built-in

2410657
png	ico
you upload a large 512x512 png it gives you an ico that works the way it should with multiple embedded images in different sizes

2410795
udp	tcp
i have tried socket.receivebuffsize it has no effect at all for udp and it clearly said that it is for tcp window

2410823
csv	tsv
instead of trying to build your own csv tsv file parser or using string.split i d recommend you have a look at fast csv reader or filehelpers library

2411009
inherited	properties
you should get this object in the openreadcompletedeventargs in the userstate properties inherited from asynccompletedeventargs

2411022
implements	extends
but in the definition of the class there no extends statement only implements

2411031
pull	push
copying .git is not an option since i want refs to push pull with and i don t want to set them up manually

2411049
put	get
where the routehandler splits the path into its correct parts to get the correct report and this works great if i put in a route www.mysite.com report folder1 folder2 report then i ll get what i m looking for however my problem is if i have a link like www.mysite.com report folder1 report the path is only folder1 report and the routing really doesn t like this in fact it doesn t even hit my route handler just goes straight to resource can t be found server error page

2411065
ubuntu	linux
also fwiw chrome 5.0.322.2 dev under linux ubuntu 9.1 does not have this issue

2411106
post	get
using javascript you can send get and post requests but you will not be able to read the response like you can with xhr

2411116
invokerequired	begininvoke
i ve read articles for winforms that suggest using invokerequired to automatically call begininvoke if necessary

2411131
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade jquery to versioning 1.4.2 and i am now getting an error on this line

2411132
int	chars
in my case i am just checking the int representation of the chars and if it is 65 returning true else false

2411177
folder	directory
that created a directory for my sub-branch in the original branch s folder structure

2411187
uielement	adorner
if you use the tunneling version of the mouse events rather than the bubbling events previewmousedown instead of mousedown you will receive the mouse events from the uielement first and be able to stop them from reaching the adorner by setting e.handled to true

2411235
hide	show
then when each filter is changed show hide the divs based on class selectors

2411314
slideup	slidedown
i have seen slideup and slidedown in jquery

2411315
for-loop	loops
i would like to convert my for-loop to stl std for_each loops

2411323
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
i want to use mysqlconnection command and sqldatareader or sqlconnection command and sqldatareader based on a condition

2411335
getter	setter
as i look at it you have a getter and setter for each attribute of the class package

2411335
getter	setter
having getter setter for all those attributes doesn t go well with encapsulation

2411384
solaris	sunos
the 1.5 and 1.6 versions are what the java compiler says using java -version and sometimes the minor release is used as a version string like sunos 5.8 was called solaris 8 as a product name

2411397
width	height
this prints a height of 44 and a width of 320

2411447
jquery	scriptaculous
there s a module of scriptaculous called sound.js docs is prototype scriptaculous based but you can easily port it to jquery

2411480
getter	setter
so any package derived class that needs or require a quantity may do so by overriding the getter and setter of the quantity property

2411530
sendkeys	findwindow
i found stuff about using findwindow and sendkeys for this but i donâ t see how thatâ ll work unless the button had a keystroke assigned to it which it doesnâ t

2411613
width	height
and don t try using sizeof because that will only give you the size of the pointer if another function needs to know the dimensions of the array you ll have to pass along those parameters height and width as arguments along with the array pointer

2411619
google-chrome	firefox
each time the memory of both firefox and google-chrome is increasing by 3 to 6ko

2411642
opera	safari
it claims to work in ie opera and safari by simply being a javascript file

2411649
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari - developer tools

2411658
innodb	myisam
let s say you re adding an index to a couple tables or changing a table type from myisam to innodb or something then with a large enough table those things could be done in 5 to 10 minutes depending on your hardware

2411665
google-chrome	safari
for safari and google-chrome the developer tools

2411677
nunit	mstest
i have a nice way in between mstest and nunit

2411677
nunit	mstest
you can use the mstest framework to run your test testclass attribute and testmethod attribute for each test but use the nunit assert api

2411687
mvp	presenter
i have been searching on the net and i made a couple of examples of both of them but i m even more confused because in some sample web pages mvp uses more than 2 interfaces to communicate the presenter with the view layer some ones even have completely blank interfaces only declarated but in other ones it only takes two interfaces to transport data from presenter to view

2411695
subtract	add
in sql server i d just add 1 day to the date and then subtract 1 second

2411706
ubuntu	linux
in my current installation apache2 ubuntu linux the line is found in etc apache2 conf.d charset but in other linux unix setups can be in etc apache2 httpd.conf or etc apache httpd.conf if you are using apache 1

2411734
pop-up	dialog
from then on there are several options - one is to bundle it with the release attach a link to the file to one of the projects and select copy local true or to embed it into one of the projects and use it in a pop-up - this can be done with the installer project or as part of the about dialog

2411765
typedef	struct
typedef struct

2411781
mdpi	hdpi
the android documentation says that best practices are to make two drawable directories - one for hdpi and one for mdpi

2411781
mdpi	hdpi
it also says that if the mdpi directory doesn t exist and a mdpi device is running the app it will scale down the hdpi ones so everything looks good

2411865
put	get
it would be much simpler to code if get and put were reduced to their bare bones no timeouts no no-waits etc and all subqueues used a single overall mutex very small overhead wrt many mutexes and much easier to code in a deadlock-free way

2411887
children	parent
there could be multiple children with the same parent for example - intersect should only return that id once

2411925
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have tested it in firefox google-chrome safari and ie8

2411927
udp	tcp
if your purpose is to study network programming and you re more interested in udp versus tcp for instance then udp is a bad choice for a chat application as it does not guarantee much about data integrity or ordering

2411932
maven	pom.xml
i want to integrate this into my maven pom.xml so

2411934
gridview	rowdatabound
totals in the footer can be applied using a combination of javascript executed on each data change and form load and dynamically adding textboxes or labels to the footer via the gridview s rowdatabound event

2411936
ceil	floor
chances are you need to learn about floor and ceil too.

2411938
ant	maven
i would like to be able to run the tests on target systems from the application jar without eclipse or ant or maven or any other development tool

2411966
gif	png
i m wondering if thereâ s a way in java or a third party library to check the allowed files formats jpg gif and png before reading the entire file

2411976
lisp	scheme
since it uses lisp rather scheme as its teaching language recursion is used throughout

2411977
firefox	safari
i changed it to -1 and voila the facebook dialog works on safari and firefox all new versions

2412008
put	get
note that if you put this in a .bashrc you ll get bitten when you run sudo since the env var won t be defined there

2412048
google-chrome	firefox
while webkit has had a stupidly fast js implementation for quite a while and google-chrome even before firefox has only recently got tracemonkey and don t even get me started on internet explorer

width	height
when you create a uitableviewcell object as a subclass of uiview it has its own default frame and bounds which includes a height and width

2412164
guava	java.util.concurrent
the contents of the map is not thread safe because it needs to be either wrapped with preferably a guava immutablemap implementation or java.util.collections.unmodifiablemap or use one of the map implementations in the java.util.concurrent

2412170
put	get
if you are trying to make a certain order traversal of your array more efficient you could always transform the incoming matrix before you put it into the array and then do the transform again when you get it out

2412171
mouseleave	mouseenter
instead of hover you should use mouseenter and mouseleave

2412171
mouseleave	mouseenter
i ve had this same problem before and using mouseenter mouseleave fixed it

2412178
fflush	gets
you must use fflush after each println or activate automatic flushing on the printwriter so the data gets really sent

2412219
sorting	filtering
think about pulling some meta-data out of the image and storing in separate columns for filtering and sorting purposes

2412246
rss	feed
rss feed are my issue at this point

2412246
rss	feed
multiple rss feed to be specific

the pages where this dialog pop-up is unrelated to the data being displayed so this is a separate model

2412320
button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
you can have a checkbox radio button dropdownlistfor et

2412330
tiff	png
if you want to stick with what s in java you probably have to use tiff png or jpeg -- there are third party image endcoders for example my company atalasoft makes a .net version of these advanced encoders -- there are java vendors out there as well

2412446
folder	directory
you will have to make the new virtual directory be an application so it can have its own bin folder

2412455
filtering	grouping
you can grouping filtering and sort items based on various fields

2412520
put	get
i am able to get a very similar example of a chat client server from the boost site working but when i attempt to put the code into my own program it stops working

2412542

mxmlc	compc
the thing is i m trying to do it using the command line only mxmlc and compc and without using embed and failing miserably

2412622
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
on paper binary arithmetic is simple but as a beginning programmer i m finding it a little difficult to come up with algorithms for the addition subtraction multiplication and division of binary numbers

2412626
division	subtract
getting the day of week from such a number is as simple as subtract and getting the remainder of a division

2412721
getc	gets
i ve tried pretty much every other method of getting data from the client tcpsocket but all of them hang and never break out of the loop getc gets read etc

2412839
uiview	subviews
in the meantime you could construct a custom uiview with uilabels and colored lines to act as the legend for the graph then add it as a sibling to the graph not a subviews or it will not be rendered properly and order it to show above the graph

2412843
switching	screens
keeping in mind a memory usage and b time to switching screens

2412909
pop-up	dialog
on this page if you type something into an input and then click save a custom dialog will pop-up

2412911
put	get
other ways are to mark a project id in cookie but that kills linking so that as someone leaves and comes back they get put back there

2412937
pop-up	dialog
so you would just have your menu item action display a pop-up dialog or something like that

2412970
implements	extends
he means that you can extends the class android.widget.textview or canvas or some other renderable surface and implements your own overriding version that allows embedded images with text flowing around them

2412971
qsort	bsearch
i m working on a homework assignment in which i m required to use char arrays instead of strings and qsort bsearch

2412999
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
worrying about whether to override alloc or allocwithzone is again a subclassing thing but really anyone who inherited from a singleton superclass and then screws around with its allocation methods deserves the bad behaviour they get

2413032
sorting	filtering
the code below completely works for sending receiving json parameters from and to jqgrid in order to have correct paging sorting filtering with single search only utilizing linq

2413097
int	double
if i change the type of derived foo s parameter from an int to a double i get the following warning in addition to the aforementioned error c2259

2413107
move	drag
what you probably want to do is work out where in the stackpanel the element will end up as a result of the drag which element in the panel it will push down then create an animation to animate the element from its current position where the user released the drag to that final position in the stackpanel and another animation to move the pushed element in to its new position in the stackpanel visualtreehelper can probably help here i think

2413166
stdout	stderr
to redirect and append stdout and stderr to a file while also displaying it on the terminal i do this

2413187
hide	show
i have divs show and hide with an animation using the following script i included the jquery library

2413289
uicontrol	uibutton
check out uicontrol what uibutton inherits from

2413326
folder	directory
the problem was is that color-theme.el expects to have the themes in a folder one below where it resides in a directory called themes

2413358
subclass	accessor
otherwise you ll have to subclass the collection class you re using to add the accessor you need

2413400
subtract	add
it doesn t make sense to convert a timedelta into a datetime but it does make sense to pick an initial or starting datetime and add or subtract a timedelta from that

postgresql	mysql
i have to decide between mysql and postgresql which database might fit better my problem

2413455
children	parent
this iteration mode instructs the iterator that the parent items not leaves are to be placed before their children if any when iterating

2413455
children	parent
this iteration mode swaps around the parent child positions such that the children items leaves come first followed by the parent as demonstrated by

2413462
dictionary	map
in clear violation of the rules for the encapsulation of algorithms and data structures this unnecessarily discloses that currently these methods use a map or dictionary for their implementation

2413463
subtract	add
add subtract the hours from time_t.tm_hour

2413521
public	protected
basically in the latter version getname must be public although i think you can use friend and so must be the inheritance whereas in the former the inheritance can be private and or the interface functions can be protected if desired

2413535
inherited	properties
however i see one reason to use them anyway if you have an object of type mysubtype which inherited from mytype you might want to render only properties defined in mytype in that case you just have to specify mytype as the type parameter overriding the type inference

2413578
textarea	textbox
the form is made up of input textbox and textarea

2413582
unicode	ucs
utf-8 8-bit ucs unicode

2413592

2413610
yacc	bison
learn about tools such as lex flex and yacc bison

2413658
filtering	grouping
having is used to filtering aggregated rows after they ve been grouping by

2413750
implements	modifiers
access to all of the access modifiers implements in the clr

2413750
public	protected
you can explicitly specify public protected or private for both the same assembly and external assemblies

all you have in c# other than the obvious public protected private are the internal and protected internal modifiers the former meaning public internally private externally and the latter meaning public internally protected externally

2413802
int	boolean
is there a way to make it so that the method that i use in main only has to take one int perhaps another method splits that int into two clones that are then passed to public static boolean prime proper

2413834
serializable	deserialization
in this case by far the easiest approach is to write a serializable deserialization method for your entity

2413848
multiplying	multiplication
and don t use divide where multiplying will do multiplication is typically faster though not always

2413855
ienumerable	ienumerator
you can only use yield return in a function that returns an ienumerable or an ienumerator not a

2413870
int	double
double click your button to add a handler method then grab the value from the field as an int

2413882
ienumerable	ienumerator
the return type of an iterator must be ienumerable ienumerator ienumerable t or ienumerator t

2413882
ienumerable	ilist
ilist and ilist t do implement ienumerable ienumerable t but every caller to an enumerator expects one of the four types above and none else

2413899
pop-up	dialog

also if you could paste how your apache nginx configuration looks like i doubt there is anything wrong in there but you never know

2414002
jlist	jtable
approach is really identical to the one you use for jtable or jlist also if data structure and so model differs

2414014
ironruby	ironpython
if you absolutely have to use both languages in a project your best option would probably the combination of jython and jruby or ironpython and ironruby

2414042
whirlpool	md5
i suggest using sha2 224 256 384 512 md5 ripemd160 or whirlpool if you can

by far the most important oo design pattern is mvc model-view-controller which all of the major frameworks cakephp codeigniter etc use

2414242
avr	microcontroller
i m trying to build gcc for use with an avr microcontroller and avr-ada and i ve hit a roadblock caused by my regular compiler being too picky about the version i needed for the avr

2414259
pull	push
can you pull push to the repository from the command line

2414268
division	modulo
once the b 2 test returns false then there s no need to calculate the modulo hence avoiding the division

2414350
next	except
everything works as it should except when you click on the next prev images the item node collapses

2414366
trie	tree
will the browsers construct a trie or suffix tree

accessor	properties
in c# you can have more restrictive accessor on the accessor of a properties like this

2414542
post	get
you can pass 3 options uri method get post

2414554
hide	show
modify effects for your needs if show hide isn t what you need

2414555
getter	setter
you will probably need to use a codesnippettypemember though with a bit of ingenuity you could still use codedom to generate the getter and setter bodies

2414568
onchange	onblur
i want to be able to enter data and use javascript onchange onblur etc to render a live print preview

2414578
folder	directory
all i get out is a html file named what i specify then a newly created folder in the same directory called images which is empty

2414604
hide	show
some way what i want to do is this once i click on calender the selected value should show in textbox and calender should hide

2414615
min	max
so if you have no agregation function sum max min avg count etc. selected you will not be able to group by

2414617
width	height
specifying width and height in the image tag is a good practice..this way when the page loads there is space allocated for the image and the layout does not suffer any jerks even if the image takes a long time to load

2414623
width	height
if you d like to use inline styles though it s probably best to set the width and height using the style attribute for the sake of readability

2414624
width	height
the historical reason to define height width in tags is so that browsers can size the actual elements in the page even before the css and or image resources are loaded

2414624
width	height
if you do not supply height and width explicitly the element will be rendered at 0x0 until the browser can size it based on the file

2414624
width	height
sizing the via height width creates a physical placeholder in the page flow at the correct size enabling your content to load asynchronously without disrupting the user experience

2414624
width	height
alternately if you are doing mobile-responsive design which is a best practice these days it s quite common to specify a width or max-width only and define the height as auto

2414624
width	height
that way when you define media queries css for different screen widths you can simply adjust the image width and let the browser deal with keeping the image height aspect ratio correct

2414645
hide	show
module third party to perform a small operation in my main application when i call that module..it processes for a particular time say 5 sec.while its proccessing it show the process in the commmand window with some information..now my main application waits until the called module finishes its process.now my question is..how to do i hide this command window without disturbing its process..i tried to use the createprocess but it seems to not work.

2414658
x86	64bit
10.6 x86 64bit dmg archive

2414669
allocator	stl
stl implementation differ on every platform so exposing stl in library will have risk for example if you expose std map on your library since you can not export std map from your library your library will be forced to use std map implementation from your library users the one that load your lib this will cause some incompatibility such as different version of stl implementation different stl allocator class and some platform specific issues

2414672
cells	tablecell
when i try to use the getttribute id method on a tablecell object that i get from iterating through a tables rows cells it returns undefined

2414699
google-chrome	safari
this worked great until i cleared my cache and found a funky behavior in google-chrome and safari

2414708
gif	png	gif	ico	gif	bmp	bmp	png	png	ico
if you have a byte array that represents a file that wpf can decode bmp jpg gif png tif ico you can do the following

2414737
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
so my launchconditions will never fire on uninstall and will correctly detect which versioning if any is being upgrade from

2414746
affinity	processors
you can get better accuracy by running you timer pooling routine inside a separate thread and set that thread affinity to one core processors and set the thread priority the highest you can get

2414791
opensuse	linux
on a relatively modern linux opensuse 11.1 the default is 32 768 processes

2414791
children	parent
if the parent processes does not reap it s children you ll need to kill the parent process so that init can reap the zombies

2414807
versioning	upgrade
since snow leopard has upgrade to python 2.6 the framework now contains versioning for 2.4 2.5 and 2.6

2414812
google-chrome	firefox
i love vi and i m looking for a plugin of some sort that would allow me to input text in my browser preferably firefox or google-chrome using vi commands

2414824
yacc	bison
here are some reasons i could think of for using lex yacc or flex bison

2414824
yacc	bison
the developer is already familiar with lex yacc or flex bison

2414841
affinity	processors
in the rare cases where you absolutely need to be sure that it never happens then locking your threads down by setting the processors affinity mask is the only option

2414880
post	get
for post params you would need to do something else obviously but to get them to jqgrid it s the same idea

2414930
apache	nginx
static media on the site is served by nginx server while the site itself runs on top of apache just in case if this information is required

2414935
interpolation	splines
it contains various interpolation methods including barycentric approaches and splines

2414935
interpolation	splines
but as the saying goes there are lies damn lies and bicubic splines interpolation

2414940
width	height
i m going to go against the grain here and state that the principle of separating content from layout which would justify the answers that suggest using css does not always apply to image height and width

2414940
width	height
each image has an innate original height and width that can be derived from the image data

2414940
width	height
in the framework of content vs layout i would say that this derived height and width information is content not layout and should therefore be rendered as html as element attributes

2414940
width	height
at the least the aspect ratio could prove useful image has a width of 15 and a height of 200

2414940
width	height
the spec says that the width and height attributes can also be used to override the height and width conveyed in the actual image file

2414940
width	height
to override height and width i believe css inline embedded or external is the best approach

2414940
width	height
i think ideally the original height and width would always be specified as html element attributes while styling information should optionally be conveyed in css

2415002
width	height
by default cgrect instance variables are set to cgrectzero but remember that this is just a normal cgrect struct at location 0 0 with 0 width and 0 height

2415009
put	get
instead google allows you to put custom attributes inside your html which can then be retrieved from the xml you get back from google custom search results api

2415020
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
suppose user starts installation and if already older versioning is available on same machine then we should promp user to upgrade the versioning and needs to show list of files which are new in this versioning

2415021
kde	gnome
there is also a free software library called poppler which is used by the pdf viewers of gnome and kde

2415056
trie	tree
searching with a trie suffix tree is fast -- but building the trie to start with is considerably slower

2415056
trie	tree
that means a linear search will almost always be substantially more efficient overall than a trie or suffix tree

2415113
children	parent
at the top of your module class just use an imports and all parent and children will use this namespace

2415121
actualheight	rowdefinition
unlike frameworkelement which does define actualheight as a dependency property rowdefinition doesn t derive from frameworkelement and just defines actualheight as a normal property with no change event

2415134
width	height
3 the height has been zoomed an identical amount to the width

2415134
width	height
img id test src alt map test usemap #maptest width 800 height 800

2415148
lxml	beautifulsoup
either accept the need to loop not through every tag in general but through all with a given tag name or upgrade to a richer interface such as beautifulsoup or lxml

2415194
pull	push
if you and bob are working on a project and you re not always going to be able to push pull from each other s personal machines or you work in a company that wants a place for the latest clean trunk then a shared server with a no-trees repository is your answer

2415200
inline	inlining
with normal inlining all kinds of effects on register usage local variables etc are there that the compiler cannot do with inline assembly

2415220
int	chars
scanner.nextint catches the first int occurrence and nothing else so it doesn t handle the new line chars which scanner.readline will see as its input

2415228
int	double
if the number of digits is 16 normal precision of double convert that int into floating point directly and return

2415238
bazaar	git
this type of flexibility is what draws me to bazaar despite the fact that git is wildly more popular and faster

2415280
google-chrome	firefox
i tried to use css to give a style to the page but there were lots of problems to keep the page aligned between different browsers and i tested only internet explorer firefox and google-chrome

2415287
cakephp	yii	codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	yii
you should be able to solve this using cakephp symfony codeigniter yii zend or any other framework so it is better to do some real testing

2415287
codeigniter	yii
you might also consider footprint and execution time and find a framework that performes well and is not too cpu heavy read yii or codeigniter for instance

2415310
rss	feed
a i want to be able to support password protection of my rss feed through the following authentication methods

2415310
kerberos	ntlm
integrated windows ntlm kerberos

2415310
rss	feed
reading over the rss 2.0 specification i saw nothing related to security so i assume that security implemented for the rss feed is handled on one end by the web server handling the http request for the rss feed and on the other end by the client requesting access to the rss feed

2415310
rss	feed
i m curious to know how or if sites like userland or asp.net weblogs offer password protected rss feed and on the other side of the fence how are rss aggregators like newsgator newzcrawler sharpreader etc

2415362
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to work in firefox 3 and in google-chrome with both get and getjson

2415387
jobs	cron
it is quite common that cron backup jobs etc run and hit your server and the team has forotten why those were set up in the first place

2415396
bazaar	git
minscm an abstract front-end for mercurial git bazaar from takeshi nishida

2415415
mouseover	mouseout
edit the main problem now is that the second bigger menu social_menu that is shown on top of the smaller mouseover triggering element share_words only closes when you mouseout the smaller trigger element even though this element is hidden

2415420
google-chrome	safari
the color animations doesn t wokr on webkit safari google-chrome

2415420
google-chrome	safari
and you will be find a is not run and b is ok in safari and google-chrome

2415442
uiview	uiwindow
i had a uiwindow in which i placed an opengles uiview

2415451
filesystems	fat
fat filesystems and network filesystems will have their own ordering or no ordering - the files might just be in the directory in whatever order they happened to be created - i think fat systems are like that

2415473
stdout	stderr
a simple redirects stdout to stderr will clear things up and give that instant aha

2415497
appkit	nsimage
uikit iphone defines uiimage and appkit mac os x defines nsimage you use the one for the platform you are targeting

2415504
pascal	delphi
some languages have direct support for that in delphi pascal for example you can do that like that

2415526
post	get
it serves content on top of http protocol webdav uses http and adds special methods to standard post and get and word is webdav client

2415544
hide	show
i probably don t want method level security because i want to use spring taglibs to selectively show hide menu items however there should be way to prohibit unauthorized user to access a page directly through url

2415551
unsigned	short
additionally i m not fully seeing the use of the unsigned short if you are planning on writing a binary file consider that the unsigned char type is generally of size byte making it very convenient for that purpose

2415567
opera	firefox
firefox and opera will download an equivalent data set in 40 seconds

2415567
opera	firefox
firefox and opera are probably using between 4 and 8 connections to download all of the files

2415628
post	get
in get or post requests though utf-8 encoding is obviously expected which the standard urllib.urlencode function does not process correctly throws exceptions

2415641
width	font-size
though if you know the font size in pixels you can get a rough estimate of how many characters is visible by dividing the pixel width with the pixel font-size

2415641
width	height
beware that this may vary depending on the font s character height with ratio and that some browsers will return the width either including or excluding the scrollbar if present

2415692
doc	rtf
take a look at this article on code project it shows how to convert a doc to rtf using c# you should be able to adapt this to convert to text

2415742
integer	unsigned
they both say they are of type struct system.byte and represent an 8-digit unsigned integer

2415778
cldc	midp
this device has midp 2.0 and cldc 1.1 support also jsr75 which i need in order to save files

2415778
cldc	midp
one of them the defaultcldcjtwiphone2 from the java me sdk 3.0 also claims midp 2.0 and cldc 1.1 support

2415778
cldc	midp
when i look at the midp 2.0 jsr118 api i can clearly see all of these methods being present with the since tag being either midp 2.0 or cldc 1.1

2415824
google-chrome	safari
safari ie and google-chrome doesn t support the onclick event in the tag

2415850

2415852
innodb	myisam
iam using mysql database with myisam innodb

2415949
public	protected
should be public protected virtual

2416043
button	checkbox
except that when you mouse over the individual checkbox and button and various components they all fidget slightly

2416172
move	drag
when i drag to the right the item move underneath the other items

2416184
src	attr
you have to make it a jquerby object to access attr src

2416214
width	height
another point which comes to my mind is that you create windows with dimension 0 - no width or height

2416233
pull	push
i have some ideas for reworking the internals of xml calabash to use more of the push pull streaming features of saxon but there are a lot of other things on my todo list too -

2416284
hide	show
i can t disable it completely because the user sometimes needs to access the start menu or may like to manually show or hide the sip

2416314
bmp	pcx
what is the code in c to display a picture file like jpeg file or bmp file or pcx file

2416365
audiotrack	audiorecord
it uses audiorecord and audiotrack to record pcm audio from the mic and play pcm audio out the earpiece

2416365
audiotrack	audiorecord
so as you can see in the creation of the audiotrack and audiorecord the encoding is supplied via the audioformat but this only allows 16 bit or 8 bit pcm

2416365
audiotrack	audiorecord
i have my own g711 codec implementation now and i want to be able to encode the audio from the mic and decode it going into the earpiece so i have encode short lin int offset byte enc int frames and decode byte enc short lin int frames methods but i m unsure as to how to use them to encode and the decode the audio from the audiorecord and audiotrack

2416378
pop-up	dialog
getting the session key from the cookie after the facebook connect dialog pop-up and the user logs in

2416430
for-loop	loops
the for-loop was chaged to a while loops and the code brought inside the while

2416434
submit	submission
this was to avoid multiple submit for same requests - hence we used the common html submission approach of token generation where with every response carries with itself a new token and the client has to sent it back to the server for executing the next request

2416434
mouse	keyboard
in this case we disabled the session expiration on the server and wrote custom code to handle events - keyboard and mouse on the flex client

2416497
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
this code was adapted from here i didn t need the various doctypes identification as i m only dealing with images however the image type could be any number of things - jpg bmp gif png etc

2416504
post	get
in both get and post responses the content-type is application json

2416586
mouse	keyboard
the quizzes can be attempted using only the mouse so i need the keyboard to be completed disabled for the period of the quiz

2416594
width	height
use overflow hidden in combination with the desired width height

2416599
width	height
declare a width and height and then use the overflow property

2416680
pull	push
most of the time some push pull clone dance manage to solve it

2416715
ubuntu	linux
my language at the moment is java on gnu linux ubuntu so i know about the robot class

2416779
put	get	post	put	post	get
also you could try to use http put or something other than get or post because normal browsers don t do that

2416790
onmousedown	onfocus
i ve spent quite a while trying to resolve this issue and found a simple work-around for ie8 - just use onmousedown rather than onfocus

2416816
put	get
here s a function that i wrote to get the clip id s in a string input and put them into an array which you can the insert into your embedded object

2416870
rsa	dsa
then it was switching to different authentication mechanism at first it was trying dsa instead of rsa and then it was prompting for a password

2416881
tunnel	vpn
if you have no clue about security the simplest solution might be to set up a secure tunnel using a vpn or ssh and send your messages using that

2416893
getter	setter
finally unless your setter method has to do something special you should consider using synthesize to have your setter getter automatically generated

2416937
lxml	html5lib
the best modules for this task are lxml or html5lib

2416974
post	get
and get all blogcomments for each post that has a state of published

2417033
google-chrome	firefox
once the firefox plugin is installed google-chrome also plays the files correctly but i doubt that the average user would ever think to do this

2417051
nsmanagedobjectcontext	nsmanagedobjectmodel
sounds like you are creating two different core data stacks nsmanagedobjectcontext nsmanagedobjectmodel and nspersistentstorecoordinator

2417089
serializable	deserialization
you need a binary serializable to preserve objects identity during the serializable deserialization step

2417114
mp3	speex
i m also looking to encode the audio to mp3 before upload and have seen some references to speex

2417181
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
depending on implementation resize events can be sent continuously as the resizing is in progress the typical behavior in internet explorer and webkit-based browsers such as safari and google-chrome or only once at the end of the resize operation the typical behavior in firefox

2417210
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	centos	opensuse	centos
may be stick with the most popular ubuntu fedora opensuse slackware centos rhe

2417210
vmware	virtualbox
you can use virtualbox or vmware and freely available virtual machines to test other distros instead of having 5+ separate partitions

2417218
filtering	grouping
however just remember where filtering the entire pool of rows first grouping by combines those remaining rows and having filtering those grouping

2417218
filtering	grouping
having filtering grouping

2417357
int	double
and to answer your question - yes you can crate data types but they can t be primitive types like int double etc

2417399
postgresql	mysql
so it doesn t matter if i use the pdo driver once for mysql and once for postgresql it will still return the table structure

2417425
int	double
but point object s x and y values are int i need position in float or double

2417456
int	double
from int you should be able to cast to double or float without any problems

2417480
firefox	safari
for safari and firefox it works fine when the user clicks a link or refreshes the page

2417544
firefox	safari
when i run the app in debug mode my safari or firefox becomes irresponsive i can t even switch to them

2417559
sudo	passwd
you also need to allow apache to sudo without a passwd as you have no way of entering the passwd through php

2417563
hash	md5
i m creating my own rss reader and to see which rss items were already downloaded i m converting the links of each item to md5 hash

2417563
hash	md5	rss	feed
when an rss feed is loaded it adds all the items to a listview object and then checks the md5 hash against a text file and removes the ones that already exist

2417563
hash	md5
now this works right now because i have only 5 feeds and each feed only loads about 10 items but in terms of longterm use the textfile would become cluttered with very old md5 hash

2417563
hash	md5
i m wondering if an sqlite database would be better to do such a thing such as storing the feed link the md5 hash and the date

2417601
hash	md5
you could use a database for this or even a flat cache file in xml or something. you could then serialise de-serialise an array of your md5 hash dates etc remove any from the array you don t need any more then serialise the array back to your cache file again

2417609
rss	feed
why not use the updated field in the rss this way what you need to save is the latest fetch date a compare it to the feed updated date

2417628
post	get
you ll get a signal when the request completes which you should use to post an xwindows message and wake up your event processing loop

2417651
put	get
of course to get this to work you ll have to put in all the code for tabhosts to work

2417778
folder	directory
your routing probably works fine for the root directory of your site and content folder

2417833
superclass	subclassing
in addition all my classes subclassing a general superclass which implements among others the method help that calls doc class obj which allows me to bring up the help from every instance of the class

2417845
folder	directory
if you do not see your folder in that final list it is because there is no virtual directory pointing to the my documents folder that contains your web site and home page.

2417859
typedef	typename
typedef typename tb btype typeb

2417859
typedef	typename
typedef typename ta atype typea

2417905
folder	directory
i ve figured out that typing git clone git gist.github.com 285330.git gist-285330 will copy the latest files from the gist into the local directory gist-285330 as well as creating the .git folder with all the previous version information

2417947
post	get
the internal logic determines which collection to look at based on whether the request is a get or a post

2417947
post	get
post requests to get the desired

2417973
typedef	struct
i think that since you are typedef ing tb btype the compiler would need to know the type struct myb which it doesn t you only forward declared it

2417973
typedef	struct
you can check this in fact if you comment out the reference to ta atype in struct b you still get the same error while if you comment out the typedef typeb in struct a the compiler doesn t complain

2418009
post	get
the post page uses an api to get the result back from google

2418058
google-chrome	firefox
so far i ve tried this in both firefox and google-chrome with no success

2418086
width	height
i want the size of this new window to change depending on the height and width of the video that is being played

2418093
put	get
we give an empty set to it so that as a result we get a set with elements fillset has put in it

2418097
children	parent
setting anything to 100 makes it fit the parent container not the children

2418097
children	parent
i m pretty sure that the problem exists above your viewstack though in the parent children relationship not necessarily in the code order

2418101
post	get
but basically yeah have a page on your site that when it gets a post get variable it makes an http request to google containing at least your search term and your api key it then receives a load of xml in return which it then formats and returns on the page

2418114
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i m having trouble getting jquery to load in ie7 works fine in all other browsers firefox safari opera ie8 just not in ie7

2418120
g++	gcc
short answer the error happens because you compile c++ code with the gcc driver instead of g++

2418126
min	max
similarly apply to things like min max avg etc

implements	sealed
let s say taskargument is abstract and task implements a method onentertask taskargument args and is sealed for some special behavior of the existing system which is out of scope

2418240
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
note i m only enquiring about firefox safari google-chrome in this sample

2418281
submit	submission
form submission requires post-back once you submit the first form your page is redirected to the action of that form and you will lose the information in the rest of the forms you have

2418338
kohana	yii
i am going to use kohana or yii still doing feasible test at the moment

2418342
firefox	safari
safari firefox etc internet explorer will render css differently from other browsers so you should be aware and test for this during development

2418353
width	height
how can i get the width and height of the body with javascript so that i can resize the window size dynamically based on the amount of contents of the page

2418379
gridview	rowdatabound
this table i later assign as datasource to a gridview and on rowdatabound i assign the value of each cell

2418451
migrate	downgrade
but with the microsoft data access technologies data set linq2sql entity framework i don t know a way to automate things like migrate or downgrade a database schema with data migration

2418512
invokerequired	begininvoke
for thread-safe updates back to the ui use the invokerequired and invoke begininvoke members on the winforms controls

2418557
post	get
if i m trying to post a message or check my bank balance or get movie ratings i don t want to be fiddling around with colors and fonts

2418583
matplotlib	scipy
i have installed numpy1.3 scipy 0.7.1 matplotlib 0.99.1.1 and python 2.5

2418619
integer	unsigned
10u 10u is explicitly an unsigned integer

2418624
sikuli	eggplant
however you may be able to try automation tools like citratest or eggplant or sikuli which are image-based rather than object-based

2418635
int	chars
int -123 chars c strings str etc

2418638
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
the viewwillappear and viewdidappear methods give subclasses a chance to perform any additional actions related to the appearance of the view

2418687
min	max
min max and somewhere between min and max

2418687
min	max
and where appropriate two extremes below min and above max

2418687
min	max
there are obvious exceptions some code may not have a min or max for example but i ve found that unit testing for these events is a good start and captures a majority of common issues with the code

2418693
hide	show
this event handler then hide panel1 and show panel2

2418693
hide	show
in usercontrol1 there is button user clicks this which raises event in aspx page this is supposed to hide panel1 and show panel2

2418703
spaces	delimiter
the downside to the second is that all other whitespace characters spaces tabs etc between the string delimiter are part of the string which makes it awkward to keep your code looking neat

2418735
teamcity	luntbuild
if they don t pass the joel test they re clueless enough to not be able to micromanage you so you should have the flexibility to automate your build using teamcity or luntbuild if the re isn t any money in the contract for tools

2418746
int	double
in addition to the previous comments about suffixes and gcc c99 mode if you can t get long long to work and you only need int up to 2 52 you can get away with using double

2418746
int	double
int up to 2 52 should be exactly representable as double assuming an ieee double precision format 0 +1 bias exponent

2418750
touchesmoved	touchesended
but text should take the touchesmoved and sprite should take touchesended

2418795
soappy	suds	soaplib	soappy	soaplib	suds
after trying a few different librairies suds soaplib i finally dug into the soappy code

2418819
caliburn	prism
currently i read up a lot about silverlight prism and caliburn which seem to get me this functionality - at a price

2418832
post	get
the application has numerous controllers containing get and post request methods which are marked with requestmapping annotations like this

2418928
maven	pom.xml
maven has a nice utility to create eclipse project files and there s a plugin to manage the pom.xml file in eclipse

2418989
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
strictly speaking unchecked-exception will always extend runtimeexception whereas checked exceptions do not

2419016
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
the unchecked-exception classes are the class runtimeexception and its subclasses and the class error and its subclasses

2419058
cpu	processors
these daysâ memory band-width and usage of the processors cache is as match of a problem is cpu time

2419066
maven	pom.xml
maven doesn t have any knowledge of things that are not declared in the pom.xml so yes you have to declare smartgwt in the pom.xml

2419066
maven	pom.xml
actually the common way to work with maven and ides is to add things in the pom.xml and to generate or derive things at the ide level from the pom.xml

2419088
apache	nginx
files and is readily available on most servers or reverse proxies apache s mod_deflate nginx s nginxhttpgzipmodule etc. and all modern browsers you can instruct both apache and nginx to skip compression for specific browsers based on user-agent .

2419115
spoofing	traffic
spoofing of traffic is a serious problem for other google services such as adwords

2419152
width	height
you ve seen the official answer above but i would urge you to think more about why you would use width and height attributes in some instances and css in others

2419152
width	height
therefore you should normally use the width height attributes on images

2419155
ssl	https
whether that works for you or not depends on why you need ssl with stunnel your client webbrowser will think it s https but asp.net cassini won t

2419217
floating-point	integer
back then when we worried more about integer vs floating-point performance the dhrystone test was popular

2419232
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
catching an illegalargumentexception to rethrow another runtimeexception with a clearer message might look like a good idea but it is not

2419237
implements	extends
given that statusnet implements an api very similar to twitter i could probably modify extends twitterizer to do just that

2419243
memset	calloc	memset	malloc	calloc	malloc
the latter actually is one of the reasons the calloc function exists on some platforms it can be implemented significantly more efficiently than a mere malloc followed by a memset to zero

2419274
g++	gcc
in that case it sounds like your gdb is out of date compared to your gcc g++ version

2419309
post	put
so far i understand this small code to post only one particular category one a page when put infront of the loop

2419339
hide	show
i have tried programmatically hiding one and showing the other with hide and show but the problem is that the hidden widget occupies space in my qgraphicslinearlayout even when it s hidden leaving an empty gap

2419339
qstackedwidget	qgraphicswidget	qstackedwidget	qgraphicsscene	qstackedwidget	qwidget	qgraphicsscene	qgraphicswidget	qgraphicsscene	qwidget
however i am working with a qgraphicsscene and so my widgets don t inherit from qwidget but rather qgraphicswidget so i can t add them to a qstackedwidget

2419393
getter	setter
it then has getter methods to expose these values but no setter methods. the stockmarketdata class is basically a holder for stock market data values

2419422
accessor	properties
the controlitems properties has internal set and public get accessor and is of type

2419422
accessor	properties
the thing is that i am getting build errors that say this is not possible because my controlitems properties does not have an accessable set accessor

2419445
move	drag
for instance having the widget move only in one axis or have the widget move double the distance between the cursor and the drag starting point

2419465
caliburn	prism
with silverlight and the frameworks that are available prism caliburn etc you can produce incredibly flexible and scalable uis so that gets a big thumbs up from me

2419475
rtl	vhdl
first the vhdl is analyzed in order to detect rtl templates consisting in rtl elements flip-flops arithmetic expressions multiplexers control logic

2419485
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
you can also provide distribution specific installers like a rpm on redhat or centos or deb for debian ubuntu although once you have the makefile spitted by autotools making these is a breeze

2419498
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
even looked right in address bars across all browsers i tested with safari google-chrome and firefox all on mac and i have no idea what browser my girlfriend was using on windows

2419549
width	height
but only to fit the image to the width and height of the browserâ s viewport since you cannot size a background image yet

2419549
firefox	safari	webkit	gecko	opera	safari	opera	firefox
css 3 specifies a background-size property but its support is still proprietary using the vendor specific prefix like -khtml- konqueror -moz- gecko based browsers like firefox -o- opera and -webkit- webkit based browsers like safari

2419588
post	get
sorry if there is way too much info in this post â thereâ s a load of story before i get to the actual problem

2419592
draggable	droppable
i want to call a function only when the draggable div is dropped perfectly onto a droppable div

2419663
getter	setter
under source menu generate getter and setter

2419675
touchesbegan	touchesended
i have it doing a nslog on touchesbegan and touchesended and it s doing both correctly

2419675
touchesbegan	touchesended
i m worried touchesbegan and touchesended cannot cause a scroll

2419712
hide	show
then you your user click the edit button you hide your textbox and show your combobox with its visible property set to true

2419715
subtract	add
in fact with the above gltranslate changed to add a single integer to a global variable and when leaving subtract it again and the below defined gltranslatee i did a test

2419738
firefox	safari
edit this is what my code looks like this works fine in ie8 firefox and safari but in ie7 uploadify doesn t show the image that replaces the file upload input dom element

2419769
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
try in different kinds of browsers to exclude the one and other ie6 7 8 firefox safari google-chrome etc

2419771
min	max
diving into the bowels of the container code via reflector it was setting the min max size values for my control that was being reparented

2419771
min	max
i had assumed inaccurately that the default min max settings were left as the default from the designer

2419794
hash	md5
you could use a md5 hash on both files and compare them that way

2419835
subtract	add
if you want to be really clever you can start looking at what level of braces you re in and make sure it s a top level one go to the start of the file add 1 every time you see and subtract one every time you see etc

2419875
disk	ram
if you are running code on a standard machine with hard disk drive hdd and your program resides on the hdd then the time to copy the data from data section of your binary image to ram is essentially the same amount of time as using some type of run-time initialization

2419880
public	protected
one of the rulesets i believe from stylecop enforces putting public functions first then protected static then protected then private static and finally private

2419880
public	protected
what is stylecop s reasoning for wanting the public protected private ordering

2419909
folder	directory
there you have the field additional python import directory where you can add the django folder actually the folder that contains the django folder

2419913
listview	gridview
the error is because the gridview is being applied to more than one listview

2419915
prepare	execute
information 0x40043006 at import data to table01 dts.pipeline prepare for execute phase is beginning

2419935
public	protected
by visibility public methods internal methods protected methods ...

2420072
memcpy	memmove
using memcpy memmove should work fine on that kind of data

2420079
firefox	safari
it worked in safari but not in firefox this cuts out too many customers for the website i m designing for

2420079
firefox	safari
it does work in safari - just not in firefox or camino

2420080
pygobject	gio
you will need to use gio via pygobject in order to retrieve the file

2420097
memcpy	malloc
as soon as you have a valid variable in your hand allocated by new malloc or on the stack it is just a pointer to memory hence memcpy and other functions from this family will work as expected

2420111
client-side	server-side
first of all you have to decide if you need both client-side and server-side functionality for your control

2420111
client-side	server-side
they will allow you to create a custom server-side control and extend that control to include some client-side functionality

2420111
onmouseover	onclick
first of all avoid binding events from inside scripts use onclick onmouseover etc

2420154
super	implements
i think it s super lame to implements two command handlers and it certainly won t scale well if you have to add more email sources

2420168
cifs	smb
terms to google for are python smb cifs

2420190
put	get
i appreciate the technical side of reformatting but i am pointing out that there is risk involved in anything non-trivial and unless you put the right person on it it might get mucked up

2420218
hash	md5
take a hash md5 should be good enough of the build before and after the reformatting - if it s the same for every file that clearly means it can t have altered behaviour

2420225
spaces	linefeed
since compiling would ignore the spaces tabs linefeed etc. then the compiled version should be identical to the original and that would prove to those semi-technical managers that all is well

2420248
getter	setter
it seems that part of the problem is that an rdbms resolves what object you are referring to based on a simple case insensitive string-based name in a language like java typing is more complicated than this you cannot refer to a property if the getter setter field are not a member of the class loaded at runtime so you essentially need to have 2 versions of your code in the same script hmm custom classloaders sound like a pain have the new version of your class stored belong to another package sounds messy or use the version x+1 x+2 strategy i mentioned requires a lot more planning

2420252
memcpy	memmove
i would still use vector with std copy but that doesn t mean new memcpy memmove is bad

2420303
post	get
while i m not sure this is a proper question for stackoverflow i ll post a couple links to get you started towards solving the problem

2420319
width	height
i also tried replacing the rendertransform with just scaling the image by itself using the height and width properties but it made no difference

2420337
implements	extends
if you absolutely need to use a hashmap then i would create a class that extends hashmap and implements comparable

2420366
mouseup	mousedown
as an aside if you were simulating a double click you would need to set the click state to 2 for both the mousedown and mouseup events of the second click.

2420377
getdate	dateadd
the number of weeks generated can be changed by altering only one digit the 3 in select dateadd week -3 getdate as starting_date

2420402
hide	show
and use the show hide methods.

2420477
post	get
once i get around to reinstalling i will post the result back here

2420488
width	height
you should use the width and height of the view not the canvas both available via getwidth and getheight

2420494
rss	feed
i created an iphone app that gets rss feed from my youtube channel my blog and my twitter

2420550
post	put
it seems like the jquery is aborted midway as any alerts i put in the post or ajax callback functions are being ignored

2420551
int	chars
that is int chars varchar decimal etc

2420601
mouse	keyboard
create the xna objects related to keyboard mouse gamepads in the main

2420632
put	get
actioncontroller methodnotallowed only get put and delete requests are allowed

2420653
portrait	landscape
for handsets with qwerty and touch screens the qwerty keyboard is exposed when it is slid out and the screen changes to landscape mode from portrait

2420653
width	height
so you can detect the sizechanged width height call detect that handset went into landscape mode and then handle it

2420653
portrait	landscape
handle portrait landscape changes

2420694
operands	decrement
even more important since it results in undefined behavior not just unspecified behavior is that you generally can t use an operands to the increment decrement operators more than once in an expression

2420716
vim	emacs
alternatively if you use the vim or emacs xemacs editors they have cscope support built-in

2420716
vim	emacs
i m not familiar with how the emacs integration works but in vim it works pretty much like a regular tag-stack in that you can jump to symbol and then pop back to a previous symbol

2420739
post	get
this will force it to do a post back and will get your second panel to show up

2420779
post	get
as mentioned previously out of the box there is only support for get and post

2420779
put	get
at first glance it appears that you can use the proxy config in livecycle data services or blaze to get support for put and delete

2420796
mouseup	mousedown
one thing you should also do is set the click count properly on both the mousedown and mouseup events like so

2420820
put	get
either you can live with slightly off colors affected by the nearly transparent invisible layer or upon getting a click you must remove the layer get the correct pixel color and put again a nearly transparent layer

2420835
cvs	svn
the most senior developer here reformatted all the code base when he migrated it from cvs to svn and he had to perform some tests to make sure it would work all the way from start to end and now we have hooks to ensure that checked-in code is properly formatted

2420864
children	parent
in this case i don t add the child to the parent s children collection i just set the parent on the child object

2420868
subtraction	multiplication
there are various methods - i would suggest newton-raphson which is simple and fast and uses only multiplication and subtraction

2420868
subtract	add	division	subtract	division	multiplication
if multiplication is not allowed then there also seem to be plenty of integer division algorithms which just use shifts bitwise operations and add subtract first hit on google www.bearcave.com software divide.htm

2420896
inherited	properties
the system.web.mvc.viewpage class is the class that your default asp.net mvc views inherited from so you have access to the html properties in your views

2420902
cck	pathauto
i have done some reading on drupal custom content types and cck views and pathauto

2420902
put	get
however i have not been able to get a clear picture of how to put it all together to accomplish what i am attempting

2420967
google-chrome	firefox
i have this html5 code with a mp4 for google-chrome working an ogg for firefox failing and the same ogg via a java applet for internet explorer working

2420992
filtering	grouping
all i had to do was to specify an appender per application grouping and inside each appender i would have a filtering chain

2421015
post	get
i suggest that you post your code here to get some more helpful responses

2421045
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the easiest way is to force the user to install the internet explorer version of flash note installing in firefox google-chrome or safari will not work as they do not use the ocx version of flash

2421056
opera	firefox
my site displays just like in need in ie and opera but in firefox i can t get via css to have font sizes smaller than firefox default minimum-font-size

2421066
hide	show
the jqtouch demo helpfully show how to show an install this message for users not using full screen mode and hide it for those who are

2421066
put	get
and yet i can t find any other trace of it when i put this alert to test things after the document has loaded i get nothing when launching in fullscreen mode

2421067
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this works in ie firefox safari desktop versions win mac google-chrome opera

2421144
children	parent
you don t have to add the child to the parent s children collection to get nh to persist it because it s marked as the inverse side of the relationship

2421144
children	parent
if you set the parent on the child flush the session and re-load the parent in a new session then the children collection should contain the child assuming 2nd level cache doesn t come into play

2421165
realloc	malloc
and it returns a std string so you would have to use malloc realloc to handle that

2421218
firefox	safari
in the browsers i ve tried firefox 3.5.8 and safari 4.0.4 no object has a checkvalidity method so i can t run the validations even though i can define them

2421246
min	max
the validation of numbers even takes into account the min and max attributes so opera will not let you submit the form if you enter a number that is too large

2421286
firefox	safari
for some reason i cant access the function in safari or firefox

2421296
post	get
what i am trying to is when another service call post to a get with say 5 parameters

2421316
folder	directory
several top level directory are gone and their content folder and files just spread out in the list

2421318
width	height
the buttons view should have a fixed height but stretch width wise

2421318
width	height
buttonview resizes width but not height and is locked top left

2421375
n-gram	words
second the reason i got into the n-gram approach is that i don t want to limit the words count n to a specific length

2421375
minimum	max
the only problem with this example is that you have to specify the minimum word pattern length and i want it to be dynamic from 2 to max found

2421402
filesystems	fat
and fat is a simple enough filesystems that you can crawl through it with nothing but a hex editor and some patience

2421413
profiling	instrumentation
profiling your app with instrumentation and use the core animation instrumentation

2421420
try-catch	exception-handling
i d encourage you to expand upon this by implementing a try-catch and handling exception-handling

2421422
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine for me in ie firefox and google-chrome

2421441
aggregate-functions	sum
this is because when we group by two columns it is saying group them so that all of those with the same subject and semester are in the same group and then calculate all the aggregate-functions count sum average etc. for each of those groups

2421453
mergesort	heapsort	quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort
you do not implement your own sorting algorithm if quicksort mergesort and heapsort is available

2421457
post	get
maxpostsize defines how big a post can get before tomcat will automatically parse it whatever that means

2421473
firefox	safari
this works in firefox i can t vouch for safari

2421504
width	height
sandy www.myspace.com sandy -- should be the url webpage in specified height and width

2421504
width	height
mandy www.myspace.com mandy -- should be the url webpage in specified height and width

2421558
folder	directory
if you don t specify the folder explicitly the system will look in the current working directory for the process

2421562
width	height
either the width height got messed up as you encountered or transparency didn t work well or the floats got mad or there were browser inconstenties or they shipped with gifs or the documentation support was poor

2421590
public	protected
... if a class is declared to be a base class for another class using the private access specifier the public and protected members of the base class are accessible as private members of the derived class

2421595
pop-up	dialog
if user presses the button a js dialog box will pop-up asking user to confirm the deletion

2421618
int	boolean
type one of string int hexcolor boolean

2421690
jar	war	maven	pom.xml
i ve been using the same approach as jens on a number of projects both with maven 2.2.1 and now with maven 3.0-alpha-6 pom.xml modules define the module structure of your project tree jar war modules are the leaves of the tree

2421693
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
in this case argumentnullexception is thrown because an argument is null and argumentexception is thrown because the contents of the enumeration are not directly a parameter of the function so what you can say is that the argument is invalid but it is not because it i null or is out of range

2421777
maven	m2e
m2e does not run any maven goals

2421784
children	parent
say there s an animal type as parent and cat dog and bird as children

2421838
int	double
but later it discovers that it is actually a void prn double int

2421851
mouseup	mousedown
the display is safe to move to mouseup instead of mousedown

2421909
opera	google-chrome
here s a link to a sandbox where you can see opera and google-chrome in action

2421941
onresume	onpause
the best solution i can think of is to flip a boolean on off whenever onresume or onpause is called in all my activities but this seems like a lot of footwork

2421954
width	height
width and height meet minimum thresholds

2421980
post	get
i wrote something similar a while ago to get images from scraped blog post

2422021
int	chars
the int chars for r is 10

2422022
move	drag
in the iphone or android if you have a jquery slider it doesn t quite work touchscreen will move the screen instead of drag the slider.

2422059
qstackedwidget	qgraphicswidget
with a little work you could even make it generic enough to be used as a qgraphicswidget version of qstackedwidget

2422086
int	chars
also you want c to be of type int not chars

2422088
scrollable	panels
appending multiple grids to a single scrollable panels is the right way to do it unless you want to break them off into individual tabs

2422159
opera	firefox
ie8 firefox opera

2422159
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari

2422160
width	height
i went through the debugger and searchicon is showing the width and height to be -1

2422168
pull	push
i currently have a pull mechanism where every one minute or so clients query one row in db to understand if cache is still good if changed they sync everything but i want to change this mechanism to push based

2422180
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
for instance it will know to use apt-get install libncurses5-dev if using debian ubuntu yum install libncurses-devel if using rhel fedora centos

2422180
bash	zsh
work on any shell bash dash zsh pdksh busybox ash etc

2422199
onresume	onpause
so register a callback supplied by the activity with the service in onresume and unregister it in onpause

2422199
onresume	onpause
you could accomplish the same thing with a broadcast intent register unregister the receiver in the activity in onresume onpause if you wanted

2422291
rar	zip
archive 7z rar zip etc

2422291
flac	ogg	wav	flac	wav	ogg
sound most such as m4a flac ogg but not wav

2422304
fflush	gets
however if if the order was modified before the second query is executed the order will get fflush assuming auto-flush mode and read-write transaction right before the second query gets executed and this will trigger a staleobjectstateexception

2422309
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox you can use css

2422339
nunit	mstest
roy osherove just wrote a recent blog post summarizing the differences between nunit and mstest

2422339
nunit	mstest
he concludes that nunit wins for unit testing but mstest has much better abilities for integration based testing and team testing with team system

2425977

when you use addclass it adds appends a class unless you remove some first using removeclass so you do like this

2427069
inherited	properties
i have a class that inherited from ienumrable whose count properties is reporting 0 zero elements but the for each loop steps into the loop body and tries to use the variable where it should just be moving on

2427139
hash	md5
i agree with david in that using a md5 hash is a good and simple way to accomplish what you want

2427154
hide	show
instead of hiding all rows and then showing one row put some logic in the loop so that you hide or show each row depending on the id

2427219
translation	localization
it searches for and returns a localization or translation of the string it is given

2427221
jar	war	entities	entitymanager
we have a very comfortable setup using jpa through spring hibernate where we attach a persistenceunitpostprocessor to our entitymanager factory and this post processor takes a list of project names scans the classpath for jars that contain that name and adds those jar files for scanning for entities to the persistence unit this is much more convenient than specifying in persistence.xml since it can take partial names and we added facilities for detecting the different classpath configurations when we are running in a war a unit test an ear etc

2427230
expression-blend	silverlight
the answer to this is to install expression-blend 2 as that still supports silverlight 1.0

2427247
post	get
i have just seen several examples of code in asp.net and asp.net mvc for admin like pages that use get instead of post

2427271
codeigniter	cakephp
optional build something using an mvc framework for php like cakephp or codeigniter

2427275
post	get
get and post are very very similar except for the fact that gets have a limit on the length of the http action because they are all url based

2427296
post	get
get ought to be used to retrieve data idempotently and post ought to be used to update data non-idempotently

2427300
innodb	myisam
what are the difference between innodb and myisam

2427315
innodb	myisam
myisam only does lock at the table level -- innodb does locks at the row level

2427315
innodb	myisam
storage engines section of the mysql manual which is probably not a bad reference when it comes to innodb and myisam

2427318
versioning	upgrade
were doing this to upgrade the client to the latest versioning of their cms

2427323
innodb	myisam
another important difference so far myisam supports fulltext search but innodb does not

2427326
folder	directory
folder and it gets loaded before the one in vim directory

2427391
structuremap	log4net
structuremap underwent a bit of an overhaul recently so it s possible that a dependency on log4net was removed during that process

2427391
structuremap	log4net
in any case structuremap does not currently require log4net

2427395
ubuntu	linux
i have installed xampp for linux on ubuntu 9.10

2427411
tax	shipping
if there are other variables in orbit like state tax rates or discounts coupons that need to be handled before shipping costs are set this might not be so ideal

2427416
int	chars
edit if it still doesn t work you may try defining the chars as their int values and pushing them with fwprintf i know that s cumbersome and not a good fix in the long run but it should work as well

2427449
post	get
it s called post redirect get

2427460
hide	show
for your own error handling you can leave placeholder elements on the page then place messages in them and show or hide them as necessary

2427507
squash	merge
merge squash merge a tree a sequence of commits into a single commit

2427516
versioning	upgrade
always upgrade the jvm to the latest versioning and then see if the problem still exists

2427518
post	get
the redirect should use get even though this request is post

2427520
squash	branch
note it does not produce a commit right away you need an additional git commit -m squash branch

2427520
squash	merge
if you choose to squash all commits of tmp but contrary to merge --squash you can choose to replay some and squash others

2427563
getter	setter
and adding getter setter methods would result in unnecessary overhead

2427606
allocator	stl
one of the parameters to vector and other stl templates is allocator

2427621
simulink	labview
in control engineering or instrumentation i see simulink or labview g is pretty popular

appscript doesn t bridge nsimage in part because nsimage is appkit and appscript links against foundation only

2427628
folder	directory
directory folder and navigate to the

2427637
client-side	server-side
most web-based chat apps i ve seen are a combination of server-side code of various flavors and client-side javascript

2427648
client-side	server-side
it is server-side javascript so it s easier to communicate with client-side javascript

2427653
accessor	properties
in general i prefer to access all member fields via properties accessor as that encapsulates them better allowing you to change the underlying implementation storage of a field without having to change any of the code that accesses it except for the properties accessor itself

2427665
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
either the nature of your index the data coming in the pre-existing data if any the collation case-insensitive case-sensitive

2427667

i had this same problem what you need to do is add the lib directory under the top level boost folder to the library path in visual c++

2427755
getter	setter
then in my method that authenticates the user note that usermodel is simple class of just data members and their getter setter

2427756
post	get
but it sucks that wordpress does not enable pages with all the little extras you get with post

2427756
post	get
for example while the post editor gives you convenient access to tags categories and a post excerpt field pages get left out in the cold

2427775
actualheight	actualwidth
you should bind to actualwidth and actualheight members of the textbox

2427803
rss	feed
i m creating an application that generates rss feed that include an enclosure for showing an audio player

2427803
rss	feed
since rss readers are kinda flaky in my experience i d like to test how my feed look in as many readers as possible

2427826
submit	submission
if they are auth d still you want to return true and let the form do it s regular submission if it returns false you want to not allow the form to submit

2427828
rss	feed
top 9 windows rss feed readers

2427846
put	get
that s what you get out of a query as the column value and i believe that s what you have to put in as a parameter

2427898
google-chrome	firefox
all major browsers offer it as far as i know ie firefox google-chrome etc

2427907

ioexception	fileinputstream
it seems that implementation of fileinputstream from sun used to throw ioexception instead which is now also documented in javadoc

2427981
kohana	yii
i took that very seriously and had a close look at alternatives mainly yii and kohana

2427981
kohana	yii
for future projects in which i want to make use of the actual mvc features and totally submit to a framework s conventions on application building naming style and procedures though i may not necessarily be going for zend but for a more minimalistic framework like yii or kohana

2428007
ant	maven
you may want to take a look at teamprise build extensions which allows building ant or maven tasks from tfs

2428065
post	get
the best practice if generating one tiny form per delete link in on server is impractical is to use a get link to load up a confirmation page from the server which has a post form that performs the delete

2428065
post	get
if the server gets a get to controller delete x then serve up a confirmation page with a post form

2428066
width	height
you can use a standard tag and put it in a container like a with a limited height width

2428086
folder	directory
i need to be able to drop the framework into any folder on a server no matter how many folder deep and need to find that directory to use as a base url

add the uiview as a subviews of your master view and specify its bounds to be off of the left side of the screen so that all but the indices is clipped by the master view

2428136
folder	directory
this is my first stackoverflow question i m learning vb and having a few problems with getting a list of all folder directory on the system

2428188
ienumerable	iqueryable
asenumerable transforms the previously uses iqueryable into an ienumerable thus stopping the generation of the sql in case of linq to sql or any other transfromation by the provider implementing the specific iqueryable linq to sql provider

2428203
nsexpression	nspredicate
solving simple linear equations with nspredicate and nsexpression is a breeze but to go from there to solving arbitrary collections of constraints aka linear programming is still a big step

2428218
rss	feed
i m interested in password protecting my apps rss feed

2428218
rss	feed
so when you load a rss feed url in the browser the browser s default dialog asks for a login and password

2428248
wordpress	phpbb
this is why wordpress mediawiki phpbb phpmyadmin and every application i ve ever written has the user manually specify a base url as part of the application configuration

2428292
disk	ram
i know what version of the framework is going to be installed how much ram hard disk space etc

2428301
children	parent
suppose i have code that maintains a parent children structure

2428329
fast-forward	merge
if you do a straight git pull then you will either be fast-forward or merge an unknown number of commits from the remote repository

2428357
pull	push
more of a push into the icommand object than a pull

2428363
children	parent
many tree algorithms require that each node have links to its children and its parent

2428386
tinyint	boolean
philip kelley ray and i think artic have all suggested modifying the comment table by adding an entity_id which can refer to either the book_id or the author_id and a flag of some sort char 1 tinyint and boolean respectively that indicates which of these is being referred to

2428394
getter	setter
the difference is that with getter and setter you control how instance fields are accessed

2428405
getter	setter
another point is encapsulation - if you choose to change the way this variable is handled to always return store a copy you can do it in one place the getter setter without breaking anything

2428455
getter	setter
a very important point that is often overlooked you don t have to provide a getter and a setter for every field

2428455
getter	setter
having classes that consist of nothing but private properties and public getter and setter is just as bad a design as using public fields

2428455
getter	setter
the point is that getter and setter allow you to add behaviour and logic to the model beyond the simple holding of data - and in many cases that means not having a getter or a setter or both

2428463
post	get
i am testing out webhooks and i created a postbin test url and i am trying to create a webservice that would listen to the postbin url and be able to get the values out of the post but i am not sure how to do this my sample postbin url could be

2428471
put	get
you could of course put the grade info in the student object but ultimately there really isn t much you can do to get rid of that extra class

2428485
getter	setter
in the first place not all data members should have getter and setter and i imagine you can see the virtue of keeping those variables private

2428485
getter	setter
if there s getter and setter you may be able to compensate for that so that setting a value can do something more or less complicated in the internals to get the same effect as it previously had

2428489
boost	allocator
add an allocator to my class definition have and proceed similarly to the vector example given in boost

2428565
strtol	strtok
use strtok to break the string into individual tokens then convert each token to an integer value using strtol

2428565
int	chars
if that chars is anything other than whitespace or 0 then the string was not a valid int and we can reject it before assigning it to our target array

2428623
youtube	vimeo
i want a php code to turn a youtube dailymotion vimeo metacafe.

2428632
mouse	keyboard
i m working in eclipse and find myself always replacing multiple copies of the same word but i always have to take my hands off the keyboard and screen to get the mouse hover over the word double click to select and then copy or rewrite the word

2428634
int	boolean
notions of type safety and distinguishing boolean from int did not seem important until much later -

2428695
put	get
i m trying to use subwcrev to get the current revision number of our svn repository and put it in a file so i can show it in the ui

2428697
strtol	atoi
i would recommend strtol which provides better error handling than atoi or sscanf

2428733
mri	rubinius
unfortunately many popular ruby implementations are not capable of running multiple threads at the same time including mri yarv and rubinius

2428765
16-bit	64bit
why not 16-bit or 64bit

2428773
for-loop	arrays
my solution was to create a for-loop that ran that code and then check answer to see if it was an arrays using php method is_array and executing the method call again if it wasn t

2428803
charindex	substr
use substr but you ll have to use either charindex or patindex to get the location of the character you want the substr to stop at

2428891
width	height
when i resize the window its width changes but its height is constant

2428916
gif	png
so lets say i have an image doesnt matter what kind of gif jpg png with 200x200 pixel size total area 40000 pixels

background-color	transparency
this image have a background that can be transparency or every color but i know the background-color in advance

2428923
spaces	delimiter
by wrapping the - in spaces the delimiter is less likely to be tripped up and there s no need to trim the result

2428941
openmpi	mpich
mpich has built-in debugger while openmpi does not last time i checked

2428976
icmp	dhcp
also if a host becomes unreachable turned off disconnected... an intermediate gateway or the client itself may detect the event loss of carrier dhcp lease not renewed... and reply to the packets sent to the died host with a icmp error host network unreachable

2428981
uilabel	uibutton
i have a tableview with custom tablecellviews that has uilabel and uibutton on it

2428995
pull	push
in this context start by identifying your concurrent development effort and decide on a publication push pull process

2429014
std	ostream
to actually write objects binary use std ostream write

2429059
width	height
i didn t expect this to work because the this reference inside the area function should be pointing to the area function itself so i wouldn t have access to width and height from this

2429077
put	get
when i click the run button i get a popup that tells warns me what s going to happen...it s going to put a row into a new table

2429077
put	get
if you try to put multiple statements in and run them you ll get that error

2429080
mouse	keyboard
i m not sure how citrix vm vs mikogo vs ultravnc work with displaying information but i ve always guessed it s a combination of sending mouse and keyboard instructions and then refreshing the image to show what the display of the desktop is

2429166
for-loop	loops
you can loops through the items with a for-loop like this

2429213
min	max
i can give you an hint in how to obtain max and min values

2429265
put	get
if you want it to be a type then get rid of the element declaration in your address schema and put in instead

2429283
put	get
trying to put optional parameters in uri segments and things start to get weird

2429294
folder	directory
i m using dir.mktmpdir as the default scratch directory which gives a really ugly path for example var folder zz zzzivhrrnamviuee+++1ve+++yo -tmp- d20100311-70034-abz5zj

2429339
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i know that webkit safari google-chrome supports them but firefox at least 3.5 does not

2429344
min	max
so set your label for datapoint0 to 10 max value and for datapoint1 set the label to 5 min value

2429344
range	max	range	min	min	max
this will then look just like one range bar with the min value on the left and the max value on the right

2429350
getter	setter
you can inject ejb s in a jsf model and delegate it in action methods and maybe also getter setter but you should not do the other way round do not define the jsf model in an ejb this leads to tight coupling and would make ejb s unuseable outside the jsf context

2429355
inherited	properties
getattr does a lot more than a lookup in the object s __dict__ it supports properties and other descriptors attributes inherited from the class and its bases such as methods attributes that may be dynamically generated via a __getattr__ method in the object s class or again one of its bases

2429400
google-chrome	firefox
the error definitely doesn t occur in google-chrome 4 ie 8 or firefox 3.5

2429400
set	bag
c 659197 n 2 buyid 4751 qty 1 custcol_oboe_col_kind 2 although the number that custcol_oboe_col_kind is set to changes depending on the selected bag color

2429420
put	get
i get compile errors if i put anywhere in my xaml

2429475
ubuntu	linux
update i usually work on ubuntu linux 2.6.31-20-generic #57-ubuntu smp mon feb 8 09 05 19 utc 2010 i686 gnu linux python 2.6.4 r264 75706 dec 7 2009 18 45 15 gcc 4.4.1 on linux2

2429497
int	chars
this performs basic int and chars casting

2429535
folder	directory
i opened the project properties and added the path to the zlib-vc zlib include folder to the list of additional include directory and tried to build again

2429566
jar	war
if you mean you have a shared project that turns into a jar or war or dll or assembly that several projects use you can check in the artifact and have other projects simply check it out like any other 3rd party jar

2429581
int	boolean
types narrower than int are widened to int in expressions anyway - so the boolean operators would still work on int operands

2429591
inherited	properties
combine the common settings with the specific settings using properties inherited to manage the configurations - the properties manager tab allows you to do this

2429602
vbscript	vb6	vb.net	vb6	fortran	ada
clonedr operates on a wide variety of languages c c++ c# java php cobol python ada fortran egl and visual basic vbscript vb6 vb.net

2429623
trie	tree
i ve create a trie tree with an array of children

2429661
post	get
what their ajax is doing is making a get post request to another web page and dynamically loading the results

2429682
octal	decimal
the 013 is in octal so treated as a decimal you get 11

2429684
vsto	add-in
wrote a vsto add-in for excel that draws a grid dynamically

2429684
width	height
so basically i have no way of telling what my new width and height are

2429687
min	max
edit group by loses all except the first unique value so replacing min with max will not work

2429689
octal	decimal
13 octal is 11 decimal

2429695
octal	decimal
it s string concatenation of decimal 17 and octal 13 equivalent to decimal 11

2429698
octal	decimal
i would just add to reed s explanation that 013 is interpreted as octal 13 which is decimal 11

2429715
post	get
if you have problems with this part please post here and when i get some time i will update my answer with that functionality

2429729
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie8

2429764
subtract	add
yes it is important to get the sign correct when using esp in this case subtract but also sometimes you need to add when referencing something already on the stack like arguments inside a function

2429803
google-chrome	firefox
i ve also tested it in the latest versions of firefox 3.6 and google-chrome whose version escapes me

2429817
setinterval	clearinterval
you can use setinterval to begin triggering the event at regular intervals on hover and use clearinterval to stop it when the user stops hovering

2429838
width	margin
as noted by the op it seems to make more sense to have a pre-defined width from which margin padding and border-width are subtracted than to have a width to which these are then added

2429855
post	put
to me an external url would be page on that isn t part of my domain ie i own www.example.com and put a form that post to www.spamfoo.com

2429872
hash	salt
after user is added unverified combine email with a salt a secret and create the sha1 hash of the email salt combo

2429904
min	max
it s possible to establish a min max character count

2429930
int	double
the method abs int in the type math is not applicable for the arguments double

2429952
stdout	stderr
a process run as part of a command substitution can write to stderr to provide output to the user while the stdout output is captured by the command substitution

2429952
stdout	stderr
where the sandbox command sends most of its output to stderr and just the final â directory to chdir toâ to stdout

2430029
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
because google-chrome and firefox and ie and safari all behave slightly differently with the same javascript code web developers have to spend a great deal of time testing their code on the various browsers detecting which one you re using and adapting the code to the slightly different sets of libraries bugs etc

2430031
salt	md5
generate the token as a checksum md5 crc whatever over the user id the image id and maybe the current day of the year and be sure to mix in an unguessable salt

2430039
int	double
if i wanted to use the same specialization for all builtin numeric types int float double etc. i would write those lines many times

2430126
postgresql	mysql	apache	nginx
i have developed 3 simple blogging system in php apache mysql python nginx postgresql and in erlang yaws mnesia

2430170
opencv	emgucv
i would suggest coming up to speed on opencv emgucv s the .net port i use

2430174
formview	detailsview	gridview	formview	gridview	detailsview
bind method is only for the gridview detailsview and the formview control

2430207
width	font-size
you can then check if the width of the text is greater than 800px and reduce the font-size until the width is less than or equal to

2430207
width	font-size
you can also check if the width is too short maybe less than 200px and increase the font-size accordingly

2430207
width	font-size
that is repeatedly reduce the font-size by 5 until the total width is less than or equal to 800px

2430347
post	get
i can post more specifics when i get home and have access to said books

2430374

ie 7 8 require a different setup than firefox safari opera most notably the data and classid attributes.

2430377
weka	orange
to name a few weka rapidminer knime orange

2430467
versioning	upgrade
svn will automatically upgrade a working copy when it needs one and if a different client is using an older versioning it may no longer have access

2430501
for-loop	loops
i know it s more pythonic to use a for-loop for iterators but i wanted to implement a while loops within a generator that s called by a for-loop.

2430507
post	get
edit if this isn t exactly what you re looking for you might want to tag this post with javascript to get more people who know about js form validation to answer the question

2430520
nsurlcache	nsurlconnection
nsurlconnection has support for caching in the style of nsurlcache and it does a lot of work for you behind the scenes

2430528
post	get
another option is using ajax to pass as get post directly.

2430540
put	get
then test style.background attribute on url string and if it matches then get path between url and and put it into array

2430574
width	height
so if in your editable area you can add a fullcontainer rule which you should be able to if you re editing the css file at all you very likely could redefine that div to get rid of the width and height declarations width auto and height auto should do and similarly reset or override other things overflow hidden if necessary

2430575
lxml	beautifulsoup
lxml also has more features and offers beautifulsoup too

2430589
inherited	properties
that will make that your objy inherited also the properties added to the objx.prototype and as you see i changed the objy.prototype.constructor since the assignment in the line above will make this properties to wrongly point to objx

2430695
exslt	libxslt	libxml2	libxslt
it uses libxml2 and libxslt to handle xpath xslt and exslt

2430716
button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
like a checkbox button or dropdownlistfor or all the above

2430720
profiling	instrumentation
i assume you understand how profiling works the profiling will do some instrumentation and attach an agent to the jvm all this affects performance

2430762
hide	show
it sounds like you re looking for a static setup but likely you will show hide windows depending on what you re debugging and size them to different situations

2430785
int	chars
for each int you read ada.integer_text_io.get uses the default width of zero so it skips any leading blanks line terminators or page terminators then reads a plus sign if present or for a signed type only a minus sign if present then reads the longest possible sequence of chars matching the syntax of a numeric literal without a point. a subsequent ada.text_io.new_line leaves the line terminator there for ada.text_io.get_line to trip over and zero is not within namerange

2430786
portrait	landscape
i need to rotate my device to portrait and then rotate to landscape

2430816
scatter	graphing
based on my experience with zedgraph i could not set both of x and y axes scale same to have a correct scatter graphing

2430842
ant	maven
these can also run with ant maven as part of the build

2430844
put	get

functions like strtol strtok and atoi are often useful

2430984
int	double
long long if it needs be just a little bit bigger float or double if n isn t too big and you don t mind some imprecision or big int if you want the exact values of really big factorials

2431026
width	height
of course you could just refactor your current x y and width height to use the point etc for storage

2431063
google-chrome	firefox
i dont think this is a local caching problem ive disabled caching in all browsers the problem occurs in ie firefox google-chrome

2431069
width	height
i am interested in finding out the height for a given width taken by the webpage for the given html content

2431075

a union will do an implicit distinct on the result rows but we know there ll be no overlap here because we re varying checking for null

2431095
set	bag
i ve tried using a custom convention implementing ihasmanyconvention but the instance parameter does not seem to contain the information about whether its a list a bag or a set and also does not contain the column details for the index column

2431150
width	height
this cannot be done unless there are attributes or css rules that define their width or height

2431173
children	parent
if i change some value for a parent sprite the same value will affect all of its children

2431197
int	double
primitive types such as int float double etc can be printed in the same fashion they are printed in c using printf fprintf etc

2431197
nsstring	nsobject
if you need to print the data of a class you can often use nsobject s method to get a nsstring representing the data of the object

2431212
gson	jackson
jackson and gson are the most complete java json packages regarding actual data binding support

2431212
gson	jackson
since i am more familiar with jackson here are some aspects where i think jackson has more complete support than gson apologies if i miss a gson feature

2431212
getter	setter
field and getter setter access earlier gson versions only used fields this may have changed

2431218
folder	directory
to prevent this do the update on the branch you need only or remove the .svn folder in the upper directory

2431237
subtraction	addition
yeah that s not strictly possible the closest thing you can do is nest addition and subtraction functions inside

2431317

which you could have used to your advantage - launch each exe setting the current directory to the folder containing the oss dlls

2431362
portrait	landscape
you can test the behavior of your app through switching between portrait and landscape modus control + f11 in the emulator

2431365

hide	show
at the moment i rolled a custom solution which show hide menu items via css class and a programmatic check of the role that the user is in

2431465
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
for that you need to use the good old malloc realloc and free do not mix malloc realloc free and new delete

2431473
free	malloc
you had to use malloc free instead of new delete to use it

2431475
antialiasing	transparent
the trouble with transparent images is that the half-transparent pixels at the border will be partly colored with the color you specified as the transparent color if you can live with that then you can use the antialiasing arcs library you specified just put the following at the beginning of their example i used the optimized version

2431493
git-rebase	undo
in any case i don t really need to undo the git-rebase i just want to be able to recover the changes in the two files

google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
i ve tested this with ie8 mozilla opera google-chrome and safari

2431775
ssl	https
in terms of redirecting users to https areas i usually just forward the pages i want secured for example if a user navigates to i ll immediately redirect the request to response.redirect ... then take them out of the ssl secured area once they are successfully authenticated

2431789
getter	setter
the object philosophy would prevent that and enforce access through getter setter to ensure representation independence

2431841
width	height
if the image dimensions width height are within max dimensions i use a simple copy direct to folder userpics

2431841
width	height
if the original dimensions are bigger than max dimensions i want to resize the width and height to be within max

2431841
gif	png
tried imagetypes uploaded jpg jpeg gif and png same result for all of them

2431857

2431860
postgresql	mysql
soap postgresql mysql ldap and

2431892
getter	setter
as an example in a company i worked for is used to define beside setter and getter with methods like this

2431957
int	double
int double string....

2432028

i think the way would be to let persondocument and assetdocument inherited from a document class which would have an id properties that stores your current personid or assetid respectivly

2432074
haskell	scheme
haskell scheme or clisp

2432111
unsigned	short	int	double
comceau and gcc dont treat types like long double short int or unsigned int as fundamental type

2432126
unsigned	short
infact unsigned long short are variant of the int type

2432126
unsigned	short
so you can use any combination of those keywords together like unsigned short int

2432147
entity-relationship	diagram
smartdraw - for entity-relationship diagram its one of the best i have seen so far

2432155
mouseover	mouseleave
note this will only bind the first hover argument the mouseover event it won t hook anything to the mouseleave event

2432167
erd	diagram
you can generate an erd diagram from an existing schema in the database

2432183
memcached	apc
you can use anything from per-request caching which will be pretty useless for this particular problem to things like apc memcached a local database or even just saving the raw results to files

2432193
profiler	visualvm
maybe you can attach visualvm to your pid when running ant to see what s going on with memory or perhaps a profiler to pin it down

2432249
superclass	subclassing
i have an object of a subclassing extending its superclass

2432278
ant	maven
so people have to judge between how easy they can adjust their builds for how maven works and how long they can wait for a bug fix and how hard it will become to maintain a complex ant build script

2432299
ant	maven
on the other hand maven doesn t prevent configuration so it can be tweaked and can use ant if necessary

2432299
ant	maven
i would prefer maven for a new project because i can follow sensible maven conventions but would use ant build scripts for existing projects

2432299
ant	maven
correction for existing projects i would take a long hard look at migrating to maven and only then if i m really pushed against the wall use ant

2432299
ant	maven
the more i use maven the more i realize how valuable a tool it really is and how hard it becomes to justify ant immediately valuable plugins not building blocks like with ant standardization juniors have no problem jumping into a new project and building code dependency management integration with hudson jenkins...hard to justify ant any more except for extreme end-of-project-life builds at least on the types of projects i work on

2432310
post	get
this is be true for both get and post requests

2432323
pop-up	dialog

networkstream	sslstream
easiest way to work with ssl over sockets is to implement sslstream over networkstream bound to the socket

2432405
folder	directory
it is used so that one can make use of multi-level subdirectory inside controllers directory whereas normally we can use single level subdirectory inside controllers folder and can call it in url

2432444
width	height
put the image into a div with width 100 a defined height and overflow hidden

2432466
filesystems	ntfs
permissions are very os specific while posix file permissions allow the user to set whether you can read write or execute a file for the file owner the group and others the ntfs filesystems has a similar system but the concept for an execute permission is inexistant

2432479
folder	directory
and the wait to write a new set of file to the directory after the folder is released by the thread that started procesing the folder

2432535
stdout	stderr
i am writing a bash script and need to redirect the stdout and stderr output of a command i run to a single file prefixing each line with stderr or stdout accordingly

2432538
post	get
you might consider replacing all instances of _post in the old script to _request which will result in it accepting both get and post alike

2432556
stdout	fflush
i have also tried to no avail adding fflush stdout to the c code just before exiting but it seems that there is absolutely no need to fflush a stream before exiting a program

2432558
opera	firefox
this renders consistently in all browsers i tested ie6 opera 9 firefox 2.0 under windows 2000

2432722
slideup	slidedown
i am inexperienced with jquery and i m having some trouble with the slideup and slidedown animations

2432761
width	height
note that the texture width and height needs to be a power-of-2 so you ll have to pad the margins and adjust your vertices to get the correct placement if the image is not power-of-2

2432769
int	double
passing a single pointer to a struct 4 bytes will take fewer instructions than passing an int 3 double and a pointer 32 bytes but if you have to fill the struct with those 32 bytes before doing the call then you ve lost the advantage

2432812
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to set up the android sdk to develop a simple program on the command line in linux ubuntu 9.10

2432817

2432843
migrate	upgrade
i have migrate a web application from myeclipse to eclipse wtp and i am now in the middle of the first major upgrade to the code base and web pages after the migration and it is frankly driving me mad that saving a jsp page causes a redeployment of the whole application as it takes time and that my backend connection does not survive the serialization-deserialization of the session object which is non-trivial to fix

2432883
snmp	mib
i want to make my own snmp server and agent.with my own mib and oid s

2432883
snmp	mib
and if i want to use windows snmp service and extend it and insert my own oid s into its mib

2432955
children	parent
the event only reaches the parent if it came from one of the groupbox s children

2432981
openssl	opensc
openssl may offer something similar with the help of opensc but the driver shall then support the pkcs#11 api

2432981
openssl	crypto++
apart from openssl and nss you might want to investigate crypto++ which is quite mature and supposedly c++-friendly

2432986
awt	swing
i believe the reason is because swing was built off of awt and container is a top level awt object

2432986
awt	swing
it really isn t the greatest design choice though since you generally don t want to mix awt heavyweight objects with swing lightweight

2433057
versioning	upgrade
this can happen if you either upgrade your project start a new project and forget that you upgrade rails in the meanwhile or if you re still using an old versioning of rails and it s now been removed from the dreamhost server that you re on

2433067
post	put
this user may upload a file make a post then decide to put up a new revision replacing the old lets say its a large zip or tar.gz file

2433068

2433179
folder	directory
each extended iis website contains several specific virtual directory which are mapped to folder under c program files... 12 _layouts images

2433182
getter	setter
the above code would hopefully generate setter getter for any supplied properties in an array for the object author

2433230
inherited	properties
i m wondering why i need to do this for certain controls when i do not need to for others -- why some inherited properties and others do not -- and whether there is any way to make them all inherited in the same way

2433251
executable	upx
i have experienced significant increases in start up time when upx compressed executable are run on systems with certain virus scanners

2433273
hide	show
i want to design a view view controler that automaticaly show hide a subview when in landscape orientation

2433298
distance	polygons
since the polyhedron is defined by many polygons in a 3d space one way that occurs to me is to compare the distance to each polygons and choose the shortest distance

2433319
ienumerable	iqueryable
ienumerable is great for working with in-memory collections but iqueryable allows for a remote data source like a database or web service

2433350
prepare	execute
native prepare statements cannot execute certains types of queries like show tables

2433394
vb.net	vb6
i program in delphi as well as vb6 along with vb.net and c# but creating activex controls is the easiest in vb6 compares to all other development tools

2433397
ienumerable	iqueryable
then with an iqueryable the generated sql will contain but with an ienumerable many more roles will be pulled back from the database then the check will be done by .net

2433400
pull	push
what i would like to do is have 1 person be the administrator and only that person is allowed to commit push pull to the repository

2433415
maven	pom.xml
to have maven filter resources when copying set filtering to true for the resource directory in your pom.xml

javadb sun s supported distribution of the open source apache derby hsqldb not very active and h2 the successor of hsqldb are all 100 java embeddable database engines and can all be used with hibernate there are dialect for them

2433599
getter	setter
java programmers get around this by creating from the start getter and setter for every public facing attribute whether it has any kind of processing or not just in case

2433599
getter	setter
i ve seen java programmers starting on other languages that do have properties doing the same sin of using getter and setter thing

2433599
getter	setter
getter setter

2433621
hide	show
and i am using jquery to show hide the sub-list

2433627

works well in opera firefox

2433735

2433745
rss	feed
to setup a free wordpress account on wordpress.com and use the generated rss feed as a means of importing posts into their website

2433762
ant	maven
you could use a maven archetype and then switch to using an ant build script

2433764
javassist	cglib
another option would be to switch from cglib to javassist

2433770
versioning	upgrade
so i upgrade to that versioning just to get a run-time error stating that it could not find nhibernate 2.1.0.4000

2433782
kde	gnome
you can use d-bus interface which gets more and more popular in both gnome and kde although it is more for processing events or sending simple commands

2433825
rss	feed
otherwise mailing lists or rss feed may provide some push style info as well

2433825

you can subscribe to mailing lists to get mail into your gmail account subscribe into rss feed with google reader and have it notify you via gmail and then see if it s possible to subscribe to svn updates on the repositories

2433832
mouse	keyboard
this should allow you to catch most keyboard and mouse interactions

2433835
atomic	interlocked
reading and writing a data type that fits into a single word int on a 32-bit processor long on a 64-bit processor is technically atomic but the jitter and or processor can decide to reorder instructions and thus create unexpected race conditions so you either need to serialize access with lock use the interlocked class for writes and in some cases reads or declare the variable volatile

2433836
hide	show
would i just have different user controls for each page and create show and destroy hide them on request

2433852
rss	feed
wordpress has an xml-rpc interface so you could write some middleware to feed your blog with an rss feed or simply submit content via the xml-rpc api itself

2433852
rss	feed
i m sure there are probably some plugins there are many to choose from to read rss feed for wordpress too but you ll have to scowl the wordpress site for the specifics

2433876
loops	while-loop
however when the while-loop gets stepped into it won t break out of loops when everything has been printed to the console and there is nothing else to read

2433886
getter	setter
than the same thing with getter and setter

2433913
versioning	upgrade
it may actually be in your best interest to simply let their versioning languish until you re ready to upgrade

2433913
versioning	upgrade
it would probably be best for you to upgrade your versioning in a sweep with your own app s versioning changes

2433916
getter	setter
i have a domain object employee with the properties firstname and lastname which are transient and when invoking their setter getter methods they encrypt decrypt the data

2433918
japplet	jdialog
i found it helpful to understand that swing provides three generally useful top-level container classes jframe jdialog and japplet

2433950
post	get
when i start this small app i get the message from the header of this post

2433962
floating-point	fractions
bear in mind when you get the result that floating-point numbers cannot in general represent decimal fractions precisely

2433962
floating-point	integer
so once you have the mathematically correct answer it will not necessarily give you an integer answer when you do a floating-point multiplication

2433964
width	height
my window width is 1280 and height 960

2433976
mouseleave	mouseenter
and then point all of the buttons mouseenter and mouseleave events to those functions

2434001
xna	spritebatch
keep in mind that if you are changing the blend modes your spritebatch should be performing in the immediate mode i forget the xna term but the one where it doesn t do ordering of sprites for efficiency else it will be reset unexpectedly

2434004
qtableview	qstyleditemdelegate
i have a qtableview which i am setting a custom qstyleditemdelegate on

2434061
folder	directory
then when it is time to deploy update the production site i copy the .svc file s and the .dll file s in the bin directory to the production folder

2434071
portrait	landscape
this is for a game where the user can choose levels some of which are int portrait orientation and some are landscape orientation

2434071
portrait	landscape
for example ideally the activity would know before even oncreate was called whether it should be landscape or portrait depending on some property of the launching intent but unless i ve missed something that isn t possible

2434071
portrait	landscape
this was done with a simple int representing portrait or landscape determined when the player selected a level

2434071
portrait	landscape
lastly i just had to add a line to the manifest stating that gamelandscape would always run in landscape and gamelogic would always run in portrait

2434075
x86	64bit
after getting the problem on vista i changed the target platform to x86 as people have suggested with the 64bit problem but tis didn t fix the issue

2434165
integer	fractions
you might also want to round off the newheight newwidth to integer values - in almost all cases you ll get some fractions result and images don t have fractions pixels

2434165
disk	ram
this way the transaction will hide the record as it s not committed yet there s no way for two or more simultaneous uploads to get the same id number and if anything fails during image processing insufficient ram disk space corrupt source image etc... you just roll back the transaction and clean up the mess

2434290
hide	show
now since iphone os 3.0 uitableviewcontroller automatically resizes its tableview when the system keyboards show and hide

2434290
hide	show
i have standard input fields along the custom ones so if the user changes the fields the standard keyboard hide and the custom one show

2434338
vb.net	vb6
it s also a vb.net project upgraded from vb6 if that makes a difference.

2434341
width	height
a you are returning two values that really should be encapsulated in one object height and width of something so you should return an object that represents that something or b this is a code smell and you really need to think about why the method is returning two values the method is really doing two things

2434350
submit	submission
ms bug report here connect.microsoft.com submit button value not posted with form submission

2434432
hide	show
if you don t want to use a plugin like the one in slaks answer you have to either position a label above the password field what the plugin does or hide the password field and show a text input in its place until it gets the focus

2434432
google-chrome	firefox
here s an example that works in at least ie7 it should work in ie6 but i haven t tried it google-chrome and firefox

2434448
width	height
the parameters to glviewport are the lower left corner of your viewport as x and y then width and height

2434458
width	height
i would like to know if it is technically possible to resize an image at a client-side with javascript really resize not just change width and height

2434463
portrait	landscape
you could make two activities - one for portrait levels the other for landscape levels - and then set the activity s orientation in androidmanifest.xml using the android screenorientation attribute

2434463
portrait	landscape
use your current activity as the base activity and just create the landscape portrait activities as subclasses of that activity

2434465
put	get
but this code is being repeated in many pages so i tried to put this function in a c# class and try to call it but i get errors..

2434530
vb.net	vb6
in vb6 i would use an eval or something simular to convert the string to an actual object but this obviously doesn t work in vb.net

2434540
pop-up	dialog
basically click the edit link dialog box pop-up with the content to edit loaded into the ckeditor

then i put nant.exe from the ubuntu nant package into the path and i get

2434595
cifs	smb
i m looking for some stand alone library to access smb cifs shares

2434604
kde	gnome
that s a difficult question to answer as you don t say explicitly what kind of a graphical interface you are running on since x is the bare-bones x driver behind the gui such as gnome kde windowmaker fluxbox nextstep to name a few i know for certain that kde s interface uses compiz to communicate with the x driver interface to draw on the screen and perform eye-candy movements...but the resolution of x is still the same regardless..8 bits 16 bits 24 bits 32 bits pixel format depending on your screen resolution and how x is configured

2434606
post	get
when sending data via post or get with jquery you use for format so i thought is there a way to do it with this kind of code

2434613

2434979
accessor	properties
apple recommends using lazy initialization wherever possible so i think you re heading down the right path though you might want to consider making the method name something that looks like a properties accessor -names rather than -load especially since there s a class method named +load that means something quite different

2434987
inherited	properties
the current dir is a per-process properties a child process usually inherited it from the parent process but the reverse should not happen and it doesn s

jtextpane	jviewport
this.getcomponent 0 is returning the scrollpane s jviewport not your jtextpane

2435935
ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
you already know the answer to the very oriented body of your question there is no ant equivalent to this minimal pom.xml because unlike maven ant does not define a set of standards patterns conventions in other words a lingua franca or shared language for project management that would make it possible so ant can t beat maven on this sample

2435935
ant	maven
somehow yes and i believe that most complains about maven s complexity are due to ignorance i know ant well i know how to do things in ant ant is simple i don t know maven i don t get it i don t know how to do things i feel lost i feel constrained i don t want to learn it maven is complex. and fud

2435935
ant	maven
but maven and ant are so different that there is no real point at comparing them and maven is still much more than ant + dependency management

2435935
ant	maven
so at the end no offense here such questions don t change anything and i ll just quote maven and ant guys youâ ll never agree

2435988
button	checkbox
it is somewhat redundant although less so when you have checkbox radio button where several of them can share a name

2436072
queue	fifo
bfs + fifo queue

2436093

union	distinct
i need to return the max added date and corresponding user and max updated date and corresponding user for each distinct record when tables a b c d are union ed

2436126
folder	directory
yes we ended up rolling back if that s what you call it when you have to re-get everything from sourcesafe to a completely new directory because there is no auto-rollback feature with the framework conversion only a backup folder that has been screwed with and dumped into another folder and will never work again because all references are now broken and the web.config has a bunch of illegal entries and the iis metabase ended up corrupted and intermittent database locking caused permissions to be wiped and around 15 or 20 other problems..

2436134
ubuntu	linux
as stated in the title the program is working on my local machine ubuntu 9.10 but not on the server linux

2436175
free	malloc
it s been a while since i ve used this and i honestly can t remember how well it interacts with the c runtime heap as opposed to the windows heap manager to ensure that each malloc free new delete call is separately checked

2436194
rss	feed
most feed readers won t be able to consume your rss feed if you put a password on it

2436199

2436228
nunit	moq
currently we are using nunit moq and i m starting to investigate structuremap

2436230
isapi	iirf
i know you re asking a programming question but you could avoid the whole thing by abandoning the effort to write an isapi filter and instead use an off-the-shelf general purpose rewriter like iirf

2436304
lisp	scheme
common lisp is a weakly functional mixed-paradigm language and scheme is more strongly functional but still not pure

2436338
width	height
i can t figure out why this would be happening if i m fetching the width after i set it to visible with its new dimensions which by the way are relative when i m setting them with layoutparams fill_content for both width and height

2436431
hex	binary
i d love to be able to just see 32-character hex hash while mysql would convert it to from 16 binary bytes and index that as programs using the database might have some troubles with arbitrary binary data that i d rather avoid if possible also i m a bit afraid that mysql might get some strange ideas about character sets and for example overalocating storage for that by 3 1 because it thinks it might need utf8 how do i avoid that for cure

2436431
hex	binary
it seems some kind of solution would be binary 16 null for storage unhex md5 url for insertion comparison hex url_hash for retrieval not that it really needs retrieval there will be unindexed url column there anyway

2436448
hash	md5
the index is probably already using a hash in a more efficient way than your hand-made md5 solution would

2436457
fseek	fread
ideally you would want to check each call to fseek and fread to make sure they didn t encounter any errors but you mentioned you were on a deadline so this is just some quick-n-dirty error tracing to try and track down the segfault

2436459
put	get
if i try to put the decimal-format outside the template then i get the message that the xsl if is not allowed in this position in the sthylsheet

msdn says to set dmpapersize to 0 when you want to specify width and height whereas the microsoft support correction says to set it to dmpaper_user

2436729
put	get
i put in an event to get called when the qtreewidgetitem is dropped but it seems the object gets deleted as soon as it s dropped

2436733

i m familiar with how type affinity works in sqlite you can declare column types as anything you want and all that matters is whether the type name contains int chars floa etc

2436753
children	parent
if the parent mc is resized if in the transform dialog it reads other than 100 then that transformation is passed on to any children

2436755
powerpc	i386
i have seen the -arch compiler flag before and have seen values passed to it such as powerpc i386 and x86_64 which i assume maps to the cpu language but my understanding stops there

2436766
google-chrome	firefox
because this works perfectly for me on ie8 compatibility mode firefox and google-chrome

2436790
folder	directory
at the end of each method typically you tell it to render a particular view stored in a folder named after the controller in the views directory which is a lot like a classic asp page with all of the logic separated out

2436796
solaris	aix
i ve done a little research on macos x linux aix solaris and hp-ux and there are some interesting results

2436811

the resulting unsigned integer type is

2436887
foldable	traversable
using ghc extensions you can also derive instances of the following classes typeable data functor foldable and traversable

2436890
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer types implement modulo arithmetic

2437070
int	double
you can avoid the messiness of mapping from double to int by using random s api directly

2437111
put	get
i think the only way to work with memcache is to try to get data out of it with the expectation that it might not be there even if you put it in before

2437114
youtube	vimeo
why aren t you using video hosting service free like for example youtube vimeo for this which are way better prepared for handling this then you could ever be

2437122
opera	firefox
once firefox and opera got a 302 from the server they both tried using home testajax with a slash at the end

2437122
google-chrome	safari
on the other hand the reason why ie safari and google-chrome were working is because they still had x-request-with set to xmlhttprequest in redirected request

2437122
opera	firefox
it is still a mystery to me as to why firefox and opera didn t but i am not going to worry about it at this point

2437164

2437283
int	chars
issue i am mostly concerned about is bit order when converting of negative bits from chars to int

2437293
int	chars
there is going to be no portable way to do this because nothing says chars has to be eight bits and nothing says unsigned int needs to be 4 bytes wide

2437300
client-side	server-side
however if i am doing extra server-side validations like checking if username is already taken that aren t present in the client-side rules then the validation plugin clears these validation messages when user tabs out of these fields

google-chrome	safari
now i need to extend this to apple safari and google-chrome on all supported platforms

2437319

gprof	callgrind	valgrind	gprof	valgrind	callgrind
not quite an answer to your question but maybe a solution to your problem i switched from gprof to valgrind callgrind tool primarily because of the incredible graphical tool kcachegrind which you can use to visualize the results

2439881
gprof	callgrind
gprof2dot works with callgrind as well as gprof

2439888
comparator	comparable
first of all if you are using java 5 or above you should implement rather than the plain old comparable therefore your comparator method should take parameters of type myclass not object

2439888
equals	compareto
use the equality test imposed by compareto in place of equals

2439888
equals	compareto
update so imho with your current class you can not make compareto consistent with equals

chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

2440274
post	get
curlopt_post as you want to send a post request and not a get

2440276
prepare	execute
i think the point of prepare statements - besides security in query building - is prepare once execute many prepare statements are meant to be run multiple times

2440288
width	height
there would be a way to divine at least the number of bytes per pixel if you could tell how many frames the cursor has but since you can t that information isn t set as of 10.6.1 â x-radar problem 7751530 you are left trying to figure out two factors of a four-factor product bytes per pixel ã width ã height ã number of frames where you only have the width the height and the product

2440303
screens	tablet
for example at a small screens size there might be 4-5 buttons at the bottom but if you ran it on a tablet or something similar there would be maybe 20 buttons

there are however some exceptions such as the parameterindex-based setter methods of preparedstatement and the columnindex-based getter methods of resultset

2440364
stdout	stderr
stdin which is read-only stdout and stderr which are write-only

2440364

it s really awkward to write an numberisinrange int n int min int max predicate with a half-open range if integer.max_value could be legally in a range

2440828
webrat	cucumber
for example i can use cucumber to do end-to-end testing and it would involve functional testing using webrat and rspec as well

2440850
lisp	scheme
i realise common lisp is very big but you might want to take another look at the scheme dialect which is much smaller and simpler and is often used as a teaching language even for non-cs types felleisen et al. s how to design programs specifically targets a non-programmer audience

vsts	tfs
i suggest you download the rc of vsts and of tfs install them and find out

2440977

2440986
inherited	properties
instead do it the old fashioned way prototype and inherited by properties

2440988

if you need more than one format available at all times you may want to give yii s getter and setter a try

2441242
jboss	glassfish
but if you need to support cover the other aspects of the java ee api as well then you need an application server such as sun glassfish or jboss both which by the way uses tomcat as the servletcontainer part

children	parent
say i have a parent class and each parent has multiple children

2441496

2441520
numericupdown	maskedtextbox
similarly controls such as maskedtextbox datetimepicker or numericupdown allow input without allowing free-text input so the user might be constrained to a certain type datetime or decimal

edit i made a file specifically for building the dependencies for me i store it in a sibling folder of each of my projects child of the myproj in the directory structure specified above called dependencies.pri

2441575
disk	ram
in a lot of situations the cost of disk space and availability of ram mean that we no longer need to squeeze every last bit of storage out of computers as we did 20 years ago so we can sacrifice a bit of storage efficiency in order to save on development maintenance costs

2441575
16-bit	64bit
however where large amounts of data are used or we are working with systems with small memories embedded controllers or when we are transmitting data over networks using 32 or 64bit to represent a 16-bit value is just a waste of memory bandwidth

2441661
apache	cherokee
i d love to have a tool to let me configure apache lighttp cherokee and mysql automatically

2441674
webclient	webrequest
i ve tried to override the webclient and set a timeout to the webrequest and it didn t help

2441704

you could also try using copywin instead of overwrite - it ll give you more control including letting you start copying at a different position on the source window

2441912
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
to use a uinavigationcontroller you ll need to replace your current uiviewcontroller with a uinavigationcontroller which has this uiviewcontroller inside of it

2442021

it works fine in firefox google-chrome opera it displays 10x10 table with 30px width height rows

2442188
for-loop	loops
in other words you should use a while loops instead of a for-loop and only increment j if the elements at i and j do not match

2442209
put	get
if you put an entity and then get it inside the transaction then you don t see any changes just the state of the datastore before the transaction

2442248

2442514
realloc	malloc
this version uses dynamic memory allocation to resize the buffer as needed starting with a null buffer pointer realloc null size malloc size

this works great except i want it to only do this for primitive types like int double bool etc and other types that aren t primitive but can be serialized easily like string

2442579
implements	extends
i do not know what you are doing but you do not want a class that extends arraylist and implements iterator

2442616
addition	multiplication
parentheses that are used to disambiguate infix operators are not obviously redundant even when they are redundant except perhaps in the very special case of multiplication and addition operators

2442640
getter	setter
in other words in ruby variables are always private the only way to access them is via a getter and or setter method or as they are called in ruby an attribute reader and or writer

2442640
getter	setter
so we have covered the field part java field ruby instance variable we have covered the public and private parts in ruby instance variables are always private if you want to make them public use a public getter setter method and we have covered the static part java static field ruby class instance variable

2442640
getter	setter
don t provide a setter method only a getter

2442658
hash	md5
still it would probably be cleaner to simply use a time-tested hash with a larger space md5 instead of crc32 or sha1 instead of md5 than bet on your own solutions like storing file size

2442670
typedef	struct
typedef struct bitstream_impl bitstream

2442673
expression-blend	silverlight
i want to make a silverlight application in expression-blend because of the rich ui and navigation of blend

2442717
min	max
using the linq min and max extensions will always be slower because you have to iterate twice

2442733
integer	unsigned
so i don t know what the optional means for the access key i ll assume it means that the field can be all-zero bytes if you have no access key if data is already a string of bytes and command a small unsigned integer for example something like...

2442765
minimum	max
there is a cache memory manager which has a minimum and a maximum memory limit max limit it matters anyway

2442798

2442970
dictionary	map
i have a class called map which has a dictionary called tiles

2442983
equals	gethashcode

2443017
mbunit	nunit
xunit nunit mbunit etc

2443018
ncover	partcover
then if you want to be sure your tests cover a good part of your code you can use software like ncover jcover partcover or whatever

factors	mean
if you mean all numbers that have no factors in l well there s infinitely many of them so it s kind of hard to make a list of them all

2443107
mcc	mex
my possible solutions are to use a mex file for the main program or have the main program call a mcc library which then calls a mex file which then calls the proper grader

2443129
int	double
but the int are converted to double before comparison to 5.2

2443129
int	double
the type error probably misled you the list of int wasn t being converted to double by comparison to 5.2 the real problem is that only double can be compared to double so you must pass a list of double to belowthreshold

2443132
folder	directory
if the files are in a folder - that the folder is set up as a virtual directory in iis and you have clicked the create button in the iis control panel to create an application

2443280
for-loop	arrays
based on the for-loop you ve written your arrays criteriacheck appears to be a set of indices into arrays and for each of these indexed elements you want to do some computation

2443283
disk	ram
since you already have the file i o in place you might get enough speed by placing it on a ram disk

2443341
min	max
the solution is simply to make sure that your 1d function has values in the interval min r max r

2443341
range	max
note that in the original data max r is about 424 while the function you are interpolating is defined on the range -300 299

2443344
put	get
generally get requests should not have any side effects and put is for writing replacing the entire resource

2443373
addclass	removeclass
you will note that i removed your background-image css and replaced them with addclass removeclass

2443385
hash	md5
the whole point of the family of cryptographic hash md5 sha-x etc is to make collisions vanishingly unlikely

2443442
width	margin
move the margin auto and width 50 to the form css instead on in the #formdiv

2443470
post	get
fbml mode relies on post calls but iframe appears to use get

then if users want to upgrade to the latest library versioning they will have to rename them to match what is declared in the manifest

2443619
tstringlist	tobjectlist	tstringlist	tlist
a tobjectlist in common with a tlist and a tstringlist uses an incremental memory allocator

2443670
width	height
so i think i ve to dynamically change width and height attributes in img tag

2443678
width	height
just leaving off the width and height attributes and styles should do

2443687
width	height
as far as i ve seen if you don t define the width and height the browser displays the entire full size image

2443757
multicastdelegate	delegation
creating a delegation in c# creates a class derived from multicastdelegate with a constructor

2443757
multicastdelegate	delegation
one final interesting note is that the classes delegation and multicastdelegate have yet another sets of constructors

2443787
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uinavigationcontroller inside a uitabbarcontroller

2443891
inherited	properties
1 the creation of a class that inherited the linq class or one that has the same properties

2443944
int	boolean
it will create a obj with x paramenters all with a int float string boolean or null value

2444017
ubuntu	linux
i set it up on ubuntu linux and started reading and trying to follow the information given on the apache website here

2444019
min	max
where min and max are int s

2444044
range	min
just using max-min+1 in place of n and adding min to the answer will give a value in the desired range

2444054
put	get
so don t expect the following code to not return null if you don t put anything before and actually you ll only get what you put in there

2444060
folder	directory
it s also important that you structure the views into sub folder to avoid a messy view directory

2444061
lisp	smalltalk
here i tried to implement the smalltalk approach in common lisp which is a good illustration of how metaprogramming is poorly supported in the latter

2444073
google-chrome	firefox
and it works in firefox but not in google-chrome

2444084
google-chrome	safari
if i remove it the code does not work in safari and google-chrome

2444086
maven	pom.xml
oh and about the super pom.xml -- from this page in maven s docs

2444086
maven	pom.xml
the super pom.xml is maven s default pom.xml

2444086
super	extends
all poms extends the super pom unless explicitly set meaning the configuration specified in the super pom is inherited by the poms you created for your projects

2444116
width	height
assuming that you care about alt height and width attributes you should reading the image properties from a javascript array may be a good fit for you

2444140
uilabel	uitextview
i need to grab an uiimage from a uitextview or uilabel

2444151
google-chrome	firefox
for some reason firefox 3.6 for windows isn t issuing a right-click event but google-chrome and ie do

2444151
google-chrome	firefox
if you right-click #test then you get nothing in firefox but you get an alert under google-chrome and ie

2444162
post	get
for web services soap is an example of something that is not rest because the implementer of the service creates it s own verbs via methods rather than the standard get post etc

2444185
versioning	upgrade
which can be problematic - i have a number of rails 2.3.5 and earlier apps in production that require maintenance and won t be upgrade to the new versioning

2444192
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3.6 gives the alert just fine on either left or right click on my mac osx 10.5 as do safari and google-chrome

2444206
put	get
sinatra should respect the order of routes so if you put administration route first and a request matches it get slug won t be called at all

2444228
width	height
if youâ d prefer to keep the width and height attributes in your html then in php you want the getimagesize method in the gd library

2444238
swt	swing	awt	swing
things you are used to use in a window-app like swing swt awt and the like

2444273
inherited	subclassing
edit 2 i now think the best soluton is to create listeningview.h that just includes a listeningview protocol instead of subclassing listeningview since we can t do multiple inherited in obj-c

2444321
hash	md5
if md5 hash any arbitrary string into a 32-digit hex value then according to the pigeonhole principle surely this can not be unique as there are more unique arbitrary strings than there are unique 32-digit hex values

2444336
hash	md5
the answer above still holds but you shouldn t expect an md5 hash to serve as any kind of security check against manipulation

2444351
hash	md5
is there a hash function that returns a 16-digit hex value as md5 returns 32-digit or is there a library for c++ in which i can use md5 or sha-1 which returns a 16-digit value

2444354
extjs	gxt	extjs	smartgwt	gxt	smartgwt
as a base framework for a more complex customized one - examples include extjs gwt gxt and smartgwt

2444355
hash	md5
since you re willing to live with the much-higher collision rate you can just truncate the md5 hash of the data

2444384
put	get
i recommend you do your sorting with the built-in sort method and put your energy into defining the right key-extractor function to get things sorted the exact way you want -- a much more productive use of your time

2444393
hash	md5
as others have pointed out the goal of a hash function like md5 is to provide a way of easily checking whether two objects are equivalent without knowing what they originally were passwords or comparing them in their entirety big files

2444397
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd for kguest

2444397
pecl	pear
warning pear archive_zip is deprecated in favor of pecl zip

2444451
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
this is why you should always make sure to add a salt if you are using md5 to store password hash if you include a salt in the input string a matching input string has to include exactly the same salt in order to result in the same output string because otherwise the raw input string that matches the output will fail to match after the automated salting you can t just reverse the md5 and use it to log in because the reversed md5 hash will most likely not be the salt string that originally resulted in the creation of the hash

2444451
hash	salt
so hash are not unique but the authentication mechanism can be made to make it sufficiently unique which is one somewhat plausible argument for password restrictions in lieu of salting the set of strings that results in the same hash will probably contain many strings that do not obey the password restrictions so it s more difficult to reverse the hash by brute force -- obviously salt are still a good idea nevertheless

2444451
hash	md5
bigger hash mean a larger set of possible hash for the same input set so a lower chance of overlap but until processing power advances sufficiently to make brute-forcing md5 trivial it s still a decent choice for most purposes

2444475
width	height
if the page loads with the imageâ s width and height included as attributes in the source

2444475
width	height
use removeattribute width and height the first time you change its source

2444504
single-quotes	double-quotes
you can t nest the double-quotes inside the single-quotes

2444505
subclass	abstract-class

2444540
rss	feed
i m trying to pull the contents of an rss feed into an object that can be manipulated in code

2444540
rss	feed
every time i ve tried to read in the contents of an rss feed using the syndicationfeed class the .content element for each syndicationitem is null

2444540
rss	feed
i suspect i may just be missing a step somewhere but i can t seem to find a good tutorial on how to consume rss feed using these classes

2444570
rss	feed
the rss feed you linked to puts its content in the element

2444570
rss	feed
as documented the element of an rss feed maps to the summary property

2444689
atexit	main
use the atexit module to register in the main thread a function that set the global threadstop to true or more simply set the daemon attribute of the thread object to true so it won t keep the process alive if the main thread exits

2444741
dumpsys	adb
from the command line you can use adb shell dumpsys activity

2444770
versioning	upgrade
i have a live marketplace versioning of my application and now want to start developing my next versioning but want to be able to have the newer dev upgrade for testing and existing live versioning for demoing both on the same device but i dont want to create a whole separate project to do this

2444796
client-side	server-side
as for javascript client-side versus asp.net server-side i think you are likely to wind up with some combination of both not an either or

2444853
spaces	delimiter
i have tried using cut to keep the columns that i do want and having as my delimiter however because of the file size figures it messes up using spaces as a delimiter

2444868
spaces	delimiter
try to open them in excel with spaces as delimiter delete it there

2444872
spaces	delimiter
if you had mixed spaces and tab delimiter you would need to convert one to the other as cut does not like multiple delimiter

n-gram	words
i am interested in finding words that are similar in context cat and dog and i was wondering how do i compute the similarity of two words on a n-gram model given that n 2

2444954
width	height
this allows you to set a percentage of the enclosing component s width or height

2444956
action-filter	onactionexecuting
i noticed that inside the iactionfilter.onactionexecuting the value for filtercontext.controller.viewdata.model is always null despite the fact that it looks like the model binder is always invoked before the action-filter onactionexecuting method

of course fulltext is only available on myisam table types so if you re using innodb or some other type you re out of luck

2445209
getter	setter
we ve gotten around it by creating a protected variable of the concrete type which is used for mapping and exposing the interface type as a getter setter for that concrete type

2445245
google-chrome	firefox
i m wondering why opacity animations only work with firefox and not with google-chrome or internet explorer

2445245
google-chrome	firefox
fades the element in with firefox but just makes it appear with google-chrome or ie

2445246
subtract	add
it would be nice if i could also add subtract and find the dot-product of vectors

2445348
octal	hex
you should try something like to check for the 0xd octal 15 being equivalent to hex 0xd

2445423
rss	feed
rss 1.0 which is built around rdf does still crop up from time to time so you should built support for it along with the other 8 versions of rss and the ability to recover from errors since many rss feed are invalid and not well formed

2445463
inherited	subclassing
however while technically possible most of the time you are subclassing builtins such as str you are looking at a has-a kind of relationship not is-a therefore composition should be used not inherited meaning you should create a class with a string as an instance attribute rather than subclassing string

2445506
put	get
get column and rows of cursor and put your html tag there

2445512
implements	extends
in java we use extends keyword for extends class and implements for interface and where as you are using wrong keyword for wrong type

2445537
width	height
detect the x and y of both images and then do some calculation minus width and height of each images if they are of not same size to get correct x and y coordinates

2445537
width	height
minus width and height to find out correct x and y

2445550
put	get
first method is to put file into database from drive second method is to get file and save it on drive and 3rd method is to get file from database and put it as memorystream so you can some other stuff with it then just writing it to drive

2445635
keydown	keyup
you need to separately track the key status using keydown and keyup

2445681
multiplying	add
i have a simple class library com+ service written in c# to consume 5 web services add minus divide multiplying and compare

2445681
inherited	subclassing
as you see when one of the subclassing inherited ws both methods must be overridden which might not be useful in some subclassing

2445684
sorting	filtering
rather sorting and filtering is used in the user interface or some other back end processing component

2445684
sorting	filtering
additionally when looking at the second option from a single responsibility aka solid perspective you ll see that your product business object has the responsibility for sorting and filtering something that isn t at all related to a product

2445934
integer	fractions
...where ceil is an operation that takes any fractions value and rounds up to the nearest integer

2445971
subtract	add
if there was even a formula i could use that would tell me how many pixels i needed to add subtract from my my variable that would be excellent

2446011
width	height
so far the out give these coordinate which equal height and width even on screen the pictures showed in different sizes

2446012

rss	feed
to get an idea how it feels load a huge rss feed into google reader

2446155
put	get
finally all the results get put onto another queue ready for collection and user response by the web server

2446178
rss	feed
i am trying to add a rss feed into an html page

2446259
width	height
if the td is of fixed width then you can make an image with dimension equal to and set this image as the background and set background-repeat to repeat-y so that it fills the entire height of the td

2446264

setinterval	clearinterval
i think the better way will be to use setinterval and clearinterval

2446350
width	height
i ve tried the method glutinitwindowsize int width int height

2446386
rss	feed
i have an rss feed that gets arranged in a uitableview which lets the user select a story that loads in a uiwebview

2446386
uilabel	uitextview
however i d like to stop using the uiwebview and just use a uitextview or uilabel

2446386
rss	feed
the problem arises when i try to process the rss feed

2446398
google-chrome	safari
to get this working in webkit google-chrome safari use -webkit-box-sizing

2446450
google-chrome	firefox
however in both firefox and google-chrome res contains an empty string

2446480
postgresql	mysql
i need to make some tests for a potential migration from mysql to postgresql

2446480
postgresql	mysql
it will be easier to test if it is possible to use postgresql as slave for my mysql master

2446488
int	double
excel cells do not have an int type excel numbers are always double

2446589

if returned the right one we could look up the parent with symbolparent then iterate through the children using symbolchildren symlistcount

2446590
equals	tostring
i m implementing equals hashcode and tostring of my entities using all the available fields in the bean

2446590
equals	tostring
i m wondering what s the correct way to for implementing equals and tostring on an entity object

2446633
lotus	groupwise
i am accessing lotus and groupwise using javax.mail via imap recursively accessing all folders and processing email i find

2446633
lotus	groupwise
but in folders like tasklist and calendar those are from groupwise but i think i remember lotus had similar things i get the items in there as instances of imapmessage and so they are processed as if they were mail

2446639
tostring	getter
edit the same rules about not accessing the class properties directly applies to tostring method as well - only using the getter guarantees that the information really contained in the class is returned

2446642
post	get
however you should have something that works in the href but since this appears to be making a significant change on the server you should be using post not get so a link is the wrong tool

2446652
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout
the standard events are mouseover and mouseout but they can be a bit tricky to work with because they bubble you get mouseout for instance whenever the mouseleave any descendant element

2446652
mouseover	mouseout
with appropriate logic though they re not to bad to work with and in fact if you have lots of these you probably want to use mouseover and mouseout rather than the alternative below because you can set them on just a parent container and then work out which descendant element is involved which can be simpler in some cases and more complicated in others

2446652
mouseleave	mouseenter
ie provides mouseenter and mouseleave which are much easier to work with because they don t bubble but of course ie-specific

2446652
mouseleave	mouseenter
...which is really just a shortcut for setting up mouseenter and mouseleave handlers but still wonderfully concise

2446660
ubuntu	linux
platform - ubuntu linux

2446692
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i want it to be above the gã videre button on the page it works in safari and google-chrome but not ie or firefox

2446705
postgresql	mysql
you could configure mysql using the postgresql-sql-mode and you could also make a dump ready to import in postgresql by using --compatible in mysqldump

2446732
width	height	width	margin	box-sizing	margin	margin	height
i would completely remove those box-sizing properties and use more compliant properies like padding margin width and height for the sizing

2446733
implements	extends
first you don t extends interfaces but you do implements interfaces

2446749
viewdidload	dealloc
if you want it to start when the view is first created and keep ticking firing even when the view is not shown then you need to create it during init or viewdidload and then be sure to stop it when you dealloc or viewdidunload

2446759
versioning	upgrade
the lite versioning can have a link to upgrade to the full versioning but it must be a functioning app in its own right

2446760
folder	directory
using cmd line in a given directory i want to detect the most recently created written folder and delete all the contents of that folder

2446768
darcs	fossil
i like mercurial hg and darcs but my favourite by far remains fossil for personal projects as well as shared

2446779
pascal	delphi
i have some delphi pascal code from the dde emulator but the dde calls look rather different to the powerbuilder ones

2446840
firefox	safari
other browser do not although there are some properties you can use for firefox starting with -moz or for safari starting with -webkit

2446874
postgresql	mysql
in mysql and postgresql has constant complexity o 1 for search

2446931
width	height
if you have set the height and the width of your bitmapdata to the same width and height of the movieclip your reflecting you will get cut off

2446931
width	height
what you need to do it collect the real width and height of the rotating movieclip and when you redraw the bitmapdata use the new values

2446944
serializable	deserialization
there are methods for handing this though and custom serializable can be implemented by creating a readobject and writeobject method for deserialization and serializable

2446978
rss	feed
in the case of the rss feed to make sure that you are getting something back

2447030
temp	tmp
something that returns something such as c temp in windows tmp in linux and likewise for other platforms such as mac

2447048
profiling	instrumentation
instead of guessing where the bottleneck is i suggest that you profiling the code with instrumentation or even just using nslog with timestamps to see exactly where the code is spending most of its time

2447086
listview	gridview
listview gridview tablelayout

2447109
vim	textmate
textmate example of desired vim right margin highlighting

2447109
vim	textmate
by selecting highlight right margin in textmate s general preferences you can see an example of the desired vim behavior

2447147
mouseout	mouseleave
the mouseout of div1 should only get triggered when the mouseleave div1

2447147
mouseout	mouseleave
changed the mouseout to mouseleave and the code worked.

2447153
fadein	fadeout
the fadein and fadeout work in all browsers

2447173
post	get
the issue i have is that foreign key fields and those using initial take all associated entries all records associated with that record other then the one entry i wanted e.g instead of getting a primary key i get the primary key post subject post body and all other values attributed with that record

2447177
mouseout	mouseleave
use the mouseleave event instead or mouseout for this it handles your specific issue

2447177
mouseout	mouseleave
the mouseleave event differs from mouseout in the way it handles event bubbling

2447193
rank	max
instead of getting the first value for the max date it rank the dates and gets all values for the latest date

2447279
notepad++	textpad
i know there s an addon out there for textpad and one for notepad++

2447288
int	chars
binary to ascii was fairly simple with the strtol function and all and my code for converting a chars which is practically an int was this

2447324
int	boolean
mysqlio.nextrow field int boolean int boolean boolean boolean buffer line 1405

2447372
outputstream	inputstream
streaming is only possible if you have an inputstream at the one side and an outputstream at the other side

2447402
put	get
now to use it get inputstream from httpconnection and put it all in saxparser.parse

2447429
ogre	irrlicht
in my opinion going with irrlicht or ogre is a good idea

2447457
getter	setter
the spec requires that both a setter and getter are defined to be able to use the syntactic sugar for calling the setter

2447457
getter	setter
furthermore the getter must be visible in order to use the setter

2447477
vaadin	wicket
but remember some web frameworks like wicket and vaadin for instance use this method to show its values

2447511
google-chrome	safari
although there is another alignment problems with ie but not in google-chrome or safari

2447511
google-chrome	safari
i had it working before but the only thing i can think of to do is target safari and google-chrome

2447511
google-chrome	safari
need to change these for google-chrome and safari

2447531
inherited	properties
i would make use of aggregation instead of inherited create a new vcl component that delegates its methods to the existing component you then have full control over what properties to publish

2447580
int	chars	int	double
sizeof int sizeof float sizeof double sizeof chars sizeof 167 sizeof 3.1415926 and

2447587
innodb	myisam
if in addition you need to do continuously transactions on these tables as opposed to just load data every now and then and mostly query that data you probably need to look into innodb and not the default myisam tables

2447614
opera	google-chrome
also try with some other browsers like opera or google-chrome if you have access to them

2447658
sorting	filtering
this datatable has pagination sorting and filtering

2447665
puts	gets
the ontouchevent method gets called every time the user puts a finger down moves a finger already on the screen or lifts a finger

2447677
post	put
i m well into implementing a rest service on a windows ce platform if that matters and i started out using ibm s general definitions of using post for creating inserts and put for updating

2447703
put	get
it would then put those together and get the address of the element only when you dereference it something like this

2447714
post	put
we use post create put update

2447740
post	put
to using post instead of put

2447792
int	chars
think of a chars as just a small int

2447799
draggable	droppable
what i do is i set the foreground div with the draggable as the droppable but use the dropover and dropout features to determine if the item is outside the foreground div

2447823
put	get	post	put	post	get
the reset action is a idempotent action if you call it n times you will always get the same result so imho you should use a put call instead post as post is not idempotent

2447839
kde	gnome
i like the appearance it has on gnome or kde but even getting it to look like windows xp would be an improvement

2447851
free	malloc
if you would free j in the end of the loop you could get the same behavior as before depending on the implementation of malloc and free

2447874
children	parent
in school portal there s a student profile and a parent profile now the problem is how can i achieve a relationship between this two.actually the scenario is one dad can have multiple children studying in different school now suppose dad wants to look out the result remarks of his all children on what basis he can achieve that this is my question

2447876
post	put
consider placing an order if you put to orders my-new-order the meaning can only ever be update the resource identified by orders my-new-order whereas post orders can mean place a new order if the post accepting resource has the appropriate semantics

2447909
aggregate-functions	sum
i realize that an aggregate-functions like average need to be rewritten into a count and sum to the nodes and that the coordinator divides the sum of the sums with the sum of the counts to get the average

2447933

i want to get all the parent sorted by their number of children

2448299
typedef	struct
you don t need to do an explicit typedef for classes and struct

2448307
typedef	struct
the problem is you can t template a typedef also there is no need to typedef struct in c++

2448316
typedef	struct
note that there is no need for the typedef trick in c++ you can use struct without the struct modifier just fine in c++

2448318
boost	stl
note that boost s ptr_vector cannot be used safely with some of the stl algorithms which may be a problem for you

2448378
children	parent
you might consider maintaining a derived attribute on your parent entity call it childrencount that reflects the number of children related to the parent if this is feasible for your situation

2448378
children	parent
it s not the cleanest solution but if you keep it as an nsnumber in the parent entity you d have access to it even if children is faulted and you can sort on it directly

2448383
put	get
once you create your api url and get your results back you can then put them in an array and send that data to a uitableview

2448391
serializable	deserialization
however if you already have the flowdocuments as xml files than it would be easier just to dump them into a nvarchar max field with no added serializable deserialization overhead

2448434
sorting	grouping
on myisam tables in some cases the subselects tend to be faster than grouping by queries due to the fact that grouping by in myisam is quite expensive due to sorting materialization overhead

2448464
getter	setter
when you bind a component the getter and setter are supposed to be simple - only get set - no logic inside them

2448475
cairngorm	mate
use some mvc framework like cairngorm or mate to begin with

2448508
getter	setter

2448580
subtract	add
i needed to add subtract from my my

2448592
setinterval	settimeout
you can also pre-load the in-page cache in the background using setinterval or better settimeout

2448628
getter	setter
and indeed you should preferably not do any business logic in getter setter

2448659
min	max
i ve been grabbing all of the matching records and using php to calculate the min and max value for each page which seems inefficient and likely to cause scaling problems

2448659
min	max
the only possible technique i ve been able to come up with is some way of having a calculated variable that increments every x records x records to a page grouping by that and selecting min max for each page grouping.

2448661
procfs	bsd
the linux kernel does not provide a mechanism in procfs to report on tcp socket states unlike bsd and other unix-like oss

2448828
mvp	presenter
with mvp you normally bind the view ui with the presenter in the presenter

2448906
stdout	stderr
this will interleave stdout and stderr as desired in a real file that is conveniently open for you

2448917
put	get
if you put the code in the app your will not be able to maintain it and you ll get rsi from all that clicking

2448940
min	max
to figure this the min and max per page you d need to use temporary tables and then calculate the per page min max for your entire resultset from this temp table

2448953
children	parent
parent has children

2448979
for-loop	loops
it s been a while since i ve used delphi but my guess based on the error is that the excelworksheet collection is not enumerated which would mean doing a for each style loops would not work and you d need to use a c-like for-loop

2449043
capitalization	uppercase
navigation and logos should start with an uppercase or if it s a name the proper spelling for the name iphone not iphone or iphone. only use css capitalization for stylization

2449052
cos	sin
you have the angle and the length of movement which is your hypotenuse so you should be able to use sin or cos to calculate the amount of x and y movement required

2449074
getter	setter
you could do this by altering your getter setter for the parameters property so anything that uses the paramters would validate them on the first use

2449198
vsto	add-in
in the case of a vsto add-in this is set to the user documents folder automatically

2449198
vsto	add-in
if your file will be deployed to the same folder as your vsto add-in assembly you can use appdomain.currentdomain.basedirectory to build the full path to the file

2449199
post	get
browsers only support get and post for sending forms

2449243
getter	setter
here s an example that adds a getter and setter

2449260
post	get
according to the html4 spec form element only supports get and post

2449279
firefox	safari
ran in the same problem and this solved it for me in all major browsers ie6+ firefox safari in mac xp

2449297
int	chars
take one dictionary that maps chars to int

2449301
stdout	stderr
it does not return the output from stdout or stderr

2449301
stdout	stderr
to grab the output from stdout or stderr use subprocess.popen

2449334
qtableview	qtablewidget
i would recommend changing from a qtablewidget to a qtableview with an appropriate model

2449343
inherited	properties
i know that this is normal dependency properties behaviour because the properties is inherited but that s not what i want in this case

2449370
post	put
the reason to use post as insert and put as update is that post is the only nonidempotent and unsafe operation according to http

2449393
hash	salt
i have used a salt string with hash passwords but not with a two-way encryption

2449400
post	put
when the intention is to create a new resource we can use put if we know what the identifier of the resource should be and we can use post if we want the server to determine the identifier of the new resource

2449404
calloc	malloc
which was previously allocated using malloc or calloc

2449404
calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	malloc
free and malloc calloc etc is used for basic types but in c++ new and delete can be used for them likewise so there isn t much reason to use malloc in c++ except for compatibility reasons

2449408
free	malloc
and one more thing you should never pair malloc delete or new free

2449414
free	malloc
when new and delete are used with standard c types in c++ source they behave like malloc and free

2449472
int	chars	int	boolean
many of the native object types such as boolean byte chars int long object short string vector hashtable are implicitly persistable

2449478
m2e	pom.xml
if you just want to create a default pom.xml and enable m2e features so i m assuming you do not currently have an alternative automated build setup you re trying to import and i m assuming you re talking about the m2e plugin

2449478
m2e	pom.xml
the m2e plugin provides a right-click option on a project to add this default pom.xml

2449554
profiling	instrumentation
instrumentation uses dtrace under the hood and provides a huge wealth of profiling and measurement tools

2449554
profiling	instrumentation
the time profiling template will get you time profiling and call stacks but i don t think there is any way to get a call graph for the entire execution though there s so much in instrumentation i may easily be wrong

2449569
globalization	localization
the datetime object has the ability to offset from local time to utc gmt time using .getutcxxx this will convert from the local time instance to a utc offset based on the current globalization localization setting being used in the runtime

2449601
maven-jar-plugin	pom.xml
i ve got an existing pom.xml file that includes a maven-jar-plugin section

2449635
mouse	keyboard
haveâ for instance mouse or keyboard timing inputâ that are then

2449638
inherited	properties
i read in wpf unleashed that wrapping something in a frame control ..isolates the content from the rest of the ui and properties that would normally be inherited down the element tree stop when they reach the frame but wrapping the button in the example above in a frame doesn t work

2449648
pop-up	dialog
i need to have a pop-up dialog like the color dialog or save dialog but for choosing a date from a calendar

2449648
pop-up	dialog
the datetimepicker is what i need but i don t know how to launch this like a pop-up dialog in c#

2449663
debian-based	ubuntu
for debian-based distros like ubuntu you ll want to create a .deb file

2449695
versioning	upgrade
the commenter below correctly mentions that the express editions don t come with mfc so i guess your option is to either link to mfc dynamically or upgrade to a versioning that supports static linking

2449701
ubuntu	debian
for ubuntu debian you could read the ubuntu packaging guide

2449701
redhat	fedora
for redhat here is the rpm guide from fedora

2449723
try-catch	exception-handling
a try-catch is expensive when an exception-handling is thrown and usually you want to try and detect that situation before the exception-handling is thrown

2449730
firefox	safari	webkit	gecko	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
you can use csssandpaper to use the transform property which can be used to rotate elements in gecko firefox webkit safari google-chrome opera and even internet explorer

2449772
subtract	add
note that since it allocates space for one audiobuffer as part of the struct itself you subtract one from the number you really want to get the space to add on to the allocation

2449825
debian-based	ubuntu
almost any distribution system out there has an package generator - try checkinstall for debian-based ubuntu etc. deb packages - just run it and it will do all the stuff required for you

2449844
google-chrome	firefox
one good way to get that is to have your script installed as part of a plug-in for firefox or google-chrome using a toolkit such as greasemonkey

2449875
octal	hex
as to what actual octal hex values ã is associated with i m not sure

2449882
maven	pom.xml
as far as i know there is nothing that will automagically convert an eclipse project into a maven project modify the layout create a pom.xml generate and feed it with metadata detect libraries and their versions to add them to the pom.xml etc

2449939
hide	show
option 1 use conditional-suppression logic to hide show redundant fields

2449944
button	checkbox
to deselect all checkbox you can iterate the container s children or easier use buttongroup.getelements to enumerate the button in a particular group

2449964
post	put
anyway - i just put up a quick blog post on it as well here

2450006
glassfish	weblogic
if you want to use a more robust mainstream java server instead of jetty you can deploy a war bundle of your application to tomcat glassfish weblogic etc

2450024
ilist	icollection
an ilist is an icollection

2450024
ilist	icollection
you could implement icollection and if you need more methods from ilist in the future you can just change it without causing harm to the clients

2450121
inherited	properties
you can t just say don t inherited because the control has to inherited its properties values from somewhere

2450157
unsigned	short
you need to special case the non-promoted types char short and their unsigned signed versions thereof since applied to two of such operands of differing types the result will be neither of them

2450178
for-loop	loops
also as mark byers pointed out loops would be simpler to understand if you refactored it into a for-loop rather than a while

2450286
google-chrome	firefox
anyway the above code will do what you re after tested here in google-chrome and firefox looks good and only requesting the page once

2450357
unsigned	short
retrieving from unsigned short

2450368
put	get
i think that real problem with code quality or testing is that you have to put a lot of work into it and you get nothing back

2450377
integer	unsigned
you can replace the integer types uintxx_t with the corresponding type of your language like unsigned long

2450474
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
but it seems to only be broken in ie7 ie8 ff3 safari opera google-chrome camino all worked

2450483
width	height
they have a font which itself has a name and a size a numberformat height width orientation etc

2450508
ready	each
make sure to index a dummy term in between each name so that ready phil doesn t match the document

2450530
apache-poi	xlrd
i could not find a decrypt method under apache-poi or python s xlrd module

2450555

2450621
width	height
try to set width and height

2450685
children	parent
everything works great when saving the parent and the children

2450685
children	parent
i can t seem to get all the children with a specific parent

2450687
fflush	gets
my problem is that application_endrequest never gets called on a 404 error so if my view does not render i completely block database access until my fflush takes place

2450709
getter	setter
take a look on getter and setter in frontcontroller view layout and viewrenderer classes

2450726
width	height	portrait	landscape
unfortunately when in landscape mode the width and height remains the same as in portrait mode

2450795
for-loop	loops
and you could make use of a for-loop instead of a while loops for example

2450814
realloc	malloc
start by malloc ing a reasonably-sized buffer copy data into it and realloc yourself more space as needed

2450818
gif	png
in mac os x textures as gif don t work only png and jpg

2450860
qdialog	qwidget
if you want to call resize you need to create your own qwidget or qdialog

2450862
lan	localhost
i know my rmi app works correctly - it works fine when the server is on localhost and inside the lan but when connecting to an external rmi server it fails when trying to make stub calls

2450891
post	get
in particular you ll see that it needs to be sent as a post rather than the more common get

2450896
implements	extends
i chose the second option and derived a cursor by extends the sqlitecursor class and implements the sqlitedatabase.cursorfactory interface with the following code

2450902

what apis are provided by windows for cpu power management i m interested in cpu frequency scaling setting min and max cpu frequency - similar to what you can do in control panel in power plans but in a programmatic way

2450906
width	height
i m looking for an easy way to get width and height dimensions for image files in ruby without having to use imagemagick or imagescience running snow leapard

2450910
swt	swing
you can also script swing or swt with jruby either directly or via one of the numerous frameworks

2450910
webkit	gecko
you might manage to integrate protovis via a webkit or gecko like redcar does embedding or a java html renderer there are some

2451001
mate	puremvc	cairngorm	mate	cairngorm	puremvc
everything else i ve seen primarily cairngorm puremvc mate still has a lot of either code or xml bloat which is something i want to avoid

2451161
ironruby	ironpython
i ve given thought to using ironpython ironruby and luainterface but frankly they re all a bit overpowered for what i want to do

2451161
scatter	graphing
to come up with the data for the graphing the user will choose whether it s a bar graphing scatter plot etc. and then to actually obtain the data i would like to obtain some kind of list from the user simply entering something sql-ish along the lines of

2451202
inherited	properties
i have a series of models all which inherited from a base model properties

2451252
titlebar	window
i get a window whose full size is 500x500 including the title bar etc. where i really need a window whose size is something like 504x520 to account for the window border and titlebar

2451255
int	double
is not applicable for the arguments int double

2451262
jboss	glassfish
apart from jboss and glassfish you may be interested in jetty - an extremely lightweight yet powerful alternative

2451300
chgrp	chmod
as bob belongs to dev i can set the permissions correctly with chmod but it appears chgrp is throwing back operation errors

2451313
int	double
the method put int map in the type map is not applicable for the arguments int double

2451313
int	double
so the type of pegplprices.put int double is double

2451321
hide	show
specifically i want to show or hide pictures based on a value in the data

2451337
opera	google-chrome
tested to work on ff3.6 ie7 google-chrome 4 and opera 10

2451456
hide	show
you want to show the panel when the user hovers over the original button and hide it again when the user moves their mouse away from the menu

2451456
mouseover	mouseout
a better approach is to have the mouseout event initiate a timer which will start the transition after a brief delay and then cancel this timer if you receive another mouseover event in the meantime

2451468
qiodevice	qnetworkreply
qnetworkreply in its turn is an inheritor of qiodevice therefore you are able to call its readall method in order to receive the response data

2451473
post	get
this is a long post basically summarizing all the things i learned about django in order to get static files to work it took me a while to understand how all the different parts fit together

2451486
gif	png
yeah read about headers of jpg png gif and other popular image formats and try to recognize their headers in your data

2451493
stdout	stderr
route stdout and stderr to a file

2451535
nsurl	nsstring
i know one upper bound is 2 32 - 1 bytes because that s the maximum length of a nsstring on the iphone and nsurl can be converted to nsstrings

2451552
strsplit	substr
finally note that you can use substr to extract your letters and numbers instead of doing strsplit

2451594
for-loop	arrays
a divide-by-two search in a sorted arrays of size n can be written as a non-nested for-loop too but it would have o log n time

2451605
stdout	stderr
redirecting the standard error stderr and stdout to file use the following syntax

2451634
bmp	png
it is entirely probable the data is simply jpg bmp or png and the tool is basically an sql frontend

2451644
jgit	egit
egit jgit is a reimplementation of git

2451660
for-loop	arrays
there are more verbose ways of iterating over characters in an arrays regular for-loop characteriterator etc but if you re willing to pay the cost tochararray for-each is the most concise

2451671
profiling	debugging
if you ve already tried to execute a .php file remove the existing run profiling you maybe weren t aware that you created run debugging configurations...

2451674
integer	unsigned
type if t is a unsigned integer type then the same type as t if t is an signed integer type then the corresponding unsigned type

2451674
int	chars
otherwise if t is an enumerated or chars type chars or wchar_t then an unsigned int type with the same width as t

2451677
google-chrome	firefox
a useful way of reverse-engineering something like this is to go into a browser like firefox or google-chrome others do this as well but these are the two i use most right-click on the element and select inspect element. this will give you a nicely-formatted at least firefox formats it i think google-chrome might not view of the markup as well as currently applied styles

2451683
awt	swing
either of these should be inside a awt frame or swing jframe

2451683
awt	swing
window creation is handled by java via awt or swing

2451735
jcheckbox	jradiobutton
note that this code will work equally well if you replace all the instances of jradiobutton with jcheckbox

2451735
button	checkbox
however this is not recommended because the standard way to indicate that only one thing can be chosen is to use radio button rather than checkbox

2451735
button	checkbox
if you really don t like the way jradiobutton button look then i suggest playing with your swing look-and-feel to change all of your checkbox and radio button in your application until you are happy with the result

2451747
put	get
i want to put an encrypted license list on the web so that valid users can use my app to get that list and check to see if their license ids are on the list so the apps can be activated

2451767
midi	osc
in addition chuck supports midi osc hid device and multi-channel audio

2451775
width	height
to change my reports to landscape i simply swap the pagesize property s height and width values on the report itself

2451775
width	height
if i make the width 29.7cm and the height 21cm i get a landscape report

2451775
width	height	portrait	landscape
reports are portrait by default though - if yours are showing up as landscape and nobody has changed the height and width of the page then i m not sure what s happening

2451776
multiplying	addition
it was one where it would multiplying by addition

2451790
folder	directory

2451792
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
if you want only one value stored you need a single variable you can also allocate memory dinamically but it requires a good knolewdge of pointers and memory allocation management functions malloc realloc free etc.

width	height
mdi was first invented for two obsolete modes which are mosaic where every window is arranged to have about the same height width and cascade

2451914
int	chars
means read an int and put it in int1. so you feed it z which is not a valid chars in an int and it simply aborts the read and leaves whatever in int1

2451926
width	height
what i mean is something that gives the height of elements like the status bar tab bar navigation bar default tableviewcell height and such things as width of accessory view indentation etc default icon sizes default font sizes for ui elements if they need to be mimicked for instance etc etc etc

2451934
accessor	properties
xsd.exe will autogenerate the xxxspecified properties and accessor if you set the minoccurs attribute as minoccurs 0 for an element .

when viewing as an unsigned integer all 64 bits are significant in producing the integer value

2456756
integer	unsigned
by dropping the sign bit bit 64 you end up with 63 0 bits xoring with 1 bits gives you 63 1 bits add +1 and the whole thing rolls over to give you an unsigned integer having bit 64 set to 1 and the rest set to 0 - which is the same thing you got with cout but as a negative number

the js failure occurs with firefox google-chrome and ie

2457594
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested this myself using firefox and google-chrome on a thumb drive

2457644
union	distinct
union potentially if you want a distinct list of entries i beleive it only does a distinct is another alternative

2457708
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
all our information is encrypted using public key encryption and the keypair is user dependent its generated on the server and the private key is symmetric encrypted using the users password which is also hash on the database so basically on first run the user sends in his password via a ssl connection and the password is used with the addition of salt to generate an md5 hash also the password is used to encrypt the private key and the private key is stored on the server

2457710
google-chrome	firefox
we had a similar problem couple months ago where we wouldn t have any problem with it in firefox or google-chrome but when we were to show the combobox on ie the screen would freeze and it would start responding again in a couple minutes

2457715
memcached	apc
generally the delay involved in reading the file from disk is much higher than a caching system such as memcached or apc

2457749
xsd.exe	svcutil.exe
i understand that there are limitations to the types of schema supported by svcutil.exe xsd.exe when targeting the datacontractserializer and even xmlserializer

int	chars
public const type int chars

2457840
concave	convex
so how can i automatically break apart a concave polygon into convex ones or even all triangles

2457919
affinity	processors
edit as the documentation on queryperformancecounter states it should not matter which processors is called - and in fact the whole hacking around with thread affinity is only needed if the apic acpi detection fails and the system resorts to using the tsc

2457947
width	height
my xib has the proper height width but it seems to get overridden when i call it like this

2457950
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
put the ints into an nsdatecomponents object then ask an nscalendar object to change that into a date

folder	directory
to get the base assets folder you need to use the assetsmanager to list the directory with just quotes

2458068
subtract	add
then you can use calendar s add to subtract one day

2458072
width	height
the gray background i d guess is created with a big fixed position with width 100 and height 100 and some opacity

2458099
for-loop	arrays
i know i could use a for-loop and reference the next item by it s index but it wouldn t work for associative arrays

rss	feed
the query i m trying to write is for the items field of an rss feed

2458153
google-chrome	safari
current webkit based browsers as of 3 16 2010 safari and google-chrome exhibit the following bugs

2458153
hash	md5
the only fix i can think of is this when you save the state from the first time you visit page a take a md5 or sha1 hash of the page and store that with the input element state

2458153
hash	md5
when you go back to page a only restore state if the md5 or sha1 hash is the same

2458163
mouse	keyboard
to detect what event you got with you mouse or keyboard to test it u can use

2458169
versioning	upgrade
but remember that parse has undergone major upgrade and revisions in the most recent versioning based on feedback of users

2458209
equals	gethashcode
yes i could implement equals gethashcode to make them seem the same

2458211
post	get
seems like you just want the answer to your homework so i wont post more than this but this should be enough to get you on the right track

2458233
free	malloc
malloc error for object 0x60e2c4 pointer being free was not allocated

2458250
equals	gethashcode
you should implement equals gethashcode methods

2458274
post	get
the post has a similar refinement and the getnewform combines the definition of http method and path into one so that get requests for appointments new are handled by that method

2458310
onfocus	onblur	hide	show
i am using a jquery pluggin for a quick and easy form validation my forms use the input s default value as a label and i have a little onfocus and onblur javascript function to show and hide this when the user starts to type

simply implements comparable myabs on class b which if i interpret your question correctly extends myabs

2458373
uilabel	uitextview
both seem to work fine for uilabel but fail for uitextview elements

2458389
folder	directory
hopefully linux i assume that s what you are running on could handle millions of files in a directory otherwise you might need to hash on the task id to get a sub folder

2458440
jar	war
however following that advice along with how i think i m supposed to make an executable jar war isn t working

2458440
jar	war
to fix the first one i put the jetty jar files in the base of the war file and tried again -- same error

2458469
implements	extends
also if you want it baked in you will probably need to extends the gridview and implements your own code

2458495
integer	unsigned
i know java doesn t allow unsigned types so i was wondering how it casts an integer to a byte

2458536
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
as of c89 you do not have to cast the result of malloc calloc or realloc and doing so can suppress a potentially useful warning

2458536
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
it unclutters the code a little bit and you don t have to go back and update all your malloc calloc realloc calls if you change the type of a

2458549
intersect	contains
i m not familiar with triangular bezier patch but if it can always be contains within a triangle then if the ray intersect the triangle it must intersect the curve inside it too

2458600
children	parent
inherited attributes which must be passed down from parent nodes to children nodes of the abstract syntax tree during the semantic analysis of the parsing process are a problem for bottom-up parsing because in bottom-up parsing the parent nodes of the abstract syntax tree are created after creation of all of their children

2458613
width	height
you have to specify width and height

2458691
inherited	subclassing
i ve also seen a solution of the similar problem by subclassing jframe and further inherited

2458697
filesystems	xfs
also the kinds of filesystems that support this xfs ext4 are not normally used on usb sticks

2458698
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works in latest versions of ie firefox safari and google-chrome

2458766
twitter	myspace
a simple solution would be to use janrain - they handle login for multiple networks including myspace facebook twitter yahoo

2458780
stdout	stderr
the article provides various ways to address this problem including the source code for a streamgobbler class that consumes stderr and stdout in background threads

2458849

2458918
ironruby	ironpython
hosting the dlr and ironpython or ironruby could be a good choice here because you get a well tested environment and all the optimisations the dlr provides

2458941
stringstream	fstream
and we do or any other output stream like an fstream or stringstream the compiler will look for and find our function and call it

2458944

2458994
post	get
the question that i have is how do i get video id and how do i post my video to the server

2459044
hash	salt
it s quite easy to store a salt hash of a credit card number rather than the number itself for secure lookups

2459044
hash	salt
that s why we salt our hash

2459044
hash	salt
for the case of credit cards this should be the same -- a random salt for each instance of the credit card being hash

2459044
hash	salt
the salt and hash are right there and don t need to change while still allowing for audit checks of the hash

2459071
spweb	spsite	sharepoint	spsite
problem creating a site column using the sharepoint api object model with incorrect case in the url for the spsite or spweb object will cause the new column to throw an exception if an attempt to edit it is made through the site columns gallery

2459071
spweb	spsite	sharepoint	spsite
then if i create a new site column using the sharepoint object model and happen to use when instantiating the spsite and spweb objects the site column will be made available but when trying to access it through the gallery the error above is generated

2459080
ironruby	ironpython
i m wary using ironruby though because it doesn t appear as mature as ironpython

2459090
post	get
disclaimer i have no idea how the panda video converter works this is just an example of using requestbuilder to make get and post requests to a server

2459090
post	get
since the only elements of this process are post and get requests you can use the requestbuilder to make these requests for you in gwt

2459090
post	get
this just serves as a basic example of using requestbuilder to make get post calls

2459105
doc	rtf
use rtf rather than doc

2459117
children	parent
it has a mdi parent form that is hosting a few children forms

2459155
win64	windows
however you are defining a win64 as a wix variable not a windows installer property

2459155
win64	windows
if has the right value when the setup is created then this will cause a win64 property to be recorded in the windows installer database the msi file and the property will be available during installation for use in a condition element

2459179
portrait	landscape
i want my uiview subclass to behave so that when it is fitted in portrait orientation is has a certain size and another size when fitted in landscape mode

2459180
firefox	safari
onfocus doesn t seem to work in a contenteditable div on firefox safari

2459193
tapestry	wicket	jsf	tapestry	jsf	wicket
there are other java web frameworks that do this such as tapestry wicket and jsf icefaces etc

2459197
pull	push
fossil recently changed the details of how it saves passwords which impacted the way authentication is done during clone push pull and sync

2459209
put	get	post	put	post	get
rest-based services get post put

2459291
put	get
the problem is that if i put a list of exam_normal at an exam class if i try to persist exam i get an error because it tries to persist exam_normal first but it cant because the primary key of exam is missing because it isn t persisted.

2459349
google-chrome	firefox
i ve reproduced the problem in firefox and google-chrome so far

2459403
operands	scalar
unqualified scalar type and the operands shall have scalar type

2459439
codeigniter	silverstripe
i ve tried defining a validation_errors function in my controller which is what i usually do with silverstripe s sapphire framework but this won t with codeigniter

2459466
put	get
if you put it in the where predicate then you ll get no results because there will be no matching rows in the postviews table

2459486
next	except
works nicely except i am at a loss as to how to attempt the next steps

2459529
telerik	componentart
telerik or componentart

2459529
telerik	componentart
i have used componentart but i just reviewed telerik and it looks like they might have better functionality for the same price

2459597
cvs	svn
svn newbie although so far i really like it coming from cvs

2459615
width	height
incidentally however there is no css width or height specifier for the rest of the page

2459659
folder	directory
one solution could be to make the images folder a virtual directory on the iis but i would like to know if this can be done without creating a virtual directory for the images folder

2459694
folder	directory
you open up the internet information services manager and find the file you want to modify the caching settings for or you can do it on the folder that contains the file - for example if you want to do all files in a directory which is pretty common

2459719
inherited	properties
your class c does not inherited from object or any other new-style class so it is an old-style class and therefore does not support properties

2459731
hash	md5
if it is the exact same file the md5 hash will be the same for both images

2459787
merb	ruby-on-rails
i m porting an application from merb 1.1 1.8.7 to ruby-on-rails 3 beta 1.9.1 that uses json responses containing html fragments a json container specifying an update on a user record and the updated user row looks like

2459787
put	get	merb	ruby-on-rails
in merb since whatever a controller method returns is given to the client one can put together a hash assign a rendered partial to one of the keys and return hash.to_json though that certainly may not be the best way. in ruby-on-rails it seems that to get data back to the client one must use render and render can only be called once so rendering the hash to json won t work because of the partial render

2459795
jsf	seam
a nice article besides seam in action book about jsf seam can be found here

2459824
jpql	hql
try calculating the random beforehand and construct your jpql hql native query with the pre-calculated random value

2459829
richfaces	tomahawk
if you look at component frameworks richfaces tomahawk etc - they do it this way

2459830
hash	md5
that means that it s likely an md5 hash

2459831
rss	feed
what i thought of is to publish an rss feed of entries in asp.net site and routinely scrape that data into mysql on linux host

2459855
width	height
in which case you might need to either maximize the layoutroot inside the page or specify a proper width and height for the itself

2459882
folder	directory
however my os file system has a limit on the number of sub directory meaning storing the original folder structure is not going to work

2459886
boost	allocator
boost interprocess vector takes an allocator type as a template parameter

2459886
boost	allocator
this is wrong and is exactly why boost interprocess vector needs a shared memory allocator

2459932
vim	emacs
you should get your environment set up be it vim emacs or an ide such that you can easily move back and forth between static code in text files and an interactive repl

2459997
int	chars
to get the ascii code for a chars just get the chars into a chars and cast the chars to an int

2459998
rubygems	bundler
keep in mind that the latest version of bundler requires updated rubygems

2460011
xlsx	xlsm
will fix xlsx or xlsm files

2460085
put	get
i have an application that uses msword automation to edit some documents after they save and close word i need to grab the modified file and put it back on the repository there is only one scenario where i can t get it to work and that is

2460123
hide	show
i am able to toggle visible property to show and hide it but not able to change the imageurl property

2460139
kde	gnome
i run qt applications regularly on my mac and occasionally on windows and i m entirely certain that neither the macs nor the windows pcs have kde installed nor gnome for that matter

2460146
getter	setter
- avoids defensive getter and setter

2460198
ia-32	x86
as i understand it the x86 ia-32 architecture still has the same basic limited register set today that it always did but the internal register count has grown tremendously but these internal registers are not generally available and are used with register renaming to achieve parallel pipelining of code that otherwise could not be parallelizable

2460208
gif	png
this uses a negative lookahead to ensure that the regex matches a string only if the string does not contain pdf png jpg or gif at the specified position

2460209
rss	feed
track their rss feed to find new content

2460240
gilead	dozer
this will result in b not being fetched by default but b_id will be available even after the session is closed and running your result through something like dozer or gilead

2460261
opera	firefox
my plugin works perfectly on firefox and opera

2460291
dictionary	map
f# map - c# dictionary

2460296
rss	feed
i wouldn t use rss feed and polling for the following reasons

2460296
rss	feed
rss feed normally only list the last 10 or so items that are new

2460322
ubuntu	linux
i tested your code on a linux machine ubuntu 9.10 python 2.6.4 and got the valueerror

2460330
perl	tcl
that ruled out perl python and tcl along with scheme

2460464
nsurl	nsstring
you can then use the path-manipulation methods of nsstring or of nsurl or the equivalent function for cfurl to tack a sub-path onto that

2460464
nsuserdefaults	cfpreferences
if you want to save a preferences file you probably should be using nsuserdefaults or cfpreferences instead of handling plists yourself

2460464
nsuserdefaults	cfpreferences
nsuserdefaults and cfpreferences work as expected in a sandbox

2460566
maven	pom.xml
execute the maven test goal over the parent pom.xml you will notice that 3 4 tests from org.seamoo.persistence.jdo.jdogenericdaoimpltest passed while all tests from org.seamoo.persistence.jpa.jpagenericdaoimpltest failed

2460576
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
also you generally don t want to explicitly make uinavigationcontroller s view a subview of another view unless that other view is your uiwindow

2460674
mouse	keyboard
so as you can understand the features are quite obvious ability to easily simulate keyboard and mouse functions read input process and display output execute programs manipulate windows register hotkeys etc

2460677
google-chrome	safari
if you are using firebug or the google-chrome safari developer tools execute the above in the console and you ll see the stack overflow header shrink by 50

2460688
serializable	deserialization
if both the client and the server are written in .net c# i would recommend wcf insted of raw sockets as it saves you a from a lot of plumbing code with serializable and deserialization synchronization of messages etc

2460764
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for firefox google-chrome and safari nothing happens

2460797
selecteditem	selectedindex
you can use selectedindex or selecteditem properties of the combobox

2460803
wicket	stripes
you should employ some rapid web development framework for that i would like you to look into wicket or stripes

2460880
width	height
by default if you assign a percentage value to a height width it will be relative to it s direct parent dimensions

2460940
folder	directory
every time i recompile the code it is deleting the .svn folder in the bin debug directory and hence svn is showing obstructed error

2460951
downcasting	upcasting
i feel that also using collections.checkedset and friends are not needed since it is statically certain that the returned collection only contains someclass objects this would not be the case when downcasting instead of upcasting but that s not what i m doing

2460967
post	put
this is to have a clean start - in case people put additional thigns in with a post build event script

2460991
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
my code starts with mousedown and then records all points on mousemove until it receives a mouseup event which then calls recognizer.recognize on a stroke generated from all these points typically in the range of 100 points or so

2460996
superclass	subclassing
now imagine that someone has your returned collection - and they try to insert a different subclassing of superclass someotherclass

2460997
post	get
that s a completely different thing than what session_start does creating a session or resuming the current one based on a session identifier passed via a get or post request or passed via a cookie

2461013
folder	directory
install directions that include linking alaising public_html mymodule to a sub directory in your module folder is about the simplest it gets

2461017
ubuntu	linux
back home tested on linux ubuntu - lucid lynx - both with openjdk and sun-java from distribution repo and it works i used the .class file compiled on windows

2461057
put	get
but if you put an alert in between you get the result because the ajax call returns a result and assigns x in the time delay

2461098
ocl	uml
ocl and uml 2.2 demo in french language 3mn

2461098
sysml	uml
the interesting point of this demo is that using a single model for the entire project allows to be flexible enough to extend traditional uml and avoid sysml bpmn dsl additionals models because all information is built on the top of the uml 2.2 metamodel

2461179
rss	feed
out-of-the-box for node creation from rss feed

2461179
implements	extends
if as it sounds you have some control over the way the sharepoint data gets exposed you should be able to use feedapi successfully without any modifications at all but maybe you ll need to implements your own parser extension again check the additional modules already written to extends feedapi for examples if not solutions

2461249
tabcontrol	tabitem
it works on the first tabitem of my tabcontrol but not on the second

2461272
atoi	atof
atoi atof

2461307
hide	show
this allows you to hide show portions of the page when it gets printed

2461322
xapian	whoosh
in general is it a proper solution to do full text search like this or would you recommend using a search engine like solr whoosh or xapian

2461336
set	bag
for example i can expose an ilist from an interface and then as the implementer of a class that implements this interface i have the freedom to choose to use a sortedlist bag set or whatever collection best suites my needs

2461357
for-loop	loops
i highly recommend against playing with the for-loop counters from within loops itself

2461375
ostream	istream	std	ostream
std ostream and std istream

2461383
strtol	atof	strtol	atoi	atoi	atof
the functions atoi atof strtol

2461383
strtol	atoi
all have more or less cumbersome and non-obvious error checking involving errno strtol is way much better than atoi in any case so avoid using atoi

2461418
persistent	transient
this explains transient persistent objects

2461426
post	get
search queries should probably be gets rather than post because they are not changing anything - they are simply passing parameters to get certain information

2461435
post	get	trac	bugzilla
using a free trac or bugzilla instance to share the tasks look at the root post to get even more alternatives

2461448
mousemove	mousehover
to show the tooltip you can catch the mousehover and mousemove events

2461448
mousehover	mouseenter
note the mousehover event will only show up the first time the mouseenter a control

2461465
punctuation	words
soundex will give you a degree of confidence that two strings sound the same but you may have to do some upfront cleaning first like removing punctuation and tokenizing the string into separate words

2461469
javadb	hsqldb
use an embedded database like hsqldb h2 or derby javadb

2461472
stdout	stderr
run prg get its stdout and stderr separately

2461501
xapian	whoosh
we ve used haystack search a modular search application for django supporting many search engines solr xapian whoosh etc...

2461530
stdout	stderr
you can use the backtics to execute your external program and capture its stdout and stderr

2461530
stdout	stderr
by default the backticks discard the stderr and return only the stdout of the external program.so

2461530
stdout	stderr
will capture the stdout of the program cmd and discard stderr

2461530
stdout	stderr
to capture both stdout and stderr you can do

2461530
stdout	stderr
using the above you ll not be able to differenciate stderr from stdout

2461530
stdout	stderr
to separte stdout from stderr can redirect both to a separate file and read the files

2461552
children	parent
for each checked parent if it has zero children i delete it else i redirect to children edit view

2461552
children	parent
when there is no more child linked to the initial parent i must return to the parent delete action and continue from where i left delete the current parent whose children i just re-affected then delete the next checked parent

for-loop	loops
i break the code of the for-loop without using break like i have for-loop given below.and when i is 1 or 2 or 3 or any else but if condition is true then loops will be terminated because i will be 5 if the condition is true.and so no need of break is needed there.beacause i do not want to use break .i have done like this here.it works

2461900

google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome and firefox but in ie it doesn t

2462685
aptana	radrails
for ror i have aptana radrails installed

2462719
cvs	svn
i see that svn handles tagging differently then cvs

2462788
int	chars
however try to use an unsigned int to hold this value for all practical purposes it never makes sense to use a signed type to hold chars values ever if you are going to print them pass around

2462790
post	get
you need to aggregate the post by user using group by u.user_id get a count value for the number of post and order by that number in descending order

2462810
for-loop	arrays
thus the way the operator works in a for-loop iterating through an arrays

but it does weird stuff for directory - normal folder have unknown file type white paper icons recycle bin has vlc icon etc

2463455
facebook	fbconnect
in the fbconnect folder in your xcode project you should have a fbdialog.m with a initwithsession fbsession session in there you should find everything about the facebook login and logout buttons including the .png images that they point to

postgresql	mysql
that seems to work fine for mysql but postgresql flips out on it

2463525

i am using the scriptaculous draggable droppable scripts and have a problem when dragging into a scrolling div

2463574
draggable	droppable
i have another div with draggable items while all of the img elements are droppable

2463574

even if i set the scroll attribute when creating the draggable items it will scroll the grid div but not use the proper droppable item

2463576
children	parent
the sql returns parent and children for each parent i need the child to nest in a list

2463609
accessor	properties
finally i created an interface iggy that contained the accessor to the common properties

2463640
google-chrome	firefox
it seems that this is only possible in ie - firefox and google-chrome natively prevent text from being entered into upload input fields

2463728
vb.net	vb6
likely the problem is that you ve defined it here as a long which in vb6 is a 32-bit value but in vb.net is a 64-bit value

2463758
versioning	upgrade
and you should also have a story for upgrade scenarios perhaps using an application metadata versioning upgrad e step

2463793
vb.net	vb6
the length of integers and longs is different in vb6 than in vb.net

2463815

you can also check out this blog post which will show you how to dot source inside of the api and how to use this api to get at the other data streams in powershell

2463828
free	malloc
i just started out with c and have very little knowledge about performance issues with malloc and free

2463832
int	double
you are taking a long double which is a floating point format and printing it with ld which is an int format

2463841
linefeed	delimiter
also the terminated is the cr linefeed that typical text files are delimiter per row

2463856
free	malloc
it depends on the implementation of malloc and free

2463867
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
first i can assume that all urls that end with jpeg jpg bmp png or gif are images and others aren t

2463870
free	malloc
but remember you need to balance the number of malloc and free otherwise you get a memory leak.

2463889
free	malloc
certainly malloc ing and free ing at every iteration is a waste of resources since you can happily re-use the buffer

2463891
free	malloc
for 20 iterations you shouldn t be worrying about the performance of malloc free

2463891
free	malloc
even if you were to move the malloc free outside the loop using a maximum buffer as suggested by justin you shouldn t need to explicitly clear the buffer

2463896
free	malloc
you can t call free outside the loop if you are calling malloc inside

2463896
free	malloc
you will have malloc ed num_files times but only free once - you leaked the memory from all but the last

2463896
realloc	malloc
there are two main choices - malloc before the loop or just use an array if you know a size that will work for everything or use realloc

2463939
tapestry	wicket
as cletus said frameworks like tapestry ex wicket ex and others have some sort of client validation that uses javascript to validate forms etc

2463939
jstl	taglib
you can write your own validation jstl taglib maybe with the help of a js library jquery ... and plugins like jquery validation plugin

2463956

postgresql	mysql
edit the following tags were removed mysql postgresql to make room for other more representative tags

2464015
ubuntu	linux
it s running on a linux ubuntu server with php 5.2.6

2464040
ends-with	substr
you can use a combination of substr and string-length both of which are in xpath 1.0 to simulate ends-with

2464064
freebsd	linux
it definitely relies on the underlying os for notifications on linux freebsd and mac os and i think windows

2464069
int	double
to check for #n a the cell would be an int data type not a double

2464082
vpn	lan

i ve got an app that s working pretty flawlessly in google-chrome and firefox however when i view it in ie all is well until i click on a header element to activate it jquery accordion

2464178
return-value-optimization	nrvo
the c++ standard gives permission for the compiler to elide the unnecessary copy in this case it s called the named return-value-optimization usually abbreviated to nrvo

2464178
return-value-optimization	nrvo
nearly all reasonably recent c++ compilers implement both nrvo and return-value-optimization so generally speaking you can ignore the fact that this construct wouldn t otherwise be particularly efficient

2464181
execl	fork
fork + execl or exec variants which is essentially how system is implemented

2464240
google-chrome	safari
in safari desktop as well as mobile and google-chrome the h264-compressed test.mp4 file will be played

2464258
accessor	properties
you can create your own accessor and properties for example

2464277
public	protected
package protected class makes sense - it is visible to the classes inside the package and not really for public consumption

2464311
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in fact apple s documentation strictly says not to subclass either uitabbarcontroller or uinavigationcontroller

2464337
superclass	subclassing
the field in the subclassing will hide the field in the superclass but both exists

2464341
submit	submission
1 when submission a form i use formviews almost exclusively if that helps if potentially dangerous characters are detected automatically strip them out and submit

2464464

google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome everything is ok but in ie 8 in my case when i select a state the cities dropdown isn t loaded

2464710
clistctrl	cdialog
i found that in some such as headers in clistctrls or cpropertysheets don t need you to call setmaxtipwidth every time as mentioned above but others cview cdialog cpropertypage clistctrl ctreectrl do require you to call it every time the tooltip is going to pop up

2464733

2464878
int	chars
here i have used int and not chars for variable s now for using s for chars conversion safely i have to make it chars again because when scanf reads a chars it only overwrites one byte of the variable it is assigning it to and not all four that int has

2464890
glut	sdl
so when you create your window with glut sdl or wgl or whatever you have to specify the size

2464915
int	chars
the argument to scanf is a pointer to int and scanf is expecting a pointer to chars

2464915
put	get	int	chars
the two data type int and chars have different sizes at least on most architectures so the data may get put in the wrong spot in memeory and the other part of s may not get properly cleared

2464915
int	chars
the answers suggesting manipulation of the result after using a pointer to int rely on unspecified behavior that scanf will put the chars value it has in the least significant byte of the int you re pointing to and are not safe

2464923
int	chars
the c format calls for a chars you ve passed it an int which will roughly speaking be reinterpreted

2464923
int	chars
even assuming that the pointer value is still good after reinterpreting storing an arbitrary chars to the first byte of an int and then reading it back as int is undefined behaviour

2464923
int	chars
writing converts the value from int to chars and then back to int again

2464923
int	chars
and then either or according to whether you want negative-valued chars to result in a negative int or a positive int up to 255 assuming 8-bit chars

2464934
google-chrome	firefox
i am using pagination and the results show fine in ie but disappear in google-chrome and firefox when advancing forward from page 1

2465032
children	parent
the problem with using node.children to obtain the children and then move the children to the font node s parent node is that none of the children nodes include the text found within the font node

2465037
memcached	apc
you should use pdo which already provides a lot of power and if that s not enough you can extend that possibly with your own functions such as checking for hits on memcached apc before actually querying the database

2465037
implements	extends
you can also extends the class to implements your own sql functions like

2465203
cifs	smb
we did extensive trials with the source stored on a smb cifs mounted disk in the enterprise software company where i work and the conclusion was that it is not possible to tweak this to any acceptable performance since cifs performance for handling big amounts of small files is so poor

2465206
post	put
-- i put -- to be able to post the hyperlink and from other links but still the same problem

2465210
firefox	safari
this is for using in safari though it could probably be used on firefox as well

appfuse	spring
appfuse has a maven archetype for creating webapp with spring hibernate and spring mvc

2471140
maven	pom.xml
you will need to update the java source version to 1.5 in the pom.xml for annotations etc it describes how to do this on the maven site

2471142
equals	tostring
for the s if i have tried tostring and also the equals

2471148
put	get
so i am getting off on a tangent use the put get to talk to registers you have to use the trm and the arm arm to place the interrupt handler code somewhere you have to enable the interrupt most likely in more than one place in the arm as well as in the peripheral

2471148
put	get
so now you take your test program that can run on the arm if compiled that way and instead compile it on the lost linking it to the put get whatever abstraction layer

2471148
put	get
if you use some sort of abstraction like my put get you can write your peripheral code one time in one file linking it different ways that one file program function can be used with the perhipheral only in simulation for quickly developing your code then run with the arm in place in simulation adding the complexity of the arm exceptions and arm interrupt system and later on the real chip as you were running on the simulated chip

2471150
implements	extends
since dude already implements the interface as well we could have the plugins extends dude but that would be conceptually wrong because extends creates an is-a relationship but a plugin is not a dude

2471174
int	boolean	int	double
the java virtual machine uses explicit bytecode instructions to reserve and release memory on the stack these instructions are generated by the compiler and manage the lifetime of primitives like int boolean double and object-references on the stack

2471229
haskell	ocaml	erlang	ocaml
most big libraries tend to be more wide than deep for example the win32 api php libraries erlang bifs ocaml and haskell libraries stored procedures in a database etc

2471244
webclient	httpwebrequest
an alternative to httpwebrequest is webclient

2471257
vb.net	vb6
if you have used adodb in vb6 c++ then ado.net is the .net vb.net c# equivalent

2471257
put	get
each time you put a different graphics card inside your computer you need to have a new graphics driver to get your graphics card to work at its best

2471272
width	height
i would use a calculation where you get the width in pixels divided by the square width and then the height divided by the square height

2471272
width	height
then you can find a way to change the resolution to the result or grab the color of every pixel at position height and width 2 of the square your looking for

2471366
onclick	onsubmit
you should capture the onsubmit event of your form rather than the onclick event of your submit button

2471397
spaces	linefeed
those are spaces and linefeed

2471498
move	drag
in vista and later if an app becomes unresponsive the desktop window manager is able to handle redrawing it when necessary move a window over it drag it around etc. because it has kept a pixel buffer for it

2471511
hide	show
to make one form show and hide another you call show and hide on it

2471522
actionscript	mxml
i m not sure how it would be handled in mxml but you can generate the full string in actionscript

2471527
firefox	safari
when using ecmascripts typeof on plugin elements embed or object safari firefox return function

2471543
crypt	salt
note that you don t have to explicity extract the salt from the stored password nor worry about the algorithm salt size - crypt does that for you

2471555
superclass	subclassing
i always think of it as b having more stuff in it then a subclassing often have more methods than superclass hence b gets the wide end of the arrow and a gets the pointy end

2471656
stdout	stderr
stdout is stderr is below

2471675
post	get
the only way i thought i could do this is using post get

2471712
folder	directory
i copied my clickonce deployment to my c inetpub folder on my webserver and i deleted my virtual directory

2471712
folder	directory
so now under inetpub folder on my web server i have the following directory path

2471730
folder	directory
in temp folder i have sub directory named 1 2 3

2471732
firefox	safari
firefox and i believe safari both respond with function because that is how they determined to deal with it

2471798
draggable	droppable
using droppable to provide feedback is not a good option due to their deeply nested structure using greedy so i would like to give visual feedback by changing the draggable the clone

2471808
packets	pcap
i am using pcap to create a packets sniffer

2471813
getter	setter
i see that tax information is kept at order level but i cannot see any setter getter for it

2471822
profiling	debugging
as suggested in the comments you should contact the builder of the program and suggest that they debugging it using a profiling and properly dispose of the objects or to let them go out of scope so the garbage collector can dispose of them

2471828
folder	directory
caurina folder in local directory

2471834
youtube	vimeo
i ve been assigned a project for a website where users will be allowed to upload video s using a youtube api but more importantly for me they will also be allowed to submit video embed codes from numerous video sites youtube vimeo etc

2471839
config	ini
earlier i was using multiple ini files but now i plan to go for single xml file which will be containing all config details of the project

2471839
config	ini
problem is if somebody wants config file in ini or db or anything else and not the default one in this case xml my code should handle that part

2471839
config	ini
if somebody wants to go for other config option like ini he will have to create ini file similar to my xml config file and my config manager should take care everything like parsing storing in cache

2471839
config	ini
for that i need a mechanism lets say proper interface for my config data where the underlying data store can be anything xml db ini etc also i don t want it to be dependent on these underlying store and anytime in future this should be extensible to other file formats

2471869
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i am using the cycle plugin within joomla and it works fine on ie6 firefox safari google-chrome however when you view it in opera breaking happens

2471869
width	height
it loads fine but when it brings in the next slide and every consequent slide after that it re-sizes them to what i can only assume to be the browswe window s width and height

2471968
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
most people have upgraded to firefox 3+ by now and webkit browsers safari google-chrome etc have had it implemented for awhile and even ie5.5+ supports font-face

2472000
profiler	yourkit
i would suggest using a profiler like yourkit homepage so that you can easily find what is allocating so much memory

2472004
cvs	svn
we integrate the google adt plugins into the eclipse core along with cvs svn and mylyn

2472004
ubuntu	linux
linux support is tested on ubuntu and fedora but it may or may not work on others

2472032
mouseleave	mouseenter
you need to implement this logic by using the mouseenter and mouseleave events one each form something like

2472113
uiview	subviews
i have a custom uiviewcontroller which is the only subviews of uiview

2472126
equals	gethashcode
equals nor gethashcode has been overridden at this point

2472145
uiview	subviews
i d like to be able to create my own container subclasses of uiview which can react first to touches before their subviews

2472161
equals	gethashcode
either make paymenttypeinfo override equals and gethashcode or pass an appropriate into the contains method

2472161
equals	gethashcode
as slaks mentions in the comments in this case gethashcode won t actually get called - but you should always override both equals and gethashcode or neither of them

2472189
width	height
pass the browser width height

2472190
width	height
first of all i want my image to be forced to resize to a specific width and height after the upload

2472196
width	height
x and y are positional elements width and height are size elements

2472203
apache	lighttpd
if you really don t want to use one of the many web servers that could do this with a couple minutes of setup time iis apache lighttpd you could just make a simple http socket server

2472251
pull	push
there are no virtual directories by design and branches are hard objects in dvcs which it needs to be such in order to work simply with synchronization of repositories push and pull

2472251
bazaar	git
the first thing you do when you work with a dvcs is to clone repositories git s clone hg s clone and bazaar s branch

2472251
fast-forward	merge
what later needs to be done is to push in those changes again to origin which will result into a fast-forward merge since the merge commit is a direct descendant of the latest in the origin repository

2472251
bazaar	git
since i don t want this answer to be any more verbose i ll let you read the git mercurial or bazaar docs about that instead

2472251
bazaar	git
there is also the issue of sending patches between each developer that was a huge problem in subversion which is mitigated in git hg and bazaar by uniquely identifiable revisions

2472263
width	height
as stated in the docs the height_field and width_field are names of fields where to store the original image s height and width -- not to coerce the image to a certain size

2472344
width	height
in regards to the bounds below i verified the bounds being used by the code are basically the height and width of the entire screen area less the status bar

2472348
sudo	passwd
sudo attempts to open the terminal device tty to read the passwd

2472348
sudo	passwd
sudo -s tells it to use the standard input for a passwd which should be coming from emacs

2472376
ant	maven
neither the exec plugin documentation nor the maven ant tasks pages had any sort of straightforward example

2472404
accessor	properties
another example of using a dictionary as a static properties with only the get accessor

2472408
folder	directory
now i have been in the directory with the mytest.class which is just somewhere in my file system i tried moving the source folder to the junit folder and the junit junit4.8.1 folder and the same result

2472439
sudoers	visudo
what i had to do is add to my etc sudoers file using sudo visudo obviously

2472439
sudo	passwd
eval-ing shell-command sudo etc init.d apache2 restart now prompts me for a passwd instead of trying to guess it unsuccessfully

2472523
put	get
ok so i finally decided to get my hands dirty and put some code together for this

2472523
post	get
after working on the plugin for a bit i was trying to get the select to work for the tv i came across a post on modx forums which lead me to this -

2472524
background-repeat	background-image
try using background-image and background-repeat in the style tag instead

2472530
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome 3.0 and firefox 3.6 render this almost the same - the fieldset border is a bit heavier on google-chrome and a there s noticeable stairstepping on the corners

2472562
put	get
so i just put the difference serial in a round function and i get the whole numbers i need for number of days

2472591
hide	show
you could certainly use the buttons that you want in your menu to show and hide a uitableview

2472600
squash	merge
i do not use squash to flatten commits but i rebase to avoid the extra merge commits

2472624
unsigned	short	int	chars	int	double
an hypothetical database or serializing interface capable of handling any primitive types would need special cases for unsigned int short long long chars float long double arrays thereof functions relating to etc

2472626
mouse	keyboard
from this post someone mentions the window.autohideall shortcut however that seems to only be for assigning keyboard shortcuts--this is a mouse click thing

2472707
komodo	aptana
i use komodo edit or aptana

2472731
put	get
if i get your meaning then a very simple way is to cross join on a derived query on a table with more than 1000 rows in it and put a top 1000 on that

2472823
folder	directory
click the directory folder

2472862
getchar	getline
getline is probably better than getchar in most cases

2472898
ienumerable	icollection
drop .tolist if you don t really need to return an icollection t and an ienumerable t is fine

2472915
subtraction	addition
please note i m not asking someone to do the whole thing for me as i want to learn and i m confident i can do the rest including addition subtraction etc

2473017
ready	each
then during development rather than updating the build configuration as each component becomes implemented the build itself could determine if a subproject is ready for inclusion yet perhaps it tries to grab the code compile it and run a pre-determined test suite

2473041
width	height
im thinking i somehow need to figure out when the added width of the divs is at the full page width and set equal height on those

2473049
inherited	properties
it is quite simple to write your own trivialtextblock control which has a string parameter and simply draws it using the inherited textelement properties such as fontsize fontweight etc

2473088
min	max
however the next problem is that this general purpose routine should be computing max min mean variance etc

2473109
width	height
google maps default icons are 20px width and 34px height so you could use something like this to emulate

2473113
cpu	processors
if is your range then if you could generate 10 10 random numbers per second if you have a 3 ghz processors and about 4 cores on which you generate one random number per cpu cycle - which is imposible and ruby will even slow it down a lot then it would take about 10 180 years to exhaust all the numbers

2473171
google-chrome	firefox
the same example tested in ie8 firefox and google-chrome behaves exactly as expected

2473182
cells	tablecell
tablecell element can contain colspan element in which one can point amount of cells have to merged to this cells

2473238
put	get
here is a link to get you started on streaming or better yet just don t use images more than 30kb or so else put them on the filesystem not in tables

2473252
children	parent
the relatively positioned #panel parent doesn t have layout and hence ie forgets to redraw its children when it get resized repositioned

2473294
implements	extends
i find it helpful to at a glance and know which what the interfaces classes are which ones extends implements each other especially when i m attending a design review for someone else

2473296
comparator	icomparer
another way is to create a class that implements icomparer then there is an overload to pass in the comparator class

2473300
qlist	qdatastream
ideally i would be able to write a qlist to a qdatastream but i m not exactly sure how to go about doing this

2473312
ienumerable	iqueryable
one option i tried is to just make iadapter return ienumerable or iqueryable but the problem there is that i then do not have access to the methods itable provides insertonsubmit

2473323
rss	feed
i am using the nsxmlparser to get new rss stories from a feed and am displaying them in a uitableview

2473329
nhibernate	massive
so i could have saved myself massive amounts of time and effort by just using vanilla nhibernate itself

2473338
post	get
i won t get specific on that number but have said in another post my monthly revenue from application sales is enough to pay rent on a decent place for me and my wife and daughter

2473360
post	get
and post the error you get

2473379
gtk	fltk	fltk	glui
you could also look at the billions of other gui toolkits like gtk tk fltk yaaf glui dlib clx.

2473395
qstring	qlist
qstring is one and so is qlist so it looks like you re sorted

2473446
maven	pom.xml
1 a maven parent pom.xml file at the top level of the project

jquery	simplemodal
i am trying to use the jquery simplemodal plugin and i am curious about something the description page mentions a container div

2473549
bmp	png
i m using d3dxsavesurfacetofile to save windowed direct3d 9 surfaces to png bmp and jpg files

2473558
client-side	server-side
second if the server-side code is only used to retrieve data from a database and to save results after client-side computation then the app server will very likely not be the bottleneck the database will

2473603
post	get
nice input validation system with strict validation being the default and not only for get post but all other inputs like headers files and cookies as well

2473603
cakephp	kohana
a bit short on documentation but it has the only true mvc implementation in comparison to kohana cakephp zend and all those other frameworks...just have a look at it and ask questions on irc or the user mailing list

2473623
post	get
assuming that the markup looks exactly like you showed in your post you could just strip the tags out like this run this on the email field after you get it from your db

2473624
google-chrome	firefox
most things that work in ie will render correctly in firefox and google-chrome

2473628
int	double
when i try to use a static_cast to cast a double to an int i get the following error

2473646
int	double
you must use new because a double and an int can not reside in the same memory space sanely

2473647
int	double
unless you want take a int -level look at a double

2473654
int	double
you can convert between a double and an int with but not between pointers to different types

2473662
int	double
that having been said if you really want to interpret your double as an int will work fine

2473683
keydown	keyup
my hardware has a problem from time to time it s sending a keydown followed by a keyup event

2473683
keydown	keyup
but in some applications that listen to keydown and keyup i get unexpected behaviour

2473690
lisp	scheme
if you avoid reducing any subexpression under a lambda and if you also insist on reducing each argument to a normal form before a function is applied then you have a model of an eager functional language like f# lisp objective caml scheme or standard ml

2473781
filesystems	ntfs
b you can t the short path on an ntfs filesystems is stored as a distinct ntfs attribute normally if a filename can meet 8.3 it stores only one if it doesn t meet that criteria then it can store both a long and a short file name

2473785
hash	md5
anyway you should just use a bigger hash - find an md5 function - if you re actually hashing something or a uuid generator with more than 4 characters and yes you could use a while loop but just generate a big enough one so that conflicts are incredibly unlikely

2473829
vbscript	jscript
i have been asked dozens of times over the years for my list of tips and tricks that people can use to optimize their vbscript their jscript their active server pages their vb their c# code

2473867
put	get
i think this data will also be useful for me to decide whether to upgrade one machine or get another dedicated machine and put all the databases on that one

2473875
cpu	processors
as processors continue to get faster the main bottleneck in most applications isn t cpu it s bandwidth bandwidth to off-chip memory bandwidth to disk and bandwidth to net

2473920
versioning	upgrade
i ve struggled finding anyone else trying to upgrade the versioning of git-svn and i m guessing this client versioning restriction is unusual but i m stuck with it corporate environment.

2473937
pop-up	dialog
dialog boxes that pop-up on top of all open windows even those of other applications

2473937
pop-up	dialog
pop-up dialog that won t let you switch to another app until they are dismissed make me want to throw something

2473937
pop-up	dialog
if you re going to re-map ctrl+c from copy to close without saving anything at least pop-up a dialog warning people when they use it

2473940
range	max	range	min	min	max
when they are first displayed on the page the max and min for the range are set to today so that no dates can be selected

2473953
hide	show
i m trying to create a loop where if there s only 1 of these divs the delete link should hide and if there are more than 1 of these divs the delete link should show up on all the divs

2473971
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that if i modify the extension of an image let s say to .jpgq or even .jpg and i try to upload it firefox and google-chrome will say that the file s type is application octet-stream and normally the condition will be false

2473972
post	get
when i post the contents of the textarea in tinymce i get the dreaded ysd and the message

2473972
put	get
i ve seen this before so i put the validateinput false on the controller but no joy - i still get the error

2473979
jquery	scriptaculous
the previous developer incorporated a head.inc file which loads up prototype scriptaculous and then many of the pages are in a sub-template loading up jquery for functions like lightbox

2473980
uilabel	uibutton
so i have a bunch of uiviews that i made programmatically and placed a bunch of content on uibutton uilabel uinavigationbars etc. and most of these views are going to need to actually be uiscrollviews instead

2473991
kde	gnome
there is the sytem tray protocol which i believe both gnome and kde use

2474009
width	height
i m trying to detect the browser s current size width and height

2474015
min	max
i m using python s max and min functions on lists for a minimax algorithm and i need the index of the value returned by max or min

2474015
min	max
in other words i need to know which move produced the max at a first player s turn or min second player value

2474015
min	max
i need to be able to return the actual index of the min or max value not just the value

2474040
queue	fifo
if you want to limit the array s length use a function in which you check the length and optionally remove the oldest element as you append a new one this is in principle a fifo queue

2474082
implements	extends
if you have document based application and a view that you want to dump to printer then in our mydocument or whatever you call it that extends nsdocument you would implements

2474092
versioning	upgrade
in that case then you would be well advised to upgrade to the latest versioning

2474095
versioning	upgrade
the only time you should update immediately is when the versioning of the framework you rely upon is out of your control and the client is likely to do the upgrade

2474109

2474125
heroku	engineyard
i would highly recommend checking out both heroku and engineyard s cloud-based offerings

2474156
hiphop	xcache
let me clear up a misconception you might have about hiphop and xcache

2474156
hiphop	xcache
xcache works by adding opcode caching to zend s php implementation like apc and friends while facebook s hiphop allows for php code to be transformed into c++ code and then compiled using g++

2474156
hiphop	xcache
it s not possible to run xcache with hiphop as hiphop doesn t depend on zend interpreter and doesn t even use php opcodes as it s compiled to bytecode after transformed to c++

2474205
postgresql	mysql
inserting into the database - use the mysqldb library for python i use postgresql mostly from ruby and java so i m not fully hip to the latest python mysql libraries

2474238
min	max
you can find the min max index and value at the same time if you enumerate the items in the list but perform min max on the original values of the list

2474238
min	max
this way the list will only be traversed once for min or max

2474277
serializable	deserialization
if you have a schema you can use the xsd.exe tool from visual studio to automatically make classes and use built in .net xml serializable deserialization

2474287
svg	vml
it s cross-browser because it uses vml in ie and svg in other browsers

2474296
allocator	stl
as other have suggested though the stl library has some much nicer less easy to do something stupid with memory allocator collections in it you can use

2474310
put	get
i put a login box alone with a keyword search box in 404.html in a django project so in case a 404 error is raised visitors get more options to jump to other parts

2474334
int	double
you declare var i as an int and then try to nslog it at as double value without a cast

2474351
width	height
my goal is to make a layout that is 200 width and height with four containers of equal height and width 100 each using no javascript as the bear minimum or preferably no hacks

2474351
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in safari 4 firefox 3.5 and google-chrome 5

2474358
isapi	httpmodule
so iis7 in integrated pipeline mode uses a isapifiltermodule to shim isapi filter dll s and fire off the correct events on the filters which is quite different than previous versions of iis or iis7 in classic mode because this means that httpmodule fire off right along side isapi filters in integrated pipeline mode

2474392
width	height
it s a variant of drawroundrect but with 8 parameters the final four being the diameter of each corner x y width height top left top right bottom left bottom right

2474405
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox 3.6 google-chrome 4 and ie 8 compat

2474406
versioning	upgrade
if you mean that the installer should be capable of doing an in-place upgrade of a previous versioning that is a really hard problem and i ve yet to encounter an installer builder that even attempts to address it

edit in response to the comment armadillo does not require lapack but works better with it and better still with tuned blas

2474454
armadillo	lapack
armadillo will use atlas routines in lieu of lapack wherever possible

2474454

2474622
int	boolean
anyways i was working though it some more tonight and i realized that i may be completely wrong about my assumption on garbage collection and primitive types int boolean float are these primitive type variables that i create in a 10 line function that gets called 20

2474643
jobs	cron
the query cache isn t nearly as important as you might think particularly during off-peak periods which i assume is when you would run the cron jobs

2474646
vbscript	vb6
vb6 vbscript etc you can set it up via odbc and have the username password there

2474666
firefox	safari
i just tested geolocation on firefox 3.6 and iphone safari os 3.1.3 the result is interesting firefox is more accurate than safari

2475785
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
using wireshark to look at the traffic i found that opera and google-chrome simply ack the first packet from youtube after the cable has been plugged back in but safari and firefox set the rst flag 0x4 in the tcp header and no more traffic follows

firefox	safari
so it seems that if safari and firefox sees a multicast connection close and then later see data on that same connection they will send a rst

a screen width a height of higher than 240 is likely a touch screen.

2476676
cpu	processors
in your situation you need to use the performance counter l process program_you_are_interested_in_name processors time for cpu utilization and possibly l process program_you_are_interested_in_name data bytes sec for disk operations

2476676
cpu	processors
if for example you have a concurrent program with the name a_program_name.exe you can find its cpu utilization measuring at least twice the performance counter l process a_program_name processors time

2476676
cpu	processors
by the way measuring with this test a multithreaded application running on a multicore processors might give cpu utilization which is more than 100

2476689
inherited	properties
in windowforms i would just have inherited from tabitem added some custom properties and controls and done

2476801

my employer is considering a switch from cvs to svn but i m wondering whether i should push for mercurial or some other dvcs instead

2479297
range	max
i need an expression to match a decimal number or the string all as in a range validator that allows the word all represent the max range

2479346
apache	nginx
i m having a problem running apache + subversion with ssl behind an nginx proxy and i m hoping someone might have the answer

2479346
apache	nginx
here are the relevant parts i think of the nginx and apache config files in question

2479346
apache	nginx
from what i could tell while researching this problem the server name has to match on both the apache server as well as the nginx server which i ve done

2479349
inherited	properties
suppose i create a constructor bird and another called parrot which i make to inherited the properties of bird by assigning an instance of it to parrot s prototype like the following code shows

2479360
spaces	delimiter
so if you were to represent the maze as a 2 spaces array of strings with null or some other char as a wall a different delimiter as places that haven t been discovered say o and the rest as the shortest path to get to that square using n e s and w

2479375
rss	feed
the above rss feed is the url they suggest using along with the following sample code

2479416
int	chars
try to code chars 256 and you will either get the chars with the ordinal value 0 or 1 depending on your computers internal representation of int

2479465
httphandler	httpmodule
i ve peeked at their source in this way and they accomplish the progress bar through a combination of a custom httpmodule and httphandler along with their control

2479465
httphandler	httpmodule
so in order to make this work you have to update some standardized state server-side during your file processing in the httpmodule which is transmitted back to the client via xmlhttprequest calls handled by the httphandler

2479497
stdout	stderr
one vibration the application was compiled with debugging support but it is unable to reach monodevelop on the specified ip address and port to setup stdout stderr

2479497
stdout	stderr
three vibrations could not setup stdout stderr to the application

2479499
jar	.war
we deploy our app in an .ear which contains among others the above mentioned .war file and the custom layout class in a separate jar file let s call it commons

2479499
jar	war
so my only remaining guess is that matcher is loaded by two different classloaders when it is used from the jar and the war and then attempted to pass from one to the other

2479546
cos	sin
since sin cos and tan are mathematical functions which are calculated by summing a series developers will sometimes use lookup tables to avoid the expensive calculation

2479566
wma	speex
in conversation people have suggested speex and wma for instance but i haven t found any libraries or examples that work without requiring reference to dll s that won t work in a sl4 project

2479606
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
while the quick answer is that they are more expensive than the primitive math functions addition multiplication subtraction etc... they are not -expensive- in terms of human time

2479609
subtract	add
certainly integer add and subtract will be among them

2479609
division	multiplication
depending upon the processor there may be multiplication and division as well

2479635
rss	feed
although i was passing the rss feed directly through the handler writing the read stream directly i just needed to specify the following from within the handler

2479660
jar	war
the jar needs to be added to the lib folder in war web-inf

2479709
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
on the intel x86 processor floating point addition or subtraction requires 6 clock cycles multiplication requires 8 clock cycles and division 30-44 clock cycles

2479752
valgrind	memcheck
i suggest you stop and read the valgrind quick start paying particular attention to section 4 interpreting memcheck s output and look over the faq

2479755
free	realloc
this is presumably done so that a caller can still do free on it like realloc

2479779
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
tested with firefox google-chrome ie8 and opera

2479792
free	malloc
you can t free part of an array - you can only free a pointer that you got from malloc and when you do that you ll free all of the allocation you asked for

2479862
width	height
the link have a fixed width and height + display block

2479862
width	height
i tried setting the img width and height but it made the img stretch

2479863
google-chrome	firefox
i d advise debugging this in firebug for firefox or through the google-chrome javascript console

2479879
hide	show
in login i show the navigationbar hide the backbutton1 and add a new rightbutton1 then i check if settings.bundle login and pass are set

2479954
vmware	bootcamp
you could try vmware fusion or use bootcamp instead

2479954
parallels	bootcamp	vmware	bootcamp
parallels does support running a windows on a bootcamp partition - as does vmware fusion

2479967
int	double
my suggestions would be to double check that e_id and e_type are really just native int

2479991
cassini	iis
havent tried asp.net development but i assume its going to be fine since the iis server or cassini would be hosted on the vm

2480049
post	get
post some samples of how your events are wired up and i get give a more specific example

2480078
ubuntu	linux
i am setting up a new svn server on ubuntu linux

2480088
merb	ruby-on-rails
the closest to the original from merb approach i could find in ruby-on-rails is to use #render_to_string

2480098
rss	feed
i would like to show content from other websites using rss feed into my drupal site and show it inside a page

2480180
post	get
uzbekjon has a great blog post on this as well get url parameters values with jquery

2480226

2480320
jquery	simplemodal
my problem has to do with the simplemodal jquery plugin

2480320
slideup	slidedown
edit i think it would help to explain my problem by showing two screenshots before after -- basically i am using jquery s slideup slidedown functionality to hide the credit card form depending on whether the user is paying via cash cheque or credit card

2480320
slideup	slidedown
i tried adding in a callback element of slideup slidedown but to no avail -- in fact setposition is throwing a js error because apparently the function doesn t exist

2480333
qmenubar	qmainwindow
i would like to add a qmenubar to a window of my program not the qmainwindow from qtdesigner but i do not see this widget in there and it seems the only way to do this from designer is to use a mainwindow

2480335
put	get
your verbs get set will become the http standard get put

2480339
daemons	launchd
i am attempting to write a python daemons that will launchd at boot

2480339
daemons	launchd
the problem comes in when i start the daemons at boot if i launchd from the shell it runs perfectly and completes the work

2480347
equals	gethashcode
you need to implement equals and gethashcode on your exampleclass

2480358
width	height
it was not possible to do pixel graphics with these except by printing repeated periods and micro-advancing the print head and paper the width height of a period instead of a character row of text respectively which would generally wear out the period character of the daisy-wheel or ball really quickly so many of them had metal-reinforced periods for that very reason

2480367
equals	gethashcode
it does not implement any equality testing such as overriding equals and gethashcode so nunit will eventually do a reference comparison

2480379
for-loop	loops
i mean in asp.net suppose you have a linq file called catalogue and you then use a for-loop to loops through catalogue.products and print each product name

2480390
int	chars
a chars has an int value

2480398
postgresql	mysql
i ve used pentaho data integration to migrate from oracle to mysql i also migrated the same data to postgresql which was about 50 quicker which i guess was largely due to the different jdbc drivers being used

2480419
ienumerable	iqueryable
the linq to sql provider is in collusion with the c# compiler the iqueryable interface behaves a little differently upon compilation as opposed to a standard in memory collection ienumerable

2480425
hash	salt
he then hash this token using a salt i m combing code from different functions

2480439
stdout	stderr
if you need to capture both stderr and stdout and don t want to resort to logging following is a simple solution adapted from this post

2480447
yslow	pagespeed
i m checking my pages with two plugins for firebug yslow and pagespeed

2480447
yslow	pagespeed
both seem to say that my files are caching add expires headers in yslow and leverage browser caching in pagespeed are both checked

2480456
many-to-many	one-to-many
don t forget to use singularname property in one-to-many many-to-many for nicer looking generated functions adddog dog dog vs adddogs dog dogs .

2480456
many-to-many	one-to-many
usually make more sense for one-to-many or many-to-many relationship

2480456
many-to-many	one-to-many
if you access the one-to-many many-to-many array or struct directly make sure the corresponding array struct exists before use

2480463
subtract	add
you basically want to add everyone that matches a criteria but subtract everyone that has a criteria that doesn t match

2480475
hash	md5
salting a hash is used to decrease the possibility of collision and ensure that the hash can t be found in a database like this - if everybody is using md5 for storing their passwords then a password file database could be de-hashed by looking up the md5 d value of the password

2480475
hash	salt
using a salt there is an added unknown element to the hash which means the code for generating the salt must also be known to try and brute force the hash

2480482
width	height
increasing the size of the stage increases that scaling value which through some set of concatenations of matrices results in the movieclip getting scaled and translated at that same percentage as the stage even if you explicitly set the x y width height values

2480482
width	height
anyway the fix is to set the stage to an explicit width and height

2480491
rpm	yum
if there is software on your system that depends on the existing fontconfig rpm then you won t be able to uninstall the version yum has given you

2480511
accessor	properties
make sure to expose properties accessor get

2480647
put	get	post	put	post	get
now i get it that i can put a post with all of its details in memcache and call the key post 123 that is ok and i can do it for each post

2480647
post	get
but how to deal with the case when i query the table post to get the list of all post with their titles

2480657
managed	loaderlock
loaderlock is an mda managed debugging assistant warning from the debugger

2480673
cos	sin
so then instead of cos for x and sin for y above you should use sin for x and cos for y

2480764
move	drag
i have a movieclip that i want the user to be able to drag inside the stage but i don t want it to be able to move outside the stage

2480780
portrait	landscape
all i want is for my button s origin to stay locked to the bottom-left in portrait and bottom-right in landscape so it basically stays in the same place

2480780
portrait	landscape
it should also stay in place for portrait upside down and landscape right

2480799
cvs	svn
the oft-repeated statement that there is no central repository is very scary to people who have been locked into the cvs svn model since time immemorial and can t imagine anything else especially so for management and senior experienced and or cynical developers who want strong source code tracking and reproducibility and perhaps also if you have to satisfy certain standards regarding your development processes like we did at a place i once worked

2480803
mvp	presenter
i think the problem here is that you shouldn t need both the iview and ipresenter interfaces to be generic - in an mvp framework either the view should call the presenter directly to drive the form in which case the view should be generic for some presenter type or the view should be totally unaware of the presenter and communicate through events in which case the presenter should be generic for a particular view type

2480821
accessor	properties
with auto-implemented properties both a get and set accessor are required

2480821
accessor	properties
a read-only properties has no set accessor

2480821
accessor	properties
a properties without a set accessor is considered read-only

2480833
ubuntu	linux
for reference the subversion repository is hosted on a linux server with ubuntu 9 something installed and i have complete root access to the machine

2480864
base	fractions
the fractions part of numbers for example 0.11 is represented as multiples of inverse powers of 10 since the base is 10

2480864
base	fractions
just as base 10 is not capable enough to represent every fractions number in a finite manner base-2 cannot represent all fractions numbers given a limited amount of space

2480923
squash	branch
so basically when starting on a new feature i create a branch for it go through the usual hack then commit cycle and when i think i m done with it i squash it into a single commit using git rebase --interactive master and i always end up editing the multitude of commit messages into something looking like the example in the article reproduced here

2480933
for-loop	loops
i have a for-loop that loops over one array.

2480939
width	height
now packing a rectangle of width height ratio a with squares is equivalent to packing the view with items

2480939
ceil	floor
floor r ceil c

2480939
ceil	floor
ceil r floor c

2480994
charindex	substr
substr physical_name 1 patindex +reverse substr reverse physical_name 1 charindex reverse physical_name -1 + physical_name -1 +

2480997
uiview	calayer
the problem with this is that setframe on a uiview by default has no animation but setframe on a calayer does

2480997
uiview	calayer
i cant just disable the animations on the calayers setframe because if i were to call setframe on the uiview inside a uiview animation block the calayer would still have its animation disabled

2480997
uiview	calayer	uiview	subviews	width	height
unfortunately the best solution is to not use a calayer at all and just add a uiview as a subviews and draw into that just like i am drawing into my layer and hope that with autoresizingmask set to height and width that everything will just work

2481002
lisp	smalltalk
as a latecomer to discussion the main problem with smalltalk and lisp is that you can t run them with cgi or fastcgi on shared hosting

2481008
aggregate-functions	sum
aggregate-functions sum avg count etc in sql always automatically exclude null

2481009
nsmutablestring	nsstring
when sent to an instance of nsmutablestring a subclass of nsstring however the message returns an instance of nsmutablestring not nsstring

2481019
disk	ram
every single file on your computer can be represented with binary 1s and 0s and indeed that s how it s generally stored on disk alignment of magnetic particles or ram charge

2481019
hex	binary
it does this because it s easier to understand and navigate hex than binary compare fa to 11111010

2481036
memcached	apc
apc memcached redis if possible

2481051
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
that will call dispose on the sqlconnection and render the sqldatareader useless

2481055
int	double
the rangevalidator can only handle primitive types such as int float double decimal

2481120
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that the icon is not aligned vertically with the title in google-chrome compared to firefox

2481132
hex	binary
what others suggested above is correct you can read binary through hex representation

2481157
cvs	svn
i ve experience moving a project your size and around for 15 years too from cvs svn a mix of the two actually into plastic scm for distributed and centralized the two workflows happening inside the same organization at the same time development

2481165
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux and i am attempting to install the php pear library on a virtual server which is running ubuntu

2481207
cvs	svn
it used to be done with big things like clearcase multi-site or wandisco for svn cvs but now it s pretty doable with dvcs systems

2481225
translation	localization
is a modern localization workflow and crowdsourcing platform suited for software and dynamic content translation

2481226
jobs	cron
that being said if you don t want to use buildbot or hudson and you simply want to run your tests every 24 hours or so you can install your scripts as cron jobs or write a master script that will run all your tests and install that as a cron job

2481252
operands	scalar
i think it s referred to as subquery as a scalar operands

2481323
public	protected
provide either a public virtual destructor or a protected non-virtual destructor for each class that has virtual methods

2481334
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
all uiviewcontroller already have a property of navigationcontroller which is the uinavigationcontroller that is an ancestor to this viewcontroller on the stack

2481343
libjpeg	freetype
remove the files that you originally installed for libjpeg and freetype

2481343
libjpeg	freetype
i don t think libjpeg or freetype specifically benefit from compiling them yourself

2481345
strophe	xmpphp
i would suggest using strophe and xmpphp

2481363
innodb	myisam
but full text search is only supported on myisam not innodb

2481375
google-chrome	firefox
so it should be trickling into browsers soon ie9 google-chrome 1 firefox 4 are at least some of the browsers supporting iso 8601 dates

2481414
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
solution must work on ie7 ie8 safari google-chrome and firefox

2481437
pdu	smpp
check that the bytes sent conform to any smpp pdu

2481438
put	get
after using read-tree you could use this to get the individual file you want to change modify it then put it back in with update-index

2481474
int	chars
chars is a single chars actually int so if you want to compare strings use strcmp instead

2481494
sql-insert	sql-update	sql-insert	sql-delete	sql-delete	sql-update
we can use sql-insert sql-update and sql-delete in our .hbm.xml mapping files for inserts updates deletes

2481525
pbkdf2	salt
using something like pbkdf2 and a random salt

2481548
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	debian-based	ubuntu	debian-based	linux	redhat	fedora
software installers for linux are typically distributed as packages. this can vary from distribution to distribution but debian or debian-based distributions like ubuntu typically use .deb packages redhat and fedora use .rpm packages along with some other distributions

2481567
google-chrome	safari
if your application only uses something that supports some of the html5 spec webkit-based safari 5 google-chrome chromium for instance you can do a lot ahem guessing your question stems from steve jobs mentioning html5 in a keynoteâ ...but will struggle with cross-platform support

2481567
opera	firefox
many of the major players in the browser market haven t even agreed on a common codec for video yet h.264 for many not supported currently by firefox opera etc

2481578
dictionary	map
the common pattern for this in python is to use a dictionary to map

2481595
spreadsheetml	presentationml
the one thing to keep in mind is that spreadsheetml is more similiar to presentationml than it is to wordprocessingml in file structure inside the package for every sheet there is a seperate file

2481606
int	chars
chars charat int index

2481631
superclass	subclassing
so the general rule should be to never call a magic method directly but always indirectly through a built-in unless you know exactly why you need to do that when you re overriding such a method in a subclassing if the subclassing needs to defer to the superclass that must be done through explicit call to the magic method

2481636
post	get
it is a post method not get

2481658
serializable	deserialization
this makes use of the wcf datacontract serializable with handles graphs very efficiently and maintains object reference even after deserialization

2481660
awt	swing
use java web start with swing awt and the sert uses http server servlet with

2481704
google-chrome	firefox
background-size is working in google-chrome 4.1 but so far i couldn t make it work in firefox 3.6

2481710
accessor	properties
the accessor for your keyedthings properties won t collide with any kvc accessor so you re also fine there

2481713
portrait	landscape
i understand that when the orientation changes from portrait to landscape or vice versa the activity is destroyed and then re-created

2481715
width	height
machine elf and stefan kendall are both very close but both incomplete so you just combine each as so machine elf didn t account for scrollbars and setfan didn t account for the height and width of the div itself

2481715
width	height
you may also need to set the css of your div to a fix height and width and its display is set to block

2481778
yslow	pagespeed
yslow and pagespeed

2481793
portrait	landscape
i have created a main.xml and designed one for the res layout-land landscape format and another one for portrait in res layout

2481793
portrait	landscape
when i rotate the emulator ctrl-f11 my app rotates properly to landscape using the correct main.xml but a subsequent rotation back to portrait just keeps the landscape mail.xml

2481798
udp	rtp
for example if you plan to use wifi access points outside of the home many of these will not support rtp using udp delivery

2481826
udp	tcp	udp	rtp
in practice when this is done the difference between interleaved rtp over tcp and rtp sent over udp is how these two perform over a lossy network with insufficient bandwidth available for the user

2481893
put	get
i alway remember what a teacher once told me when i was learning c-- with c you get a kevlar boot and a gun it is up to you whether or not you put the boot on before you shoot yourself in the foot because you will shoot yourself at some point... good luck to you on learning c++ just hang in there and don t get discouraged

2481895
codeigniter	kohana
kohana is strictly php5 and was initially created as a fork of codeigniter it used to be called blue flame but it has since been rewritten

2481901
width	height
it also automatically detects the size of the content being loaded so you don t have to specify a width and height

2481915
for-loop	loops
i ve done a small experiment as will be shown below and it looks like that a while loops is faster than a for-loop in perl

2481915
for-loop	loops
the one that has the while loops took 57 minutes 17 seconds to finish while the for-loop equivalent took 1 hour 7 minutes 54 seconds

2481936
public	protected
it keeps the public interface clean but still isn t great - baselinedate was made protected and a derived class is required both solely for testing

2481957
daemons	systemd
i have a process x which uses systemd c function to start ntpd daemons

2481975
google-chrome	firefox
it worked for me in ie8 it gives me the complete path but in firefox and google-chrome is just prints the file name

2482037
for-loop	loops
the while loops uses the notation but the for-loop uses

2482037
hash	md5
it prints the md5 hash of the factorial rather than the factorial itself because it is easier to compare the results etc

2482037
for-loop	loops
i consistently see a small 1 penalty for the while loops over the corresponding for-loop but i don t have good explanation for it

2482103
mouse	keyboard
the intention is to detect the last input time keyboard or mouse of the user

2482196
gmail	hotmail
otherwise you might try sending confirmation e-mails to your own accounts on major e-mail sites like yahoo hotmail and gmail and then tweaking the wording until it gets past the spam filters

2482214
printf	strtol
parse it with strtol then convert to a string with one of the printf functions

2482225
width	height
basically i ve got some structs of type ship which are going to go on a board which can have a variable width and height

2482276
hide	show
i am using jquery to show hide a div container #pluginoptionscontainer and load a page . plugin_options.php inside it with the required post vars sent

2482282
free	malloc
the size of this heap increases automatically as calls to malloc and free move what is called the program break to higher addresses in memory

2482356
nsobject	nsmutablestring
in macruby for example string.name returns nsmutablestring hash.name returns nsmutabledictionary and object.name returns nsobject

2482367
opera	google-chrome
i tried max-width on top instead and in opera and google-chrome i see the border of top as 500width but the images continue to render pass it

2482404
margin	height
i found this solution but it wasn t working on single images there isn t always 2 images so i wrote my own little bit of code which seems to be working except it sometimes doesn t subtract the height of the image from the height of the div and so i end up with a margin of 310px

2482437
for-loop	loops
i would like the label to update itself with every loops however the program is not updating the gui label with every loops instead it only updates itself once the entire for-loop is completed and displays only the last command that was executed

2482457
width	margin
to center the top-level div something like margin 0 auto should do it if the parent has a width or the good old tag if not

2482489
profiler	visualvm
this is very visible in a profiler like visualvm in the sun java 6 jdk

2482495
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s been tested in firefox 3.6 safari 4 google-chrome ie7 and ie8

2482541
merb	ruby-on-rails
the engine yard series on the ruby-on-rails and merb merge contains a lot of good information about the inner workings and upcoming changes in ruby-on-rails 3

2482578
post	get
if you want to use post rather than get you can provide a data type as the fourth parameter

2482596
firefox	safari
if you need something more precise than ip geolocation you could use the w3c geolocation api in supported browsers notably firefox 3.5 and mobile safari to request the user s latitude and longitude and then use google s client-side reverse geocoding service to guess the user s approximate street address

2482657
int	chars
the function getchar is typed to return int and not chars

2482660
printf	getchar
however if you know you are just doing characters then getchar and putchar will be more efficient since the printf and scanf variants will have to parse the string each time to determine how to process your request

2482693
opera	firefox
i see that opera ie doesn t underline the image but firefox does

2482715
post	get
i have created a program tried to post a string on a site and i get this error

2482755
width	height
however in this case when i have 150px height image the 150 width seems start lower

2482760
mockito	jmock
for the record jmock as of today supports more complex scenarios than mockito that s why the initial learning curve is steeper

2482803
post	put
i am answering this question so that i can put in some formatted code so that it will be easier to understand should someone stumble upon this post

2482829

2483230
folder	directory
the folder has both files and directory

2483244
icomparable	compareto
you ll need to inherit from icomparable interface and define the compareto method

2483264
opera	firefox
if you look at the bottom of this blogpost of mine svg at the movies take 2 you ll find a simple wrapper script that implements parsexml should work fine in opera firefox and webkit

2483291
subobject	instances
a pointer to a derived class can always be converted to a pointer to a base class because a derived class object always contains a base class subobject but not every base class instances is a subobject of a particular derived class type

2483303
hebrew	hindi	hebrew	thai	hindi	thai
it s kind of silly that google hasn t made the reverse functionality available since they re already using it in google translate to provide romanisations for cyrillic chinese thai hindi and others though notably not abugidas such as hebrew and arabic

2483304
typedef	struct
in my c file i create my struct but don t give it a tag in the typedef namespace

2483311
inherited	properties
example assuming a base abstract class named basepeoples that has properties id and typediscriminator we have a class of type person that inherited from the base and two other classes of type fisherman and driver that inherited form person

2483411
parser-generator	parsec
i ve been considering using haskell s parsec parsing library to parse a subset of java as a recursive descent parser as an alternative to more traditional parser-generator solutions like happy

2483418
mp3	flac
if a flac file is newer than the corresponding mp3 file or the corresponding mp3 file doesn t exist then i want to run a bunch of commands to convert the flac file to an mp3 file and copy the tags across

the nsmenu is shown when the user clicks a specific nsstatusitem

2483450
int	boolean
some database abstraction layers might expect that a boolean is a type of int

2483480
cpython	ironpython
using multiple processes lets you exploit multiple cpu cores at the same time while in cpython using threads doesn t threads take turns using a single cpu core -- so if you have cpu intensive work and absolutely want to use threads you should consider jython or ironpython

2483480
unix	bsd	opensolaris	bsd
net of this crucial consideration threads might often be a better choice performance-wise on windows where making a new process is a heavy task but less often on unix variants linux bsd versions opensolaris macosx ... since making a new process is faster there but if you re using ironpython or jython you should check on the platforms you care about that this still applies in the virtual machines in question -- clr with either .net or mono for ironpython your jvm of choice for jython

2483491
width	height
for example a rectangle can have it s width and height each set separately and this of course is impossible with a square

2483528
put	get
ps i don t want to put ws in parser rules i would be much happier if lexer just get rid of those

so i create httpfiledownloaderretrier which has one function that uses httpfiledownloader in a for-loop with max 3 loops and a 5 second wait between each loops

2483624
asterisk	freeswitch
install a voip server like asterisk or freeswitch and write code to have your web app interact with it

2483624
sms	tropo
a side benefit to the cloud services is many of them allow your app to run over other communications channels tropo does im and sms too

2483692
hide	show
the reason i need this is i hide show elements sometimes using .show and hide and when that happens i need to reset tab order for the elements that appear disappear

2483721
jar	war
you have to provide a jar with the remote interfaces to your war also known as a client ejb-jar there is no other option

2483721
jar	war
and if your remote interfaces do use entities or any other dependencies then your war must obviously be aware of them you also need to include entities and any other dependency in a jar and to package it in the war

2483770
sudo	passwd
ask for the users passwd in a dialog of your own and pipe that into the shell when sudo asks for it

2483802
daemons	systemd
a lot of daemons etc are also set up under modern systemd to run as their own user with most of the privileges they need

2483858
versioning	upgrade
what you ll miss though is if there are any files deleted in the upgrade versioning

2483892
free	malloc
you should have the same number of free s as you have malloc s

2483895
free	malloc
the key is to always free memory in the same manner as you malloc ed it

2483923
hide	show
i would like to create numbered divs such as eventbox1 eventbox2 etc. in a loop and then have an option to show and hide them

2483923
hide	show
i was wondering how to enable show hide option of each div

2483923
hide	show
i would like to have a show hide link in each div and each time it is pressed only this div hide show

2483925
listview	gridview
if you re using a listview or a gridview you can implement the listview.onscrolllistener methods notably onscrollstatechanged and onscroll

2483934
lua	scheme
javascript ruby lua scheme php

2483943
google-chrome	safari
however in safari google-chrome the grabbed listitem jumps instantly to the top of the page when i want to drag it like the ul is on top of the window

2483960
post	get
under php you can get the raw post contents with file_get_contents php input .

2483961
onmouseover	onload
well you can t use alert and some other js global functions onmouseover onload etc

2483979
post	get
here the client asks a get post query to the web server and the server responds with xml

2483985
width	height
whatever the base of the triangle the width of your rectangle is base 2 and the height is base + 1 giving

2483987
memcpy	malloc
you should check for errors ideally on each malloc and memcpy but just doing it once at the end will be sufficient cudageterrorstring cudagetlasterror

2484026
keystore	jks
i have public and private keys in separate .pem files that i would need to get into a jks keystore somehow

2484038
subclass	abstract-class
actually socketaddress is an abstract-class so you receive some subclass of it

2484041
try-catch	exception-handling
now normally i could wrap a call to this method in a try-catch block with 2 catch clauses to handle the logging situations for each of the exception-handling

2484042
serializable	deserialization
fortunately on most cases you will only need the special features when you are actually working with the object so you can serializable a simplified but complete enough version of it and reconstruct the advanced object upon deserialization

2484079
int	double
i think the best choice here is to keep arrays and decode your int or double manually into it and concatenate strings onto the beginning and end

2484096
hide	show
you can t show the div once you hide it since the link is inside the div

2484105
hash	salt
a simple way to generate the random unique string is to take a hash sha-1 for example of the real id + some salt value

2484105
hash	salt
it makes it very difficult nearly impossible for an attacker to reverse engineer the real id from the public id by brute-forcing the hash which can be quite easy without a salt if the id is short and numeric

2484141
rss	feed
the much better and cleaner way would be to have them the central bank in that case publish the data in a defined form as a web service rss feed or xml output that you can access

2484151
put	get
also whenever i try to put the scriptalias alias the previous content or the following content into an htaccess file i get a 500 internal server error

you could attempt to detect a touch event get rid of the existing overlay item draw your own copy of the icon where the overlay item had been manually animate that as the user drags and then put the overlay item where the user drops it getting rid of your manually-drawn icon

2484201
websphere	ibm
from the updater tech notes it seems like it was a pain to get running with websphere and you needed a special updater from ibm to get the patches

2484203
implements	extends
i would like to implements an observer pattern in objective-c where the observer implements an interface similar to skpaymenttransactionobserver and the observable class just extends my base observable

2484218
put	get
type-class hell is no fun but i think you might get a more informative error message if you put a type signature for regex into the where clause

2484241
codeigniter	cakephp
both cakephp and codeigniter are designed for php4 - in other words for really old technology

2484359
put	get	public	protected
p.s. it s not that personal if someone really wants it it could never be 100 protected and if it was that important i wouldnt put it in the public folder also if the dude really wants to get it that hard he should deserve it

2484384
memcached	apc
if content is changing a lot it may not be worth caching data but if a lot of more static then maybe using something like memcached or apc will be of use

2484392
hash	md5
store for example its md5 hash

2484392
hash	md5
then when the user types in a password compute its md5 hash and compare it with the expected one

2484394
width	height
after initializing uploadify set the width and height of the object to match the button behind it

2484394
width	height
after initializing uploadify set the width and height of the wrapper div to match the button

2484418
put	get
so i wrote this curl script and put it on my php site and now i can get the text of any googledocs document and twitter feed into my silverlight application

2484492
hash	salt
as a sidenote do not use salt hash google don t hash secrets and do not use an encrypted version of your data

2484504
serializable	deserialization
the idea here is that ttype is a concrete representation of that type an algebraic datatype with int float constructors and so on and you have here a value whose type is concealed but that carries a concrete representation of that type that you can use for example to get a safer serializable deserialization

2484541
redhat	fedora
depending on platform you can modify ld.so.conf via etc ld.so.conf.d redhat fedora come to mind which makes deploying changes to ld.so easier from a deployment scenario

2484569
awt	swing
in answer to your question i would definitely do what you describe as an awt solution--that way you can track the objects created and be able to allow the user to reload them onto an edit canvas and more than likely each of the shapes the user creates would be a layer not the layer swing container but an object that would store and track what shapes are drawn and be able to redraw them--the main thing to keep in mind is draw order

2484569
awt	swing
mostly you want to use awt over swing due to the fact swing is not thread safe--that way you do not paint yourself in the corner early on in your design

2484569
awt	swing
swing is built over the awt and adds a great deal of complexity that an application like this doesn t need

2484569
awt	swing
the developer community--myself included--were well on the way to creating a lot of what swing offered in slickness and component based design but what we were building was totally awt based

2484569
swt	swing	awt	swing
here is the class which is a custom awt component--it should be fine in either swing awt probably even swt

jquery	curvycorners
i am using curvycorners in combination with the jquery validation plugin and i m having problems getting the div to redraw the rounded corners when i do like this

i ve found that exif libraries out there don t support png and gif

2484611
rss	feed
some ideas are here how to detect if a page is an rss or atom feed

2484613
getter	setter
it feels that while i gain on using mvc for every new value added i have to add two new methods in the model which quickly get all cluttered with getter setter

2484666
prepare	execute
it first execute the code with the normal stdin console or eclipse console and then with a prepare stdin containing the text test r ntest r n

2484683
versioning	upgrade
the instructions that come with the download seem to be for a major versioning upgrade and are way too much trouble for frequent security updates

2484703
getter	setter
while getter and setter in and of themselves are not necessarily evil they are sometimes a sign that your subsystems are too strongly coupled

2484731
getter	setter
if you feel you have too many getter and setter in your model class maybe you have too many fields altogether

2484731
getter	setter
in general java is a verbose language which expects you to put all those getter and setter and a lot more in place

2484733
folder	directory
the server logs are usually found in a straightforward folder file in the server installation directory such as logs in case of tomcat

2484746
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

2484759
int	double
i have another array of double pointers call it b and i have an unsigned int call it c

2484759

expression-blend	silverlight
the project type i created was the silverlight 3 application + website via expression-blend 3

2484917
division	modulo
instead of converting to a string use division and the modulo to extract the digits

2484942
google-chrome	firefox
you might also want to try using firebug for firefox or the developer tools in google-chrome to make sure that the request is actually being sent and inspect the result

2484946
integer	fractions
is there any useful module on cpan that returns number of biggest fractions of date interval return integer number of years months days hours minutes seconds between two dates to use in sentence like n days ago or m months ago

2484983
hide	show
i d advise either loading the images with ajax or simply putting them in the html and using jquery to show or hide them as necessary

2485036
rss	feed
i m trying to mashup varioius rss feed

pop-up	dialog
i am not referring to a custom dialog like the jquery dialog there is a default pop-up for credentials which looks different depending on browser same as with javascript alert but i don t know how to display it

2485076
inherited	subclassing
as pascal i initially thought that injection does not work with inherited but this problem continued when i directly called em.persist in the subclassing

2485095
width	height
the only real way to do it is to check x y positioning and height width of each element to calculate collisions geometrically

2485192
rss	feed
given the number of variations the number of people mixing namespaces usually to use a full content element in a version of rss that doesn t have one and the number of invalid feed

2485207
google-chrome	firefox
and im trying to figure out a way for firefox or google-chrome to setup anytime it sees for instance a a web based page for equipment like cisco linksys sonicwall t1 controllers from the manufacture in the title bar or from the originating page place a set up 2 - 3 passwords to auto log on with

2485210
post	get
thanks to goran for pushing me to get the real source tables to post here which i m still not going to post because i m too lazy to redact them as appropriate for easy viewing and protection of the innocent but i should have at least printed them out before asking

2485242
lisp	scheme
source scheme lisp nested loops and recursion

2485271
ordinals	difference
on the off chance that perhaps the ordinals position of the indexed field might make a difference i also tried a unique index on the second column only and this came out exactly the same size

2485277
haskell	ocaml
f# is definitely based on ocaml and takes ideas from other languages such as haskell and shares many aspects with them however there is also a lot of other things

2485286
google-chrome	firefox
tested to work in firefox ie google-chrome although thinking about handling document.onload too

2485308
nsstring	nsxmlparser
i am usin the nsxmlparser and am wondering how i can parse iso-8859-1 correctly into an nsstring

2485315
put	get
put this together and we get

2485343
children	parent
yet another approach is to use a layered div approach in which the top content and bottom are all children of a parent div that contains the background

2485382
dictionary	map
generally you would map a simpler dictionary string string as

2485387
unsigned	short	int	chars
when i step into each line of the above code the debug cursor jumps straight from the unsigned short port line to the first local_address.sin line even though i am using step into f11 it does not stop at struct int chars or socket lines it jumps straight over them

2485392
rss	feed
it is able to parse a variety of rss and atom syndication feed and versions and emit whatever syndication feed format version you want

2485392
rss	feed
publishing rss and atom feed

2485462
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
but possibly it is the uinavigationcontroller that is responding to this notification or uitabbarcontroller

2485490
versioning	upgrade
any paid content each has on the app store versioning should be available for their beta though as usual for app upgrade and one-owner multiple-devices scenarios

2485532
required	placeholder
the contents of this placeholder can obviously vary from child to child and is obviously not required to be used

2485563
min	max
i would like to display salary sal min sal mid and sal max using a line graph

2485613
post	get
strangely however if you limit to just one friend f_id1 you will get back post user_id made to their friends wall

2485631
width	height
with the code below i m getting an argument exception invalid parameter when creating the new bitmap with the new height and width and i really don t understand why.

2485643
unsigned	short
thing is java does not have unsigned primitives so i am not able to send values greater than max value of signed short allowed

2485643
unsigned	short
how can i do this converting int to short and send over the network without worrying about truncation and signed unsigned int

2485667
unsigned	short
firstly java int short and byte types are all signed not unsigned

2485667
division	multiplication
on the other hand the semantic of multiplication and division are such that signed and unsigned flavors have to be handled separately

2485682
width	height
if you try to create a bitmap with zero height and width that is the exception you ll get

2485691
getchar	fgetc	int	chars
forget the name - remember that getc and getchar and fgetc return an int not a chars

2485691
int	chars
they have to return an int because they need to return every possible valid chars value plus eof

2485691
stdout	stderr
the bogus character messages are printed on stderr not stdout

2485697
width	height
it works independent of screen size because the blackberry app just gets all three parts and generates an appropriately sized bitmap using the screen width and height

2485697
width	height
however i have not found any way to get the height width of the window in android

2485697
width	height
i think this might be possible using the dimensions of my layout managers but i cannot get the height width of them in the oncreate method so i m not sure what to do exactly

2485698
gridview	objectdatasource
it s ok to use datatable in the ui a gridview and other controls can be binded easily to its data through an objectdatasource and paging and sorting is automagic

2485725
equals	compareto
in the end compareto must also be consistent with equals

2485732
int	chars
not exactly sure if the string that is being validated should check whether the contents only contains numbers or can be actually represented in the valid range of an int one way to approach this problem is to iterate over the chars of a string and check that the chars are only composed of numbers

2485733
processors	hyperthreading
hyperthreading twin processors

2485756
google-chrome	safari
it s just a layout issue with your page in webkit the rendering engine in safari and google-chrome

2485771
facebook	fbconnect
something where i could create my own custom login screen asking for the facebook login username and password and then using the fbconnect native methods to validate that info and retrieve a valid session

2485839
hide	show
try using a dataview as your binding source and use dataview.rowfilter to hide rows or show rows of your choosing

2485863
hide	show
it turns out that my first view the one with the map on it didn t have a title set in fact i hide the navigation bar because i didn t want to show it

2485909
quicksort	heapsort
some more common and more efficient algorithms include quicksort merge sort and heapsort among many others

2485915
filtering	grouping
next we filtering the blank lines out and determine each line s index and grouping them by the modulus of the aforementioned index

2485946
int	chars
you could also define a specific and replace every either3 int string chars with mytype every left3 with myint every mid3 with mystr and every right3 with mychar

2485979
disk	ram
in that i can get only ram size i can t get the specific disk space like c and d

2485999
width	height
svg width 500 height 200 version 1.1

2485999
width	height
rect id simplerect width 100px height 75px

2486023
portrait	landscape
as the title of this question implies our best-case scenario is the ability to detect the orientation change and use it to alter the css on the fly so as to present a slightly different page for landscape versus portrait

2486071
superclass	subclassing
but you can t do that if you actually have a -- those pointers must always be to b or subclassing thereof not to a a superclass of b

2486098
post	get
i did get a fair number of warnings on the console though regarding bytes per row setting not being high enough - after reading answers to this post i ended up setting it to 0 which lets the system determine the right value

2486133
min	max
instead of an array or a min heap i would use a max heap since you only want to check for distances less than the 10th closest point

2486144
opera	firefox
now the above script works fine in firefox opera and ie8

2486144
opera	firefox
firefox opera ie9 etc

2486185
jobs	cron
and i also want to induce sleep between cron jobs

2486220
public	protected
however by convention the access modifier public private protected is always given first static and or final if applicable are given next followed by the return-type

2486294
put	get
you should get the same values out of a list that you put in to them

2486327
post	get
however even with these meaures they will still have access to the scripts so long as they know how to post the data and also get the new code each day

2486334
width	height
i have the css set on the new window so that the image height and width are both 100 and overflow is set to hidden so that the window can be resized

2486347
post	put
to protect you against this you could put a cookie into the browser and have the cookie value sent in the post form too by hidden field or just add it to .post

2486349
config	ini
python has the configparser or configparser in 3.0 that is geared towards ini style config files

2486368
translation	localization
in localization file config locals fr.yml these categories were translation to french

2486382
width	height
so when you call resizeto it fires detects the inner height width isn t the desired aspect ratio and resizes the entire window frames and toolbars and all

2486390
post	get
i serve my entire cms from the same url for security and scaleability using mostly post instead of get parameters

2486426
cstring	bstr
in our com project we need to choose between best string class implementation so that bstr used for com interfaces and elegant string class like cstring provides many string manipulation apis

2486437
pop-up	dialog
is it possible for a webpage to pop-up a open folder dialog ask the user to select a folder then show the contents of that folder in a list or something in the webpage

2486464
cstring	bstr
you can use _bstr_t attach to create _bstr_t instance from cstring allocsysstring call in this case you don t need to care about bstr release

2486582
atomic	interlocked
and to be thread-safe the increment and decrement-check operations have to be interlocked atomic which can have a severely negative effect on multiple cores

2486662
bazaar	git
i too have been looking for a case where say subversion fails to merge a branch and mercurial and git bazaar ... does the right thing

2486756
ubuntu	linux
my subversion repository currently is installed on a dual boot system with windows and ubuntu linux installed

2486756
ubuntu	linux
the repository files will be accessed by the linux svn service if my laptop runs with ubuntu

2486799
put	get
i put it live and get an error saying warning call-time pass-by-reference has been deprecated

2486802
rss	feed
we have some funny restrictions where we can t simply publish the rss feed to the public

2486812
goto	break
there might be a more structured command to control the flow like a break or a continue which has been implemented by the compiler in the same way as a goto so that reflector can t tell the difference

2486859
rss	feed
you have put in a template to match and correct the elements with the wrong media rss namespace but you don t have anything to match the other elements attributes in the rss feed

2486859
rss	feed
that does not preserve the original rss feed s xml and produces output that is not valid rss xml structure

2486903
pop-up	dialog
so before you do an access to the web app check to see if the cookie is there and pop-up the login dialog activity whatever if needed

2486920

comparator	comparable
make each object s class implement java.lang.comparable and write the comparison logic for each class there then just accept comparable instead of object and call comparator

2486971
vrml	x3d
given that the w3c seems to follow closely that project and that several render backends are planned to be used actually webgl but later google o3d for example maybe the old dream of vrml x3d guys could become reality in a not so distant future

2487005
versioning	upgrade
it appears that all post-fsfs format upgrade are optional not mandatory â so all you need to do is ensure that your repository was created by the oldest versioning of subversion involved

2487036
free	malloc
if you were out of memory in a defect free program malloc would return an error indication

2487070
post	get
well because post methods are built to add stuff to an app get methods are supposed to be used to get information without side effects

2487070
post	get
so rather than your .post call expecting data and handling the callback what i d recommend is having your controller expose a method for creating new chat messages via post and then another method that get the last x chat messages or the messages since a certain timestamp or whatever

2487090
width	height
this happens because firefox draws a 1px dashed border around the element with 100 width and height when you click on it making it too large for the window to fit by just 1px

2487096
hide	show
what you should do is create new jpanel for all the windows you want to show then remove or hide the panel you want to hide and add or show the one you want to show

lwp	libwww-perl
you could use libwww-perl perldoc lwp and have more control about the download process

2487164
hash	md5
doing an md5 or sha hash is very easy and match the downloaded one with what you re expecting

2487223
min	max
however if i read you correct the 2 resultsets are fundamentally different the min max is an operation on the 1st result set after filtering and not on the original data

2487225
vbscript	vb6
interestingly a very similar issue occurs in vb6 vbscript where for function byref x function x function x and call function x are all slightly different in which value they pass by reference function x passes a reference to the result of the x expression and not x

2487291
apache	nginx
alternatively you may find nginx + apache + mod_wsgi a more stable approach - nginx is a fantastic front-end webserver for serving static content but apache is excellent for hosting dynamic processes

2487299
subtract	add
you need to provide methods to add subtract to the counter and it is your duty to make them thread-safe

what i have works perfectly in google-chrome firefox and safari

2487620
opera	firefox
you can see it live here if you use a browser that supports svg filters e.g opera or firefox

2487622
subclass	abstract-class
i m handling this by defining an abstract-class outputprovider that i will subclass for each individual case

2487679
profiler	vtune
added to that i would use a real profiler like vtune ptu than the one available in any visual studio version

2487689
google-chrome	firefox	mouse	keyboard
what i d like is a javascript function that can be called in order to restore keyboard and mouse focus to the flash app and which will work in ie firefox and google-chrome

2487726
ivar	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
a subclassing can t have a declared ivar with the same name as one of its superclass s declared ivars even if the superclass s ivar is private

2487726
superclass	subclassing
this seems to me like a violation of the meaning of private since the subclassing is affected by the superclass s choice of something private

2487734
range	infinity
the range for the above decibels is negative infinity to zero and for linear is 0.0 to 1.0

2487739
vtune	shark
to decide where to apply this you may use a sample-based analyzer like shark vtune or zoom to highlight the instructions slowed by denormal values

2487797
draggable	droppable
i m using the jquery droppable draggable to reorder a treeview made up of ul li items

2487797
draggable	droppable
when i define the items to be draggable the code doesnâ t work any more the items are classed as droppable but the drop event wonâ t run

2487820
draggable	droppable
however if you want a tree view you should be using sortable instead of draggable droppable

2487823
public	protected
the private protected and public directives exist for the benefit of the compiler

2487823
ivar	subclassing
there is still objective-c s relatively flat namespace to content with and that is what prevents you from having an ivar of the same name in a subclassing

2487852
config	ini
you cannot instantiate a database logger from an ini config yet

2487857
client-side	server-side
you didn t specify in your question if you own the server-side method or just the client-side call so the excerpt below covers both cases

2487868
width	height
it requires that all images be fully loaded so it can custom resize each individual image based on it s own aspect ratio width height etc calculate the width of containing div and calculate the slide distance from one image to another

2487876
imap	nntp
executive summary essentially the author eventually gives up on using this header and recommends and shows a different approach which is also implemented in the c-client library part of the uw imap toolkit open source package which is not for imap only -- don t let the name fool you it also works for pop nntp local mailboxes c

2487879
for-loop	arrays
to iterate over an arrays use a standard for-loop with an index

2487912
mako	genshi
numerous template languages such as cheetah django templates genshi mako mighty might serve as an example

2487931
clang	llvm
is there some c c++ ide for windows which is integrated with the llvm compiler and clang c c++ analyzer just like modern xcode do

2487931
clang	llvm
yes clang was not able to be used with complex c++ code but trunk clang already can compile llvm itself

2488093
addition	multiplication
matrix multiplication addition fft s convolution etc

2488184
inherited	properties
the hasownproperty checks are because this statement iterates over all properties inherited or not and if something like some javascript frameworks augmented the array.prototype or object.prototype objects those augmented properties will be also iterated

2488214
javadb	hsqldb
instead of a fullfledged database server you can also consider an embedded javabased database such as sun oracle javadb apache derby hsqldb or sqlite each which are of course accessible through the jdbc api the usual way

2488219
postgresql	mysql
these would include postgresql hypersonic sql mysql sqllite on the free side and oracle ms sql server and others on the paid side

you can add the view of the uinavigationcontroller to the uiwindow and either let it obscure the first view or remove that view from the uiwindow

2488387
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
that s the direct answer to your question however if you simply want uinavigationcontroller functionality but don t want to see the uinavigationbar on the first screen - check out

2488395
jtextpane	jeditorpane
but you can use jtextpane or jeditorpane

2488412
post	get
if you only need to test the results of fairly straightforward get and post requests a service like pingdom would probably suffice

2488445
trie	tree
i personally feel you can check out b+ tree or trie

2488456
serializable	deserialization
basically they can find out enough information from the object class for meaningful automatic serializable deserialization

postgresql	mysql
okay i tried this for you on postgresql i don t have mysql here so maybe it s a little bit different

2488508
put	get	post	put	post	get
each rest method get post put delete is a simple condition in the view function

2488537
width	height
i simply inserted width and height values into the html and the script was then able to properly format the show without the images being loaded as it grabs the necessary data straight from the markup as opposed to the images themselves

2488552
post	get
never send anything that can be changed by the user such as get or post data straight to a database without at least using this function

2488555
freebsd	netbsd
the bsd family netbsd freebsd

2488610
metaclass	subclassing
michael s answer is nice and simple but if you wish to avoid having to add that line to each unit subclassing - maybe you have a bunch of other lists like that one a metaclass is an easy way to solve the problem

2488613
post	get
if i write out the size of the stream i get the size of the file i post ed from my application so i reckon the data is in there somewhere

2488653

i don t want to use md5 and the code must be portable and with salt

2488742
getter	setter
public fields no getter setter

2488759
post	get
python is a dynamic language that get interpreted and compiled on runtime and as such cannot have better performance then c++ - take a look at this post for comparison between several programming languages

2488770
int	boolean
this function is capable to return testing result such as boolean int unknown type etc

2488784

post	get
i guess that prototype doesn t work well with http methods other than get and post here s the ticket describing similar problem though proposed patch didn t work for me

2489011
findwindow	showwindow
you can probably show the window later on by using the findwindow and showwindow functions

2489016
firefox	safari
it works fine in firefox and safari and from what i gather in ie 8

2489065
mp3	wmv	mp3	ogg	wmv	ogg

2489087
mouseover	mouseout
peraphs is the same of mouseover mouseout and hover

2489096
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
class subclassing inherited from superclass

2489096
superclass	subclassing
it seems to me that subclassing should be able to see superclass because package a.b.c is a subpackage of a.b.

2489122
cstdio	iostream
however stringstreams iostream are far far superior to the cstring and cstdio lot

2489122
printf	strlen
if you re using strings always use the c++ string libraries over strlen printf and that

2489174
getter	setter
if i need such a generic getter method i have no clue how to transform this generic setter above to a generic getter method

2489215
min	max
also using new ternary if instead of min and max seems to be consistently faster

2489246
getter	setter
the doc you linked shows the model having getter setter like this

2489254
pascal	delphi
delphi or free pascal projects at

2489281
foreground	tray
the code works great only if the form stays in the foreground not minimized to tray but if you add a notifyicon and minimize the form to tray and turn the showintaskbar to false so that you only have an icon in the tray the program wont catch any clipboard changes anymore .

2489323
viewdidload	viewwillappear
viewdidload and viewwillappear in commentsubmissionview do not fire

2489343
northwind	adventureworks
i think doing a dw on an existing popular dataset like northwind or adventureworks is probably not a great idea because so many people have done them

2489377
width	height
when you set center the frame s x y height and width are adjusted around that center point.

2489397
button	checkbox
regardless when a user clicks a button on the page i want to loop through the items in myitemscontrol and determine if the checkbox element associated with the item is checked

2489398
put	get
this situation may seem a bit like a chicken and egg problem application developers won t move to 3.x till the libraries get there libraries developers would rather only maintain one branch and are waiting in an attempt to time the porting to py3k in a way that they can put the their py2.x branches in maintenance shortly thereafter

2489421
error-handling	exception-handling
more to the point you should only use exception-handling when error-handling would otherwise mess up the structure of your code which shouldn t be the case in an is the data in this form ok - yes fine accept and close event handler

2489451
postgresql	mysql
for example pyqt is already available for python 3 as well as 2 and you can use postgresql a splendid open-source sql database engine much more standard than mysql via py-postgresql

2489451
postgresql	mysql
so if the third party extensions you re pining for are say wxpython and mysqldb perhaps you can try these alternatives i m biased of course since i ve long preferred qt to wxwidgets and postgresql to mysql on purely technical grounds -- but the prompt porting of the related python extensions to python 3 does also hint that these extensions are being more actively and vigorously developed so that might be another nudge to try them

2489514
floor	sqrt
floor and adding 0.5 is done to prevent cases like sqrt 4 returning 1.9999999.

2489528
google-chrome	firefox
the dldatauri version works great in firefox poorly in google-chrome can t save and not at all in ie

2489528
google-chrome	firefox

2489548
nhibernate	queryover
i m using the queryover api that is part of nhibernate 3.x

2489576
pop-up	dialog
i usually prefer and recommend to other developers the use of the jquery-ui dialog widget but in this scenario the images are actually webcam feeds that the user will want to pop out of the main window and have open even if the main window is closed so while i appreciate the move from pop-up windows in general please avoid suggesting alternatives that involve same-window widgets

2489612
winpcap	jpcap
jpcap is just a wrapper for winpcap and this underlying mechanism can not drop observed packets

i would like to have a background image in my qgraphicsview that is always scaled and cropped if necessary to the size of the viewport without scrollbars and without scrolling with the keyboard and mouse

2489769
client-side	server-side
personally if your client-side and server-side validation results in a different error message being presented then i think that s your problem not the split between the two

2489792
client-side	server-side
server-side is always required because you can t always assume client-side validation was correct

2489858
firefox	safari
i tested multiple versions of firefox ie7 ie6 and safari

2489867
writetofile	nsdata
take a look at the nsdata writetofile atomically method

2489893
integer	unsigned
and just as an optimization hint store your ip addresses as an unsigned integer field not varchar 15

2489899
uiview	calayer
the lightest-wight solution would be to create a small helper class in the the file as the uiview that s using the calayer

2489907
min	max
that s a special case that you can use but the general way to scan convert a convex polygon like a triangle is to put all the points into a list and then for each scan line draw a line between the min and max column

2489909
inherited	properties
i guess having that particular properties return object just abstracts the return type somewhat not locking it in to an object further down the inherited chain

2489987
g++	gcc
g++ the c++ compiler is a sibling of gcc the c compiler and g++ is allowing you to use that c99 feature while vs has no such thing

2489994
pos-tagging	stemming
leaving other practical questions aside parsing pos-tagging stemming and of course the very issue of identifying mapping a given word.

2490016
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
the viewdidappear and viewwillappear methods will only be called if you are

2490016
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
in the situation you have where you are adding a view to another view you must invoke viewwillappear and viewdidappear on the view controller yourself or they won t happen

2490016
accessor	properties
it will always be invoked after loadview when the view properties accessor is invoked on the controller for the first time unless an error occurs

2490029
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox

2490035
opera	safari
the inset keyword is not supported in safari 4 but is supported in safari 5 and opera 10.5

2490145
post	get
i would highly suggest though that you ask yourself where you want to be as a software developer in a few years then post a new question asking how you can get there describing exactly what there is

2490167
width	height
width of box and height of is fixed but i need height of content flexible

2490415
hide	show
if you re talking about the image that displays when you call setdivider or android divider in xml i don t think you can hide it on some rows and show it on other rows

2490418
hide	show
the problem is you re trying to hide and show an inline element

2490418
width	height
they re easy to animate growing and shrinking because you simply animate their height and or width

versioning	upgrade
answer thank s to fazil s investigations upgrade matlab to a versioning greater than 2009a

2490486
comparator	comparable
you can do this by making your type implements comparable or by providing a separate comparator

2490486
comparator	comparable
when to use comparable vs comparator

2490513
cstring	bstr
the best you can do is to use cstring allocsysstring and you better use a bstr wrapper like ccombstr or _bstr_t to manage the resulting bstr lifetime

2490585
stdout	fflush
you have to fflush stdout

2490588
stdout	fflush
fflush stdout

what you do instead is use salt and a good hash function and store compare only the hash values

2490627
google-chrome	firefox
this is not working in ie but it does in firefox and google-chrome

2490627
google-chrome	firefox
then it worked in ie but stopped working in firefox and google-chrome

2490631
pop-up	dialog
a checkbox-look button pop-up a file open dialog is ideal

2490654
width	height
i know in advance that this bitmap is a 24bpp and its width and height

2490662
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
from memory i think there are quite significant size differences in the default sizes of buttons between ie firefox and safari - i dont really use opera but i assume there are size issues there - so if you were then to set a padding on the button in css it might not render correctly any more in safari and firefox

2490666

2490770
affinity	processors
see also this codeproject article which shows the point pretty well along with some ways to set the processors affinity

2490789

2490921
for-loop	loops

openssl	crypto++
on the external libraries front you have plenty of choice including nss openssl crypto++ .

vsto	add-in
further vsto does not enable the creating of user defined worksheet functions udfs so you would need a vba front-end or create a managed com add-in without using vsto in order to do this

2492585
vsto	add-in
unfortunately vsto is only available for excel 2003 and above and i think you have to create separate add-in for excel 2003 and excel 2007

2492585
vsto	add-in
managed com add-in made without using vsto on the other hand can be made compatible for excel 2000 and above with no difficulty

2492585
vsto	add-in
lastly vsto does not support the creation of udfs and therefore you d have to either create a managed automation add-in for that or utilize a vba front-end which calls your vsto functions

2492624
folder	directory
i got round this during development by having the image stored in a folder which was part of the project but after release of the project to the server the application refuses to allow the image to be saved in any directory within c inetpub wwwroot

2492649

2493207
namedtuple	dictionary
edit it looks like the _namedtuple function is provided by pylast and will use a real namedtuple in python 2.6+ but will fall back to a plain old dictionary in python 2.5 or older

2493443
children	parent
i have it in subclass persona and the collection is made only with parent class and not with children classes

2494359
factors	matrix
there doesn t appear to be a way you can initialize lu with a pre-existing upper triangular matrix lu s constructor makes no assumptions and just starts factors but i would think you could either use it as is and live with the performance hit of the redundant factors or just take solve method and adapt it to your needs

2494439
realloc	calloc
secondly comment 2 why did you call calloc when the realloc on a double pointer was called previously...

2494520

2495859
clearinterval	settimeout	setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout

int	double
re edit i see you want to return boxed types like int double etc

folder	directory
edit once referenced you will have to browse to the install folder of the starter kit to add the reference the dlls will be be copied to the output directory because the copylocal property of the reference in vs will be true so when you publish the project via vs or compile the dlls will be included in the bin folder so no you will not have to install the starter kit on the server also

2496467
folder	directory
usually hosts give you access to at least one directory above that in which case a much better solution would be to create a folder there into which you put your application

free	malloc
the code highlights the programmer s responsibility to manage the memory - for every malloc there s a free if not you have a memory leak

2496745
nsstring	nserror
this is actually not how i do it though - i simply created a generic myhttprequest wrapper class that is the delegate of the nsurlconnection it accepts a url nsstring post body processes all the network stuff and returns an nsstring result and an nserror to the caller - a little bit higher abstraction

2496761
width	height
for example if my window is 200px by 200px and the user wants to resize it i want the ratio between the width and the height at 1 1 so that if the new width is 400px the new height is forced to 400px

now i can easily get the max order value for the day and put it in the group header by using the ssrs max function

2499509

stdout	stderr
with that code the stdin stdout stderr file descriptor of my prgname are associated to the socket when looking with ls -la proc pid fd and so the terminal capabilities of this process doesn t work

2500344
stdout	stderr
a test with a connection via ssh sshd on the remote device and executing localy under the ssh connection prgname show that the stdin stdout stderr fd of this process prgname are associated to a pty and so the terminal capabilities of this process are working fine

2500430
subtract	add
that is if the previous angle is negative subtract 360 and add 360 if the previous angle is positive

2500446
fast-forward	merge
footnote speaking of my experience i eventually found switching fast-forward to off was mostly helpful for git newcomers - however once the feel for workflows and concepts start to sink in you definitely want to avoid blurring your log graph with tons of pointless merge remote ..blarf type commits

integer	unsigned
i ve got to modify a c program and i need to include a set of unsigned integer sets

sorting	filtering
this question is similar to gwt table that supports sorting scrolling and filtering

2500659
keydown	keyup
you should remember that if a key is hold it will write several times and if you are only using keyup keydown or keypress you will still get the other characters that were repeated unless you erase all the undesired chars from the textfield - which if long could diminish performance

2500779
oncreate	setcontentview
yeah either setcontentview hasn t been called in oncreate of the activity or else the view you are trying to get isn t an edittext

2500838
google-chrome	firefox
i really recommend browsing with google-chrome when you re looking to debug javascript it s error console is very useful for not just determining errors like this but also for pinpointing the location in the script that is throwing the error which might be an advantage beyond firebug in firefox

int	boolean
it s not very good practise to use yes no for your you re better off using an int or boolean value

2501508

however if you want to do something with each of the radio buttons in the group you could use getelementsbyname which returns a collection of all elements found with the given name

2501801
implements	extends
you could extends a say interface b extends a and extends aimpl and implements b class bimpl extends aimpl implements b .

2501831
jsf	seam
i thought the hidden parameter would work because that is how i would do it with straight html and i m a little surprised that its not working for jsf seam

2501950
hex	binary
imagine that i have a several viewer component that are used for displaying text and they have few modes that user can switch different font presets for viewing text binary hex

2501954
scrollable	panels
now i found that i can spare myself a lot of trouble in my js project if i insert a scrollable iframe into each panels

2501954
width	height
this is also true in particular of the iframes 100 width 100 height

2501954
width	height	google-chrome	firefox
all of this works a treat in firefox and google-chrome but ie6 is doing something rather cute so long as i do not affect the width of the browser window but only change its height only the panel div changes in height

2502008
folder	directory
check your git installation folder or the directory where you have launched the command

2502008
folder	directory
usually the contents are just downloaded in the current working directory in a folder

2502039
getter	setter
the property call defines the property and the synthesize call will create setter and getter for you methods to set and retrieve the value of itemid

2502133
udp	tcp
most commonly at the bottom of the application layer you will be choosing between tcp ip or udp

2502133
udp	tcp
if you need in order delivery of messages you need to use tcp as opposed to udp

2502144
superclass	subclassing
you need to change the base class superclass to have a virtual method with the same signature as the derived class subclassing

2502204
google-chrome	firefox
it looks correct in firefox google-chrome ie8 but not ie6 7 the footer s background is white and inside the box

2502279
mouse	keyboard
however there is an authentication system which prevents unauthorized programs from access an x server the place where the keyboard screen and mouse are

2502290
put	get
you would get the same error if you put a system.out.println in the first method after the return statement in it

2502322
width	height
you ll need to use the pre-defined width and height of the gui with the internal variables a_screenwidth and a_screenheight and force param2 of gui show as an expression to make it work

2502322
width	height
for example if the width of the gui is 900 and the height is 550

2502347
for-loop	arrays
your second line does not even access the arrays - make sure that it s not the first line of the body of the for-loop that throws the exception

2502367
firefox	safari
it does not work in safari 4 but does work in firefox 3.5.9

2502368
valgrind	gprof
i ve found valgrind cachegrind with kcachegrind to be helpful in analysis of un-prepared no gprof code embedded binaries

2502397
jobs	cron
i ve seen some people suggest cron jobs but i m not sure how feasible it would be to create three new cron jobs every time i send an email use them once and then delete them afterward

2502411
chaiscript	c++
i m using script language chaiscript with c++ and qt

2502412
opera	google-chrome
looking at google s browser security document the following browsers translate non-reserved nn sequences in the address bar msie7 msie8 ff3 opera google-chrome

2502431
rss	feed
i am getting last 20 status updates posted by some twitter user via rss feed the feed xml is parsed and the statuses are displayed in a listview

2502431
post	get
when i click a listview item i get the option of re-tweeting and post reply

2502443
pop-up	dialog
in a long-running operation i m showing a pop-up dialog created from progressdialog to prevent other operations from happening

2502463
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox google-chrome etc

2502569
gwt	cssresource
if you use cssresource to inject your css file gwt will handle pruning unused styles for you just like it does in the case of unused code

2502614
put	get
i didn t put in all of the fields but you get the idea

2502623
gwt	cssresource
if you bundle css files with clientbundle via the cssresource class the gwt compiler can actually generate errors on unused css selectors

2502638
pop-up	dialog
in the dialog that pop-up you ll see the command line which includes all jars parameters etc

2502663
jsf	seam
which means seam jsf was treating my form submit as a non-faces request

2502694
hash	md5
an md5 hash is often used to verify the integrity of a file or document

2502694
hash	md5
here s a good article on generating an md5 hash in javascript

2502712
children	parent
this was another post i ran into when i was researching - sql selecting parent and their children

2502763
hash	md5
for example check out the pseudo code or an actual javascript implementation for computing the md5 hash of a string

2502765
mouseleave	mouseenter
i thought i was missing something too but i do know that the jquery validation plug in doesn t react to mouseenter mouseleave

2502765
versioning	upgrade
i also found the need to upgrade to the latest versioning of jquery.validate.js from the developer s page because we are using a later versioning of jquery 1.4 here

2502773
hide	show
i want to hide all the descendents of the ul for my tree menu when the page loads up then as each main li link is clicked display the direct child and if the direct child has children grandchild when the the child is clicked i want it to show the grandchild elements

2502866
cpu	hyperthreading
i can t say i ve specifically tried #cores + 1 but on our systems intel i7 940 4 hyperthreading cores lots of ram and velociraptor drives and our build large-scale c++ build that s alternately cpu and i o bound there is very little difference between -j4 and -j8

2502872
stdout	stderr
this worked for me for redirecting stdout stderr can be handled similarly

2502963
wxpython	pygtk
also pygtk is lighter than wxpython but i ended up bitting the bullet and using wxpython for the same purpose recently it is heavy but it didn t have any affect on the script performance

2503025
children	parent
but when traversing the tree i cannot manage to determine the actual number of children without iterating over the parent node

2503028
versioning	upgrade
just upgrade rubygems as normal if it messes up just download the last versioning and run sudo ruby setup.rb

2503037
spaces	delimiter
assuming it s white spaces delimiter this code should do

2503046
free	malloc
if not for example it intends to use free you ll need to use malloc instead

2503087
getter	setter
i would like to be able to have a default mapping controller that i can configure then override the getter setter for a particular field if needed

2503111
installation	upgrade
i haven t actually tried this myself but you should be able to use an installation disc for rhel 5.4 to upgrade even if you are off-line although you ll need to get on-line somewhere to download the disk image

2503111
rpm	yum
basically you create a custom repository on you hard drive with the rpm files from the disk and point yum at it or use the disc directly

2503114
rss	feed
for example take yes i know her twitter page off by heart lol on the right hand side of the page is a link to her rss feed

2503172
put	get
i put the resulting library in opt local lib and i still get the same error message

2503269
int	chars
my first idea was to substring those three chars convert them to an int add 400 to it convert them back to a string and then call replace on the original string

2503348
cairngorm	puremvc
i ve seen massive misuse of frameworks like puremvc and cairngorm mainly because apply them in an all-or-nothing fashion

2503349
hamcrest	lambdaj
in his last release lambdaj implements it with a smart use of closure and hamcrest matcher

2503351
ncover	fxcop
inside there it builds the projects runs nunit ncover fxcop stylecop etc

2503351
teamcity	nant
i haven t used teamcity but there should be a way to pull down the source and then run an msbuild or nant build script which will then handle the build steps

2503358
jtextfield	jlabel	jtabbedpane	jtextfield	jtabbedpane	jlabel
unlike many basic components jtextfield jlabel etc the jtabbedpane ignores the foreground and background colors when setting up to paint

2503365
freebsd	linux
many appliances are based off of stripped down linux or freebsd kernels running apache or a lightweight httpd

2503388
jquery	simplemodal
the simplemodal jquery plugin gives you the option to autoposition your modal window

2503407
put	get
i would hesitate to put code that calls user_default c functions in production code so you might want to look at the source for the function and replicate it in your own code so you don t get bitten by a behaviour change in a future erlang release

2503415
versioning	upgrade
i would continue with the practice of exporting the site as upgrade are needed but have a symbolic link to a directory outside of the versioning controlled directory with the user uploaded content

2503476
width	height
itextsharp uses 72 pixels per inch so if you know the height and width of your desired page size in inches just multiply those numbers by 72 to get mywidth and myheight

2503507
accessor	properties
if you need thread safety you can bake that into the accessor methods properties

2503522
rss	feed
using the open source trac provides a wiki integrated rss feed of the commits to the project and code browser

2503594
mp3	ogg
it uses a list to store mp3 and ogg files

2503594
mp3	ogg
however i would like to create this list myplaylist dynamically with a javascript function which would retrieve the mp3 urls and the ogg vorbis urls from the html code

2503623
opera	firefox
i ve tested on firefox 3.5.8 and opera 10.10 on ubuntu

2503642
getter	setter
in order for custom properties to be de serialized properly you need both a getter and a setter

2503647
children	parent
1 when you realloc the node list you actually move in memory the node objects so the parent pointer in their children must me updated as well

2503660
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol	rss	feed
i am displaying an rss feed in the uitableview in rssviewcontroller depending on the segment selected on the uisegmentedcontrol

2503660
rss	feed
for example i have two rss feed by default i am displaying the rss feed at segment 0

2503660
rss	feed
the rss feed that i load at segment 1 has only 5 rows

2503660
rss	feed
when i scroll the rss feed at segment 0 then before the scrolling stops i switch to the rss feed at segment 1 i crash the app with the following error

2503660
rss	feed
if i wait till the scrolling on the rss feed at segment 0 stops then select segment 1 everything works fine

2503739
inline	inlining
i looked up inline member functions to be sure i understood and i dont think the inlining is the cause but i am not sure what is

2503761
inject	interceptor
an injector can easily be inject into your guice aop interceptor some thing like this

2503774
post	get
if i have a controller action that may recieve both http get and http post from a number of different sources with each source sending different data

2503784
super	extends
for the long answer all that super and extends stuff in the generic type constraints is what josh bloch calls the pecs principle usually presented next to a picture of arnold -- i m not kidding

2503784
super	extends
producer extends consumer super

2503796
google-chrome	firefox
i have this code that it is working on firefox and google-chrome but in ie8 ie7 it s not working

2503816
bibtex	latex
i am a graduate student with many scripts bibliography data in bibtex thesis draft in latex presentations in open office posters in scribus and figures and result data

2503837
post	get
the usual pattern is to have two controller methods one controller method handles the get the other controller method handles the post

2503864
integer	unsigned
the docs specify the following datatypes for the integer storage type int integer tinyint smallint mediumint bigint unsigned big int int2 int8

2503873
folder	directory
turns out this error occurs when the mobile.browser file is placed in the app_browsers root folder so just make a sub directory for it instead of

2503912
subtraction	addition
those are aaa ascii adjust for addition aas subtraction aam mult aad div

2503920
webkit	gecko
with gecko and webkit the text displays fine

2503927
width	height
the only solution i know for this is either adding the shift to the image itself or using an absolutely positioned element with a slight offset hovering behind the element - but that would require you know the width and height in advance

2503942
getter	setter
actually i often use methods instead of direct access to attributes the good old getter setter approach sometimes

2503945
post	put
therefore you need to make a form that post to the action then put a or in the form

2503965
udp	tcp
you didn t specify tcp or udp so i ll just give you some general guidance

2503965
udp	tcp
for tcp or udp just allocate a single buffer of size n where n is the biggest message size you could possibly have sent from the remote player or server

2503965
udp	tcp
for your socket whether udp or tcp make it non-blocking

2504016
versioning	upgrade
my apps deploy the v1 schema from the initial script then run upgrade script for each versioning

2504016
versioning	upgrade
each script know how to upgrade from versioning n-1 to n and only that

2504016
versioning	upgrade
when you attach an older database you see the famous database is running the upgrade from versioning 611 to 612 and you see that the upgrade goes step by step does not upgrade straight to current versioning 651 or whatever is current in your case

2504016
versioning	upgrade
in other words your build server should build the current database using the upgrade scripts and then as a build step script out the database and produce a build drop with the current versioning schema script

2504026
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i ve tried setting the frame of self.tableview in different places viewdidload viewwillappear etc but nothing happens

2504052
hide	show
what i want to do is whatever link i click in the list it will show its corresponding table and hide all the others

2504053
viewdidload	viewwillappear
not viewdidload or viewwillappear

2504068
jboss	glassfish
any application server jboss glassfish will contain one to control what a loaded application can do

2504124
junit	easymock
typically you would only do this if you are using a lot of static methods from a particular class like i use it all the time for junit asserts and easymock

2504151
uiview	calayer
i have a uiview which has about 8 different calayer sublayers added to its layer

2504184
client-side	server-side
if you absolutely must have a client-side app look at making the server-side restful google this if you don t know what it is and you can utilise the existing http libraries in the .net framework to send and receive data to from the server

2504186
hash	md5
http post over ssl to with username and md5 hash of password - compare this to the md5 of the password you have stored for them

2504194
client-side	server-side
the server-side code is vbscript and so far we ve avoided the various javascript libraries by the simple expedient of almost never using client-side scripting

2504197
int	chars
evaluates to true and the only overload of find that would work is the chars c size_t pos version as bool can be converted to an int 1

2504224
int	chars
in fact quite a bit of i o depends on eof having a value that couldn t originate from the file which basically translates to a requirement that chars have a range that s smaller than int not just smaller than or equal to as the standard directly requires

2504224
unsigned	short	int	chars
that does leave one loophole though it s one that would generally be quite horrible that chars and short have the same range size_type is the same as unsigned short and int has a greater range than chars short

2504261
accessor	properties
a properties with a single name is basically prohibited by the same rule since it is internally a pair of methods with no argument for the get accessor

2504263
int	chars
seeing as there probably isn t a string predefined for each numerical value i m guessing that the computer goes through each bit of the int from right to left each time incrementing the appropriate values in the chars array base10 notation places

2504265
int	chars
so the declaration of int 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 will not compile as well as chars 3

2504337
youtube	vimeo
however i m also researching how i could provide an embed feature like youtube or vimeo etc. without compromising this security feature

2504343
uilabel	uitextview
this view has a uilabel a uiimageview and a uitextview

2504366
awt	swing
a netbeans form is actually just a displayable swing or awt container class which you populate with components like jtextfield objects

2504395
width	height
that is i can do away with the wrapping div and thus need not rely on ie6 to honour the automatic relative dimensioning height 100 width 100 of the wrapped iframe

2504436
int	chars
because 1 is an int and because 1 can t possibly be an address the compiler finds the only overload of string find it can call is the one with chars c size_t pos

2504478
pop-up	dialog
i need to pop-up a quick dialog for the user to select one option in a uitableview from a list of roughly 2-5 items

2504483
vsto	add-in
in a vsto add-in i m developing i need to execute a method with a specific delay

2504528
pthreads	fork
as long as you are working on a pthreads os you can use fork and exec

2504547
post	get
in the post body which lets me get all the data across multiple tracking ids for a range of dates

2504576
listview	gridview
i read this question on so and while it does give me some good insight i don t know how to add the necessary binding to a row because i am using a listview with a gridview as its view not a listbox

2504611
mouseleave	mouseenter
use the mouseenter and mouseleave events

2504669
bash	zsh
the shell bash zsh etc is responsible for wildcard expansion so in your first example there s no shell hence no expansion

2504769
google-chrome	firefox
debugging in google-chrome isn t as pleasant as firefox

2504777
button	checkbox
theres a button when clicked will add the selected checkbox value into database but right now when the button is clicked and after the postback the page will show the error system.nullreferenceexception

2504806
virtualenv	setuptools
python duh setuptools or pip virtualenv and an editor

2504813
comparator	comparable
if you don t pass an explicit comparator to a treeset it will try to compare the objects by assuming they are comparable

2504813
comparator	comparable
treesets are sorted sets and require either objects to be comparable or a comparator to be passed in to determine how to sort the objects in the set

2504816
comparator	comparable
for treeset you either have to make the elements comparable or provide a comparator

2504816
equals	compareto
the interface defines one method compareto that must return a negative integer zero or a positive integer if this object is less than equals to or greater than the other object respectively

2504835
postgresql	mysql
in python you may use postgresql mysql sqlite or some other database

2504835
pylons	cherrypy
there are about 200000 pylons zope django cherrypy werkzeug...i won t bother starting an argument by recommending one

2504835
wxpython	pygtk
there are wx bindings wxpython gtk+ bindings pygtk and two sets of qt bindings

2504838
vim	emacs
vim or emacs could be the most powerful but also the most difficult to learn at first

2504857
comparator	comparable
treeset is only appropriate if you need the set sorted either by the object s implementation of comparable or by a custom comparator passed to the treeset s constructor

2504861
src	attr
attr sets the given attribute in this case src

2504881
implements	extends
when the you call lookup on this object will only return the object that was used to initialize the object if it implements extends the object that is used in the query

2504896
ubuntu	linux
i ve used python on windows and on ubuntu and linux is much cleaner

2504977
int	double
and some of them are int double pointers c# pointers array and whatnot

2504984
opera	firefox
from my logging i found that in firefox and opera doing this automatically calls the plugin destroy method npp_destroy npapi

2505023
firefox	safari
this problem is on firefox mac and pc safari looks good

2505035
client-side	server-side
under-reporting by the client-side rig versus server-side eems to be the usual outcome of these comparisons

2505035
client-side	server-side
data sources recorded in server-side collection but not client-side

2505037
folder	directory
look in the samples directory of the webcontent folder

2505041
lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml	html5lib	html5lib	beautifulsoup
i ve read raves about beautifulsoup html5lib and lxml but i cannot figure out how to install any of these on windows

2505052
width	height
graphics.drawroundrect is better because it takes two parameters for the corners - elipse width and height and then you could apply both scale factors but it doesn t allow me to specify different radius for different corners

2505064
gridview	objectdatasource
i ve got a gridview connected to an objectdatasource which is bound to some custom objects in my code code is below

2505070
xls	.doc
we ve implemented a policy that all .doc files must have the svn needs-lock property set to prevent parallel access on files that are hard to merge we ve also done this for xls ppt pdf etc.

2505096
pull	push
until now i had only worked on my home desktop but i just bought a laptop and am trying to set it up so that i can work on the project from either computer and push pull changes

2505102
ecj	javac
as an aside another difference between ecj and javac in my experience javac will tell you to get lost if you have a string constant over 65535 bytes long this is a limitation in the class file format

2505117
children	parent
with css you can reference children from parent but not parent from children

2505127
lxml	beautifulsoup
if it is not well formed you need a fault tolerant parser such as beautifulsoup element tidy or lxml s html parser

2505127
lxml	beautifulsoup
lxml and elementree use a mostly compatible api that is more of a standard than beautifulsoup

2505127
lxml	elementtree
in my opinion lxml is the best module for working with xml documents but the elementtree included with python is still pretty good

2505127
elementtree	beautifulsoup
in the past i have used beautifulsoup to convert html to xml and construct elementtree for processing the data

2505129
firefox	safari
but i want to run it on web browsers internet explorer mozilla firefox safari etc.

2505155
pull	push
i still haven t worked out how to fix it properly since i want to continue to push pull to both repo s but manually adding the info to the project s .git config works

2505194
apache-fop	xhtml
in this case directly converting from xhtml to pdf a would be an ideal solution either using itext directly the example uses itextsharp a .net port of itext but it s the same for java or by using apache-fop as others have suggested which also uses itext internally when outputting to pdf and although it is more bloated inefficient and complicated to setup than using itext directly it might produce better results than the itext example -- only one way to settle that you have to try it out on a few of your xhtml files as samples

2505203
versioning	upgrade
what you want to do is set you installer up in such a way that the new versioning of your software sees the file deletions as upgrade to a prior versioning

2505203
versioning	upgrade
the upgrade guid always stays the same within your product family of different versioning

2505203
versioning	upgrade
in general if you follow this pattern and then specify file deletions in your new versioning the installer should interpret the file deletions as upgrade and you should not get any errors on subsequent execution of the newly-installed versioning

2505225
udp	tcp
both in tcp and udp

2505271
ienumerable	icollection
i see that implements icollection and ienumerable but that only allows me to read values not add them

2505296
submit	submission
therefore submission it twice would submit the order twice

2505296
post	get
in order to prevent this you need to make the refresh do a get request instead of a post request

2505296
post	get
this will make it so when the user hits refresh it will be sending a get request instead of a post request and it won t prompt for confirmation

2505296
post	get
user now will be refreshing a get request instead of a post request

2505307
post	get
alternatively use get instead of post to send your data.

2505309
post	get
the most used are get and post

2505317
unix	solaris
i am running python 2.6.2 on solaris 10 unix and recently installed the pythonldap 2.3.9

2505324
pull	push
if they re only created in mercurial then one work-around would be to set up a svn-gateway repo on the remote system and do the push from there and never pull from that repo back into mercurial

2505346
inherited	properties
a dependencyproperty is a properties whose value depends or can depend on some other source such as animation data binding styles or visual tree inherited

2505346
inherited	properties
imagine how you would implement something like styles or properties inherited the ability to set something like a font or data context on a parent element and have its value propagate to all child elements

2505358
stdout	stdio
the parent process can redirect the stdin and stdout streams of the child process implementing character-based message passing via stdio

2505366
inherited	properties
a dependency properties is a properties where the current value is dependent hence the name on other aspects such as default values validation coercion value inherited or animation

2505437
width	margin
you can make three css classes with appropriate margin so taht div willl be in center apply these classes on the basis of width of inner div

2505448
put	get
i also like a create a top-level application group into which i put the app delegate main xib file if any pch file info.plist app icon default.png and other things related just to the application so they are all easy to find - after you add a number of files each of those things can get lost in giant lists of stuff

2505477
getter	setter
because the getter and setter can act as a proxy

2505477
getter	setter
just because your getter setter is named getname and your property is called name doesn t mean it will always be that way

2505485
getter	setter
no one forces you to put in getter and setter for every variable

2505485
getter	setter
indeed blindly using private members + dummy getter setter for every variable is pointless even though many object oriented encapsulation tutorials do this all the time for some reason

2505503
getter	setter
there is somewhat of a debate right now as to using protected vs private or to use concepts akin to properties in some languages delphi c# rather than getter and setter as in java

2505539
inherited	properties
i don t really want to over-complicate my data model with each subtype being inherited even though no additional properties or methods are included except pc types which would ideally have associated accessories and software but that s probably out of scope here

2505544
getter	setter
as you mentioned using accessors makes private variables a bit pointless and in some environments performance consequence of using getter and setter just makes it worthless

2505544
getter	setter
on the other hand if you don t have such concerns i think using getter isn t so bad but you should think twice before using setter

inotifypropertychanged	ieditableobject
first you ll want to implement at least ieditableobject inotifypropertychanged and idataerrorinfo on the individual items in a data-bound collection which in your case would be the employeegridviewadaper class

2505602
gridview	datalist
i have a datalist and inside it there is many rows and in one of these rows i have a gridview

2505604

onmousedown	onmouseup	onclick	onmouseup	onclick	onmousedown
if you want your action to be performed only when the mouse is used then consider using onmousedown or onmouseup instead of onclick i d suggest the latter in your case

2505648
portrait	landscape
but the issues is that subviews added in the lower part fo mainview are not responding to touches in landscape mode but working fine with portrait mode

2505659
inherited	properties
if you want to use multiple inherited to combine everything into one big class it might make sense to do this then you can refactor each of the parent classes so that every method and properties is either private starts with __ or has a short 2-3 character prefix unique to that class

2505758
hash	md5
my suggestion would be to use a common accepted hashing algorithm like md5 to achieve the same hash values

2505764
hash	md5
what you really want to know is whether a hashing algorithm such as md5 will produce the same hash value for identical files on different operating system platforms

2505764
hash	md5
in the case of text files transcoding between different character encodings or changing line termination sequences will make the files different at the byte level and result in different md5 hash values

2505840
wxpython	pyqt
gui tcl is inbuilt but wxpython or pyqt are recommended

ssl	https
hypertext transfer protocol secure https is a combination of the hypertext transfer protocol with the ssl tls protocol to provide encryption and secure identification of the server

2505890
client-side	server-side
you should validate it with both client-side and server-side ie

2505925
inherited	properties
if you need access to the user array in many controllers that inherited from the systemadmincontroller what you can do is store it as a protected properties of the systemadmincontroller eg

not beautiful or clean but as a fast workaround you could make the indexed properties accessor public

2506065
google-chrome	firefox
when i browse to the above html doesn t get displayed i have tried in ie firefox and google-chrome

2506084

nzmath mpmath scipy and sympy were all taken into consideration as well

2506106
put	get
but after i put the controller out i got the above error so i commented out all the code but i still get the same error

2506111
hash	md5
while i don t know for what purpose you want to use a hash algorithm i d like to say that some collisions have been found for md5 so it might be less secure well we probably can t say broken since those collisions are hard to compute

2506156
postgresql	mysql
i don t remember which version of sqlite it was but i learned the lesson that if you want to have reliable concurrent writes to sqlite database then you better use some other database like mysql or postgresql

2506165
post	get
i had to do a cleaner double post of this one to get the answer

2506193
ostringstream	std
please note that the std ostringstream class resides in header

2506210
postgresql	mysql
queries on postgresql or mysql

i am trying to get put out a simple site which would pool the database every few seconds and update the information on the page dynamicly when theres something new inserted

2506345
ostringstream	std
i posted some code to create strings in place here basically a wrapper to hide the std ostringstream and make calling code cleaner

2506359
move	drag
working i can drag move the slider manually

2506376
inherited	properties
not really - you want those decoupled because your business entities will be a good entity model while the service objects will be optimized for the use in the service which may mean other properties composition and inherited decisions

2506382
ubuntu	freebsd
can i build the program for freebsd on my ubuntu computer by changing some build options or i need to build it in freebsd os

2506389
freebsd	linux
you can run a lot of linux programs on freebsd see

put	get
i get this error whenever i put more of my gotoxy and textcolor but when putting more printf this error does not appear...well this was not appearing before it just appeared in lately after tons of codes are inputted

2506576
keydown	keyup
currently i do this by manually handling the keyup and keydown events

2506606
ubuntu	linux
in terms of development environment i would recommend that you install a copy of ubuntu linux in virtualbox since setting up a working development environment on that particular distribution of linux is as simple as a single invocation of sudo apt-get install and linux is de-facto compliant with unix

2506722
nhibernate	bltoolkit
nhibernate for most things bltoolkit for the more specific rare occurances

2506728
width	height
the code above only needs to rotate by 90â at this time so i m just setting destwidth and destheight to the height and width of the original image

2506763
width	height
if you want to rotate over 90 degrees your width and height should be exchanged

2506771
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have four uinavigationcontroller assigned each to a tab in a uitabbarcontroller

2506771
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
each uinavigationcontroller manages a uiviewcontroller which may itself branch out into other uiviewcontroller below it hierarchally

2506812
trie	tree
if in-memory efficiency is also an issue you could store your strings in a trie or a radix tree

2506829
folder	directory
for this to work you ve got to have the file in the same directory as adb.exe which is in the tools folder of your sdk directory or have set up adb as a system-wide recognisable command

2506832
client-side	server-side
i am building a framework that will validate forms both client-side javascript and server-side based on a form requirements specification written in json

2506909
std	ostream
if i do std ostream i get the errors

2506920
std	ostream
the ostream class is part of the c++ standard iostream library and is defined in the namespace std

2506920
std	ostream
so you probably should add std before ostream

2506923
std	ostream
as everything in the c++ standard library ostream lives in the std namespace so it s std ostream

2506935
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
if you use viewdidappear method it will be keep on calling the mail view.so use viewwillappear method

2506943
cairngorm	flex	cairngorm	puremvc
i was reading these days about large projects implementation in python and flex and very often people praise the use of framework like cairngorm puremvc or others over traditional oop coding

2506971
width	height
based on the width height of text block adjust top bottom padding until the box is square and choose best matching background from different size pre-drawn images

2506982
rpm	yum
all the tools you need are either already there or are part of simple yum or rpm installs

2506990
ostream	istream
i have a function which is implemented in terms of writing the t object to an ostream and a matching function that reads a t from an istream

2507062
std	ostream
you forgot to put std in front of each occurrence of ostream

2507136
int	chars
you need to use an int variable since the range of values getchar returns is a value in the range of unsigned chars plus the single negative value eof

2507219
octal	decimal
integer can be specified in decimal base 10 hexadecimal base 16 or octal base 8 notation optionally preceded by a sign - or +

2507229
jstl	taglib
the right taglib uri depends on the jstl version

2507229
jstl	taglib
assuming you re using jstl 1.1 which would be the best choice for was 5.1.2 which runs servlet 2.3 you need to specify taglib uri s as per this document

2507231
octal	decimal
check the manual php only supports decimal hexadecimal and octal integer notation but you can use bindec instead

2507231
hex	binary
also keep in mind that each hex digit represents 4 bits so it s easy to convert between binary notation and hex

2507275
jar	war
suppose i have a war and jar projects defined in maven

2507275
jar	war
the jar project is dependent on the war project

2507298
symfony	kohana
i also recommend you to study various php mvc frameworks and see how things are implemented there symfony kohana

2507322
pop-up	dialog
the problem is in image two when i click on a choice in the menu the dialog pop-up but it is empty i would like to be able to load the data from my content provider into the edit text in the dialog so in image one it shows donal as the user name so in image two donal should also appear in the edit text in the dialog

2507335
post	get
well you need to see first what you have written in the page for get and post but i hope you are making sure both requests are sending different contents

2507402
post	get
make sure that the logfiles include all submitted data such as the complete get url with parameters and post with entity body

2507422
subtraction	multiplication
in the example above res1 is an array containing a set of elements filtered out of values array and some arithmetics applied afterward subtraction multiplication for all selected elements

2507472
post	get
i know this is an old post but maybe some people might be interested in this to get the picture you need a jailbroken device

2507528
x86	64bit
it works on 64bit boxes so long as you compile using x86

2507572
hash	md5
upgrade files are packaged with some means of authentication verification such as md5 or sha1 hash and or digital signature to ensure it came from a trusted source and was not tampered

2507588
firefox	safari
i started to use dashcode with a safari custom project my apps work fine but stacklayout object does not work in firefox

2507588

the sorting filtering happens in the consuming class after returning all customers

2507664
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
additionally there are no issues when using ie 8 on windows 7 or the osx build of google-chrome firefox or safari

2507665
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
renders fine in google-chrome ie and safari i thought it might have been a firefox issue but loaded the fiddle into firefox and seems fine

2507687
post	get
i am not sure i get the question could you maybe post example data for the source table and also show what the result should look like

2507715
printf	fgets
putting in a printf after fgets yeilds

2507717
put	get
instead use inline functions and you don t have to worry about what you can and can t put in a string and you can get rid of all that unreadable wrapping and -escaping

2507816
disk	ram
master key is only ever stored in ram never persisted to disk

2507870
folder	directory
is there any way to annotate the directory so it ends up in the project as a source folder

2507876
jar	war
that is not an acceptable dependency to make a jar plain java code dependent on a war java ee specific application package

2507876
jar	war
if you have code in your war that you are dependent on then that code should be in it s own jar and then both the web app and the jar project would have a common dependency on it

2507908
int	chars
base 2 and 3 for your examples you can easily convert an int to a string of a given base using integer.tostring and map the chars of that string to the symbols

2507913
vim	emacs
on the linux side you are going to find developers using what they wish to use anjuta code blocks dev-c++ kdeveloper emacs vim etc.

2507955

i ve got the basics to work with nsslidercell and nsbuttoncell using - nscell tableview nstableview tableview datacellfortablecolumn nstablecolumn tablecolumn row nsinteger row in my delegate and returning different cells for each row

2507971
ostringstream	std
then you can use rand or random to get a random number which you can constrain to the interval using modular arithmetic and then you can convert the number to a hexadecimal string using std ostringstream

2507971
ostringstream	std
std ostringstream oss

2507976
google-chrome	firefox
i tested on google-chrome and the behaviour seems to be different than on firefox

2507987

2508065
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest versioning of richfaces

2508107
lxml	celementtree
while i second the suggestion to use lxml you can get a huge performance boost by using the builtin celementtree

2508112
post	get
but i d just like to run the method without hitting it with an http get or post request

2508160
ironruby	ironpython
ironruby and ironpython are very neat and appropriate for this but as the other answer says powershell may be appropriate if you have a more infrastructure-type thing

2508174
folder	directory
because of this i wanted to put the vb folder into the root of the directory next to the app directory so i can access it directly via .com community - but the htaccess file is getting in the way complaining that it can t find the community controller

2508214
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
my approach so far is to target the user-agent string of the the five major desktop browsers msie firefox google-chrome safari opera

2508218
datamapper	activerecord
for a php application with a complex domain model i don t want to use the activerecord pattern i need instead the datamapper pattern as presented in zend framework

2508264
jmenubar	jmenuitem
the jmenuitem of jmenubar drops down to a jpanel added to the jframe but the jpanel erases the jmenuitem

2508282
folder	directory
in the unpacked directory there is a folder entitled lib which contains the packaged .jar files specified as necessary to use jfreechart

2508285
versioning	upgrade
this way those dependent on the service can continue using the existing versioning of the service while some particular dependency can upgrade to the new versioning

2508294
uiview	subviews
a better idea might be to make a custom uiview that you can design in interface builder and have that pop up by adding removing it as a subviews from the current view

2508308
versioning	upgrade
in my days repackaging software for enterprise distribution i certainly made patches transforms and versioning upgrade by methods like you have described with no issues

2508351
lisp	scheme
if you want to learn lisp paip is a better choice to start with because it will teach you a lot about common lisp and a smallish chunk of scheme

2508352
post	get
for that i ve managed to get the source code from snippets.dzone.com post show 5143 and edited it accordingly to my requirements

2508354
google-chrome	firefox
i have the following code that works on firefox and google-chrome

2508354
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome it returns 1 wich is the expected value

2508447
stdout	stderr
i don t want to mix stdout and stderr

2508463
cvs	svn	tortoisegit	svn
if you re a fan of tortoise svn hg cvs etc there is also tortoisegit

2508476
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
the waveform is stored as a instance variable of type nsimage with an nsbitmapimagerep

2508507
migrate	upgrade
so far it looks like the solution is to migrate to apache or upgrade to windows 2008 ii7

2508511
didselectrowatindexpath	viewwillappear
prints well in my viewwillappear in the didselectrowatindexpath and crashes in viewforheaderinsection

2508552
stdout	stderr
awk can t actually see the input from stderr - the pipe only pipes stdout

2508552
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr to stdout for awk to see

2508552
stdout	stderr
redirect stdout back to stderr where it originally was

2508552
stdout	stderr
the cshells are notoriously bad at handling stdout stderr

2508565
cpu	processors
the most optimized database server utilizes 100 of its cpu 100 of the time otherwise you re wasting computing resources by having a processors that s sitting there not doing anything

2508587
spaces	delimiter
let s assume you defined a word as a spaces delimiter group of characters

2508589
children	parent
also i try not to say anything about the children inside the parent s docblock since the typical parent-child relationship is done as a way to abstract away needing to know the specifics of the children

2508604
folder	directory
edit after some more tinkering it seems that path to file works just as well as long as the file is under the src directory and that copy non-embedded files to output folder is checked in the project properties under flex compiler

2508630
uiview	uiwindow
i have a uiview which is supposed to cover the whole device uiwindow to support an image zoom in out effect i m doing using core animation where a user taps a button on a uitableviewcell and i zoom the associated image

2508630
portrait	landscape
the zooming is performing flawlessly what i haven t been able to figure out is why the subview is still in portrait mode even though the device is in landscape

2508642
mouse	keyboard
they may not have or be able to use a keyboard or mouse

2508674
yslow	pagespeed
check out google s pagespeed and yahoo s yslow plugins for firefox they will give you some decent advice but don t follow them religiously

2508704
width	height
i am currently using a ellipse2d method but that doesn t seem to work and doesn t return a radius as under my understanding it doesn t draw the circle from the center rather from a starting coordinate using a height and width

2508719
ubuntu	linux
however when doing more and more work with php i found myself lost in the internals of linux specifically ubuntu

2508725
opera	firefox
try httpfox for firefox or opera which has dragonfly built-in

2508764
versioning	upgrade
this ensures 1 all projects are referencing the correct dll and 2 all projects are upgrade to a new versioning at the same time

2508785
sorting	filtering
the advantage of the list would be that you get sorting and filtering out of the box

2508795
libtiff	libpng	libjpeg	libtiff	libjpeg	libpng
there are open-source libraries for the main formats that you can look at for guidance libpng libjpeg libtiff

2508807
tiff	png
but you ll hit the wall on a compressed format like png tiff or jpeg

2508807
libtiff	libpng	libjpeg	libtiff	libjpeg	libpng
google libpng libtiff and libjpeg to find them

2508814
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

2508823
firefox	safari
most browsers safari firefox have good traffic analyzer tools

2508845
accessor	properties
you should still pass them around as variables or at least create properties accessor to get at the backing field

2508854
getter	setter
you should generally use accessor methods getter and setter and keep your internal variables private

2508873
width	height
you have to give it layout by giving it a dimension with height or width or just fall back to the old faithful zoom 1

2508906
profiling	instrumentation
you should see this in your instrumentation or shark profiling most of the time spent in is in turn spent in

2508911
int	double
the intel fpu is 80bits internally floats are 32 and double 64 so converting to float double to reload as an int will lose some bits of precision

2508913
error-handling	exception-handling
so you d need to explicitly catch the exception-handling and generally clutter your code with error-handling

2508953
spweb	spsite
the sprequest warning is usually related to undisposed spweb or spsite objects the best way to avoid this is by doing

2508968
ubuntu	linux
i ve seen a lot of programmers using ubuntu when they needed a linux distro and nearly all of them used it the windows way instead of the unix way

2508969
put	get
i have some height and weight data i want to train my nn so that if i put in some weight then i should get correct height as a output

2508970
put	get
my final goal is to collect data returned by select query into an csv file and put csv file at an ftp location from where client can get it

2509066
folder	directory
basically i have a file directory code snippet that lets me browse through my htmltemplates folder and am able to select an html document

2509077
serializable	deserialization
datamember field can t be readonly because wcf dont serializable object as-is and every time befor deserialization starts creates new object instance using default constructor

2509079
getter	setter
if what you need is something more complex you might want to create a gen_server process that answer to all config requests getter and setter methods

2509080
int	double
rather than calling them complex types you d be best served thinking int double etc

2509080
int	double
as classes and int double etc

2509080
int	double
if you re doing any type of sophisticated math the class-based numeric representation like int and double will be cumbersome and slow you down - many math operations can only be done with primitives

2509080
int	double
on the other hand if you re trying to put your numbers into collections like lists and maps those collections can only contain objects - and thus you must use or convert to classes like int and double

2509101
postgresql	mysql
postgresql and mysql

2509112
vim	atom-editor
vim has the atom-editor p to match printable characters however trying to do this to match the inverse failed and just left me with every p in the file

2509113
fadein	fadeout
im trying to fadeout the li elements depending on the current page number this number is stored in the attribute actualpage of the parent ul and after fadein those li elements whose page matches with the actualpage attribute of the parent ul

2509173
int	boolean
if you want to setattribute to session you have to use object like int boolean string in servlets

2509219
uiview	uiwindow
this is because as you mention your view has been added directly to the uiwindow therefore when the method to rotate is called for the navigation controller nothing happens to the uiview

2509219
uiview	subviews
the uiview would rotate if it was a subviews of the view controller view

2509244
wsdualhttpbinding	basichttpbinding
the service that works uses a basichttpbinding with streaming and the two which don t work use wsdualhttpbinding

2509305
switching	screens	portrait	landscape
all my app is in landscape mode .in some point i switching to a screens with tab bar controller but it s been placed like in portrait mode.i subclassed the uitabbarcontroller and override the method shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation to return yes always but because the app is already in landscape this method is not being called

2509310
cvs	svn
you could be making multiple changes in hg which add up to just one change in cvs svn so that history will not be kept in cvs svn and you ll have to summarize your commit messages

2509320
children	parent
since they are nested i know i can t save the children before the parent are saved but i would like to save all of the parent at once and then all of the children

2509329
width	height
dijit will try to use your inline styles like width and height to determine the proper settings for its own internal elements

2509439
children	parent
the program meanders around the tree taking all sorts of complex paths following links to parent and children

2509439
children	parent
the program will also grow the tree add new nodes and modify the parent children links of other nodes accordingly the tree never shrinks

2509439
children	parent
but then i have a problem- if i m adding a new node then i may want to lock the node s parent so that i can adjust its list of children

2509450
addition	multiplication
this is not a join set multiplication this is a union set addition

the reason for this is that you can happily use common words like min or max without worryign that some standard library has already sued them simply write std min and std max

when reading the other answers trying to use replace i thought i could post this and get someone with mysql syntax experience a few ideas to make a set base solution

2510240
gridview	radgrid
i am using radgrid but i guess this should be applicable to gridview as well

2510271
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
also it was necessary to use objectinputstream instead of datainputstream in the getnewmessage method since the message was sent by objectoutputstream

2510272
tinyint	varchar
by the way instead of storing checked and unchecked in your database as a varchar you can store it as type tinyint 1 and just use a 0 or a 1

2510283

2510654
rar	zip
basically i ve created a personal non-commercial project which i don t plan to release that can read zip and rar files

2510656
wgs84	utm
for a range of 40km you may find that approximating the world to a 2d flat surface may work although a utm transform would be the ideal way to go - in any case i d advocate using the actual wgs84 co-ordinates ellipsoid for calculations such as great circle distance or calculating bearings

2510662

2510729
objectdatasource	detailsview
i m currently grabbing a reference to the object when the detailsview is databound in the objectdatasource selected event handler storing it in session and manually adding entries to the e.newvalues collection when updating fires

button	checkbox
on a button click you can loop through the listview.items collection using findcontrol to find the checkbox and if checked get the textbox values

2510780
for-loop	loops
the for-loop is better because the scope of the iterator is limited to inside loops

2510797
spaces	delimiter
a line scripter like your suggesting is not very hard to write you could easily use a tstringlist set the delimiter to a spaces set the text property for each line then its a mater of evaluating the first item and dispatching the rest of the parameters on the line to a specific function

2510883
post	get
if your new value follows these requirements and you still get an error post a specific question about the error you re getting

2510959
rss	feed
i m using some php scripts from feedforall to join together rss feed rssmesh and display them as html rss2html

2510992

without the all it defaults to union distinct which causes the rows to be compared for duplicates but the way you have constructed them guarantees that there cannot be duplicates so this extra check is a waste of time

2511009
iprincipal	iidentity
how is the best way to create a structure to store all this information while the user navigates the site i mean on the thread i should be able to check his role his pages the ones he can access i have been reading and there is a lot of stuff there where im confused i saw the membershipprovider iprincipal iidentity etc classes but im not sure what should be the best one for me

2511148
jikes	javac
jikes does a warning but javac gives me an error

2511239
post	get
i originally approached this by creating two separate methods to handle the get and the post methods

2511239
post	get
the post method would redirect the browser to the get method so that any parameters that were specified would be added to the query string and so that the browser would not prompt the user with a dialog saying that it is going to resend the data that they entered if they refresh

2511239
post	get
i would have been fine with keeping two separate methods to handle get and post requests but the identical method signature prevented this

2511269
g++	gcc
gcc g++ version 3.4.5 yes somewhat old is throwing an error

2511270

parent window before creating the children

2511537
put	get
for the two arrays just put them in a list and you ll get a list of all their values

2511589
hide	show
so the hide makes sure every table is hidden and the only the one that matches the index i becomes show afterward

2511607
many-to-many	many-to-one
specifically with effective dates and changes even in a simple many-to-one hierarchy it can still make a lot of sense to use a many-to-many link table design

2511677
viewdidload	viewdidappear
if this is the initial controller however it may be easier to start with your root view controller being the data screen and push the presentation screen onto the stack in the datascreenviewcontroller s viewdidload or viewdidappear and used a delayed method to push it after 2 seconds

2511682
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
i leave this as one of the oddities of those java.util.date and java.util.calendar classes

2511728

you hide the built-in scroll bars with your custom control and instead of calling scrollup down you post windows messages to the area behind your custom control to fake clicks and get the grid view to move around the way you like

2511764
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stderr to stdout at the windows shell level by doing something like

2511768
dictionary	map
i have used an dictionary to map key clb1-items to the corresponding clb2-items

2511769
hide	show
if you want to hide show the element you need to find it within the you re hovering over

2511792
hide	show
you want to hide and show the p element only

2511795
filesystems	ntfs
on windows 7 w2k8r2 you can use findfirstfileex with findexinfobasic the main speedup being omitting the short file name on ntfs filesystems where this is enabled

2511795
filesystems	ntfs
basically they are skipping the filesystems abstraction layer and access ntfs directly

2511902

getter	setter
i would go for the second option it is less intrusive and gives you more control no big bang you can keep old getter setter you can deprecate things

2512037
getter	setter
it is easy to consider inlining simple property fetches getter setter but inlining complex methods may result in code bloat

free	malloc
in the face of this uncertainty the safest course is to explicitly allocate new space with malloc release the jni memory and call free whenever the newly allocated memory is no longer needed

2512296
operands	scalar
you may want to use subqueries as scalar operands

2512310
post	get
now i am really confused as to how i can get hibernate to realize that it needs to map the foreign key from the post table to the user table

as for cron being right for the job as long as you have a powerful enough server that can handle thousands of the above cron jobs running simultaneously you should be fine

2512415
firefox	safari
firefox uses googles database of locations while safari uses skyhook so there really isn t anything you can do

2512461

that s one of the big strength of maven you don t need to know if the project is a jar a war an ejb etc and to run the appropriate goal to package it

2512507
int	double
you ll need to subclass so you can implement the validate function and possibly the fixup function for your particular case since the two validators included with qt only cover int and double

2512585
rar	zip
or perhaps not a whole stream class perhaps just an interface you design which reads data from a stream zip rar into a specified buffer and page can specify its internal vector as the buffer

tostring	getter
i want to generate custom methods in eclipse like the way we can generate tostring getter and settlers right click - source -

2512987
16-bit	64bit
int in particular is particularly prone to that old 8-bit and 16-bit architectures invariably had 16-bit int s while today s 32-bit and 64bit ones invariably use 32-bit int s

2512988
int	chars
it s definitely the case that float int and chars may be of different sizes on different devices yes

2513005
int	double
i finally found the problem with the date difference when i was saving it to a db i used timeintervalsince1970 with an double value but when populating it and setting it to a datepicker i was using a int column type

2513027
rss	feed
the rss feed will read something like oklahoma city ap â james harden let

2513042
.htaccess	httpd.conf
the plan is to do this in apache httpd.conf or .htaccess using something like this

2513114
cout	cin
no this is an explicit way to say cin and cout are declared without actually defining them

2513116
cout	cin
in this case you into your .cpp file and because cin and cout are declared as extern the compiler will let you use them without complaining

2513117
cout	cin
the statements in your example declare rather than define cin and cout

2513147
min	max
you aren t assigning values to any of your max and min variables so they are all zero

2513156
bazaar	svn	bazaar	cvs	cvs	svn

2513156
cvs	svn
and compared to svn and cvs what extra features does it provides

2513161

2513300
post	get
the request was a get redirecting a post would lead to all sorts of trouble

2513323
folder	directory
you re going to need some sort of server side code to generate a list of files folder within a directory

2513343
client-side	server-side
you can t count on client-side validation since there are easy ways to go around it so you need to repeat all the validations on the server-side and add new validations if you need for instance using database to add more validations etc.

2513366
width	height
however you can build your site into a fixed height width element and then centre that element on the page with css

2513366
width	height
i suppose you could force the browser width height with javascript and the onresize event but this will likely annoy your end users

2513429
folder	directory
i have a list box and i want to add a folder directory to that which is at the specified location i have used the code

2513463

if anyone still cares i ve put together a little commandline util based on the answers here which you can get at

2513662
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i ve tried adding both a crossdomain.xml and clientaccesspolicy.xml to the service library project but it doesn t help

2513710

2513792
qtabwidget	qwidget
to control the coloring of that area put the qtabwidget in a qwidget and set the style sheet on the container

2513881
packets	multicast
fundementally this works however the multicast packets all have ttl set to 1

2513885
srp	principles
such a factory is essentially a service locator and i consider it an anti-pattern because it obscures your dependencies and make it very easy to violate the single responsibility principles srp

2513897
cos	sin
has anyone seen this weird value while handling sin cos tan acos

2513915
folder	directory
perform a full checkout of your root directory and create the tags lib folder

2513915
move	drag
next move each of the old lib folders under the new lib folder by using drag drop with your right mouse button

2514024
pascal	delphi

i usually tend to solve these issues with maven since it really plays well with eclipse using m2e for instance

2514081
versioning	upgrade
we have a program that makes any needed database versioning changes when program is installed upgrade

2514085
content-length	content-type	content-disposition	content-length	content-disposition	content-type
store the actual files outside of the public html area then in your php script simply send the appropriate headers content-type content-length content-disposition and finally readfile the file from the private location

2514254
xmltype	clob
i get the fields and contents by a xmltype xmldom.domdocument etc i can get the field and the content for example in a clob from the xmltype

2514302
firefox	safari
firefox generates filenames such as a5szqrsx.zip.part and safari isn t much better with just unknown

2514308
rpm	yum
i need to upgrade an rpm installed via yum which has an fatal bug in its postun section

2514308
rpm	yum
i know that if i were using rpm directly i could just use the -nopostun option to skip this section but i don t see a way of accessing that option from yum s man page

2514328
implements	extends
public class test_bmp extends jpanel implements mouselistener mousemotionlistener actionlistener

2514328
mouseevent	mouseenter
public void mouseenter mouseevent arg0

2514342
implements	extends
in your case your abstract decorator would extends the decoree and would implements the same interface as the decoree delegating forwarding all method calls to it

2514385
rpm	yum
it looks as though it might be as simple as doing rpm --erase --nopostun to remove the bad rpm and then running yum install to reinstall the good new version

2514407
post	get
http does have a head request as well as the more well known get and post

2514415
hide	show
on click of edit i grab the id show hidden form #noteditor and hide all notes

2514437
put	get
you could put a couple of functions such as getnummembers and getmembersize index etc to get the info you are after .

2514444
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
let me explain for example i made superclass which is vehicle and the subclassing is car so the code to make inherited will be

2514444
implements	extends
public class car extends jframe implements actionlistener

2514451
implements	extends
the variable somedata needs to belong to a class which both extends someclass and implements someotherclass

2514455
google-chrome	firefox
status property is 0 under firefox and domexception object with code 11 under google-chrome

2514455
post	get
i tried to get all params not in post function - they are fine

2514571
hide	show
you need advanced feature like show hide compartments re-size etc which are only available inside traditional modeling tools

2514611
width	height
where s is the side of the square pix and width height the dimensions of the window pix

2514613
getter	setter
once you have both getter and setter you can try again to mock out both of them

2514634
hide	show
from experimentation it seems a value of 1 means show and a value of 2 means hide

2514649
width	height
it s dragging up and or left that does not work because graphics.drawoval does not work with a negative width or height

2514660
put	get
so do a get request instead of load and use val function to put data there in your callback

2514745
datediff	difference
then use datediff function to get the difference of days between the checkin and checkout columns in the table room_booking and multiply the difference with the night cost and display the total

2514778
calloc	malloc
compare against calloc instead but also note that malloc and calloc are both available from c++ in the unlikely event that they do prove measurably faster

2514780
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
so firefox google-chrome safari opera etc will ignore these comments

2514786
gmail	hotmail
i want to prevent sending file on hotmail gmail accounts

2514814
children	parent
so model ejb1 ejb2 and web are children modules of the parent multimodulejavaeeproject

2514817
gmail	hotmail
if that is so then you will probably have to configure your proxy to filter gmail hotmail page requests and remove the html that provides those options

2514817
google-chrome	firefox
if you just mean on your own computer you can get extensions for browsers like firefox and google-chrome that let you do a similar thing

2514817
gmail	hotmail
it will edit your hotmail gmail page to remove the link to add attachments

2514824
jar	war
note that there are other package formats like osgi bundle nbm ear or war but the atomic most common bundle is jar

2514999
google-chrome	firefox
using cookie paths is fraught with problems as they are case sensitive in ie and google-chrome but not firefox

2515017
mouse	keyboard
after a bit of research it looks like the office communicator client makes use of a simple audit of keyboard and mouse activity to determine the presence of a user

2515050
ienumerable	ienumerator
another book i found quite useful when i was learning about ienumerable and ienumerator is troelsen s pro c# 2008 book

2515054
versioning	upgrade
if you want to use latest technology and grow with java world you should upgrade your jdk versioning to latest

2515074
folder	directory
in order to download whole directory you would need to look for the files in the folder listfolder method and then download all the files downloadfile for each file

2515084
int	chars
i think the reason is because my ptr is of type chars which only takes one byte but i am trying to store int which takes 4 bytes is the problem

2515090
versioning	upgrade
but to implement accepted solution i need to upgrade to the latest versioning of the client library i.e api 3.0

2515098
sorting	filtering
the sql language offers you under each the order by clause to do the sorting the where clause to do the filtering and the db vendor specific limit offset clauses subselects functions to return only a subset of records based on firstrow and rowcount or lastrow

2515104
int	chars
you ll need to cast your chars pointer to an int pointer

2515108
tabcontrol	tabitem
in xaml i built a tabcontrol so each tabitem binds to a myclass object

2515116

range	median
something along the lines of having it take a median for a specific range a pseudo-query

2515167
tunnel	packets
gogo6 uses tsp which tunnel the packets to gogo6 infrastructure from where it reaches ipv6 internet

2515189
versioning	upgrade

folder	directory
this will allow direct access to the community folder which is in root directory

2515212
packets	multicast
winxp sp3 doesn t send multicast bubble packets when behind the same router

2515212
packets	multicast
but at times it sends multicast packets reaches the system in the same sub-net

2515290
put	get
to get the user inputted date taking into account their timezone to match up with the utc corresponding date in the database you should put it through mktime

2515314
daemons	launchd
i have a launchd daemons that runs in the login context of a mac osx 10.6 machine

2515314
daemons	launchd
however i need to control the precise arguments to the agent application very carefully which is why i cannot use a launchd agent like i have for the daemons

2515314
daemons	systemd
i m aware that this is not the recommended apple way of doing things but i don t really have a choice in the matter - the design of the daemons application is pretty inflexible it has to run across many different systemd

2515327
submit	submission
what i need to happen is this when a user clicks submit the jquery validates the input fields and then if the fields have been properly filled-out the original plugin ajax script is triggered submission the data

2515327
submit	submission
i can t seem to find a way to get the jquery script to trigger the ajax function on successful submit and prevent the form from submission in the case that the form hasn t been successfully validated

2515374
google-chrome	safari
hoping someone can assist with the issues i am having trying to position this ajax-loader gif file bottom banner centered on all the main browsers - mac google-chrome ffox safari and windows ie8

2515469
children	parent
the query returns what you d expect all children which have the specified parent anywhere in their ancestry

2515502
inherited	subclassing
the problem with multiple inherited is that two classes may define different ways of doing the same thing and the subclassing can t choose which one to pick

2515549
icomparable	compareto
the main problem here is that you explicitly implements the compareto method which only allows you to use it when you use your object as a icomparable object

2515562
innodb	myisam
will be slightly less efficient in innodb and of same efficiency in myisam if you have an index on flagged id

2515628
rss	feed
zend has a ton of libraries for mail rss feed caching auth db etc

2515689
getter	setter
if not you should bind the value to a variable and use getter and setter like so

2515716
g++	gcc
here s some typical function prologue code generated by gcc g++ to be precise first the c++ source

2515717
16-bit	64bit
an int is guaranteed to have at least 16-bit and on 32 bit machines it is usually a safe assumption to have 32 bits but your code may fail as soon as you move to a 64bit machine

2515806
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox and apparently safari and google-chrome will interpret this as a request to the site giving you the duplicate request

2515901
rss	feed
the rss feed will give you the content of your latest posts

2515905
put	get
however when i put the results into my new table and output them to the ckeditor i get those three characters

2515920
ienumerable	ienumerator
deferred eager mean that most of the work will be done on the first movenext or when the ienumerator instance is created for ienumerable it is when getenumerator is called

2515959
ssl	https
apparently it checks the scheme property and doesn t recognize it as https because it just sends plaintext to the 443 port instead of ssl

2515986
pop-up	dialog
also note how the ok button is removed we re going to use to built in button functionality that jqueryui provides for pop-up dialog

2516008
floating-point	integer
about precision issues dx9-class gpus do not have dedicated integer hardware so integer streams are interpreted as floating-point streams with the lack of precision you ve met

2516111
width	height
where m and n are the width and height of the two-dimensional array in your example you have a square two-dimensional array so

2516132
super	extends
don t forget that extends jquery is super easy

2516136
width	height
the height and the width can be customized independently for every columns and rows or can be calculated automatic based to the content of the cells

2516136
width	height
you can change the width and the height of the columns and rows

2516155
post	get
one of these days i ll post a laundry list of questions to get input from others like you ve done

2516157
hide	show
now i want to show a progress indicator view when the user pushes the send button and hide that view when the email view comes up

2516207
updatepanel	scriptmanager
you should look in to using the asp.net ajax toolkit and getting the scriptmanager and updatepanel on your page and using regular .net code to update your gridview

2516230
cvs	svn
unlike svn and cvs in mercurial you can add an ignored file and it overrides the .hgignore -- future changes will be automatically tracked

2516237
hash	salt
if you query your database for the login getting the hash and salt you can tell the user if the login is wrong or the password

2516237
hash	hmac	hash	salt
about storing hash passwords use salt and hmac + sha512 in php hash_hmac

2516252
width	height
in most cases neither image or text fill the whole width or height of the button

2516271
hide	show
just leave out .show hide or .text if you don t want it show or the message changed whatever you want in each case

2516294
pdfsharp	itextsharp
pdfsharp sharp pdf and itextsharp are excellent

2516319
post	get
i simply needed to use to the request- getparams which would allow me to get post id from the url

2516329
jpa	javax.persistence
i understand that jpa entities are pojos but in order to use it i would have to include a library that implements javax.persistence and the other projects using the same base object have no use for a persistence layer

2516349
getter	setter
you re going to need a private variable to implement this because you have logic in your getter setter

2516354
getter	setter
remember that properties are actually turned into getter and setter methods and you can do a lot of work within their scope

2516411
matplotlib	scipy
personally i think you re better of not using pylab at all just getting stuff from numpy scipy and matplotlib as you need it to keep things organized

2516428
equals	gethashcode
redefines equals it should also redefine gethashcode

2516514
calloc	malloc
if you initialize the array with malloc use calloc instead

2516518
pull	push
normal pull merge push sequence will create a number of commits that are not very useful in terms of the history of your repository

2516521
equals	gethashcode
the gethashcode and equals methods work together to provide value-based equality semantics for your type - you ought to implement them together

2516551
springsource	grails
i ve created a grails 1.2.1 application in springsource tools suite 2.3.2 and here is my urlmappings.groovy

2516556
set	bag
wrapped array tree set tree bag

2516571
mouse	keyboard
in contrary to all the other answers posted here it takes all keyboard and mouse events into account especially clicks

2516613
width	height
effectively giving it a height and width of 0 and behaving as if it doesn t exist

2516619
public	protected
all the four public private protected and no modifier is allowed

2516655
getter	setter
adobe livedoc suggests to use the proxy pattern with setter and getter

2516760
opencms	alfresco
but on the other hand i also don t feel like using a full blown cms like alfresco or opencms since i think that it is complete overkill for my needs

2516834
queue	fifo
an alternative would be to use a queue which the queue is a fifo fifo data structure now it is not thread-safe for access so you would have to lock it but your locking time would be very minimal to put the item in the queue

2516927
freemarker	velocity
you can rely upon template engine like freemarker or velocity or stringtemplate to have on one side your page content and on the other your page rendering

2516951
superclass	subclassing
a class designated with the mappedsuperclass annotation can be mapped in the same way as an entity except that the mappings will apply only to its subclassing since no table exists for the mapped superclass itself

2516967
width	height
the location height and width of the rectangle are saved to disk

2516967
width	height
when i redraw it however the height and width are fine but the location is always off

2516969
post	get
so if it the contact page it displays get in touch with me and if it is a single blog post page it displays a note from me

2517046
bazaar	svn	bazaar	cvs	cvs	svn

2517077
slideup	slidedown
in ie8 after the slideup slidedown actions are complete the margin between the boxes collapses

2517143
hash	md5
every file you create will have a certain size and a certain md5 hash

2517143
hash	md5
if you want a predetermined size and md5 hash this is not practically possible you would have to calculate all hash to all possible inputs

2517161
hash	md5
unless of course you know the md5 hash of some string and you put that string in the file

2517165
hash	md5
just creating a file with a given md5 hash is difficult enough without adding the size requirement

2517177
hash	md5
md5 is a cryptographic hash algorithm

2517223
width	height
use labels with borders and modify the height width to make them look like lines but this is a hack and won t work for anything other than a straight horizontal or vertical

2517282
listview	gridview
while reskining gridview listview with more columns i ran into a problem that i couldn t change the color of the highlighted row

2517305
mouse	keyboard
note that the input is partially dependent on items which are not in the view or the model like the keyboard and mouse

2517315
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
so construct the bufferedoutputstream flush it before constructing the bufferedinputstream

2517370
rss	feed
looking for an rss feed generator usuable in .net framework 2.0

2517370
rss	feed
we have the business classes in .net and want to publish rss feed on the asp.net website

2517416
int	boolean
in mysql the false keyword is not a boolean piece of data it s an int constant that equals zero

2517443
rss	feed
here s some vb.net code that i ve used to generate a rss feed from a collection in our bll

2517443
rss	feed
this writes to a file but you could easily use a generic handler .ashx to pass parameters to that would generate the required rss feed on the fly - use response.output for the xml writer

2517519
addition	multiplication
note that this algorithm avoids any math more complicated than addition and multiplication so will likely have much better performance than something that requires trig functions

2517535
for-loop	loops
i have a basic for-loop to loops through buttons and set some stuff and onpress handlers

2517623
google-chrome	firefox
and this code even works 100 in firefox but when testing on google-chrome 5.0.365.2 dev

2517648
rss	feed
i have list of 200 rss feed which i have to downloading

2517669
rss	feed
when reading in a 3rd party rss feed an xmlexception is thrown due to an invalid datetime in the feed xml

2517670
hash	md5
not being able to find a file with a certain hash is one of the defining properties of a cryptographic hash function such as md5

2517670
hash	md5
while md5 has been broken those breaks only allow you to create two different files images with the same hash but not with a predetermined hash

2517726
hide	show
but honestly that looks pretty simple to implement with a floating div that you use jquery to show hide when the share button is clicked

2517740
int	double
but since it s just a number i have no real way of knowing if it s an int float long double or whatever

2517804
gridview	sqldatasource
now in the details sqldatasource use a sql where clause bound to the selected primary key in the master gridview

2517809
post	get
if the only reason you need query strings to work is to use jquery s autocomplete function i believe there is a way to modify that function to use a post instead of a get

2517825
put	get	post	put	post	get
i need everything that is done by rest including get put post and delete

2517825
post	get
i do not see anything for httprequest to be able to do post or anything other than get unless you construct your own headers which i prefer not to

vsto	add-in
i am writing c# with vsto in visual studio 2008 in order to create an add-in for office 2007

2517872
post	put
it has properties like method post put delete and you can write your payload into the request stream returned by getrequeststream or its async counterpart for high performance

2517888
width	height
according to the syntax and structure section of the jpeg page on wikipedia the width and height of the image don t seem to be stored in the image itself -- or at least not in a way that s quite easy to find

2517888
width	height
the image height and width are stored

2517888
width	height
here s a portion of c code that could help you though decoding the width and height of a jpeg jfif file

hash	salt
if you want to eliminate any credit card stealing headaches hash them using salt values not stored in the database in addition to salt values stored in the database

2517913
put	get	post	put	post	get
httpclient documents get post put delete head etc.

2517938
width	height
my problem appears to be that when it calls the getpreferredsize for the container the result is just too small the width seems okay but the height isn t

2517964
google-chrome	firefox
thus it will always work in firefox i can t test google-chrome at the moment.

2517978

versioning	upgrade
what you need to think about a bit is versioning the assemblies and how you re going to deal with upgrade to application a when application b requires parts of application a

2518031
put	get
put all declarations at the top then call some function which will get things going and have your functions below

2518063
codeigniter	kohana
one of the nice things about codeigniter is the excellent documentation when compared to kohana

2518063
codeigniter	kohana
then again kohana is an improved fork of codeigniter

2518115
put	get	post	put	post	get
most web browsers support only http methods like get and post and do not support put and delete

2518119
for-loop	loops
it is referred to as the enhanced for-loop the for-each loops and the foreach statement

2518137
for-loop	loops
the for-loop using index is still useful if you d like to maintain a loops counter for other purposes than getting the item by index

2518137
for-loop	loops
the for-loop using an iterator is still useful if you d like to remove or change elements of the collection itself inside a loops

2518158
g++	gcc
g++ --version g++ gcc 4.4.0

2518181
onkeyup	onkeydown
the currently key events listener provided by android onkeyup onkeydown are associated to an activity so they are notified of the key events if the activity s views are focused

2518232
google-chrome	firefox
firefox ie 8 google-chrome etc

2518244
put	get
the backslash is an escape character so after you need to put 2 in a row to get the actual character to show up in your string

int	double
if a variable is declared as an int you don t need to use either form of double parentheses you can omit the dollar sign from the variable name as in the double-parentheses forms but you can t add spaces around operators

2518299
ati	nvidia
more useful with nvidia than ati for example

2518338
ienumerable	iqueryable
it makes sense seeing that an ienumerable can t be further filtered but an iqueryable can

2518465
google-chrome	firefox
however if i set display none in the .mp_modalpopup css class and then use .blockui to make it visible in ie 8 the dialogue centers itself vertically but aligns left with half of the dialogue off the page and in google-chrome and firefox the dialogue is not visible at all but blockui is working because the page greys out

2518501
putchar	gets
on the other hand since running is visible only to the translational unit being static by the time the compiler gets to the end of the file it should be able to determine that there is no opportunity for putchar to access it assuming that s the case and the compiler could go back and fix up the pessimization in the while loop

2518523
spaces	delimiter
i have an array in perl i want to print with spaces delimiter between each element except every 10th element which should be newline delimiter

2518528

versioning	upgrade
i want to upgrade the versioning to use jquery out of the box with cakephp 1.3 and get rid of prototype javascript library

2518607
memcpy	memset
buffer.blockcopy is what i tend to use when i want memset memcpy type behavior

2518607
memcpy	memset
it may be that internally the language calls the built-in classes which in turn are thin wrappers around memcpy and memset

2518633
union	distinct
my approach on this would be find the distinct employeenames you need in your result by making a union between affected tables and then use left joins to get data from both tables thus getting your nulls when you should

2518636
opera	google-chrome
i can download it with google-chrome and opera so probably it s a browser related issue

2518649
int	chars
notice how 2 345.67 was truncated down to just 2 - the comma turns your nice number into a string and now you re bound by string- int parsing rules which drops everything after the first non-numeric chars in the string

2518650
jikes	gcj
since ant 1.6 this attribute can also be used to specify the path to the executable when using jikes jvc gcj or sj

2518780
serializable	deserialization
this is where serializable or deserialization comes in handy

2518784
jar	war
it may also be used to allow multiple deployments to share the same single jar file instead of having it in each war file

2518837
inherited	subclassing
my line of thought is this since class b is nested inside class a and is private and there is no other class inheriting from class b it should be safe to seal it because it can t be inherited outside class a not even by subclassing of a

2518917
filesystems	fat
useful on broken filesystems like fat

2518917
git-clone	git-init
the default is true except git-clone 1 or git-init 1 will probe and set core.filemode false if appropriate when the repository is created

2518930
fast-forward	merge
git will automatically recognize that this is a trivial merge and perform a fast-forward merge which will add the new commits to the master branch

if you want the exact same look you ll need to retemplate the tabcontrol and tabitem by copying the current template use blend or showmethetemplate to copy the current template and modifying it as needed

2518961
width	text-align
the easiest way is to float elements and set a width and text-align right for labels

2518979
int	chars
the approach i am thinking of is to use an iterator to iterate through the vector and then convert each int into its string representation and then add it into a chars array which is dynamically created initially by passing the size of the vector

2519003
ostringstream	std
you got it right but you can use std ostringstream to create your char array

2519007
qtableview	qtablewidget	qtableview	qabstractitemmodel	qtablewidget	qabstractitemmodel
but qt implements uses mvc for a lot of the classes look at qtableview as opposed to qtablewidget qtableview uses qabstractitemmodel as the model class and there is a pretty strict separation between the view and the model

2519059
setinterval	settimeout
2 javascript settimeout and setinterval are not very reliable when it comes to timing

2519059
setinterval	settimeout
you might want to print out the times that your sound.play call is being made to see whether the irregularities are due to the irregularities in settimeout setinterval

2519134
public	protected
the c++ compiler is not allowed to reorder variables within a visibility block public protected etc

2519168
ienumerable	ienumerator
this class is only visible as an ienumerable of t readonly property and it saves me an additional class that wraps ienumerator of t

2519191
temp	tmp
if you don t want to open any security vulnerabilities by modifying registry settings your application could also create a local copy of the .chm file in the users temp folder tmp and open the help from there

2519195
public	protected
as for what private protected and public mean

2519214

2519488
hash	md5
my concern is suppose i generate an md5 hash using a native python string object like this

2519488
hash	md5
then i take a hex version of that md5 hash using

2519488
hash	md5
and send the message md5 hash via a network let s say a jms message or a http request

2519488
hash	md5
then i generate an md5 hash using java like this using the commons codec library

2519763
int	chars
int string string chars

2519769
pthreads	fork
the pthreads fork system call has no native equivalent on windows so cygwin is forced to emulate it in a very inefficient way

2519772
getattr	setattr
note that because myproperty is a property getattr and setattr will be invoking the property s __get__ and __set__ methods rather than actually mocking out the property itself

2519784
spweb	spsite
sadly i don t think this works when copying a folder to a different spweb or spsite

2519811
inherited	properties
unfortunately even if you assign a custom style to the listbox that doesn t include the foreground properties setter it will still fall back to using the default style before attempting to inherited the value of its parent

2519811
inherited	properties
properties value inherited

2519851

put	get
if you try to put in an invalid name to a domelement you ll get an error

2519962
integer	fractions
this is just a small example to show my problem i am trying to avoid using floating points by making the fractions be a fractions of the max amount able to be stored in that variable in this case a signed integer so 32767 on the positive side because the embedded system i m using i believe does not have an fpu

2519984
16-bit	64bit
as far as i know most if not all processors will hold results for a word word multiplication in a double word -- meaning an 8 bit 8 bit is stored in a 16-bit register s on an 8-bit processor a 32-bit 32 bit operation is stored in a 64bit register s on a 32-bit machine

2519996
division	multiplication
numeric stability is no accident it requires some care in deciding when and how to do division and multiplication

2519999
integer	unsigned
almost any implementation you could possibly meet will wrap around on integer overflow because a everyone uses 2 s complement in which arithmetic operations are bitwise identical for signed and unsigned types of the same size and b wraparound is the defined behavior of unsigned types in c

2520010
division	multiplication
one is to write small muldiv function in assembly language that does the multiplication preserving the high word then the division on that and finally returns the value to c when it s been reduced back into range

2520019
rss	feed
then it will give you a public url to an rss feed of your status updates

i ve just installed fancybox on my site and it works perfectly in firefox but when i try it out in google-chrome and safari the fancybox is not centered in the browser window

2520111
serializable	deserialization
for example it could be a perfectly reasonable format to store in a database if you re only using it for serializable deserialization and don t need structured queries inside the data

2520160
hide	show
whe i show the tooltip and leave the mouse in the same place the show and hide repeats forever

2520173
width	height
if you want a div container to be as big as it s parent s container then you have to specify through the terms height and width and use a percentage or integer with a measurement scale attached such as px

post	put
never pass credentials on a url put them in the http request by using post

2520247
hash	salt
hash passwords are hash using a one-way hash algorithm and a randomly generated salt value when stored in the database

2520247
hash	salt
when a password is validated it is hash with the salt value in the database for verification

2520271
put	get
if you are doing this in the silverlight part you should put the xml file in an embedded resource and access it as a stream get it with assembly.getmanifestresourcestream or as a resource a la wpf not an embedded resource and access it with the package part syntax

2520284

lex yacc or flex bison spring to mind but personally i would always reach for antlr

2520484
client-side	server-side
but if you re looking at learning this with the hopes of it being a career direction or paying job you will probably want to delve into more than just html nobody seems to be looking for people to write webpages that look like they came out of 1998 or 2001 you can get nicer looking stuff that that with almost no html knowledge using wysiwyg tools...once you get the basics of html understood and know where to look up tags and css descriptors you may want to branch out either into a client-side scripting language like javascript or a server-side programming language or framework php ruby on rails etc or trendy web-technology like flash

2520501
folder	directory
as i said all three source folder can build into the same target directory

2520550
dictionary	map
1 have a dictionary mapping trait to a list of names named map

2520586
post	get
oh make sure you re also verifying your get post variables used to submit the articles

2520610
width	height
so it seems like an appropriate fix would be to detect cleartype-optimized fonts and try and create the bold versions of those fonts using the same width and height as the initial createfont call

2520624
cvs	svn
that said there are tools that support more than one system like cvs and svn because they both have similar work flows

2520624
cvs	svn
i have not yet seen tools that would work on cvs and say mercurial or svn and git

2520673
httpconnection	downloading
first know the length of the data being downloading this can be obtained from httpconnection header

2520783
linqdatasource	objectdatasource
i know all the data source controls like linqdatasource objectdatasource etc

2520793
free	malloc
if it knows it doesn t need reentrancy it can pass in the address of a static struct or array -- in either case a malloc free pair gets saved and such savings do mount up

2520799
innodb	myisam
i think this is what you want if using innodb recommended although you can simplify this with myisam

2520828
free	malloc
returning pointers usually leads to memory leaks as it s easier to forget to free your pointers if you didn t malloc ed them

2520829
put	get
when your requiremens get more complex or you decide to add features you will be glad that you put time into a relational database design

2520915
google-chrome	firefox
everything is working like charm with google-chrome and firefox but ie is not able detect or recognize the cookie inside the confirmation script on step-3

2520931
post	get
similarly the model that the initial get action that shows the form in the first place passes to its view which submits to the post action doesn t need to be related to the model that the post action takes although it usually will be the same model

2521034
addition	multiplication
in addition if this is not a one-to-one relationship you will get different results since each left join would result in multiplication of results

2521048
folder	directory
in second case styles directory would not be copied at all as copies the artifact only not entire target folder

2521072
int	double
to create an array of functions returning double and taking an int argument

2521087
width	height
there are javascript libraries such as swfobject or jquery media that allow you to set the height width of a flash object when the page loads

2521087
width	height
alternatively you could use a little bit of jquery to alter the height width attributes after the fact

2521095
client-side	server-side
it contains both server-side and client-side code

2521109
restrict	shared
having the user_id in all tables does allow you to do certain things in views to enhance security defense in depth giving you a little bit of defensive programming in sql server you can restrict all access through inline table valued function - essentially parametrized views - which require the app to specify user_id on every table access and also allows you to easily scale out to multiple databases by forklifting everything on shared keys

2521135
passenger	webrick
just to be sure the class type of may vary depending on whether you are using mongrel passenger webrick etc. you can do a slightly more exhaustive attempt

2521164
division	modulo
the modulo gives the remainder of the integer division between the two numbers effectively giving you a number that goes back to 0 when reaching 10

2521183
3des	aes	rsa	aes	rsa	3des
the problem is that rsa is not used like a typical block cypher like aes or 3des that encrypts 8 bytes at a time all day long

2521183
division	modulo
rsa is a math operation that returns the remainder of a division the modulo

2521183
rsa	aes
we use rsa to encrypt only a short session key and then use that session key in a fast symmetric-keyed block cypher like aes to encrypt the actual data

2521183
rsa	aes
bundle the public key id from the certificate the rsa encrypted session key and the aes encrypted data together

2521209

2521329
postgresql	mysql
supports grails apps has no up-front costs and supports both postgresql and mysql

2521374
int	double
could be a call to doit int ... or doit double ...

2521374
int	double
in the latter case the int literals will be promoted to double values

2521374
int	double
by contrast void doitagain int is more specific than void doitagain double because int is a subtype of double according the the jls

2521384
mouse	keyboard
i want to detect it whether the user used the mouse or keyboard

2521501
google-chrome	firefox
now if i select the first last element from the first selection box the second select box does not scrolls into view the last selected element in google-chrome browser.although it works fine in internet explorer and firefox but not in google-chrome browser.please tell me where i am wrong or is it there a better way to do the same

2521551
free	malloc
for every malloc there should be a free thus for every init there should be a term and for every create there should be a destroy

2521588
wordpress	joomla
i know that the site is running in wordpress when i view it s mark-up and see wp-themes or in joomla it uses templates administrator for admin page eg

2521760
many-to-one	one-to-many	many-to-many	many-to-one	many-to-many	one-to-many
i understand and make use of one-to-many many-to-one and many-to-many all the time but implementing a one-to-one relationship seems like a tedious and unnecessary task especially if you use naming conventions for relating php objects to database tables

2521768
accessor	properties
and use properties instead of accessor

2521773
folder	directory
you shall have to exclude the entire virtual directory or the site folder from revisiting

2521826
children	parent
if you then run sqlmap.queryforobject loadparent new integer 1 or sqlmap.queryforobject loadparent new integer 2 you should obtain a parent object with two children and a parent with four children respectively

2521834
children	parent
so you could have a table containing the data of the parent object and other tables containing fields that are specific for the children

2521885
entity-relationship	diagram
aqua data studio is good but a resource hog and basically pretty sluggish and has non essential features such as the entity-relationship diagram tool which is pretty bad at that

2521962
mousemove	mousedown
i was experimenting with the mousedown and mousemove events when i realized why my problem was occurring

2521962
mousemove	mousedown
in an admittedly silly attempt to avoid writing the same block of code twice i was calling my mousedown handler from within the mousemove handler thinking that certain conditions namely neither mouse button being held down would cause the mousedown handler to effectively do nothing

2521969
temp	tmp
the easy dirty way open regedit locate on hkey_users the asp.net acount buy navigate the tree and look on environment for the temp tmp that have the aspnet temp and just change them and reboot

2522002
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
as kovpas said that subclass your controller from uiviewcontroller instead of uinavigationcontroller you use presentmodalviewcontroller

2522027
realloc	calloc
calloc realloc is left as an exercise

2522030
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
seems that you subclass your controller from uiviewcontroller instead of uinavigationcontroller

2522038
google-chrome	firefox
i can easily compute the complete absolute path for the file i need to open for example open c xampp htdocs controllers foo bar.php when visiting foo bar and i can make sure that eclipse is currently open with the correct project loaded but i m stuck on how i can have firefox google-chrome ie tell eclipse to open that specific file

2522049
post	get
i made such a thing but i used a phase listener a configuration entry in a configuration file that mapped url params to fqn of classes that handle a particular action by action i mean a url param from a get post

2522049
post	get
than the phase listener would parse all the url params from each get post and send each of them to a dispatcher

2522056
width	height
it is now on the beginning of li width and height is set

2522071
post	get
when you have to insert into database or delete sanitize inputs use mysql prepared statements or assert values that arrive via post or get this way

2522075
width	height
when the image is resized while maintaining its aspect ratio chances are that either the image s height or width becomes smaller than imageview s dimensions

2522080
range	max
the output range varies depending on the actual kernel used but it s always going to fit in a -max +max range around zero where max is the maximum output magnitude of the filter kernel

2522093
width	height
i can understand the width increasing so the button has space to draw the down arrow but i m not sure a height increase is necessary

2522107
versioning	upgrade
depending on the maturity of webformsmvp you could spend a large amount of time having to re-write sections of your code when the underlying framework is upgrade or when new versioning come out

2522128
hide	show
a simpler approach might be to have all your wizard controls in your markup but dynamically hide and show them rather than dynamically create them

x86	64bit
if your build configuration type is anycpu then sometimes accessing com objects those are only available for 32 bit interface sometime creates problem try re building your app project with x86 and then on 64bit machine any 32 bit program will function exactly same

2522315
clang	llvm
the easiest way is to just update to xcode 3.2.1 - using clang then becomes a no-brainer - nothing to install or configure - just set the compiler to clang llvm 1.0 in the project settings

2522330
int	chars
if you are really concerned about speed you might consider first counting chars with int and then obtaining frequencies through float division

if by any chance you have set in the class locationsearchview the following nhibernate would expect to find the locationsearchview class for the defined bag and hence require the 3 columns to map the collection

2522445

however by default the validation plugin hooks up to the submit method on the form and stops there so no matter how you re calling submit it should work already stopping the submission if anything is invalid

2522475

output the envelope with ack message at the beginning and then fflush the thing so that their server gets it before you end processing

2522505
chown	chmod

what you need to do is use a single input for just a link and aditional inputs for width and height and filter those

2522533
client-side	server-side
one workaround for ie since you mentioned activex would be to have your application append to the user agent string then check for the existence of this string with your server-side or client-side code

2522579
width	height
the thing is that in this case i have a div that is overflown width a overflow scroll and the div has a fixed height

2522823
tcpdf	fpdi
i am not sure how you added the fpdi and tcpdf to your cake app

2522823
tcpdf	fpdi
i realized what you need to do is import tcpdf then fpdi and then make xtcpdf extend fpdi

2522823
tcpdf	fpdi
because fpdi already extends tcpdf you gain access to tcpdf by including fpdi.

subclass the parent view and pass touches to its children views

2523007
division	modulo
as for why it exists i would guess that it does in part for completeness and in part for the benefit of other languages that may not have easy to use implementations of integer division and modulo computation

2523035
rss	feed
the absolute easiest way is to use your blog s rss feed

2523035

pull	push
a client wants us to pull down a live copy of their site do some seo work on it and push it back to them

2523083

basically on 64bit install of vs the microsoft.webapplication.targets needed by msbuild is in the program files x86 dir not the program files dir but msbuild doesn t recognise this and so looks in the wrong place

2523265
x86	64bit
manually copy the file on 64bit from program files x86 to program files

2523282
hash	salt
certainly a hash is not reversible - but without a salt iv it might be a bit easy to hack

2523333
ubuntu	linux
a i ve used xampp for linux successfully on ubuntu

i ve seen a previous thread best xml parser for java but was not sure if dom4j or jdom is any good for namespaces xmlschema and good support for utf-8 characters

2523414
map	quadtree
because i have implemented a pr quadtree to speed up rendering i thought that i could define some high-priority markers that are always visible defined in the map editor and put them in a queue

2523417
disk	ram
you always quote the lowest supported windows version minimum amount of ram required disk space minimum browser version etc

2523440

i was wondering how you could take 1 string split it into 2 with a delimiter such as spaces and assign the 2 parts to 2 separate strings

2523510
decoder	encoder
there is a base64 encoder decoder jquery plugin that should help in transfering your data

2523614
uilabel	nsstring
but the text you assign to the uilabel has to be an nsstring

2523614
uilabel	nsstring
and before you assign this string to the uilabel s text property you can for example use the following method of nsstring to crop the string at a given index your maxlength

2523617
getter	setter
others already pointed that out avoid using setter and getter and use simple attribute access if you don t need to perform additional logic when getting setting your attribute

2523653
uiview	subviews
you could take the actual uiview that the current uiviewcontroller shows and loop through the subviews to get all uitextview s that have user interaction enabled

2523658
button	checkbox
switch off the runtime themes project options application uncheck enable runtime themes checkbox ignore the increased button heights at design time delphi ide uses themes and run the application - you will see normal heights of the toolbar button

though personally i would list gedit in my recommendations i d suggest netbeans or zend studio for people who like standalone ides otherwise vim eclipse emacs

2523704
postgresql	mysql
unfortunately php particularly the mysql postgresql mssql extensions will always have your columns overwrite in the case of overlap

2523714
implements	extends
the key is to create a partial class which extends the generated class and then implements the onloaded partial method

2523747

2523811
versioning	upgrade
changing a database structure should be a controlled change - allowing an application other than for example an application designed to upgrade a database from one versioning to another is breaking this control

2523812
wordpress	joomla
wordpress goes to wp-login and joomla goes to administer

2523846
children	parent
not through the standard api but you can give all threads the same parent qapp and then use the children method

away3d	papervision3d
from what i have seen so far two most popular free flesh 3d libraries are papervision3d and away3d

2523857
away3d	papervision3d
from what i have seen papervision3d and away3d should do much more then 3d charting but i haven t seen any examples on how to draw surfaces in any of them except this line chart in 3d

2523878
width	height
i had to deal with images in my program so i have a lot local variables declared like temp width height

2523885
put	get
once you get into that game it is often better just to put a subagent on the remote device and use standard snmp protocols to get the information

2523885
snmp	mib
you ll re-invent some snmp mib

2523885
snmp	mib
you are probably better off using snmp get-bulk or just doing a mib walk by successively calling snmp-get-next until no more objects are returned

2524028
post	get
when i post the form i only get the file

2524060

you can redirect the stderr descriptor 2 to stdout 1 by adding for example

2524159
hide	show
you can bind the property visibility of the uielement to the property isdeleted of your object to hide or show the elements

2524174
lisp	prolog
i don t know about open source but i d certainly consider using lisp lenat did or prolog because it has good symbolic manipulation support and eurisko is about symbolic computation

2524176
src	attr
and use #element attr src

2524215
mp3	wav
whether it is playing a wav mp3 file using midi output or just playing beeps doesn t really matter -- i just need something that will enable me to generate arbitrary music client-side

2524216
maven	cargo
the maven cargo plugin can merge war files but i ve never used this outside a testing context where i had full control on what i wanted to merge

2524251
google-chrome	firefox
sessions work fine in firefox and google-chrome but require the use of jsessionid in the url for ie tested 7 8 set to medium privacy

2524260
integer	unsigned
the only time signed unsigned would make a difference is if you would be interpreting it as a number like for arithmetic or if you were to print it as an integer

2524283
width	height
the method resizeimage do the resizing of the width and height respecting the aspect ratio and keeping in a max width and a max height limits

2524389
portrait	landscape
having no end of trouble including a large landscape pdf in a portrait .tex document using pdflatex

2524406
children	parent
if i read your question correctly you want to set up a fetch that returns a sorted list of the children of a specific parent

2524406
children	parent
in the last line the parent variable should be a reference to the nsmanagedobject instance of the parent whose children you want

2524422
width	height
if the width and height are always equal then this would make sense

2524424
width	height
width and height are integers

2524424
int	double
you will be performing int math on these values before storing them in your double

2524457
qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel	qtreeview	qabstractitemview	qabstractitemview	qabstractitemmodel
qabstractitemmodel qabstractitemview for example qlistview qtreeview and so one

2524457
qabstractitemview	qabstractitemmodel
it seems that your application thinks that some object is qabstractitemmodel or qabstractitemview descendant whether it is not and tries to connect a slot to its datachanged signal

2524459
crypt	hash
1 you can use symmetric encryption instead of hash crypt function is hash - in this way you would have possibility to decrypt it

2524460
serializable	deserialization
so when the object is first loaded i create a deep copy using serializable deserialization and save the copy to a separate field

2524654
set	bag
for manytomany changing entity collection type hashset set won t affect the mapping to bag .it only works for hasmany

2524654
ilist	icollection
ilist icollection maps to bag

2524683
width	height
when the device is rotated and onconfigurationchanged is called we d like to be able to get the scrollview s new width height

2524683
width	height	portrait	landscape
on our droid we expected to see the scrollview s width go to 854 when switched into landscape and to 480 when switched back to portrait and the height do the equivalent switch minus the menu bar

2524683
portrait	landscape
clearly we re getting the portrait dimensions when we switch to landscape and the landscape dimensions when we switch to portrait

2524760
button	checkbox
i have a checkbox with id terms and a submit button in my form with class registration

2524760

i would also like to have a confirmation dialog pop-up when the submit button is clicked and that if it is confirmed the submit button will be disabled again to prevent duplicate clicking

2524783
opera	firefox
this works for me in firefox and opera the whitespace is all over the place in ie

2524795
maven	m2e
i am also using a maven project allowing m2e to manage dependancies

2524813
equals	tostring
the danger i think microsoft wants to avoid here is people writing a ton of extension methods that redefine equals and tostring

2524860
inline	inlining
in the second place if you do have a problem with function call overhead you should declare the functions in question inline instead of using macros to do the inlining

2524868
tiff	png
you can also use tiff or png png has lots of parameters i think you also can tell it to do uncompressed

2524936
hex	binary
hex editor vs hex editor- not so useful for huge binary files - eg

2524962
post	get
i m trying to get pre post annotations working with a web application but for some reason nothing is happening with spring-security

2524973
hash	md5
i would also suggest storing a hash md5 of the file in database

2524989
post	get
if you are using 2.5 or higher you should probably look into the spring mvc annotations which allow you to make any class be a controller with as many controller methods as you like which can absolutely include some that handle post requests -- dosubmit -- and some that handle get requests

2525012
width	height
you can use it to accomplish what you want by checking the rectangle s width and height against your circle s width and height if they match the circle is completely over the rectangle

2525036
terminate	timeout
each instance of the worker thread attempts to gain an exclusive lock on the file it was initiated with until some timeout elapses if the lock is successful it processes the file if it s unsuccessful it either retries as necessary throws an exception and terminate itself

2525044
post	get
please get to the end of this post to see that most profiling tools that point out statically allocated memory errors are usually correct

2525045
width	height
i d say the simplest way to do this is to set the center of the view to be at the center of it s superview which you can obtain from the superview s height and width attributes

2525109
decoder	encoder
don t worry about it in other words the utf8 bytes are just bytes and whatever you re using as an encoder decoder will do the right thing

2525132
pop-up	dialog
on my subcontract entry page i d like for there to be a pop-up dialog box where the user can enter a new company if the company isn t already in the drop-down list

2525156
free	calloc
you allocate it inside the function with calloc but the the caller must free it using free

2525157
post	get
when you access the request collection like that it looks for both post and get parameters checking both request.form and request.querystring

2525157
fiddler	charles
use a proxy tool like fiddler or charles to inspect the request as it leaves the browser

2525162
ant	maven
database activity archiving and rule processing are perfect uses for ant or even maven

2525185
int	chars
main and int main int argc chars

2525189
free	calloc
and if you allocate an array dynamically in a function via calloc and return it it is up to the caller of the function to free it using the pointer that the function returns

2525216
ant	maven
note that it is is a full ide not a command line tool like maven or ant

2525238

2525244
put	get
i put some log commands into the oncreate function in the tabactivity as you see and they all get written into the log...i have no idea what i m doing wrong here

2525279
accessor	properties
then call base.trackchange string object in each properties accessor upon which you are interested in change

2525279
accessor	properties
the flag is there because basic state initialisation of the object means that properties changes set accessor calls may be made until the object is fully hydrated the first time

2525280
mockups	balsamiq
balsamiq has an excellent tool for doing mockups of interface designs

2525300
updatepanel	scriptmanager
you can add a little snippet of code using the scriptmanager to execute after the response comes back to the updatepanel

2525331
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on firefox or google-chrome but on internet explorer 7 the condition is always false because the browser sets the property this way

2525331
google-chrome	firefox
and the right way is the following firefox google-chrome

2525364
hide	show
i need to split somehow some html data a text with html tags into two parts and hide the second one with a show hide link

2525364
hide	show
we don t want t to show long ones so one of the options is to show a teaser with a show hide link

2525368
google-chrome	firefox
and this has to work in firefox google-chrome and ie6

2525369
ffmpeg	libavformat	ffmpeg	avisynth	avisynth	libavformat
i would suggest using something like gstreamer or avisynth since they will abstract away a lot of the ugly details decoding video scaling and translation video syncing audio mixing audio syncing video output encoding that would be required if you just used ffmpeg s libavformat and libavcodec directly

2525389
jar	war
packaged file jar war etc.

2525576
post	get
currently i am sending my get and post requests the same way

2525584
ddms	adb
going back to your original problem check the logcat output via adb logcat or ddms to see if there are any messages from the garbage collector right before the oom fired

2525595
sorting	grouping
subquery is more efficient for myisam since it s heap-based and grouping by would require sorting and or materialization

2525621
getter	setter
i m using synchronized in my setter and avoiding it in my getter because in my app there are a tons of data gettings and very few settings

2525644
irc	xmpp

2525658
firefox	safari
this works perfectly in firefox and safari but not in ie..

2525663
put	get
if map was volatile and you created a new map for every put then that could be made to be safe without synchronisation on the get

2525672
for-loop	arrays
you could use a for-loop to iterate over the arrays until you find the first that is greater than the one you re searching

2525680
post	get
ok i didn t get a single response to this post so here is how i worked around the problem hope it helps someone

2525762
freebsd	linux
basically i run this program in linux and maybe freebsd

2525785
folder	directory
my basic question was if it was possible to go up a directory when using createobject component dot path from index.cfm to mycomponent.cfc if the name of my project folder is not static across all installs of the project

2525788
viewmodel	caliburn
you may want to take a look at some alternative mvvm frameworks such as caliburn that take a viewmodel first approach and break this coupling

2525844
pull	push
when you are up and running you can push pull to another repository via the team push pull menu item

2525889

2526295
onclick	onsubmit
it was working fine when attached to the onclick handler of the button but not on onsubmit

2526297
subtract	add
for each time interval for each square for each color channel subtract the two intensities take the square and add it all together if you need to detect clips that might be small parts of other clips it gets a bit trickier but the general principle of calculating feature vectors should work

2526305
stdout	stderr
i have a system set up that s been happily running r from a java servlet spawning processed hooking into the process s stdin stdout and stderr streams as in the second andwer to this question

2526315

i have tested the functionality in ie7 ie8 firefox 2 firefox 3 opera and google-chrome and everything works fine

2526360
public	protected
notice the guidelines only specify usage for public and protected fields

2526363
invokelater	invokeandwait
building on max gontar s observation that the exception is not thrown when using invokelater instead of invokeandwait the full solution is to implement invokeandwait correctly out of invokelater and java s synchronization methods

2526371
public	protected
as a personal aside i tent to prefix private variables and methods with _ and then camel casing protected variables and methods in camel casing and public variables and methods with pascal casing but that is just me

2526372
google-chrome	firefox
however everything works on firefox google-chrome and ie8

memcached	apc
if you just want to cache elements something like memcached or apc s cache is the way to go

2526688
memcached	apc
apc has the advantage of being more readily available you should have apc installed on your servers for the opcode cache if you care at all about performance and memcached has the option of letting you have a cache that s accessible by multiple webservers and or multiple caches

post	get
or if you only want to get rid of method post do not render home template in your view but set cookie and redirect user back

2526813
post	get
if this is the case the easiest way around your problem is to do a response.redirect to the same page - so when the user presses f5 it will reload the get request to the page instead of the post

2526813

2526990
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
this way the label could be displayed on top of the uinavigationcontroller s bar while also automatically being rotated since it is a subview of uiviewcontroller

int	chars
it s not so much a language syntax but a common shorthand for converting a chars or int into quasi-boolean

keydown	keyup
but i believe that to create an actual system-level keypress event -- to make windows create the keydown keyup messages for you and work correctly even if you change applications while the pedal is held down -- you need to write an input driver

2527648
put	get
you get several copies of the same file and then you have to delete all the versions you donâ t need leave visual studio for that or you get conflict indicators put into your code which make your code uncompilable until you removed them all

when trying to do math on an big int int64 large number in xslt template i get the wrong result since there is no native 64-bit int support in xslt xslt number is 64-bit double

2527737
int	double
this test returns true due to the inexact representation of the large int in 64-bit double i am assuming but actually is false if i could tell the xslt processor somehow to use int64 rather than the default 64-bit double for the number data since big int is the actual data type for numbers in the xml input

int	double
because neither byte nor int inherit from long and float doesn t inherit from double

2528281

for example a double and an int are stored very differently in memory and to upcast from a double to an int involves changing the strategy used to store that data from a version that stores decimal information to a version that does not

2528281
int	double
to continue the example the int and double wrapper classes are subclasses of number which both wrappers can be upcast to

2528281
int	double
however double is not a subclass of int

2528281

thus you cannot upcast from double to int

but the superclass constructor must be called before the subclassing constructor so i have no chance to save the value passed in

2529615
int	boolean
your first example if you pass in anything that evaluates to false false 0 0.0 etc will return that unchanged so your return type could be string boolean list int float etc

2529618
superclass	subclassing
while the superclass constructor is executing the object in question is a half initialized instance of the superclass not the subclassing

2530343
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
for the client project added without this checkbox enabled i opened properties page and .net ria services link dropdownlistfor is empty it contains no project set item

2530345
inherited	properties
when you create a or of a it does not inherited the value of the order properties from the parent buffer so code like this will not do what you expect

2530364
packets	multicast
i haven t done much with multicast but i believe that preparing to receive multicast packets is a two-step process

2530370
post	get
it will give post in case the button was click and get in case it the page was accessed using url like

2530372
folder	directory
i want to disable directory browsing of galerias folder and all subdirectories

2530382
vb6	vba
i m not sure if this is what caused the problem but i remember reading that vb6 vba has a problem with declaring and instantiating an object on the same line of code

2530383
ant	maven
maven integrates seamlessly with ant - in both directions

2530383
ant	maven
in my current project we invoke maven from ant multiple times in order to perform complex integration test

2530383
ant	maven
likewise we use ant via maven s antrun plugin and we also wrote our own maven plugins

2530411
implements	extends
if extension implements iextendable interface it can extends itself with different extension objects

2530411
implements	extends
the problem is that i want to allow the extension which implements iextendable to extends only with extension that implements the same interfaces as the original extension

2530411
implements	extends
and i want to allow this class to extends itself only with extensions that implements the same interfaces or less

2530411
implements	extends
i want to do this because when update will be called on some extension which implements iextendable and iupdateable it will be also called on these extensions which extends this extension

2530422
ftell	fread
now when debugging at the ftell before the fread dummy is 262062

2530422
ftell	fread
at the ftell after the fread dummy is 262640

2530431
fseek	ftell
if you don t use the b to open the file ftell doesn t return the truth just a sort of cookie that s only useful to fseek

2530445
stdout	fflush
you should call fflush stdout after printing the prompt

2530530
for-loop	arrays
for example scala has an incredibly powerful for-loop but it uses generic types so primitives must be boxed and hence you can t use it effectively for iterating over primitive arrays

2530536
submit	submission
you will lose the info from other input elements when submission any of these 1-input forms since a form submission only submit the values for input elements of that one form

2530545
iboutlet	ibaction
the button sends a message to the controller via ibaction then the controller updates the label via iboutlet

2530573
cassini	iis
why was something acceptable for cassini and not for iis is beyond my ability to understand

2530590
converter	multibinding
although i understand how to access the images from applications settings using a multibinding and a value converter i m not sure how to integrate the multibinding into the imagebutton controltemplate below

2530617
cldc	midp
so i start reading about javafx and that looks really cool but all that i see about mobiles there is applied to cldc midp etc

2530627
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

2530727
width	height
i ve always tried to specify the height and width attributes for img tags in html

2530727
width	height
the height and width attributes give

2530729
google-chrome	firefox
whenever i want to open a link in a new tab i add target _blank works fine in google-chrome and firefox

2530750
mouseleave	mouseenter
try out the mouseenter and mouseleave events

2530750
hide	show
it would be better to only create the link once and then just hide show it when they hover over

2530754
width	height
i m using this plugin because i need fixed height rather than fixed width

2530757
uiview	subviews
now what i need to do is collision detection of subviews within 2 different uiview that are contained in a view in which the view controller does the logic

2530758
width	height
images height and width attributes annevankesteren.nl

2530761
mouseleave	mouseenter
you could try mouseenter and mouseleave events instead

2530818
free	malloc
address 0x20 is not stack d malloc d or recently free d

2530870
stdout	fflush
at that point the residual data in the stdout buffer is fflush

2530878
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it does not work in mozilla firefox or webkit google-chrome safari

2530919
google-chrome	firefox
to prove my point the following code works in firefox but not in ie or google-chrome

2530940
free	malloc
the default settings are of course to use malloc and free

2530941
inherited	properties
in other cases the button properties we want to trigger on might not be inherited by the image

2531018
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
try using inputstreamreader and fileinputstream to read and then store the data in a char then just write that char using a fileoutputstream

2531113
width	height
i am not entirely sure what you mean by dynamic height and width but as far as i know you need to specify width and height either in pixels or percent of the surrounding element and i don t know of any way to let the size of the swf decide like you can do for example with an img tag by leaving out width and height

2531140
width	height
i had a look on msdn and looks like the wmp object model has some properties which might give you the height and width

2531148
width	height
i have a uibutton synthesized and when i call the following code it moves on the screen but the width height of the button never change

2531161
cgsize	cgrect
you re trying to assign a cgrect to a cgsize

2531189
google-chrome	firefox
tested this issues in google-chrome ie firefox

2531192
translation	localization
globally store an adapter or any mecanism that will be used to do translation localization in all layers of your application -- zend framework itself does that

2531203
google-chrome	firefox
there are a vast number of different mobile browsers out there makes dealing with just firefox ie safair google-chrome trivial

2531219
ant	maven
everything is driven through ant and soon to be maven

2531220
execl	fork
i m trying to use fork and execl functions together but i fail

2531262
put	get
then per these gae docs you create an upload url and in your upload handler typically a subclass of blobstoreuploadhandler you use get_upload to get blobinfo instances and put their metadata somewhere that will later let you fetch them back as your app may require

2531262
post	put
finally you post the data that you have from attachments above to your own freshly generated upload url using urlfetch.fetch with method-post and a payload in standard application x-www-form-urlencoded encoding for the form that the user would be filling in if they were uploading the data directly which is the normal way to put data in the blobstore -- you can use urllib.urlencode to prepare the payload

2531279
post	get
i want a firefox extension that allows me to supply a url with parameters in get format the extension would take the url parse it and submit the request as post rather than get

2531281
hide	show
if you are needing to hide the image everywhere it show up on the page you can do this

2531309
ssl	https
also it seems you are using https connection to the server which doesn t play well with virtual hosts because of the ssl protocol limitation

2531313
ubuntu	linux
with linux ubuntu specifically a webcam s audio and video are mounted on dev audiox and dev videoy where x and y are numbers

2531319
post	get
changing get to post isn t that hard add to the element and rename doget to dopost

2531330
stdout	fflush
you must either add a n to the end or call fflush stdout to fflush the standard output

2531375
width	height
specify a width and height for your labyrinth by calling setbounds or similar because swing may be cropping the graphics

2531377
authorization	access-control
they do not require any special modules to be installed on apache and you can use all of apacheâ s built-in access-control and authorization mechanisms

2531388
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
if you view this page in ie firefox or opera everything is fine but in google-chrome and safari the tables are a little out of line as you ll probably clearly notice

2531388
google-chrome	safari
it appears to me that in google-chrome and safari the left and right border 2px in total are added to the set table width while in the other browsers the border is considered part of the width

2531388
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if here i set the width of table.uitbetaling and table.uitbetaling img table.uitbetaling td to the same value both 496 or 498 the problem in google-chrome and safari is solved however in firefox the right side border is than blank

2531396
rar	zip
used in ethernet v.42 mpeg-2 png posix cksum arj lha32 rar zip and more..

2531438
innodb	myisam
my main articles table is in innodb but i am also caching articles into myisam table as well for full text searching but when i search an article it takes ages to perform one search

2531450
folder	directory
if the files are in sub folder these subfolders are also copied into the output directory

2531471
getter	setter
of particular notice is the fact that scala always go to the fields through getter and setter even on other methods of the same class

2531477
ilist	icollection
however if you can use a more specialized type - icollection ilist etc

2531483
svg	vml
use raphael.js mit license - it give you canvas-like api using svg and vml for ie and works in all amjor browsers including ie6

2531486
ienumerable	iqueryable
especially as the ienumerable or iqueryable returned by the query enumeration should only contain one item

2531494
treeviewitem	menuitem
for example the framework uses hic as the base class for both treeviewitem whose header is the item at hand and whose items are the children of that item and menuitem whose header is the menu item and whose items are any sub-menu-items for example in a drop-down or pop-out menu

2531496
inherited	properties
there s no itemssource properties since it can have only a single child or two children if you count header in just like the class it inherited from - contentcontrol

2531501
min	max
i want the box width to be at least 191px min and maximum 450px max

2531502
metaphone	soundex
i m aware of soundex and double metaphone but these don t let me test for the similarity of words as a whole - for example hi sounds very similar to bye but both of these methods will mark them as completely different

2531517
post	get
if you re familiar with reddit you ll know how all of their post containing pictures get a small thumbnail preview beside the title of the submission

2531520
int	chars
this is using type punning to access an int as an array of chars

2531520
int	chars
instead of accessing i as a single int the same memory is accessed as an array of four chars

2531521
button	checkbox
in ib you can simply drag a checkbox cell not a checkbox button

2531546
pop-up	dialog
effectively what i m trying to do is have a bookmarklet which will pop-up some information in a nice pretty draggable jquery-ui dialog

2531558
prepare	execute
when you execute such a prepare statement only the statement id and the parameters are transferred not some query string as if you would replace the placeholders by the actual parameters on the client-side your php script

2531583
next	except
the scripts almost works except for not waiting long enough to receive an ip it cycles to next step in the until loop too quick

2531623
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
really the decision comes down to whether you pay for a fully managed subversion repository that is pre-configured such as that offered by cloud forge or beanstalk or whether instead you pay for an infrastructure-as-a-service iaas cloud hosting service such as compute engine amazon-web-services ec2 or azure for a virtual machine and take responsibility for the setup of the subversion server on that virtual machine instance take responsibility for the security and access control of that virtual machine and take responsibility for the domain name ssl certificates etc

2531627
postgresql	mysql	apache	nginx
apache thin nginx sqlite mysql postgresql many parsing libraries rmagick tcp ip etc are c programs used by ruby

2531650
maven	pom.xml
right now i m writing a small java application by my own with few maven pom.xml files

2531701
width	height
one thing you can try is put a uiview with the color you want and position it above the uiwebview with the same width and height

2531722
post	get
if you have control over the web service then you can get it to either reply with a json or use a rest web service as well as a soap web service as javascript can work well with rest or with a form-based post get web service as opposed to soap

2531750
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
c functions deal with dynamic memory allocation only malloc calloc realloc

2531766
hash	md5
a hash value that i generate for each animal using md5 that i ll assume is unique

2531785
vsto	add-in
i am actually monitoring excel on startup to determine why excel is having problems with a vsto add-in

2531801
inherited	properties
the style properties refers to what has been set by javascript as opposed to the inherited css

2531808
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome is based on safari so if you can find a plugin for safari you should be able to use this in google-chrome

2531841
cvs	svn
since it is a generated file it is not typically stored in a revision system such as git svn mercurial or cvs rather the .ac file would be

2531922
integer	unsigned
there may also be differences in floating point and unsigned integer representation but most systems and file formats now use ieee 754 and two s-complement respectively so compatibility issues are far less frequent with those types

2531929
getter	setter
finally you can create a read-only property by giving it a getter but no setter like this

2531934
background-color	font-size
however there are differences between the ie way and the standard way for example the ie element.currentstyle property expect that you access the ccs property names composed of two or more words in camelcase maxheight fontsize backgroundcolor etc the standard way expects the properties with the words separated with dashes max-height font-size background-color etc

2531946
jboss	glassfish
to answer your question more directly though just look into the difference between a servlet container like tomcat and a full java ee application server like glassfish or jboss

2531960
google-chrome	firefox
for me everything worked fine for firefox google-chrome etc but not ie8

2531990
oncreate	onstart
however oncreate will indeed be called and your application can call onstart from there

2531997
udp	tcp
in the end at the levels where java will operate there s either udp or tcp

2531997
udp	tcp
if you can deal with udp s limitations you ll find it faster and if you can t then any lightweight tcp wrapper of which http is one is just about the same

2532160
firefox	safari
this wordpress site works fine in firefox and safari

2532163
min	max
i need to make a list showing their names and average min max scores

2532180
addition	multiplication
edit lest people get the wrong idea by operations i m not specifically referring to the operations addition multiplication etc.

2532188
jar	manifest.mf
however you can add a class-path deploy.jar attribute to your manifest.mf and require that your jar be run with -xbootclasspath a myjar.jar

2532192
fflush	gets
it can be related to some kind of buffer that only gets fflush ie sends data when

2532275
ssl	https
this will usually happen when you are sourcing some of your page via ssl using the https protocol and some of it from regular http protocol most likely images or script or css files

2532328
post	get
in the pdf page i can use post to get the detail

2532339
onclick	onsubmit
the technique to use is to wrap the conversion code in a javascript function and then to call this function from any link onclick or onsubmit event

2532364
datalist	checkboxlist
datalist checkboxlist

2532414
pop-up	dialog
don t know if it s faster than hitting enter when that dialog pop-up though

2532429
inherited	properties
the above css properties is inherited throughout all elements on your site

2532430
hide	show
i suppose i can do a hide show to get back to the first div

2532449
metaphone	soundex
but for example for hungarian there is a good free thesaurus database but you don t have soundex metaphone for hungarian texts.

2532450
realloc	malloc
you ll have to check for allocation errors after calls to malloc and realloc

2532477
fastcgi	scgi
cgi fastcgi and scgi are language agnostic

2532477
fastcgi	scgi
flup is another way to run with wsgi for any webserver that can speak fastcgi scgi or ajp

2532495
int	boolean
i have some configuration blocks that i read from a file int boolean floats and

2532495
getter	setter
the fact is that i have many such config parameters 15 or so and writing getter and setter seems an unnecessary overhead

2532503
public	protected
it sounds like you just need to make these members protected - that way they can be accessed by derived classes but are not public

2532508
fastcgi	scgi
fastcgi scgi and ajp run the web app as a separate process daemon and pass messages between the web server and it

2532513
folder	directory
earlier when i installed the application in a new virtual directory report was not getting shown then i ve copied aspnet_client folder in my newly created web application root and the report was then made visible

2532536
merb	ruby-on-rails
mod_fastcgi was usually the option for ruby-on-rails merb and other ruby based web frameworks but they are superseeded by mod_rails and mod_rack which are esource-friendly

2532564
int	chars
i ve written chars counter c extension to python looks like 300x faster than collections.counter and 150x faster than collections.default int

2532693
opengl-es	glreadpixels
but before calling it we need to call glreadpixels with gl_depth_component and that is not possible in opengl-es

2532703
post	put
make sure ie isn t caching the response from your request put this before your post calls run

2532704
int	chars
if you have a chars a chars you can convert it to an int an int

2532712
jobs	cron
cron jobs will run with a much reduced environment

2532727
getter	setter
this is probably overkill but it illustrates how you should create getter setter in python and achieve the functionality you want

2532754
jsf	seam
since seam is built on jsf it has large number of ui component libraries to pick from

2532783
stdio	fflush
so if you are going to use stdio in both the parent and child then you should fflush before forking to ensure that there is no buffered data

2532783
stdio	fflush	stderr	fflush	stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush	stdout	stdio
in particular avoid printing the error to stdout or stderr using any stdio function write is ok and then call _exit or _exit rather than calling exit or just returning which will fflush any buffered output

2532816
width	height
but i have no idea how to store values of each square in mysql when each user can have area with different width or height

2532842
accessor	properties
maybe just restrict your design to a single class with your critical accessor and another more generic named properties method ie

2532858
put	get
when you put everything in one grid with span columns and or rows - you would get a hard to manage layout

2532893
int	boolean
generally speaking basic int and boolean types are usually value types and everything else is up in the air -- some languages make strings values and others treat them as references etc

2532971
comparator	comparable
the way to sort things according to some order is to create a comparator which knows which of any two things are first according to the order or to let the thing itself implement the comparable interface so you do not need the comparator

2532998
multiplying	add
i would like to be able to seamlessly add and multiplying polynomials and regular numbers but i can t make change-class accept a number

2533006
domxpath	domdocument
if you want to use xpath to find specific elements nodes either simplexmlelement xpath or domxpath which you would use with domdocument as pointed out by cletus you have to register the namespace first

2533044
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
a decision was made to remove mono support from the main sharpdevelop application since only support for compiling with mono was provided and monodevelop can now run on windows

2533044
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
note that mono support in sharpdevelop does not provide any integrated debugging with mono s debugger and there is no gtk# designer compared with monodevelop

2533062
getter	setter
the getter and setter among many other useful functions are generated for you similar to a struct

2533095
rsa	aes
the standard python library implementing common ciphers like aes and rsa is pycrypto

2533116
getter	setter
the fact is that i have many such config parameters 15 or so and writing getter and setter seems an unnecessary overhead

2533140
hamcrest	lambdaj
in his last release lambdaj implements it with a smart use of closure and hamcrest matcher

2533187
hamcrest	lambdaj
if you find the native java switch construct is too much limiting give a glance to the lambdaj switcher that allows to declaratively switch on any object by matching them with some hamcrest matchers

2533190
hamcrest	lambdaj
if you find the native java switch construct is too much limiting give a glance to the lambdaj switcher that allows to declaratively switch on any object by matching them with some hamcrest matchers

2533272
for-loop	arrays
just do a regular for-loop from 0 to the size of the arrays

2533274
codeigniter	cakephp
the most popular php frameworks cakephp symphony codeigniter etc. all have routing code in them which you might be able to use or might serve as inspiration

2533277
post	get
even back as far as netscape 2 you have always been able to transfer information to any third-party site through simple get and post requests caused by interfaces as simple as form.submit new image or setting window.location

2533279
apache	nginx
if you use nginx as a proxy server in front of apache you can use its memcached module to serve cached html output directly from memcached

2533297
udp	tcp
i am going for an interview day after tomorrow where i will be asked vaious questions related to tcp ip and udp

2533297
tcplistener	tcpclient
right now i am studying tcpclient tcplistener and udpclient class but i want to implement all of them so as to get aware about its working

2533313
cassini	iis
this is not a ninject problem really it seems to be an issue with cassini the web server built into vs2k8 which handles these requests differently than iis would handle them

2533319
unsigned	short	int	chars
chars signed chars unsigned chars int unsigned int signed int short int unsigned short int signed short int all occupy same no

2533335
button	checkbox
along with that is an advanced button that brings up another dialog wherein one finds a checkbox to allow or disallow the raising and lowering of windows by page code

2533336
folder	directory
when i try some other directory it says the directory has no tools folder so i ve searched for a tools folder but none of those found of 15 or 20 appear to be android

2533361
public	protected
since you make the names public in the derived class anyway so derived classes of derived will be able to access them you could make them protected in the base-class too and omit the friend declaration

2533375
copying	overwrite
copying the given pointer s data psrc to that char arrat cbuff overwrite the stack frame s data which will result in a possible exploit

2533377
accelerometer	gyroscope
i managed to get the quaternion through the accelerometer but i cant figure out how to do it with the gyroscope

2533392
subtract	add
checking hasattr c __eq__ would be misleading as it might erroneously catch a per-instance attribute __eq__ defined in c itself which would not act as a special method note that in the specific case of __eq__ you ll always see a true result from hasattr because ancestor class object defines it and inheritance can only ever add attributes never subtract any

2533400
16-bit	64bit	range	minimum	int	chars
the requirements in the standard just give a minimum range for the type -- 8 bits for chars 16-bit for short and int 32 bits for long and in c99 64bit for long long and every type in that list must have at least as large a range as the preceding type

2533441
maven	pom.xml	maven-antrun-plugin	pom.xml
i would use the maven maven-antrun-plugin to echo the message and bind it on the validate phase the first phase of the default lifecyle in the parent pom.xml

2533478
mp3	wav
i need to convert wav files to mp3 files so they can be played on a website

2533478
mp3	wav
however the wav files are low bitrate around 8kbits recorded from a phone and lame s website states that it is the best mp3 encoder at mid-high bitrates and at vbr

2533525
int	double
i don t know what you are trying to achieve but use double instead of int if you don t want the int division

2533537
aptana	radrails
aptana radrails is eclipse tunned for ruby and rails

2533696
jar	war
module limbo ejb jar is in dependency of module lust war

2533713
folder	directory
for instance i would like to create a task that will checkout a particular folder from my repository and then symlink it into the shared directory of the main project on my server

2533731
folder	directory
try getting a list of all the folder in the directory then generate a random number up to the number of folder then choose the folder that relates to your random number

2533732
switching	screens
i also want the user to be able to switching focus between the game window and other windows as much as he she wants without any weird screens glitches

2533916
bazaar	git
having said that hg can interact with a git repo using hg-git and bazaar might be able to interact with both hg and git

2533916
bazaar	git	pull	push
there s also a git-bzr project to allow one to use git to pull push from a bazaar repository

2533968
xslt	xquery
when i use the command syntax for xquery it doesn t recognize the parameters like -q and gives xslt usage information

2533974
ws-addressing	soap
this response uses simple one-character namespace prefixes for most things such as s for soap envelope a for ws-addressing o for ws-security etc

2533974
wsse	ws-security
upon receipt of my response message the java client and wss4j seem to want to look up elements by their own internal xml aliases such as wsa for ws-addressing and wsse for ws-security extensions

2533979
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
use a for-loop structure opposed to a while to loops over each element of the arrays

2534020
for-loop	loops
the whole point of this was to set up a clean foreach loops for use in my program not to use that ugly for-loop

2534045
post	get
that post explains how to get all pids running on a windows machine you d have to compare the output of the cmd call with your pid instead of printing it

2534073
public	protected
i ve always wondered on the topic of public protected and private properties

2534073
getter	setter
i should note here that using public vars is not in my habit i adhere to the principles of oop by utilizing getter and setter

2534091
getter	setter
therefore you d create a public setter getter with some logic check if something is null or any other calculations instead of accessing the private variable directly and always having to handle that logic in your code

2534092
postgresql	mysql
other searches include using keys and indexes which might lead you to postgresql for it s rock solid acid compliance or mysql with innodb

2534095
public	protected
the whole point is to use private and protected to prevent exposing internal details of your class so that other classes only have access to the public interfaces provided by your class

2534105
getter	setter
note properties in smalltalk are simply getter and setter methods.

2534111
width	height
you don t actually need to specify its height and width in the include as that s already defined in the imported layout file

2534127
exponent	modulo
i m trying to port a piece of java code into .net that takes a base64 encoded string converts it to a byte array and then uses it to make a x.509 certificate to get the modulo exponent for rsa encryption

2534131
integer	unsigned
if i m guessing right what you get back is an unsigned integer of the form 0xaarrggbb so

2534139
pull	push
option 1 pull push

2534164
tcpclient	networkstream
as i m sure you re aware you send and receive data via the tcpclient using its underlying networkstream object

2534186
getter	setter
i m going to assume you mean instance variables since you mention getter setter

2534316
lisp	smalltalk
those languages should include ones that have vastly different assumptions about how people express problems say for example the set smalltalk perl c lisp java

2534316
emacs	textmate
perl people tend to like vi or emacs ruby people tend to like textmate java people tend to like eclipse or intellij

2534342
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
when you set up your uitabbarcontroller you should add uinavigationcontroller rather than your uiviewcontroller subclasses

2534400
mouse	keyboard
it lets you hook both mouse and keyboard system wide very easy

2534453
int	boolean
i know int boolean are a much better way to do this but i m working with strings and changing the schema is not an option

2534457
rss	feed
i like to generate media rss feed in zend in orded to feed the cooliris application

2534481
min	max
leave the max min height properties on 0 for default

2534481
width	height
this gives me a form that can only be 200 width but the default 0 for height seems not to work

2534484
firefox	safari
firefox and safari also offer scrollbylines and ie has doscroll but the scrolltop property is cross-browser and simpler to use

2534487
public	protected
i am wondering if it is possible to set visualstudio ide so it highlights private protected public variables of the class differently as well as change formatting on locals variables that are either passed in or declared inside a function like this

2534507
int	double
i have a bunch of overloaded functions that operate on certain data types such as int double and strings

2534531

google-chrome 5.0.342.7 beta on osx correctly produces the table as does safari 4.0.5

2534563
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari i get this correct output

2534582
simplexmlrpcserver	socketserver	simplexmlrpcserver	xmlrpclib
you can use straight sockets in which case you can use socketserver or you can rely on an existing protocol like http or xml-rpc in which case you will find ready to use library packages with plenty of examples xmlrpclib and simplexmlrpcserver

2534612
int	boolean
interlocked is limited to simple operations on int long and boolean and such

2534623
min	max
this calculates the min and max value from my table works out the difference between the two and creates 5 buckets

2534658
post	get
however when i post this data from my textbox to my server i get a length back of 24577 characters

2534757
subtraction	addition
when i subsequently do subtraction addition and comparisons between these dates i have to keep the gmt offset around and everything gets worse if the phone switches locale settings from when the date was parsed to when the date is displayed.

2534825
junit	testng
the idea is to create two executions of the maven-surefire-plugin one for junit one for testng

2534825
junit	testng
you can disable one of testng or junit per execution by specifying nonexisting junitartifactname or testngartifactname

2534840
free	malloc
undefined outcome plus malloc doesn t call constructors and free doesn t call destructors

2534851
jar	war
you can get the x.jar will not be available on the server s classpath if you are referencing the jar via eclipse s java build path outside of the war web-inf lib directory--and it looks like from the error that you are

2534874
ssl	https
if the table contains sensitive data there are many techniques to enhance security http_request won t give you https support directly but you can encrypt the data you export and decrypt on importing look for ssl on the php manual for further details

2534880
subtraction	addition
the addition and subtraction operators for numeric types + and - â 15.18.2

2534883
jar	.war
i am not bundling any jar files into my .war file deployed to jetty

2534944
distance	mercator
for example in a mercator projections segments far away from the equator represent less actual distance than segments near the equator of equal length

2534963
phong	shading
also please keep in mind that opengl s phong shading does not follow the phong shading model strictly because the normals are calculated per vertex and then interpolated inside the triangles they are not calculated per point on the surface

2534993
equals	compareto
with the way i designed the compareto method is that the result will be that they are equals

2534996
sorting	filtering
filtering and sorting paging are the easiest and if an autocomplete textbox or paged list grid can achieve the desired result go for that

2535012
submit	submission
you can do javascript validation by using the submit button to call a javascript function instead of submission the form

2535077
google-chrome	firefox
the library should handle web sites that use javascript ajax and it should return the correct html as if i were viewing the source from within firefox google-chrome

2535119
junit	testng
works with both junit and testng

2535132
pop-up	dialog
i d like to validate the format of email address entered and pop-up an alert dialog if the format isn t correct

2535143
jar	war
you can use eclipse to compare jar war files

2535143
jar	war
i m using indigo it seems eclipse only support jar comparison hence i have to rename the war extension to jar to get eclipse to do the structural comparison

2535165
try-catch	exception-handling
the only way to deal with this is to wrap all of the activity in a try-catch block and save any exception-handling that occurred which is exactly what the backgroundworker does

2535186
width	height
| with | center grows in height width | with | height

2535213

2535297
firefox	safari
i m passing in popup window function that is going to handle response and it works with firefox and safari but not with ie

2535300
int	chars
to hash a string object to an int you ll have to access each individual chars of the string object which you can do as

2535303
lwjgl	jogl
otherwise i would definitely recommend jogl or its competitor lwjgl

2535337
csv	tsv
here s a python script that takes tsv lines from stdin and writes csv lines to stdout

2535362
rar	zip
i m extracting files from zip and rar archives into raw buffers

2535362
rar	zip
archivederived.hpp derived being zip or rar

2535362
rar	zip
data is generic for zip rar and later is used to create the respective library s struct. everything else is accessed via archive and i d like to make declaring data in an outside class this way as well

2535411
int	chars
so far i have decided it is probably best to use a regexp from the returned search query html and then convert the string of chars to an int

2535422
vim	emacs
once you find the right editor emacs or vim working with the 4-space convention is a breeze

2535529
int	double
that is in c c++ you can shove a function pointer into a function pointer variable declared with the wrong function signature or even an int a double or worse with appropriate coaxing and the compiler will be happy to produce code that calls the function completely incorrectly

2535550
superclass	subclassing
give me a situation where we need to use the superclass reference to a subclassing object in java.please give me a real time example

2535569
firefox	safari
as far as i can see this behavior is consistent between safari 4 and firefox 3.6 but not internet explorer 7 8

2535574
rar	zip
data is generic for zip rar and later is used to create the respective library s struct.

2535575
superclass	subclassing
one of the strong features of java is that it is follows a oops concept and one of the feature of oop in java is that we can assign a subclassing object or variable to the variable of the superclass type

2535592
equals	tostring
i believe i read somewhere people generating equals hashcode tostring methods during compile time using apt by identifying which fields should be part of the hash equality test

2535624
decoder	encoder
the securerandom thing is not an encoder or decoder

2535626
superclass	subclassing
the liskov substitution principle states that subclassing should behave exactly like their superclass so you can substitute a subclassing anywhere the superclass is used

2535643
postgresql	mysql
not that mysql and postgresql can t achieve this but nosql requires far less time and money generally speaking

2535661
post	put
i am not going to post code here since you put that much effort in the question yourself as well but at the sun forums you can find a lot of code examples

2535668
pop-up	dialog
the reason that i m returning a jsonresult is i need to tell my view there is an error so that the view jquery knows which section to update as in whether to update the person list div or the pop-up dialog div

2535677
lisp	scheme
you re thinking in lisp or scheme or ruby or .

2535684

2535688
ubuntu	linux
i read that swi prolog ide - eclipse - in linux ubuntu is possible

2535739
put	get
it s best to put the behavior specifics of php out of your mind when learning perl else you ll get tripped up

2535757
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
seems to work fine on my google-chrome firefox and safari

2535772
google-chrome	safari
if i were doing this i would be using webkit s dom-inspector extensively available in safari or google-chrome by right-clicking on a page and selecting inspect element

2535772
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
and it has some very useful features for inspecting the metrics width height padding border margin of nodes as well as showing what style applies to them in what order and the final style being used

2535829
ubuntu	linux
eclipse is available for linux and if you get ubuntu then eclipse is amazingly easy to install

2535830
ubuntu	linux
if you just want the fun of linux command line programs without access to all of ubuntu cygwin is smaller and might be faster

2535830
unix	bsd
cygwin adds a posix layer to windows basically everything you need to compile unix linux bsd programs

2535836
int	chars
int main int argv chars argc

2535861

you can easily switching to full screens mode anytime

2535891
postgresql	mysql
this is officially supported and can be used with both mysql and postgresql

2535899
spaces	delimiter
tr will let you break up the delimiter into spaces which makes each line easier to parse

2535904
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
as the two previous posters mentioned firebug for firefox and the dom-inspector for safari google-chrome can be very helpful as you can try things out on the page without committing to anything until after you ve seen how it looks

2535913
webkit	gecko	google-chrome	firefox
it works with konqueror khtml google-chrome webkit and firefox gecko

2535931

2535955
hide	show
i suspect what i really need is a combobox with ability to hide show the down arrow

2535963
int	chars
as per my understanding 4 bytes for int 1 byte for chars and 3 bytes for padding

2535976
width	height
note that altcontent should be the id of some element in your html that you want the flash movie to replace while 800 and 600 are the height and width respectively

2535989
unix	bsd
following links explain x86-32 system call conventions for both unix bsd flavor linux

2536007

2536013
xval	fluentvalidation
i m currently looking for using something else like fluentvalidation and xval

2536128

2536200
mp3	wav
i must create a custom media player within the application with support for mp3 and wav files

2536212
union	distinct
in the specific case of the question the error reported by sql server and preventing the completion of the query is that sorting is not possible on rows bigger than... and the distinct keyword is the only apparent reason for the query to require any sorting btw many other sql constructs imply sorting for example union hence the idea of removing the distinct if it is logically possible

2536218
poe	anyevent
having said that i would strongly recommend using a proper event handling framework such as anyevent my personal favorite or poe the traditional choice

2536219
codeigniter	cakephp
the frameworks for php that i know are cakephp codeigniter zend and symfony

2536223
portrait	landscape
come to that uitextfield when device rotates from portrait to landscape mode

then with js you show and hide this text based on hover and inputed text

2536255
vmware	virtualbox
i think your best bet will be to do development with vs c# express and then use a virtual machine--such as vmware virtual pc virtualbox etc.--to access linux which is the primary platform for monodevelop and on which it works really well comparably to vs.

2536292
web-inf	context-param
edited webapps web-inf web.xml and changed context-param from applicationcontext-jdbc.xml to applicationcontext-jpa.xml

2538136
processors	hyperthreading
a typical core 2 duo + hyperthreading only has 4 logical processors and so it doesn t make a lot of sense to have more than 4 threads going at once actually it does but that s a story for another time - we ll pretend and use the simple one thread per processors model for now

2538140
width	height
in more details it tries to set the same height and width for the included panels

if you want an otherwise normal window but without a titlebar do that instead of making a tool window unset qt windowtitlehint in the window s flags - either by using the constructor or the setwindowflags method

2538511
.htaccess	httpd.conf
the authentication is set in either the httpd.conf main apache configuration file or a .htaccess in the directory that serves the protected content

2538511
.htaccess	httpd.conf
simply comment those out - if they re in the httpd.conf file you ll need to restart your apache server if in a .htaccess it should take effect right away

2538578
implements	extends
if this is impossible that is if the class is already extends another class you can instead implements the ieventdispatcher interface create an eventdispatcher member and write simple hooks to route calls into the aggregated eventdispatcher

2538640
parent-child	one-to-many
you could store the existing long ids in a list in the parent class that would create the necessary one-to-many parent-child relationship

2538722
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
you need to define a clientaccesspolicy.xml file or a crossdomain.xml file in order to permit access to your web services from different domains

2538737
width	height
i don t know if it is the answer you are looking for since i never tried to skin a scrollbar but you can change the bar width height by modifying some system properties

2538742
children	parent
to get any benefit of using trees over lists or hash tables there have to rules in place governing which nodes are children of parent nodes and not other parent and possibly the order in which the siblings occur

2538753
getter	setter
the term pojo is a generally negative term representing a javabean which is just a value object totally no business logic pure bean with only getter setter methods and is generally a model object which is part of a legacy program which uses ejb hibernate

2538783
profiling	benchmarking
as far as i know i need a patched ruby rubygc so script profiling and script benchmarking can track memory usage

2538790
accessor	properties
obviously this struct needs fleshing out with properties accessor etc

2538816
put	get
the very simplest way to get this to work is to put the image on your own server somewhere and reference it using a full http uri

2538823
maven	cargo
maven cargo settings

2538834
gridview	repeater
the parent repeater is programmatically bound and now i have an inner gridview bound to the list of datarows

2538877
maven	pom.xml
my thoughts are thatmaybe i am missing in somewhere of all the folders tree some xml that actually sais maven that my pom.xml is an archetype not a project

2538877
maven	pom.xml
after the generation of the archetype witch luckly will create some directory trees and leave me a pom.xml somewhere i still have to do some variable changes and more xml manage stuff so it whould be very kind from maven to don t destroy anything in this process

2538883
mojolicious	catalyst
there are also a series of great web frameworks for perl including the simple but powerful mojolicious framework and the comprehensive catalyst framework

2538883
mojolicious	catalyst
there s always the ancient and stable cgi library but mojolicious or catalyst would probably be better choices

2539088
width	height
in the x direction the range is 0-- width and in the y direction the range is 0-- height

2539111
profiling	instrumentation
it includes a profiling which will instrumentation your code and provide the information you want

2539119
webrat	cucumber
since cucumber uses webrat to inspect the response coming back from the server and webrat doesn t support javascript your scenario fails

2539213
post	get
as you can see the .ajax method allows you to specify get passed in the query string or post passed in the request

2539220
post	get
post get method doesn t have the same lenght limit you can use post to send more data than with get

2539292
hash	md5
if your values are not completely random but in fact may depend on something - you may compute an md5 or sha1 hash of that somwthing and then truncate it to whatever length you want

2539331
subplot	imshow
i d like to display a colorbar representing an image s raw values along side a matplotlib imshow subplot which displays that image normalized

2539331
min	max
i ve been able to draw the image and a colorbar successfully like this but the colorbar min and max values represent the normalized 0 1 image instead of the raw 0 99 image

2539336
put	get
one way to get and write the names of columns is put it before your while lopp

2539360
put	get
this will work in as much as you ll get the same bytes out as you put in but if mysql doesn t know they re utf-8 bytes then case-insensitive string comparisons outside the ascii range won t work right so looking for ã won t match ã

2539402
onkeyup	onkeydown
essentially the answer is don t override the onkeydown and onkeyup buttons

2539412
inherited	properties
if your pages all inherited from a base class you could expose a properties on that which contains the prepend url to your cdn or to your local server if you want to switch the cdn off

2539438
aggregate-functions	sum
the problem that i am running into is when displaying this in a tablix in ssrs i can return the correct moneyout value for a job by setting the field to but i also need to sum the value of these by day and attempting to do yields an error about nesting aggregate-functions

2539441
tapestry	stripes	tapestry	wicket	wicket	stripes	jsf	tapestry	jsf	stripes	jsf	wicket
i have read a bit on all the different java web frameworks out there jsf stripes wicket tapestry etc

2539473
hide	show
you can easily hide the window used for automation one technique i have used is to place it on a new page on a page control add a second page to display the status then show the status page and hide the tabs

2539502
hide	show
samsungs are pretty bad - the j2me implementation on most is flawed hide show notify methods not being called is an example and the memory and speed are typicly a bit crap

2539525
jquery	scriptaculous
i have used both prototype scriptaculous as well as jquery in many projects and based on what i am seeing it appears jquery has the more plug-in available so am leaning towards using jquery

2539561
fadein	fadeout	slideup	slidedown
the effects available with the standard jquery download fadein fadeout slidedown slideup ...

2539572
hide	show
the main change is the selector it ll only show if it s hidden and hide if it s visible it ll get rid of that loop caused by a slide left right

2539601
range	min
only instead of the range going from the min going off of where the handle is and allowing the user to slide either left or right of that fixed starting point to create the range

2539604
slideup	slidedown
i thought i was getting close - i can get the sub-menu to slidedown but when i hover over it i ve had to mouseout on the parent li triggering a slideup

2539645
toggleclass	each
i have a bunch of div s with an anchor in each that when clicked expands the the div s width using toggleclass

2539666
put	get
it handles everything internally avoiding useless locks on the map and saving you a lot of work you won t have to care about synchronizations on get and put

2539679
addclass	removeclass
and for performance sake just use addclass and removeclass instead of toggleclass

2539682
uiview	subviews
i just want to draw it to another uiview s bitmap the same way as it appears when adding as subviews

2539689
google-chrome	firefox
running php debug session in netbeans always opens as a new tab in browser i use google-chrome and firefox

2539718
interpolation	splines
the control points of the bã zier splines can be determined by linearly interpolation between the control points of the b-spline in an appropriate way

2539803
ready	each
each developer is changing schema by creating upgrade procedures this is how we have rebuild and upgrade ready at the same time

2539826
tcplistener	tcpclient
you could look into the socket class or the simpler tcpclient and tcplistener

2539842
innodb	myisam
innodb can store actual data in its buffer pool unlike myisam - so try setting this value innodb_buffer_pool_size to be large enough to accomodate your data

2539868
post	put
there s a link there to a post i put on the metro java.net forums that was helpful to me

2539901
filtering	grouping
the type of products should still flow through and be accessible and the regular grouping filtering shouldn t mutate the type that is flowing through the extension methods

2539978
width	height
i need to be able to store the current height and width of a div at any point in time

2539981
accessor	properties
first implement a static accessor properties on a class called myoperationcontext

2539994
width	height
if you are using a control you might try setting the height and width

2540000
apache	nginx
nginx uses epoll or other multiplexing techniques select for its handling multiple clients i.e it does not spawn a new thread for every request unlike apache

2540059
dot-product	transpose
i d have to transpose each array to nx1 and that s pretty lame since i d be doing it for every dot-product calculation

2540073
put	get
this design is pretty nice because the threads will no longer have to compete for a lock to update data and since the map is confined to a single thread you can simply use a plain hashmap to do get put etc

2540146
getter	setter
however the name property in the iidentity interface is read-only the iidentity interface specifies a getter but not a setter for the name property

2540181
superclass	subclassing
now subclassing of a can override getmember to make the superclass use a specific implementation of isomeinterface

2540208
httphandler	httpmodule
it is possible to write httphandler or httpmodule which give you more flexibility without requiring asp.net mvc

2540215
libs	buildpath
i am not sure what you mean with creating a wrapper module and why you would like to do it but normally you just drop the libs the jar files in a project folder which is covered by the project s buildpath aka classpath or to manually add the jar files to the project s buildpath

2540233
sorting	filtering
now however i need to parse the entire dataset ie all entities and all their attributes in order to provide a sorting filtering algorithm based on the attributes

2540244
post	put
so using put in a form method would generate invalid html and i m reasonably sure the browser will execute a post instead of a put anyway at least that s what ff 3.6 did when i tried to change the form method to put

2540244
post	get
if you want to get information out of the url just change the form method to be get instead of post

2540251
button	checkbox
when i have a set of either checkbox or radio button i often need to have an other choice

2540274
16-bit	64bit
the bios is usually not used once the kernel is loaded and depends on a 16-bit execution environment as opposed to the 32- or 64bit protected mode environment that a modern kernel operates in

2540296
apache	nginx
i found out that the cause of my problem was not the proxy between nginx and apache but rather was an issue with apache itself

2540306
getter	setter
properties in java a property of a class is something that is accesible via getter setter method setxxx getxxx property xxx tipically but not necessarily corresponds to a private field

2540326
getter	setter
it seems that setting and getting the visible property is asymmetric the setter seems to place a flag in the control but the getter to return a calculated value which depends on the visibility of the outer elements and the visibility of the control itself

2540367
jobs	cron
you may use cron scheduled jobs

2540393
free	malloc
i am thinking of replacing new delete with malloc free and use mallopt to tune the way the memory is being released to the system

2540438
put	get
wsdl does exist on server side and client does read it when i put wrong url for wsdl i get an error

2540492
onfocus	onblur
add handlers to the control for focus events or better override the methods for onfocus onblur

2540561
realloc	malloc
using malloc realloc will not help this

2540598
children	parent
so basically it might load the dependencies parent children etc which is definitely not desirable

2540608
webclient	httpwebrequest
you re looking for the webclient class and perhaps httpwebrequest

2540625
nant	cruisecontrol
i m not complaining about nant ivy or cruisecontrol at all as they ve been brilliant in helping our team of developers become more sure of the quality of their code but it just seems strange that these tools are very popular yet we re all re-inventing the ci-wheel

2540710
hide	show
if you re simply trying to hide some type of functionality you could mask the application with something very simple like an app that showed a slide show

2540722
extjs	ext.net
then in the partial view note these are coolite ext.net controls which generate extjs code

2540779
profiling	debugging
it s worth noting that the vm will execute more slowly with profiling enabled the interpreter has overhead on every method call and return and it s running in the slower debugging interpreter while native code continues to run at full speed so you have to be careful when drawing conclusions

2540782
getter	setter
the main usage scenario would be the one you describe a property with a public getter but private setter

2540804
post	get
first a h commandbutton fires a post request not a get request

2540884
postgresql	mysql
i m more of a ms-sql postgresql guy but i m working on a mysql project

2540916
ironruby	ironpython
the dlr currently supports ironpython and ironruby plus a number of other language implementations can be found on codeplex

2540929
onfocus	onblur
of course there s no need to have a counterpart as the onblur took care of it the counterpart of onfocus

2540967
listadapter	listactivity
i m writing unit tests for a listactivity in android that uses a handler to update a listadapter

2541009
inherited	properties
my end goal is to create a container that is reusable but inherited all properties methods that i ve specified throughout the chain

2541019
post	get
you can make this query a little bit more efficient by running a maintenance procedure that would get rid of the overlapping ranges on a timely basis like described in the post and rewriting the query like this

2541032
firefox	safari
to find out where particular element inherits its style from open firebug firefox or web inspector safari select the element and you will see list of its styles and their origins

2541095
invokerequired	begininvoke
although i recommend using invoke or begininvoke after calling invokerequired of course you can prevent the cross-thread exception altogether by calling this from your form or usercontrol

2541109
put	get
get them to start their work and put their results on the queue

2541117
stdout	stderr
if you want stderr instead of stdout rather than stderr and stdout you can do the following

2541117
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr 2 to stdout 1

2541166
getter	setter
an initialize method uses reflection to find the object and property and stores the property getter as an and the property setter as an

2541189
short	base
in short i used it when i have to program in .net but need access to a c++ code base

2541206
getter	setter
you could obtain delegates directly representing the getter and setter method

2541240
put	get	post	put	post	get
the only reason why you should be putting a verb force_delete into the uri is if you would need to overload get post methods in an environment where put delete methods are not available

2541275
free	malloc
we affectivly just call malloc free on the objects we want to create

2541296
hash	md5
if an attacker had sql injection in your application then they could obtain the md5 hash and the user name and login immediately without having to break the md5 hash

2541350
post	get
i messed around with your code some but didn t get a full answer but figured i d post what i have anyway

2541353
gridview	repeater
i got a list of customers i thought i would list in a gridview or a repeater with customer html it gone have paging

2541362
realloc	malloc
if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the

2541362
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call

2541362
free	realloc
to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

2541369
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
calloc malloc or realloc function

2541369
free	realloc
by a call to the free or realloc

2541450
aggregate-functions	sum
but this is where the aggregate-functions sum count average etc... come into play select id playername sum score from table group by playername

2541480
equals	gethashcode
so i disabled my implementation of equals gethashcode and it worked just fine

2541483
sorting	filtering
in addition to providing fields and filtering for locations it also offers basic proximity filtering and sorting features

2541495
hash	md5
the attacker could use this vulnerability to obtain your extremely weak md5 hash crack it and then login

2541507
dictionary	map
the include template tag can take a variable containing the template to include so you could loop through a sequence containing the various sub-templates and include them in turn maybe using a dictionary to map friendly names to template filenames

2541546
ant	maven
when i need the libs i retrieve them using maven or ivy ant tasks

2541556
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
most browsers ie9 google-chrome safari use h.264 though currently firefox only supports ogg when using the video tag

2541638
uiview	subviews
it s rigged so the subviews change colour but they change colour when they are not even touching and when they do touch the wrong uiview are changing colour

2541668
portrait	landscape
for example the teapot jumps 180deg as the device viewing angle crosses the horizon and it also rotates spuriously if you tilt the device from portrait into landscape

2541690
maven	cargo
i m not sure how you access jetty configuration in cargo but in the normal jetty maven plugin you would do something like

2541698
cldc	midp
i know that blackberry and nokia provide their own api s that go above and beyond what is specified in midp cldc or any of the jsrs for java me

2541746
superclass	subclassing
referring to a subclassing from a superclass is not a good idea

2541784
inherited	subclassing
it s interesting that no-one has mentioned one of key benefits of delegation - it s preferable to subclassing when you realise that inherited is not a magic bullet and usually creates more problems than it solves

2541787
hash	salt
if you want them to be really secure you could salt them with the user s id and then sha1 hash them base64 encode the result and then use that as the value

2541817
prepare	execute
b stored procedures cannot execute prepare statements from concatenated strings using so called dynamic sql statements nor can it return results with more than one distinct row

2541879
awt	swing
that s not even a good idea in awt let alone swing

2541879
awt	swing
other than get all the awt swing stuff on the right thread part of the fix should be to get the listener check state to see if it should execute its body rather than attempting to remove and add the listener

2541883
libs	buildpath
if this is done correctly then eclipse will automatically include the server s libs the server is actually a concrete implementation of under each the servlet api in the project s buildpath

2541887
folder	directory
it creates a new directory in the beginning and moves 10 files into that directory then creates a new folder again and moves another 10 files into that directory and so on

2541892
ostringstream	std
just use std ostringstream so you don t have to manage the char

2541926
opera	firefox
firefox and opera will not support h.264 unless the war is lost but might or might not afterwards using gstreamer with directshow quicktime providing the nonfree codecs

2541926
mp3	ogg
1 system codecs gstreamer probably free codecs ogg good chance of many non free codecs including h.264 mp3 either bought from fluendo or packaged with non free linux cd computer or installed by user possibly slightly illegal but common easy little chance of punishment

2541926
opera	firefox
5 in mobile firefox fennec planning to use gstreamer i think might use it everywhere ala opera later on

2541967
httphandler	httpmodule
but after reading about them i m still no closer to an understanding of what problems i would solve with an httphandler or httpmodule

2542023
super	abstract
of course one could imagine super interesting behavior that takes all sorts of abstract parameters but requires a ton of information to be able to call it

2542082
n-gram	words
if you do not use a library that does it for you you can optimize queries by looking up the most globally infrequent characters or words or n-gram first in your indexes

2542084
post	put
hey guys i was scanning my site for security and i noticed that it was possible for non users to send requests and post information so i decided to put login checks on all information post

2542087
for-loop	loops
if this test precedes loops it will prevent execution from reaching the for-loop if filesraw is empty

2542118
salt	md5
every bridge that i did made me choose the main sign-in app based on the password encryption since if you have a script that has md5 passwords encrypted and another vbulletin you want to connect to you d surely go with the main script as the main sign in due to vbulletin s salt password encryption

2542133
hide	show
i m working on a small problem where i m trying to show hide a panel based on two criteria

2542137
draggable	droppable
but i have a problem dragging to a droppable that is smaller than the draggable

2542153
mouseleave	mouseenter
i d bind the image source to a property of the code behind and capture the mouseenter and mouseleave events to change this property

2542157
superclass	subclassing
fine but these are all subclassing of a common class so if i leave their superclass as non-abstract i should be happy so long as i can get its manager to return objects of the proper class

2542283
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in google-chrome but fails to execute properly in firefox

2542348
rss	feed
i am pretty sure it has to do with the xmlns but i need this code to work with both this style and normal style rss feed no xmlns

2542367
goto	break
i have seen goto used to break out of nested loops

2542369
inherited	properties
all user defined properties are enumerable including the properties inherited from prototype

2542372
superclass	subclassing
this sort of extends itself type parameter is used to let the superclass refer to the subclassing in places like method parameters and return types even though no actual specific subclassing is available when the superclass is compiled

2542374
affinity	processors
you can t set processors affinity for specific threads

2542376

boost	stl
stl and boost can fill in gaps

2542443
nsstring	nsdata
the array holds nsstring nsdata and cgpoint values

2542486
base-class	derived-class
yes passing a derived-class instance to a function that takes a base-class reference is ok

2542486
public	protected
your example compiles for me though and doesn t look like it should produce that error -- an inaccessible base class generally refers to something that was extended via protected or private inheritance rather than public inheritance

2542510
submit	submission
i checked the entire form post and unfortunately the submitted fields are identical to the perl script processing the form submission no matter which submit button is clicked so the perl script can t differentiate which action to perform based on which submit button is pushed

2542576
post	get
this is all well and good for the get request but upon post the value is going to be which when you assign to that decimal gets unhappy very quickly and ends up shoving a 0 in there

2542576
client-side	server-side
i d much rather this be done server-side than client-side

2542583
cobertura	emma
yes coverage tools like cobertura or emma

2542610
children	parent
when i kill the parent daemonic process not a worker with a ctrl-c or sigterm etc. the children don t die

2542685
g++	gcc
you re compiling a .cpp c++ program by invoking gcc instead of g++ .

2542721
777	tmp
i ve set 777 permissions on app tmp

2542722
hide	show
do not show preview of videocontrol hide make it s size as zero ...

2542747
super	self
since my class decorator creates another subclass a decorated class seems to prevent the use of super when it changes the classname passed to super classname self

2542779
superclass	subclassing
just wanted to confirm that i m not headed for future trouble by using self in the superclass phonenumber and using that to execute class methods on subclassing from the parent

2542791
postgresql	mysql
all the sql solutions out there and in particular mysql and postgresql are solid and documented for performance usage quirks

2542794
implements	extends
public class swingcapture extends panel implements actionlistener

2542810
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome seems to like them all but safari firefox and ie all have problems with various icons

2542817
inherited	subclassing
for instance instead of a decorator to replace your class with a subclassing introducing some methods perhaps you want a mixin class and to use multiple inherited to create the final class

2542857
width	height
the image is the same width height as the canvas

2542867
sharepoint	cqwp
it has has the cqwp which enables you to build custom interfaces which perform well in sharepoint

2542874
cldc	midp
i am using cldc 1.0 and midp 2.0

2542893
post	put
if i can put together something concise which reproduces the issue i will post

2542902
int	double
it s generic so it supports int double strings etc

2542904
int	chars
chars is an ordinal type like int and the compiler only knows how to add them in the most basic of ways

2542930
oursql	mysql-python
i hear oursql is nicer the mysql-python

2542945
folder	directory
go to spring installation directory and include all of jars in the following folder

2542952
coalesce	isnull
edit according to omg ponies coalesce could be used instead of isnull to make it work across sql server mysql oracle etc

2542966
folder	directory
i just downloaded fckeditor and dropped the folder into my root directory but i don t know how to install the fckeditor into my forms

2543037
folder	directory
heroku s file system is read-only but you can use the tmp and log directory from within your application folder

2543075
width	height
create a dynamic bubble that expands on height and width depending on the amount of text in the bubble

2543075
width	height
in a so article they described utilizing the measurestring function to figure out the exact width or height so dynamic changes in the .cs to the width and height can be accomplished

2543107
put	get
if you put the inline function s definition into a .cpp file and it if it is called from some other .cpp file you ll get an unresolved external error c++ faq lite from the linker

2543150

the members are protected but there are public getter setter so they re essentially public

2543175
cairngorm	flex
i m using flex with cairngorm framework

2543223
jar	war
instead of sepearate jar s for each project i built a single war directly with all the classes of all my projects

2543236
opera	google-chrome
opera and webkit based browsers google-chrome winsafari seem to fail

2543256
superclass	subclassing
so any late-bound reference to that name like the one you have in its super subclassagain call will of course get the subclassing that s masquerading by that name -- that subclassing s superclass is of course the real subclassagain whence the infinite recursion

2543256
base-class	subclassing
you can reproduce the same problem very simply without decoration just by having any subclassing usurp its base-class s name

2543262
versioning	upgrade

rdf	owl
rdf sparql itself is interesting because it gives you pretty rich querying right off the bat but when you add an owl ontology in it gets even better as it means that you can answer richer queries that ask questions closer to what the user â and their employer â really wants while allowing the service providers to express what they re offering more clearly too

the concepts of salting hmac etc are all fine with me - and want to store the users passwords either salt and hash hmac hash or hmac salt and hash - not sure what the best way will be - but in theory it won t matter as it will be able to change over time if required

2544745

all protected public page related controllers will extend the website controller

2545286
public	protected
one problem i have at the moment is that if both public and protected pages extend the website controller how do i avoid an infinite loop - for example the idea is that the website controller should handle authentication then redirect to the requested controller url but this will cause an infinite redirect loop so i need to come up with a better way of dealing with this

getter	setter	tostring	getter
you just have to type the annotations and include lombok s jar and it will generate getter setter hashcode and tostring methods and so forth

2548302
jquery	scriptaculous
mainly it s popular and heavily-utilized right now due to the proliferation of ajax and frameworks like jquery mootools protoypes scriptaculous and largely because browsers support is improving in compatibility performances and whatnot

2548350
inherited	properties
those provided by classes that inherited from caanimation are good for animating properties like color change 3d transformations etc

set width height to 0

2548550
innodb	myisam
innodb supports transactions and row locking whiles myisam doesn t

2548550
innodb	myisam
on the other hand myisam has support for full-text search which innodb doesn t support but you can get around that by building your own search capability using lucene or some other library

2548576
memset	memcmp	memcpy	memmove	memcpy	memcmp	memcpy	memset	memmove	memcmp	memmove	memset
there may also be hidden calls to memcpy memmove memset and memcmp which are in the libc so you may have to provide your own versions which is not hard at least as long as you are not too picky about performance

2548587
stdout	stderr
problem is i want to capture stderr stdout during both normal execution and after a timeout

2548587
stdout	stderr
can i retrieve the partial stderr stdout produced so far

2548703
lxml	elementtree
i ve heard good things about lxml as well which exposes an elementtree compatible api

2548717
innodb	myisam
if you don t want to use another engine you could create a shadow myisam copy of your innodb table and run the fulltext searches against that

2548717
innodb	myisam
with some appropriate triggers on the innodb table you could update the myisam copy relatively easy

2548739
put	get
unless there is a pressing reason not to i would extend map and use put and get instead of setvalue and getvalue

2548768
gridview	repeater
if you have a nested repeater or gridview too i m sure you need to alter mark brackett s answer to look like this or else you ll get a run-time error about not being able to find a control with the name of rpt

2548770
simplecursoradapter	autocompletetextview	put	get
i was using a simplecursoradapter to bind to the view but i discovered that there was no way i could get the id of the autocompletetextview from an onitemclicklistener which i needed to put additional information from the selected row in a variable depending on which autocompletetextview it was from

2548770
simplecursoradapter	autocompletetextview
so i subclassed simplecursoradapter and added an int to the constructor to identify which autocompletetextview the adapter was from and i was able to access this from the view passed into onitemclick

2548812
nsdateformatter	nsnumberformatter
this happens no matter if they re binding to a string a number with an nsnumberformatter applied or a date nsdateformatter applied

whenever you need to access an instance variable in another object you should have the instance variable declared as a property and when you declare a property you must always use synthesize to synthesize the getter and setter for that property

2549075
fadein	fadeout
i tried looking into jquery.support for the jquery ones but i find myself running into conceptual problems with it for fadein fadeout i think i should test for .support.opacity but that would be false in ie whereas ie6+ could still fairly render the fades

2549089
width	height
we ve tried a number of different things and the closest we ve come is hooking into the child control s sizechanged event and explicitly setting the scatterviewitem s width and height but this approach still has issues

2549112
children	parent
but if you think that you will often be working with the parent and children together in the same transaction and you want to save yourself some typing consider using cascade persist merge save-update

2549128

i don t mind doing it in two steps - a tool that first creates the cutout of the aiff wav then pass it to a mp3 encoder

2549312
folder	directory
which means that you should create a templates folder and a templates clean folder in the directory where you have put index.php and put your templates header.tpl body.tpl footer.tpl inside

stdout	stderr
you should have one or two separate threads reading stdout and stderr one if you merge them apart from the thread that calls process.exec waitfor destroy

2549633
int	chars
memset takes an int but interpreted as a unsigned chars as a second parameter

2549656
hash	md5
in that effort i overrode the methods the existing user db had md5 hash pwds

2549670
spweb	spsite
the top level site collection spsite is a container in which you have your root web spweb and subsites spwebs under spwebs - it takes a while to get used to the names

2549670
spweb	spsite
therefore a subsite will be any site spweb under the top level web site in a site collection spsite

2549737
ada	pascal
important derivatives of algol-60 include simula-67 and pascal and via pascal the ada modula and oberon families

2549737
turing	algol
all object-oriented languages have roots in simula-67 which was an algol derivative nygaard and dahl turing award winners

2549799
width	height
we modified the tep_image function to accept -1 which means it will only output a height or a width constraint but not both

2549822
rsa	dsa
my issue here was that keytool will use dsa algorithm unless you specify rsa

2549885
int	boolean
generally it is advisable to check everything against false first if the function returns values of different types such as int or boolean

2549901
lxml	celementtree	lxml	elementtree
elementtree and the faster compatible implementations in celementtree and lxml let you very easily extract information from xml -- as long as the xml is correct and your goals are well defined

2549917
filtering	grouping
i ve been asked to filtering this result by removing two specific grouping

2549917
filtering	grouping
it seems trivial but i can t seem to come up with a solid solution for storing the specific grouping i want to filtering out

2549917
filtering	grouping
my idea is to just create an array containing references to the two grouping i need to filtering out

2549917
filtering	grouping
my concern is that in the future they may ask to filtering out more grouping and maybe an array may not be a good idea

2549932
put	get
however i soon realised that the data refresh mechanism had been put in place simply because we had live and test as two applications running off the same database at one point as we wanted to get the website live as soon as possible

2549944
versioning	upgrade
that way you can track what versioning of the software is installed and you will have more control over the upgrade process

2549958
int	chars
i have a function m int i chars c which takes and returns a chars between -abc...xyz and also takes an int i

2549958
int	chars
i ve tried looking for patterns using consecutive chars and int inputs but have come up with nothing yet

2549992
free	malloc
match up malloc with free every time and you won t have memory leaks

2549997
google-chrome	firefox
it doesn t show in firefox or google-chrome if you manage to hone in exactly where the image should be you can find the image blank.gif which is used as the stand-in to place the background-url over

2550265
width	height
check its width and height values to see if it s roughly what you would expect the width and height of movieclipstack to be

2550288
fgets	atoi
also its good to use fgets atoi instead when reading numbers that way invalid numbers will not cause your program to potentially crash

2550309
folder	directory
i would like to store the names of each folder in a given directory

2550332
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the code below works in firefox safari google-chrome

2550340
filtering	grouping
if so you need to figure out what costs more the grouping by or filtering of the dates

2550359
oncreate	ondestroy
if your control is used with some ajax framework for example after ondestroy can be called oncreate without calling destructor

2550364
oursql	mysql-python
you don t use sqlalchemy instead of mysqldbâ you use sqlalchemy to access something like mysql-python oursql another mysql driver that i hear is nicer and has better performance the sqlite3 module psycopg2 or whatever other database driver you are using

2550395
hash	salt
you should use a hash username password and salt together like

2550395
hash	salt
that way your database is not vulnerable to any existing rainbow tables because of the salt and with the username hash along with the password it is also impossible to create a rainbow table for your specific hashing method

2550401
ssl	https
which can still be used to this day to undermine tls ssl used in https

2550422
pull	push
i can push pull at github correctly but i was using url provide by github

2550430
division	addition
also some operations are generally very simple such as addition and have an accelerated route through the processor and others such as division take much much longer

2550440
put	get
it has some pretty slick mechanisms for get put and ajax calls

2550445
dbvisualizer	toad
that means either scripting the query to include a line break or using another tool like toad dbvisualizer sql lob editor or some other third-party tool

2550464
cpu	processors
in general int is supposed to map a machine register size of the target cpu architecture s machine so that loading storing and operating on the int type data should translate directly into operations that use the target processors s native registers

2550464
subtraction	addition
there may also be a performance penalty associated with using longs caused by either wait states to load the 32 bits in multiple reads across a 16 bit data bus or caused by implementing long operations addition subtraction etc in software if the native hardware doesn t support such operations in hardware

2550481
punctuation	words
string will lead to boundary problems with the first and last words in the string or strings where the target words have punctuation or are hyphenated

2550570
google-chrome	firefox
this is working as intended in firefox but not in google-chrome chromium 5.0.356.0

min	max
run them all through a min-heap of size 100 for each input number k replace the current min m with max k m

2550655
floating-point	fixed-point
there is likely to be a significant difference in real-world speed between fixed-point and floating-point math but the theoretical best-case throughput of the alu vs fpu is completely irrelevant

2550655
floating-point	integer
instead the number of integer and floating-point registers real registers not register names on your architecture which are not otherwise used by your computation for-loop control the number of elements of each type which fit in a cache line optimizations possible considering the different semantics for integer vs

2550661
addslashes	multibyte
all i need to do is inject something like 0xbf27 and addslashes modifies this to become 0xbf5c27 a valid multibyte character followed by a single quote

2550661
addslashes	multibyte
this type of attack is possible with any character encoding where there is a valid multibyte character that ends in 0x5c because addslashes can be tricked into creating a valid multibyte character instead of escaping the single quote that follows

2550783
portrait	landscape
4 when 2 happens either user switch from portrait to landscape mode or portrait to landscape mode without or with pressing return button

2550798

2551196
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs unlike nearly every other filesystems is case-insensitive so it ll work fine if your file or directory has one capitalization and you re accessing it with another

2551214
rss	feed
i m trying to process a delicious rss feed via python

2551219
set	bag
a quick fix is to change your nhibernate mappings to use a bag instead of a set

2551284
fast-forward	merge	pull	push
yes after remote repository rejected push as non fast-forward you need to pull from remote repository this would do a merge which means that you might need to resolve merge conflict -- don t forget to commit merge conflict resolution in that case and then push again

2551284
fast-forward	merge
pull would fast-forward which means that there wouldn t be created any new merge commit

2551298

then in any webpage works on google-chrome firefox

2551545
jlist	jtable
there is also a feature to bind the classes to swing components including jtable and jlist but i haven t tried it

2551599
width	height
create dynamically separate uilabel for each character with height and width of one character in your view and put it s x y co ordinates position in arc type.

2551602
getter	setter
i know writing getter setter for all the member variables is en vogue in some languages whose advocates claim them to be much more oo than c++ but imo if you do so then this is not oo at all

2551627
int	double
in java all primitive types int double etc. are saved directly local variables of this type are released in this moment

2551657
int	double
i want to test if a number double x is an int power of 10

2551657
int	double
edit actually my solution does not work because double can be very big much bigger than int and also very small like fractions

2551743
hide	show
edit to show the one you click and hide the rest at the same time

2551813
goto	break
install the add-in alter all error-handling to on error goto 0 so that it will definitely break immediately on error then run the add-in and progressively comment out all xl2002 + commands as they are encountered choosing paths where variables default to false if an if command is encountered

2551833
hash	salt
generally speaking hashing only password is not very secure a random salt has to be appended to the password so that same passwords will produce different hash values

2551833
hash	salt
with that client will have to generate salt preferably using cryptographically secure algorithm compute hash of a resulting sting using compliant implementation of a well-known hashing algorithm and then send three pieces of information back to the server

2551852
rational-numbers	fractions
although not exactly an answer to your question i think we should mention here rational class suitable for keeping rational-numbers without the loss implied with storage of float-point numbers in form of fractions

2551860
ssl	https
best thing to do is hash the password on server and accept secure connections only ssl https

2551908
openmpi	mpich
use a higher level library that builds on openmpi mpich -- boost.mpi comes to mind

division	multiplication
currently i implement the multiplication and division process in two separate methods

2552046
division	multiplication
now there is some extra work behind the scenes but apart from the specific statements where the multiplication division occurs the rest of the code is identical

2552050
qspinbox	qpushbutton
the main window contains two qcheckboxes a qspinbox and a qpushbutton

2552087
division	multiplication
there might be a more generic solution but in this case i d use the fact that division is the same as multiplication by the inverse x c

2552096
google-chrome	firefox
hopefully the majority of methods and events are implemented on modern browsers such as google-chrome and firefox latest versions of course

2552101
post	get

2552288
width	height
you will instead create a bitmap of 200 pixels width and height which can actually be selected into the dc and be painted on

2552348
google-chrome	firefox
now in google-chrome and firefox it is 1px wider than the window causing an h scrollbar.

2552774
rdf	owl
whether rdf which can also be serialised in xml can be considered to be an ontology language is contentious rdf unlike owl does not give you access to the whole apparatus of first order description logic but allows you to construct things more akin to controlled vocabularies taxonomies etc...rather than formal ontologies

2552794
traceroute	packets
while it s hard to say without any additional information the best bet would be to install some packets sniffer â probably wireshark www.wireshark.org â and compare the icmp packets â what goes on the wire with your traceroute and what does the system usr bin traceroute or windows system32 tracert send

2552810
processors	work-stealing
by work-shrugging i mean pushing surplus work away from busy processors onto less loaded neighbours rather than have idle processors pulling work from busy neighbours work-stealing

but since we know that a won t be able to get the lock until b has had a time to executed and release the lock we d be better off if a just yielded immediately was put in a wait queue by the os and restarted when b has released the lock

2552838
rdf	owl
firstly an as has been pointed out before owl can be serialised in rdf

2552838
rdf	owl
secondly owl adds ontological capability to rdf which on its own only provides extremely limited capability for formal knownledge representation by providing the apparatus to define the components of your triple using formal computable first order description logic

2552838
rdf	owl
in effect this means that you can use an owl ontology as a schema for rdf which does not formally require schemata

2552871
ubuntu	linux
it looks like you re running linux so simply install the appropriate package for instance sudo apt-get install curl if you re on ubuntu

2552878

2552967
setinterval	clearinterval
and then as a complicating factor the loop has to use setinterval to start running and clearinterval to quit to allow other js code to run - but it s basically a polling loop nevertheless

opensuse	debian
whatever opensuse s package manager is called... for something like debian s build-essential package

google-chrome	firefox
ive tried on firefox ie and google-chrome

2553367
profiling	benchmarking

portrait	landscape
i have two views within one .xib one view for landscape another for portrait

2553924
dictionary	map
looking at my stl_util.h many of the classics deleter functions copy_if and also this one probably also quite common but i don t see it given in the responses so far for searching through a map and returning either the found value or a default ala get in python s dictionary

2553956

you would need to use javascript to hide show the hyperlinks instead

2554157
button	checkbox
the button is disabled by default until the user checks the checkbox

2554164
multiplying	division	multiplying	add	multiplying	multiplication	division	multiplication
if you use inheritance it means your multiplying and divide functions would have to be virtual which in the case of something as simple as multiplication or division would probably add significant overhead

2554203
getter	setter
and add the requisite instance variable getter setter on your marketresearchactionbean

2554205
button	checkbox
it seems like the validation should be attached to the checkbox not the button

2554212
button	checkbox	client-side	server-side
i think it would work if you enabled disabled the button on the checkbox server-side event rather than client side since the associated client-side validation code will be generated to run for validationgroup of the button

2554216
gas	att
which i think is this in att gas syntax

2554308
folder	directory
which tells biterscripting - give me all entries in folder folder with names that match the patten whose file type is f flat file not directory and whose file modification time fmtime is earlier than 1 hour

mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mousehover	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mousemove	mouseover	mouseenter	mousemove	mousehover	mousemove	mouseleave	mousemove	mouseenter	mousehover	mouseleave	mousehover	mouseenter
there is no on mouseover in winforms afaik there are mousehover and mousemove events but if you change image on those it will not change back so the mouseenter + mouseleave are what you are looking for i think

2554426
put	get
i would guess that the problem is that 42 isn t divisible by 4 and so they get out of alignment if you put several of these structs back to back allocate memory for several of them determining the size with sizeof

2554455
rss	feed
i am using xampp and was wondering if i can code my site to include rss feed

2554472

post	get
if you use a post or postback type of method then you run into the situation where a user can hit refresh and get the nasty form resubmission message

2554560
richfaces	tomahawk
to fix this you should rather use the jsf-supplied iterating components such as richfaces a4j repeat or facelets ui repeat or tomahawk t datalist

2554560
jstl	taglib
for the remnant of jstl tags only the functions taglib is useful in jsf all the other taglib are superflous in a jsf environment since it either provides the same functionality out of the box jstl core and format taglib or it simply doesn t suit in the mvc ideology jstl sql and xml taglib

2554605
rss	feed
you can create a rss feed and test it locally no problem

2554605

it does its job nicely on firefox 3.6 safari 4 google-chrome 5

2555212
udp	tcp
those who keep telling the poor guy to just use tcp ignore that there are good reasons why a reliable udp implementation would be used over tcp - and it s not datagram semantics which dead easy to layer on top of tcp

2555254
memcached	apc
the first is a opcode cache or memory cache such as apc eaccelerator xcache or memcached

2555321
comparator	comparable
you can use that and it will either use natural ordering node implements comparable or a comparator supplied in the constructor if you don t want that code inside your node class

2555325
comparator	comparable
if your node class already implements comparable you don t even need to define a new comparator as that order will be used by default

2555332
width	height
you ll run into issues obtaining correct width height with webkit browsers when it s set explicitly vs

i d like to have the title of my rss feed to do the same

2555654
lan	intranet
but if you have an intranet scenario - your company s lan environment - and you have .net clients calling your wcf service there s no reason at all not to use nettcp

2555674
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
you can also include svn path git path mercurial path or bazaar path in the pip requirements

2555688
int	double
my guess is that 2 in case2 is casting 5 + 6 to int and causing round of division to 5 then casted again to double and converted to 5.0

2555695
put	get	post	put	post	get
all data is access changed via standard http verbs get post put delete

2555701
int	double
int 11 2 5 under int arithmetic which you then cast to double in the assignment

2555713
coalesce	isnull
if var is null at the start an uninitialized value then you need a coalesce or isnull and you ll often use a separator

2555759
inherited	properties
this is some trivial examplecode the more realistic scenario is that i have a databasemodel separate from the viewmodel but for convenience i d like to inherited from the databasemodel add view-only properties and decorating the viewmodel with the attributes for the ui

2555761
int	double
to expand on marc s correct answer a bit whole numbers are interpreted as int whereas numbers with decimal points are interpreted as double

to list just some of the terms out there by no means exhaustive crimson xerces xalan jdom saxon xom jaxp

2555850
getter	setter
but the takeaway and you can tell from the il is that they re the getter and setter methods for dealing with arrays at the given index positions

2555875
tapestry	struts	tapestry	stripes	tapestry	wicket	struts	stripes	struts	wicket	wicket	stripes	jsf	tapestry	jsf	stripes	jsf	wicket
there are basically two categories of frameworks component based jsf wicket tapestry gwt and action based struts stripes webworks spring

2555875
jsf	wicket
wicket just like jsf a component-based framework

2555918
vb.net	vb6
1 they must be compatible with projects developed in visual basic 6.0 the old vb6 emphatically not vb.net

2555940
vim	textmate
the guy who is running the site switched from textmate to vim and hosts very good and concise casts on specific vim topics

2555956
getter	setter
i have the appropriate getter and setter but only the first newrecnum shows up the other two are null

2555970
post	put
i think that you need to tell the form tag helper you want to use put instead of post

2555983
ami	rightscale
the centos ami s prepared by rightscale are probably sufficient

2556008
width	height
you should use height and width instead of padding

2556036
uitableview	reloaddata
i would set a few breakpoints and make sure that the reloaddata is really being called on the right uitableview and that cellforrowatindexpath is called as a result of the reloaddata

2556056
vbscript	jscript
your task can be easily scripted using windows script host languages -- vbscript or jscript

2556056
vbscript	jscript
as for the timestamp the problem is that neither vbscript nor jscript have built-in functions that would format the date in the format you need so you will have to write the code for doing this yourself

2556061
pop-up	dialog
when i do the above though and click on the hyperlink an annoying blank window pop-up with my download dialog box behind it

2556079
pull	push
if you can ssh to each others computers you can do git push pull to each other s computers

2556082
rdf	owl
i m considering storing the content of a web app in an rdf or owl ontology instead of an rdbms

2556109
pull	push
i would suggest using a central repository location that you can all push and pull from via ssh

2556110
uiviewcontroller	uipopovercontroller
you get control of the box inside of the box the uiviewcontroller inside of the uipopovercontroller but you have very limited control over the actual popover itself

2556123
bash	subshell
also you might want to check out the bracket-style command blocks of bash they are always executed in a subshell thus not altering the current environment and are more powerful as well

2556180
put	get
during the buildexecutor method first get the command from a map and if the command doesn t exist in map then try to load the associated class and put it in the map

2556219
pop-up	dialog
i was creating a new project when the pop-up dialog appeared

2556245
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
so for example 1 salt hash is md5

2556251
inherited	properties
value inherited requires a properties getter to do something

2556251
inherited	properties
the fact that properties values can be either local or inherited means that instead of values being stored in fields they re stored as dictionary entries

2556262
jar	war
i have a custom tag packaged into a library jar that is included in my web apps war file

2556262
jar	war
i ve confirmed that the jar is in the war and that the tag file is in the jar and the that the tld in meta-inf expressly defines widgetfactory

min	max
i need to make some square items and there can be a max of 5 per row and a min of 1 per row

2556327
accessor	properties
i think you may be creating an alias to your internal limit list via the get_limit properties accessor

2556364

2556436
for-loop	arrays
in the advanced for-loop there is no way to access the hidden counter and neither is there to perform a write access on the corresponding arrays slot

2556437
getter	setter
the snippet of code from the object only contains the important functions everything else is not important getter setter etc ...

2556464
for-loop	arrays
the advanced for-loop doesn t expose the counter to you and hence you cannot write the result of counter++ to the specific arrays slot

2556467
min	max
for info this is how the linq max min implementations work and likewise

2556526
mp3	ogg
however there s something to be said for also offering high-quality 300kbps mp3 or ogg vorbis files

2556538
versioning	upgrade
i m working with an older versioning of rails and activerecord that does not have the primary_key option in has_many relationships of more recent activerecord versioning and unfortunately i don t get to control when we upgrade

2556756
tcpdf	fpdi
i am using tcpdf with fpdi s bridge

2556826
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you put .asenumerable before the .select c# will use the ienumerable select over the iqueryable select

2556826
ienumerable	iqueryable
the ienumerable select executes the selector once for each item returned from the source ienumerable the iqueryable select passes the selector to the linq provider - which in the case of linq2sql tries to generate the equivalent sql

2556843
folder	directory
open the basketballteams.xcodeproj folder either in finder with control click show contents of package or cd down into the directory with terminal and delete the files that begin with your username i.e felipe

this test in particular does not apply any transformations that parent nodes may have that also need to be applied to their children

in creating your own memory management system now that you have learned what memset does and doesn t hopefully already knowing enough of the low level stuff that you know the difference between memcpy and memmove your next step is to learn about alignment and about the guarantees that malloc fulfills but your code doesn t

2558818
free	malloc
the call to free will put the memory block that had been allocated by malloc back onto data structures that the c runtime maintains for the heap in this case something that might be called the free-list

hash	md5
in the following code i use getfiles to retrieve all the files in a given directory and for each file use md5 to hash its contents check if this value already lives in a dictionary if yes it s a duplicate and i ll delete it

you can optimize this routine a bit by calculating md5 hash only once it s either typo in the question or you re really doing so twice

2558923
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the longer answer is that firefox google-chrome and opera all have good standards compliance so if it works in one it s very likely to work in the others

2558940
integer	unsigned
treat the 8 bytes as a 64-bit unsigned integer and convert it to decimal and pad it to the left with zeroes

m2e	pom.xml	maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml
the configuration of maven projects in eclipse is derived by m2e from the metadata contained in the poms so if you have two projects projecta and projectb and you want to have projectb as dependency of projecta you need to declare projectb as such in the pom.xml of projecta to add a dependency

2559264

the reason for this is that path does not include the current directory . because doing so would be a security risk folder with a ton of files in them including a fake ssh which could then intercept your password or the like

2559305
pop-up	dialog
you might be able as you say to query the iframe s status somehow but i wouldn t know a defined way to do this there will be no onload event because no document will be loaded - once the browser receives the information to expect a file download it will pop-up the save as dialog and leave the iframe s context completely

2559422
min	max
they are validated inside the businessobjects with custom validation like min max values etc

2559525

obviously there are 4 possible fax orientation portrait landscape x 2 kinds of rotations

i have a spinner view that s populated through a simplecursoradapter

2559641
getter	setter
i recently read that getter setter are evil and i have to say it makes sense yet when i started learning oop one of the first things i learned was encapsulate your fields so i learned to create class give it some fields create getter setter for them and create constructor where i initialize these fields

2559641
getter	setter
and every time some other class needs to manipulate this object or for instance display it i pass it the object and it manipulate it using getter setter

2559661
getter	setter
i haven t yet read the full article but afaiu the basic point is that one should not unnecessarily publish class fields via mindlessly added or generated getter and setter

2559661
getter	setter
you ll do it you eliminate the vast majority of getter setter methods in

2559695
getter	setter
allen holub made a big splash with why getter and setter methods are evil back in 2003

2559696
getter	setter
encapsulate your fields so i learned to create class give it some fields create getter setter

2559696
getter	setter
clearly fussy getter and setter aren t essential

2559696
getter	setter
python folks use properties sometimes to create a getter and setter functions that look like a simple attribute

2559696
getter	setter
private methods explicit getter and setter etc

2559696
getter	setter
as we say use the source luke and we re all adults here. we re all able to see the source we don t need to be fussy about piling on getter and setter to provide yet more hints as to how the api works

as ffmpeg is supporting amr encoder decoder its giving error

2559746
width	height
error while opening encoder for output stream #0.0 - maybe incorrect parameters such as bit_rate rate width or height

2559755
getter	setter
if you have getter and setter you don t have encapsulation

2559755
getter	setter
this has quite a complicated internal representation yet has no getter or setter and only one element of the representation is probably exposed simply by returning its value size

2559809
getter	setter
adding different getter and setter methods for concrete implementations will pollute the client code that uses these entities like lots of dynamic_casts to call required getter and setter methods

2559809
getter	setter
therefore getter and setter methods may remain where they are but you should protected client code

2559856
post	get
- notice http and i click a login link there it shows a small html div with login form like a litebox .now as i am on a non ssl page http the data which i post does not get encrypted and posted to the process action

i don t want to have getter and setter methods

min	max
what i want to do is get the slider values as 0 1 2 3 4 etc if say i set the min as 0 and max as 5

2559922

template method is rational if you have a class hierarchy and base class defines protected operation steps in its public template method

2559962
getter	setter
first add two properties to the bean confirmuser and emailid of course with getter and setter

2559998
accessor	properties
make a static properties of a class and in the get accessor have a check if the private static counterpart is null and if so build it else return it

it s no more of a performance bottleneck than using actual getter and setter no matter what optimisations happen

you will still need to type plenty of text to add value to what it is your class method properties actually does but ghostdoc is a great way to generate the basic scaffolding cross references inherited hierarchy and interface details in code documentation

2560535

testing something like an ajax autocomplete widget meant forking some of the code depending on ie or firefox and i still can t get typekeys or a combination of type with typekeys to work in safari

2560583
listener	eventhandler
so if you re dispatching your custom event in the project class that contains the _zoom mc and projectappear has a reference to both project and to _board then inside projectappear you can add an event listener to project for the custom event myproject.addeventlistener mycustomevent eventhandler etc.... and in the eventhandler function which will have a reference to both _board and project since it s in projectappear you can do whatever you need to with _board

hide	show
i have a combobox in a view that receives information about application state changes and then is supposed to show or hide it s children based on the whole application state

2560878
hide	show
essentially all it needs to do is hide a combobox during one state and show it again during another state

2560929
folder	directory
obviously in this case the call could return more than one item if there was more than one folder named test in your directory tree

place #undef max and #undef min just before the function and try again

2561460
children	parent
i suppose it s wrong to say it is inherited the opacity is applied to the parent div and the children are part of that so attempting to override it for the child elements doesn t work because technically they are opaque

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in all modern browsers firefox safari google-chrome ie8

2561473
getter	setter
now you can add to accessor s constructor function pointers or better - functors - to call as getter setter in any way seems right to you

2561473
getter	setter
the following example assumes the setter function return bool to convey agreement to setting the new value and the getter can just modify it on it s way out

lest the emacs zealots completely disregard my whole post on account of that last parenthetical comment i feel i must describe the root of the difference between the emacs and vim religions

2562090
vim	emacs
the emacs zealots will claim that emacs has viper mode and so it is a superset of vim

for example if you clicked the new button which leads to some text being inserted into a qtextedit you still need to call qtextedit s setwindowmodified function - which will then propagate up to your qmainwindow - and you can just check qmainwindow afterwards

2562432
for-loop	arrays
i m generating these arrays with a for-loop

2562434

another issue i have no insight in your db design but it looks like that tags should go into an own table and then relating either via one-to-many or many-to-many relationship

2562860
width	height
since you said grid that means that the height and width will be fixed

2562860

post	get
2 you can also call mwebview.reload but be aware this reposts a page if the request was post so only works correctly with get

2563509

folder	directory
if the .hgignore file is in your user profile directory userprofile .hgignore then edit your mercurial.ini which should also be in your user profile folder to have this

2564304
disk	ram
fstat should always be very fast since the kernel should already have the data you re asking for in ram as it needs to access it for the file to be in the open state and the kernel won t have to go through the trouble of traversing the path of the filename to see if each component is in ram or on disk and possibly reading in a directory from disk but likely not having to only to discover that it has the data that you are asking for in ram

2564312
hash	salt
in the client it will use the key as a salt then hash together with the password and send back to the server

2564312

2565719
directwrite	direct2d
but if you do not need support of windows xp you may try to use direct2d with directwrite and directx10 i didn t try 11

2565719
direct3d	direct2d
i tried them and they shown good results you only should avoid often switching between direct2d and direct3d contexts because it may seriously degrade performance

2565736
strcpy	strncpy
for similar reasons one should use strncpy in place of strcpy and strncat in place of strcat

2565736
cout	cin	ostringstream	getline	ostringstream	std
personally i use the c++ iostreams library std cin std cout the and operators std getline std istringstream std ostringstream etc. so i do not typically deal with that

2565736
getchar	fgetc	strtol	fgetc	strtol	getchar
if i were forced to use pure c though i would personally just use fgetc or getchar in combination with strtol strtoul etc

2565742
strcpy	strncpy
some people would claim that strcpy and strcat should be avoided in favor of strncpy and strncat

2565744
strcpy	strncpy
use strncpy instead and not strcpy for example

2565769
getter	setter
note the setter and getter above correspond to elements declared in your schema

2565794
int	chars
well if you interpret an int as a chars in c you ll get that ascii chars as long as it s in range

2565797
put	get
in general to see what s going on with your layout you can put in your preamble and then stick layout in your document to get a diagram and listing of geometry settings

2565800
readonly	temporary
naturally if you re needing the readonly immutable feature of tuples that is a fair argument but given the op question this should ve been done with lists instead -- note how there is extra code to either pull the tuple apart and put the resulting one together and or the need to temporary convert to a list and back

2565819
getter	setter
property getter and setter is a mean of encapsulation and ivar is an implementation detail

2565831
strcpy	strncpy
there are several problems encountered when strncpy and strncat are used as safe versions of strcpy and strcat

2565841
hash	md5
just get a md5 sha1 hash of the integer s byte representation

2565861
prng	random
to work around this you can pick a initial value for c that is not constant based of the secret key by just asking the prng after init with seed for a random byte

2565865
post	get	pull	push
read-only operations like pull and clone use get requests only but write operations like push use post

2565915
inherited	properties
the compiler can then verify that whatever t is being passed in it will inherited from event and contain the datetime properties

2565963
qpushbutton	qwidget
so what i would like to know is why is it that i can change the background color of a widget if i simply create a qwidget object or a subclass of qpushbutton but not when i create a subclass of qwidget

2566004
hide	show
i am creating an application in which when app launches the edittextfield getfocus automatically and the keyboard pop-up.i want to hide the keyboard by default and show when edittextfield get focus

i have a 128bit unsigned integer a and a 64bit unsigned integer b

2566023
post	get
if you load that page without cookies you get a post form

2566023
post	get
perhaps you should send that post data first get the cookies and then use those cookies for the rest of the session

2566057
vim	notepad++	komodo	notepad++
i ve integrated this rule to every editor i use notepad++ komodo vi vim visual studio 2005 in order to have a visual guideline showing this limit

2566075

switching	screens
now the screens was almost always gray and only occasionally did the blue color come through demonstrated by timer2 switching the doublebuffered property every 2000 milliseconds

2566135
width	height
ok still leaves the issue of i hear there is a 100 height problem and my horizontal borders wont stay the correct width

2566196
margin	height
then add a negative margin half the height of the image to align it vertically and put a position of top 50

2566197
client-side	server-side
it doesn t matter what as long as your client-side javascript and server-side php agree on one encoding

2566210
equals	tostring
case classes mean i get tostring and equals for free.

2566254
width	height
you d have to be careful with the width height parameters and the css you apply

2566288
strcpy	strncpy
it is probably worth adding again that strncpy is not the general-purpose replacement for strcpy that it s name might suggest

2566290
width	height
it is not fixing the width and height and spread until the all text appears

2566292
integer	unsigned
although b 64-bit integer can be stored in an unsigned long long int variable it is needed to put bits of b into another array in order to work on a and b efficiently

2566299
width	height
you need to specify the width and height in px

2566360
pop-up	dialog
i have a html page and when i click a file link on the page the file download dialog pop-up and this file dialog locks the page

2566372

the margin widths of the items in the cells in the signuptable1 are percentages of the cell width in ff but percentages of the screen width in ie6

2566410
google-chrome	firefox
it is same in firefox and also google-chrome

2566510
trie	tree
you should use a trie aka a prefix tree to build a tree-like structure that allows you to easily walk through your strings in an ordered manner by comparing their prefixes

2566510
trie	tree
you can build the trie as a tree of directories on your file system obviously not the one which the data is coming from

2566528
remoteview	appwidgetprovider
in your appwidgetprovider when you create your remoteview instance to do an update you pass in a layout id to the constructor

2566566
width	height
if it is you could simply store width and height of the area tile length and an array of integers representing the vertex height

2566570
division	multiplication
you can use the division version of russian peasant multiplication

2566580
width	height
try using the window.resizeto width height function

2566592
int	chars
what we need is but i found a shorter way of converting each chars to string which is to concat something else to it in this case an int 0 hence

2566626
folder	directory
for netbackup the binaries that analyze the directory in clients perform some type of listing that timeouts by the enormous quantity of files in every folder about one million per folder sap work directory

2566763
postgresql	mysql
also if you open to moving away from mysql i ve found that postgresql has much better resolution of deadlocks

2566888
stdout	stderr
i d like to have a macro in visual studio 2005 that calls a dos command and redirects the output stdout and stderr to a file

2566888
stdout	stderr
capturing both stderr and stdout to a file during that call

2566970

the standard solution for something like this is to look at slony londiste or bucardo

2566996
post	put
just wanted to put an update on this post

2567076
width	height
summing that up with the height and width dividing it with 2 gives me the correct value

2567078
google-chrome	firefox
it is failing in firefox 3.6.2 and ie 8 but working in google-chrome 4.1

serializable	deserialization
i m interested in the benefits of having an established framework to perform orm but i m curious as to the performance costs of using it against standard xml serializable and deserialization

2567180
actionscript	mxml
the problem is that the mxml component is being created before the actionscript is run

2567184
google-chrome	firefox
nevertheless you might try using speed tracer in google-chrome or firebug in firefox though it doesn t have quite as detailed timing information to see what s taking the time

2567197
button	checkbox
when i use the report button i get a screen with a feedback field and a checkbox for include system data

2567209
width	height
it s width and height are increased by way too much

2567221
profiling	benchmarking
once you have designed a class whose interface you d like to use you can experiment with very different implementation approaches and benchmarking them on a workload that s representative of your usage pattern so you can find out what s best for you assuming table manipulation and lookup are a big part of your application s runtime of course -- to find out profiling your app

2567221
profiling	benchmarking
and by now i have evolved it independently of the actual application-level parts but based on profiling and benchmarking thereof to completely different implementations currently based on numpy

2567221
profiling	benchmarking
once you have the code working then comes the right time for profiling benchmarking and -- just perhaps -- internal optimization of the implementation

2567279
versioning	upgrade
our clients are all using some versioning of the product but not all use the same versioning and they will not all be upgrade at the same time

2567283
stdout	stderr
in dos or 1 is stdout and 2 is stderr

2567326
put	get
just for example if you re designing a program that will get data from one database or some source anyway massage it as needed and then put the result into another chances are that you re going to start by thinking about database schemas data flow and data encoding formatting probably in about that order

2567327
versioning	upgrade
then you could just change the ssis package their job calls when they upgrade to the new versioning

2567332
dynamicmethod	reflection.emit
get the dynamicmethod s methodbuilder and use reflection.emit to add the opcodes for incrementing the field

2567340
stdout	stderr
if your script is invoked with 2 1 at the end backticks invocation will return stdout stderr

2567342
hex	binary
since the hexadecimal representation can encode any arbitrary binary values it might be possible to shrink the string by compressing them before taking the hex values

2567384
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
in any case you could use objectinputstream and objectoutputstream to pass directly objects between clients and server

2567403
opera	firefox
it works in firefox but nothing else - no webkit ie opera

2567414
serializable	deserialization
these hl7 cda files are xml files with a defined xml schema so i used xsd.exe to generate .net classes for xml serializable and deserialization

2567414
serializable	deserialization
i tried implementing ixmlserializable on the strucdocparagraph class so that i could control the deserialization and serializable of the content but it s rather complex since there are so many classes involved and i didn t come to a solution yet because i don t know if the effort pays off

2567430
pull	push
we re using a central repo on a server with push pull for our integration build

2567437

i had a similar situation where we regularly push out separate client versioning newer versioning tend to have extra columns and we can t force users to upgrade to the latest versioning

2567447
google-chrome	safari
both run modified webkit the base of google-chrome and safari based browsers

2567451
next	except
this puts the i th item of indices at the very end shifting all following items of indices one to the left and indicates that the next time we come to this item of cycles we ll be swapping the new i th item of indices from the left with the n - i th one from the right -- that would be the i th one again except of course for the fact that there will be a

2567451
for-loop	loops
but now we haven t broken off the for-loop so we continue by decrementing the next -to-last in this case the first -- which gives a minor event one swap in the indices and we break the inner loops again

2567461
accessor	properties
the view controllers view properties accessor will handle retaining and releasing for you

2567817
min	max
set the sliders min and max to 0-100 and add this to your data class

2567858
min	max
min max functions

2567860
move	drag
other than that you just have to hide the panel again when the drag and drop is complete or move out of the datagridview

2567870
inherited	properties
i think the cleanest way to do this would be to create a usercontrol that inherited directly from trackbar that hides the value smallchange minimum maximum and tickfrequency properties with same-named double properties

2567889
innodb	myisam
there are multiple mysql databases which are either innodb or myisam note each database is either innodb or myisam for a reason

there are several servers as you mention like tomcat jetty but also bigger servers which cover larger parts of the java ee standard like glassfish and jboss

2567919
client-side	server-side
in particular if you can tell me if my theory is correct about providing a client-side app that communicates with server-side web services or if i m totally going in the wrong direction

2567957
inherited	properties
now this properties is inherited by jobview and activityview but if i need reference to ijobviewpresenter object in these derived classes then i need to type cast ibasepresenter properties to ijobviewpresenter or iactivitypresenter which i want to avoid or create jobviewpresenter and activityviewpresenter on derived classes as shown above

min	max
if you want your new min to be 0 and your new max to be 255 then that equation would stretch the contrast accordingly

2568207
min	max
the original_min and original_max do not have to be the actual min and max of the entire image the could be the min and max of a subsection of the image if you want to enhance a particular area and don t mind clipping values above or below your new_min new_max

2568207
range	max	range	min	min	max
i suppose if you already know your range and so forth you could incorporate that formula into a 4x4 matrix to achieve your goal but only after you ve done a pass to find the min and max of the original image

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am attempting to add a small margin to the bottom of the legend element this works just fine in firefox 2 and 3 as well as ie 5-8 however in safari and google-chrome adding a margin does nothing

2568592
folder	directory
the problem is not that the filesystem is not able to store so many files in a directory but that if you want to access that directory using windows explorer it will take forever so if you will ever need to access manually to that folder you should segment it for example with a directory per each 2-3 first letters numbers of the name or even a deeper structure

2568655
google-chrome	firefox
also please note that this occurs in firefox but not google-chrome

2568716

also this post describes how to get automatic deployments when tests pass

2568810
min	max
on the other hand in many situations where the problem is phrased as choose a random number between 1 and 6 it might be more natural to use randint 1 6 instead of writing randrange 1 7 or randrange min max + 1

2568825

if you determine that it isn t feasible or decide to go in a different direction you ve put in less effort to get the decision

2568868
getter	setter
xaml does not understand normal property getter and setter when it comes to attached properties

2568881
google-chrome	firefox
i d recommend developing in firefox or google-chrome first then tweaking if needed for ie

2568909
disk	ram
if there is any cardinal rule to optimizing scalability cost it is that you want enough ram to fit everything you need to serve on a regular basis because this will always get you more throughput than disk access no matter how clever you try to be about it

2568909
disk	ram
well i don t have a lot of experience at extreme scales but if you have any disk io contention then you definitely need more ram

2569002
ssl	https
i m very new to https ssl so excuse my lack of knowledge

2569044
subtraction	addition
even simple operations addition subtraction are not immune to float rounding issues

2569045
put	get
if you put everything into a purely event based system there s no guarantee that the ais won t get more cpu time than your user or the other way round unless you have some control over thread priorities and even then you re apt to have difficulty keeping timing consistent

2569046
boost	allocator
however it seems like we could save the overhead of allocator shared_ptr s reference counts and such separately if we could move that data inside implementation somehow like boost s intrusive containers do

2569057
hash	hmac	hash	salt
checksums are for generating checksums hmac is perhaps the preferred way for generating salt hash of strings requiring securing hashing

versioning	upgrade
first upgrade to the newest versioning of the snmp library if there is one

2569138
implements	extends
both post and postonepointone will implements the ipost interface they are not extends an abstract class because that inheritance breaks the wsdl though i suppose there may be a way around that via some fancy xml serialization tricks

2569147
versioning	upgrade
most of the rest of that script takes care of the multiple versioning of repositories they maintain allowing the user to disable it without getting pissed off at you and gracefully handling an os upgrade that disables third-party repos

2569181
versioning	upgrade
you ll forget you did upgrade the versioning and bam changes are gone

2569184
tabcontrol	tabitem
this style s automatically applied to whatever container element the control generates for its items - so if the itemscontrol you re using is a listbox it will apply it to the listboxitem and if it s a tabcontrol it ll get applied to the tabitem and so on

currently i m only testing firefox 3.6 opera 10.10 and safari 4.0.3

2569185
firefox	safari
i ve started with a fairly simple test and can confirm no memory leaks in firefox and safari

2569185
firefox	safari
in firefox and safari reloading the page does not use any further memory and all memory is returned when the window tab is closed

2569185
firefox	safari
in firefox and safari and very possibly other browsers if there s no window.onunload handler then memory is only reclaimed when the window is closed

2569191
width	height
i am currently using formattedtext to determine the width and height of my richtextbox but the measurements it is providing me with are too small--specifically two characters in width too small

2569193
put	get
the catch is that to measure the impact you need to look at it differently - instead of how much time does a single query to fetch an image takes ask yourself how much time does a series of put a reasonable number here queries to get the same set of images takes

2569194
rss	feed
if you re part of the etherpad open source community you might want to subscribe to the rss feed for questions tagged etherpad just in case this catches on

easymock	powermockito	mockito	easymock
you can use a mock library like mockito or easymock +classpath to create a mock file object newer libs have classloader extensions that let you mock concrete classes like file or can cooperate with something like powermockito see blog and have a mock generated for the constructor call and throw the appropriate exception when called

2569330
goto	break
however break are there for flow control they are much clearer as to what they do than goto so i would recommend using them

2569384
put	get
if i then put it as an array ie i then get a different error message

2569388
fflush	gets
the content-length header only gets set if the entire response is buffered if you never fflush or if you set it yourself

right now i m using md5 which doesn t generate case-sensitive hash

2569525
pascal	delphi
the reason is that delphi or more specifically turbo pascal originally didn t have the notion of exit break continue or assert

2569531
dictionary	map
key value an associative array also associative container map mapping dictionary finite map and in query-processing an index or index file is an abstract data type composed of a collection of unique keys and a collection of values where each key is associated with one value or set of values

2569546
cldc	midp
in my experience ibm s j9 is the best - i ve used it to support midp cdc apps but the profile configuration combinations supported include midp and personal profile and both cldc and cdc foundation

2569604
put	get
try get netbeans_midp_components_basic.jar off your friend s pc under and put it in your own install in the same path

2569609
width	height
i should be able to query the data structure for what rectangles are at point x y or what rectangles intersect rectangle x y width height

2569647
haskell	scheme
for what it s worth the arbitrary precision integers in ghc haskell and gnu guile scheme are both implemented using gmp and the fastest implementation of the pidigits benchmark on the language shootout is based on gmp

2569648
hibernate	gilead
right so i am working with hibernate gilead and gwt to persist my data on users and files of a website

2569650
lwjgl	jogl
i imagine that other languages like clojure jython could also handle this request -- either through lwjgl or jogl

2569655
width	height
edit the idea here is that every object will have a different width and height so the array i use to represent that object will be unique to the object but once that array is defined preferably in the constructor it will not change

2569655
width	height
and the values of width and height for a particular object are known at compile time

2569671
width	height
in that case an array with dimensions matching the height and width of your display might suffice with each element in the array being a presumably short list of the rectangles on that pixel

2569678
hash	md5
another idea i ve had is that it is not the direct result of cryptencrypt but a result of the rasessionid in the md5 hash

2569695
fflush	gets
a standard mutex won t work since i run the risk of having the main thread grab the mutex before the data gets fflush to the database

2569697
exif	xmp
that s backing up exif makernotes iptc xmp etc whether at the beginning or end of the file

2569728
folder	directory
i point coverstory to the objects-normal directory in my builds folder and it complains that there s nothing there for it to read

2569754
range	minimum
it manages large memory blocks efficiently particularly at the 4k virtual memory page size and 64k virtual memory address range minimum sizes

2569763
client-side	server-side
i m wondering about this in the context of both server-side and client-side data validation

2569767
config	ini
i have googled and combed php ini and apache config but i cannot find what that directive setting might be

2569789
portrait	landscape
0 when vertical portrait + -90 when horizontal landscape both of which are obtained from the device gravity vector components

2569792
put	get
the simplest way to do that imho is to get rid of the standard title bar in the element in the manifest and put your own title bar at the top of the activity

2569794
put	get
when you get the file read put it into a normal class and just bind to the class or use the list of items you have to do custom stuff with the combobox

2569865
passenger	thin
tune a production deployment passenger thin apache etc

2569890
vbscript	jscript
you could also choose to use vbscript or jscript rather than perl and you wouldn t need to worry about installing any additional software

2569895
post	get
i know that i can use request.form.get variable to get post variables and in my handlers for url variables but that s as much as the documentation will tell me

2569915
google-chrome	firefox
yeah this works in firefox and google-chrome but for some reason wont work in ie 8

2569951
post	put
put recent_posts_by_user for view name recent post by user for description and node for view type

2569962
terminate	timeout
mysql terminate a connection after 8 hour timeout

2569977
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome - launches special firefox profile with elevated security privileges to bypass javascript security errors

2570001
stdout	stderr
i have a native dll which outputs via stdout stderr

2570001
stdout	stderr
i have a c# console application which calls this dll and outputs binary data to a parent c# application which started the c# console exe processing stdout stderr

2570022
poe	anyevent
if you want to do event-driven programming take a look at one of the cpan event modules such as poe coro or anyevent before you invent your own thing

2570033
bazaar	git
first thing get to know a version control system subversion git bazaar mercurial are some examples

2570038
goto	break
however it allows using labels and using break or continue with label instead of goto

2570051
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome works fine but in ie7 sometimes returns the value into the label sometimes not

2570074
int	double
loop through the int in the range of those two int s like you re doing with your floats. for each one find the cube root and square root and store them in double

2570107
filesystems	ntfs
the paper goes into plenty of detail on the topic of storing blobs in the filesystems ntfs vs

2570112
fputs	gets
and when i run it in xcode i get an exc_bad_access when it gets to the first fputs

2570118
setinterval	settimeout
and setinterval is like settimeout except it repeats a code repeatedly

2570141
google-chrome	firefox
i have some code here which works perfectly in firefox but not in google-chrome or ie

2570150
disk	ram
of course you can also store the various data elements in a db table disk or ram between views.

2570154
google-chrome	firefox
i think google-chrome and firefox interpret it differently when you assign both a left and right property

2570170
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox google-chrome ie 8

2570199
put	get
i would use a single file to get and put the serialized string

2570200
vbo	pbo
if this is a one-time operation though i d go with copying it over to a pbo and then binding into gl_array_buffer and then just using it as a vbo

2570223
free	malloc
in c++ using delete to free memory obtained with malloc doesn t necessarily cause a program to blow up

2570224
free	malloc
in c++ using delete to free memory obtained with malloc doesn t necessarily cause a program to blow up

2570230
folder	directory
i use the nshomedirectory function to get the app s home folder and write to the documents directory within that

2570265
int	double
the first class is called measuredparams and it s got 40+ numeric fields height weight waistsize wristsize - some int but mostly double

2570270
innodb	myisam
inserting into a blob is 2x to 8x faster on myisam than on innodb

2570270
hex	binary
using a hex coded string bin2hex into a x ... uses more memory on average than using an escaped binary string mysql_real_escape_string on the raw data

2570270
innodb	myisam
- this seems true for both myisam and innodb

2570270
innodb	myisam
the binary string is faster on myisam but the hex-coded data is faster on innodb

2570298
getter	setter
fortunately the .net client library has been updated with a getter and setter for this parameter although the methods are undocumented in the .net developer s guide

2570341
width	height
this will be something like pixel size min height width 2

2570375
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can watch them for the mouseenter event and if no mouseleave event fires within x milliseconds show your tooltip

2570375
mouseleave	mouseenter
it also provides hover which is just a convenience means of hooking up mouseenter and mouseleave handlers. although this means you re hooking up a lot of event handlers since mouseenter and mouseleave don t bubble mdash

2570375
mouseover	mouseout
you may well be better off tracking mouseover mouseout at the document level and handling the complexities that arise since they do bubble

2570394
easymock	jmock
if it is just for a sake of unit-test developers should apply dependency inject pattern in their coding and take advantages from mocking tools such as easymock or jmock to circumvent dependencies

2570415
onclicklistener	ontouch	gridview	onclientclick
i want to replace the onclicklistener and the onclientclick method with their touch equivalents touchlistener and ontouch so that when i touch an element in the gridview the image of the element changes and a double touch on the same element takes it back to the orginal state

2570440
post	get
so for instance you can simulate post or get request

2570489
apache	nginx
if not are there some standard headers to pass in that will accomplish that in common web servers i m thinking nginx or apache

2570495
freemarker	velocity
put the constants into a properties object then create an xml file template using velocity freemarker or an equivalent java compatible templating language that expands the properties values into the xml

2570496
folder	directory
which pulls down the directory structure properly and adds the folder foo src mylib which is a local mercurial repository

2570542
subtract	add
add subtract a random number to the lat lng values stored with each user and add a translucent circle around the icon

2570549
rubygems	bundler
rails hosting on shared hosts is already a minefield but throwing in rails 3 in all its pre-release goodness including bundler reinventing the rubygems workflow is a recipe for pulling your hair out

2570550
action-filter	onactionexecuting
write a custom action-filter override onactionexecuting and apply the filter to all your controllers

2570554
free	malloc
new and delete are dealing with construction destruction for which part of their work is the effectively calling malloc and free - malloc and free are raw memory allocation deallocation

2570566
free	malloc
if you use them to allocate plain old data such that the constructor destructor are trivial they are unlikely to differ at all significantly in speed from malloc free

2570566
free	malloc
really all they do aside from calling on to malloc free is execute type s constructor destructor multiple times for arrays

2570593
free	malloc
if the constructors and destructors are empty like for built-ins new and delete shouldn t be slower than malloc and free are

2570593
free	malloc
if they are it s often due to the fact that common implementations call malloc free under the hood so they are a wrapper around them

2570614
free	malloc
the compiler could certainly associate a bit of data with each pointer saying allocated with new or allocated with malloc or unknown and when it found a free or a delete if the allocation didn t match it could issue a warning

2570640
subtract	add
so it wouldn t be too hard for me to brute-force the damn thing by simply checking the precedence within the array if the symbol is smaller than the next symbol in the exampe xiv if i is smaller than v in which case it would be because i have ordered them in the array then i could make it subtract the value instead of add

2570649
subtract	add
moving to the left add the values as long as they increase or remain the same and subtract when they decrease

2570702
free	malloc
in c++ using delete to free memory obtained with malloc doesn t necessarily cause a program to blow up

2570702
free	malloc
although some compiler allocate memory for new using malloc free doesn t call destructors

2570709
int	chars
the simplest way of doing this when your weights are relatively small int such as in your example is to build a long string containing all the chars in the appropriate weights and choose a chars at random from it

2570718
google-chrome	firefox
now it still works fine in firefox but in recent versions of google-chrome i believe since 4 it throws this error

2570718
google-chrome	firefox
the above works in firefox 3.6 and google-chrome 3 but in google-chrome 5 it throws the above error.

2570744
google-chrome	firefox
i tried your test pages and they work fine with google-chrome 4.1.249.1045 on windows and firefox 3.6.3 and ie7 after fixing the issue below

2570750
inherited	properties
you have abstract baseviewmodel which contain for example properties title description keywords ... and all other view model classes inherited from baseviewmodel

2570780
webkit	gecko
to create a screenshot from a web page you need to have an interface to a layout engine like gecko or webkit

2570797
postgresql	mysql
there are various experimental linq to sql and linq to entity framework providers for other databases like mysql and postgresql - in my experience they are so immature it is not worth using for anything serious

2570804
pull	push
when you re ready to expose your changes to the rest of the world you ask them to pull from you or you push it to some main git repo

2570821
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
my solution should work for the focs firefox opera google-chrome safaries ex ie browsers

2570882
children	parent
fork will create a new process where the global variables will be separate between the parent and children

2570890
int	double
suppose that you have a binary file that contains numbers whos type is either int or double

2570890
int	double
the string is composed of the letters i for int and d for double in the order of the types of the subsequent numbers

2570890
int	double
for example the string iddiiddd indicated that the file contains eight values as follows one int followed by two double followed by two int followed by three double

2570893
mockito	jmock
the api classes such as httpservletrequest servletconfig etc are prime targets for using a mocking framework of your choice jmock mockito etc since they re all interfaces

2570915
int	chars
if the chars is an i use readint to read in an int

2570934
ceil	floor
i do not want to use ceil and floor

2570960
inherited	subclassing
abstract classes are useful when you need a class for the purpose of inherited and polymorphism but it makes no sense to instantiate the class itself only its subclassing

2570960
superclass	subclassing
they are commonly used when you want to define a template for a group of subclassing that share some common implementation code but you also want to guarantee that the objects of the superclass cannot be created

2570960
abstract-class	superclass
abstract-class also have the added benefit in polymorphismâ allowing you to use the abstract superclass s type as a method argument or a return type

2570962
cfstring	nsstring
i know that nsstring and cfstring are toll-bridge they can convert in such a way

2570967
junit	testng
jax-ws web services are annotated pojos so you can unit test them in isolation using a regular unit testing framework junit testng and mocks

2570970
folder	directory
you should move the user s folder outside of capistrano s releases directory

2570978
google-chrome	firefox
i ve developed a ajax-enhanced website which has been running fine in ie google-chrome and firefox for a year or so

2570978
google-chrome	firefox
but now i m experiencing this error myself not in firefox though but in google-chrome

2571035
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have a strange problem working with html css in different browsers firefox 3.6 and webkit browsers google-chrome safari

2571035
google-chrome	firefox
now the problem is that in firefox using firebug i can see that the computed width for the first element is 26.5667px while in google-chrome using google-chrome s developer tools the computed width for the same element is exactly 27px

2571037
qtimer	qmainwindow
the first process the server launches a gui derived from qmainwindow which listens for messages from the clients using repeat fire qtimer s and asynchronous mpi receive calls updates the gui depending on what messages it receives and sends a reply to every message

2571044
folder	directory
all these files are loaded dynamically into index.php it reads all folder inside templates directory and then includes every template.php file

2571068
integer	unsigned
iâ d go with either nsuinteger as the idiomatic general unsigned integer type in cocoa or uint8_t if size matters

2571075
getter	setter
you want to encapsulate object but your member fields is not encapsulated well make them private and add setter and getter methods

2571087
shadowing	named
as gabe said f# interactive uses shadowing of values when you enter a function with a named that already exists for more info on shadowing see for example this so question

2571088
uiview	uiwindow
also you don t need a delegate for drawing a uiview into a uiwindow

2571164
put	get
now after i ve changed the style on the page i want to get the new background color using the following code which i put after the call

2571168
std	ostream
this means that you must implement some sort of null stream class - see implementing a no-op std ostream

2571178
uiview	calayer
if this is to be drawn to the screen you ll need to locate your drawing code within the -drawrect method of a uiview or â drawincontext of a calayer

2571178
uiview	calayer
to update its contents you d need to call -setneedsdisplay on the uiview or calayer

2571235
versioning	upgrade
the minuses and pluses it s a bit of work to start with but with this you ll have all the ground work done to handle upgrade automatically later on to do so just add an upgradescript section to your xml an attribute called versioning for each upgrade script and simply compare it against the versioning of the db you have save in the registry

2571240
width	height
you might want to rename x and y to width and height though or something similar

2571335
keydown	keyup
however the noncharacter keys do raise the keydown and keyup events

2571368
accessor	properties
i want the attribute on the properties set accessor to catch some type of exception and then deal with this in some custom way or even just swallow it

2571379
oncreate	setcontentview
i had to do that in oncreate before calling setcontentview on the activity

2571401
lisp	scheme
i know that lisp and scheme programmers usually say that eval should be avoided unless strictly necessary

2571411
mongoid	mongomapper
i was trying mongomapper but i think i ll go with mongoid because after quick reading docs it seems to me somewhat easier

2571421
int	double
instead of looking for duplicates for each item which is o n 2 or zipping which is n 2 in memory use map double int

2571426
google-chrome	firefox
button you will notice that the sign in panel fieldset#login-controls is shown improperly compare with firefox or google-chrome

2571549
cos	sin
so i may want to write a macro that based on the first parameter uses either sin or cos

2571549
cos	sin
foo 3 4 does sin 4 and foo 1 4 does cos 4

2571555
terminate	timeout
further if the timeout occurs you should probably aim to terminate the child process

2571562
put	get
if the client was a winforms app i could simply put and the current frame on the screen would automatically get updated

2571579
post	get
i am trying to get some form data from post method

2571632
maven	pom.xml
the odd part is that jdo2-api-2.3-ec.jar is in the datanucleus maven repository that is declared in the pom.xml of the plugin and maven has checked this repository as we can see in the trace

2571636
postgresql	mysql
i haven t used mysql much but in postgresql if the number of records is small in the table it can decide not to use the index

2571643
width	height
i see that they are squeezed such that the height is more than the width

2571689
serializable	deserialization
you can override the serializable and deserialization methods to add custom information

2571764
cassini	iis
i m using cassini not iis with vs2010

2571780
folder	directory
i need to return a full directory name from inside a specified directory that contains .default in the folder name

2571780
post	get
i also looked at this post windows batch file get folders #39

2571789
subtraction	addition
you should also support basic vector operations like addition subtraction and dot product

2571819
children	parent
so if there are no children then the parent row is not returned in the result set

2571823
return-value-optimization	nrvo
i guess what you re looking for is return-value-optimization return-value-optimization and nrvo named return-value-optimization

2571876
post	put
i ve put together some example code and uploaded it here i hope that linking to one s blog post isn t considered terrible form - a brief search of the internet didn t seem to suggest it was .

2571877
hide	show
in this you d have all those pages be user controls which you progrmattically hide or show

2571977
mouse	keyboard
what you need to do is implement custom look and feel that defines ui delegates generating gwt widgets and on the gwt side capture the mouse and keyboard events on the client and feed them to the swing event queue

2571980
free	malloc
malloc still has the advantage that the memory can be deallocated with free exactly when you want it to be -- so you can usefully return a malloc ed array as your function s result and the caller will free it when done with it

2571980
free	malloc
of course style-guides that constrain malloc and free to happen within the same function would give up on this crucial difference

2571980
realloc	malloc
there are others though such as the ability to realloc a malloc -ed array if you need to change its size which also doesn t apply to runtime-sized arrays

2571981
calloc	malloc
it certainly reduces the need for calloc and malloc by using the compiler for variable allocations

2571981
calloc	malloc
you might still use calloc and malloc where you need to support older compilers or in situations where you want to allocate more dynamic data structures

2571995
cairngorm	flex	cairngorm	puremvc
that s why there is cairngorm puremvc and many other frameworks on top of flex

2572005
google-chrome	firefox
the only solution i can see is that suggested by ole above namely to look at the code from google-chrome and firefox and work out how they encode the cache

2572029
portrait	landscape
but if you will somehow show this uiactionsheet in the window main application window which does not autorotate to landscape than your controller will rotate to landscape and after clicking the button your uiactionsheet won t be presented in landscape but in portrait as the main window

2572052
mvp	presenter
in mvp i d write this as iview.activatefield nameconstant which the presenter or pm would invoke

2572108

mocking frameworks jmock easymock mockito

2572116
hash	salt
store the password+salt as a hash and the salt

2572116
hash	salt
something like hashlib.sha1 s s salt hash .hexdigest

2572125
serializable	deserialization
a working trie with serializable and deserialization

2572154
put	get
so the needs to be escaped to 26 when it is put into the string so that the get will read it properly

2572162
simple-html-dom	domparser
use a domparser or simple-html-dom for html

2572170
hide	show
google translate includes show hide romanization which is better than unihan for two reasons

2572179
ienumerable	ilist
that said no one has mentioned that is f# s name for and so the seq module functions work on any ienumerable including ilist s

2572207
wxpython	pyqt
i don t have too much experience with building gui s but i ve done a little bit with wxpython and pyqt

2572237
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
imagemagick or graphicsmagick are pretty good you can find wrappers for them in most languages

2572263
hash	md5
you send md5 hash and not plain password

2572333
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox ie safari and opera do this fine google-chrome does not

2572373
openbsd	linux
as of october 2017 openbsd darwin and linux with -lbsd now all have an implementation of arc4random that is crypto-secure and that cannot fail

2572386
width	height
i set the form to have a size of my liking with width and height on the designer and all looks good

2572397
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
at the moment the for-loop i have to remove the rows causes an indexing error as the size of the arrays changes in loops

2572400
equinox	knopflerfish
i am at the moment creating a matrix which is showing how far knopflerfish equinox and felix are osgi 4.2 compliant

2572446
width	height
in the following table how to adjust the height and width automatically for the table

2572477
put	get
some libraries introduces too many abstractions forcing you to put in more effort to get around it or forcing you to do things in a certain way and i think that s bad

2572483
short	base
i would like to change it so that it uses the short description as the description in google base

2572489
boost	allocator
if you don t need your allocator to call a constructor you can also use boost pool which i think may deallocate faster because it doesn t have to call deconstructors at all and just deleted the chunk of memory in one free

2572502
inherited	properties
if your screenmanager inherited from drawablegamecomponent then you should have access to a graphicsdevice properties from inside it anyway which you can use in the loadcontent method of you screen manage to load any content that the screenmanager requires

2572533
allocator	stl
what allocator are available out there for use with stl when dealing with small objects

2572533
boost	allocator
i have already tried playing with pool allocator from boost but got no performance improvement actually in some cases there was considerable degradation

2572543
dns	spf
you should really check or create your dns spf record it specifies which server is allowed to send email for your domain name

2572543
gmail	hotmail
hotmail and gmail users among others may find your emails in their junk folder if you set these incorrectly or not at all

2572545
struts	stripes
my favorite java web framework is the stripes framework it s an actionbased mvc framework that does not need xml configuration files like those other popular frameworks like spring mvc struts

2572553
oncreate	onstart
this method is called after oncreate more precisely after onstart and is another place android recommends restoring state

2572593
imperative	declarative
generally that wpf is declarative rather than imperative

2572594
int	chars
cin s clear member function doesn t clear the remaining input it resets the error flags on the stream which could get set because you tried to read an int but there were non-digit chars in the input

2572629
rss	feed
the rss feed has truncated posts

2572655
slideup	slidedown
the list items kind of appear but aren t animated the container is only animated when i apply the slidedown slideup toggleslide effect

2572685
min	max
min and max attributes are optional

2572721
children	parent
in the above example the parent would be alice having two children bob and charlie

2572732
urllib	httplib
urllib urllib2 and httplib on app engine are patched to transparently use this api for you so any third-party module that does http requests using one of these standard modules will work

2572776
vim	emacs
are there any snippets to make emacs use the .vim syntax files found in usr share vim vimfiles for coloring text

2572776
vim	emacs
many applications like conky have the vim syntax files like conkyrc.vim for vim but not for emacs

2572813
rss	feed
i have a shared site in sharepoint and have some rss feed webpart in it so now everytime my site opens up it shows this popup

2572836
for-loop	loops
i would love to be clever and tell you how to do this with no for loops but the overhead on a for-loop here is small and the code is probably clearer if you keep your for-loop

2572862
super	self
i assume that if it were truly important for self to be set equal to super then apple would not have the method be commented out by default

2572871
getter	setter
secondly if getter and setter are defined in an interface they don t really define complete behavior other that one is for read and one is for write wrt a property. you can have complex behavior behind setter and getter but they can only be implemented in the actual classes

2572871
getter	setter
with that into consideration there is nothing wrong - syntactically and semantically - with having setter and getter in interfaces

2572871
getter	setter
if your application is well-modeled and the problem requires that you have an interface defining setter and getter why not

2572871
getter	setter
now if we look at getter and setter from the point of view of implementing classes compliant with the javabeans specs then you do not need to define interfaces for them

2572871
getter	setter
but if you have things that require setter and getter like a bean might and which is also required to be plugged at compile-type not at run-time like a bean might and for which multiple implementations might exist then yeah this would call for an interface defining getter and setter

2572919
queue	fifo
lifo is easily represented by a stack fifo is a queue and i ve used a not-very-optimized-but-probably-adequate circular buffer implementation using a and index pointer to approximate a round-robin access pattern

2572964
hash	salt
you might already know this but i d also suggest adding salt to your hash

2573048
int	chars
my problem is that i am trying to do computations with parts of a string consisting only of numbers but i do not know how to convert an individual chars to an int

2573049
range	max
the range of parameters is 0 for no intensity and 1 for max intensity of red green and blue

2573059
int	chars
if you mean that you want to convert the chars 0 to the int 0 and 1 to 1 et cetera than the simplest way to do this is probably the following

2573083
allocator	stl
the stl generic allocator is the best for the huge variety of circumstances and if you want a new allocator you will need to profile and understand your specific requirements

2573113
subclass	accessor
the example code i linked to describes how to create accessor in your nsmanagedobject subclass that will convert the image back and forth between a uiimage and binary data

2573143
bash	zsh
in most unix shells csh bash zsh aliases are a form of expansion

2573201
google-chrome	firefox
this is a pretty picky one but when you click the headline it expands but at least in firefox haven t tested it in google-chrome yet the text jumps from the right and to the left locking in place from which the css tells it to padding-left

2573212
int	double
my guess is that the reason for this slowdown is due to the conversion between the javascript double and the internal unsigned 8bit int used by the canvaspixelarray

2573251
children	parent
rather there s a bunch of categories and some categories have parent some have children and some have both

2573262
pascal	delphi
delphi and its underlying pascal language is still alive and well with the 2010 edition recently released

2573277
drawimage	putimagedata
looks like you re doing some kind of blitting so maybe drawimage or all-at-once putimagedata could help

2573296
ssl	https
https ssl is a must for this type of traffic to prevent eavesdropping

2573338
nscopying	nsmutablecopying
mutable objects often need to be copied though nsmutablecopying might be needed instead of nscopying

2573361
put	get
i can obviously get it to work if i put it in the a class tag but that s the problem

2573366
portrait	landscape
this uiview should support both landscape and portrait modes

2573366
portrait	landscape
but the problem is that for it to work i also need to shrink the two boxes as one changes from portrait to landscape because otherwise they would overlap

2573381
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

2573432
int	double
typedef void foo int double

2573442
median	percentile
they then return not only their median but say their 25th and 75th percentile as well perverse worst cases are better if you choose slightly different numbers

2573482
google-chrome	firefox
note this will only work in firefox and possibly google-chrome

2573520
sorting	filtering
you need to follow the example of better exposed filtering in form_alter ing the exposed filtering form and sorting your filtering s #options array

2573527
sudo	passwd
i ve inherited development for a website on vps hosting and have login info for a user with sudo privileges but don t have the passwd for the mysql root user

2573559
width	height
i set the picker width screen width and height 216 elsewhere

2573593

2573629
strstr	substr
using strstr i m trying to get the whole substr between the last two quotes basic html

2573649
uitableview	uisearchbar
i m in the midst of an iphone app that needs to have 4 separate uitableview objects sharing access to one uisearchbar in the first section and first row of the aforementioned uitableview objects

2573706
vb.net	vb6
for vb6 if there is any chance it will be converted to vb.net using call means the syntax doesn t change

2573707
inherited	subclassing
if you want to use inherited in conjunction with the singleton pattern you should put the inheritable state and behaviour into an abstract base class and define the singletons as final subclassing

2573708
sorting	grouping
the second or final pass requires sorting the records within a grouping of possible matches same length same hash code s same first x bytes

2573737
mouse	keyboard
all menustrip and toolstripmenuitems are created programatically reading user permissions from database then add a handler to manage the events but the client don t want mouse interaction he wants only keyboard inputs only

2573767
int	double
where i j k t are unsigned int and high low are double

2573778
ceil	floor
so for positive numbers the result of casting a floating-point value to an integral type is equivalent to calling floor but for negative number is is equivalent to calling ceil

2573787
int	double
also floor returns a double so i + floor ... will be performed as a floating point operation instead of an int operation

2573791
sdl	devil
i use sdl and opengl and i recomend you to use the lib devil to load images

2573832
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested the following code in ie8 firefox google-chrome and it is working we just need to add the doctype correctly

2573949
powerpc	i386
all in all this is not completely trivial and unfortunately your code has to be specialized to each architecture you wish to target i386 x86_64 powerpc

2573956
verilog	hdl
the vast majority of programming languages use lazy evalution with the ternary operator i was thinking of verilog at the time of writing which is a hardware description language hdl in which both branches are evaluated in parallel

2573970
range	max	range	min	min	max
public static ienumerable int range int min int max

2573970

if min max

2574046
move	drag	mouseup	mousedown
i am trying to handle a drag drop interaction which involves mousedown mouse move and mouseup

2574046
mouseup	mousedown
first of all the mousedown and mouseup callbacks are specified as side effects

2574046
mousemove	mouseup
second the mouseup callback is specified before the mousemove callback

2574078
background-repeat	background-position
see that page for the additional parameters background-repeat and background-position

2574128
put	get
when you get it back before you put it into the database you escape it using mysql_real_escape_string to make sure you do not suffer an sql injection attack

2574195
qtextedit	qtextcursor
the methods in qt4 do not have an argument which allows you to set a selection id nor can i find any other function in the qtextcursor or qtextedit which looks like it might allow me to do so

2574207
jdom	xom	jdom	dom4j	dom4j	xom
if you want a dom api that s easier to live with try xom jdom or dom4j

2574274
children	parent
the entire transaction will either succeed leaving your database in a consistent state or fail to commit any changes if the children or parent cannot all be deleted for any reason - if there was another fk reference to a child or parent not accounted for in your delete

2574280
hide	show
my goal is to show hide the subviews with tableview inside according to the position of the segmented control

2574346
submit	submission
i want to add a symbol before a users entry into a text field without actually submission the when the user clicks submit

2574347
ddms	adb
either run the adb application from a console or bring up the logcat window in eclipse it might help to switch to the ddms perspective

2574357
hash	md5
however the examples of some phrases and their md5 hash in that wiki article are very nice

2574392
converter	multibinding
i have the following xaml that does all that it is supposed to except that the multibinding on the fontsize fails on retrieving the users i see dependencyproperty.unsetdata when i set a breakpoint in the converter

2574412
hash	md5
md5 is a hash algorithm it produces a signature of the input text such that changing any letter in the input will have significant unpredictable impact on the signature

2574415
hash	md5
it can be arbitrarily long md5 hash for 2gb iso files are routinely created just like hash for strings a dozen characters long for passwords

2574438
std	ostream
it is simply a global instance of class std ostream a class which can also be instantiated normally if and when you need it

2574559
qtextedit	qtextcursor
to graphically visualise all the various selections separate qtextcursor objects instead of calling the settextcursor method for the qtextedit widget for each of the selections i change the background color of each of those sections of text by calling the setcharformat method for each of those qtextcursor objects

2574565
autofac	castle-windsor
autofac has interception capabilities which rely on castle dynamicproxy library same that castle-windsor uses

2574631
createelement	each
i ve also passed it to each createelement for my additional element names

2574642
free	malloc
on a related issue with malloc i understand that the memory needs to be deallocated free after the variable array z1 has been used

2574727
n-gram	words
if the above method is too simple you can increase its complexity by counting n-gram groups of words or even grammatical structure by first tagging the part-of-speech lots of spam is usually random garbage populated with keywords where non-spam usually makes some sense

2574742
width	height
i would have a prepared big image 32x320 pixels and defined starting position x y 0 32 and width height 32 32 and would want the script to show second 32x32 pixel part of main image

2574781
udp	tcp
if not you ll probably want to use udp or tcp

2574781
udp	tcp
few protocols these days design individual packets though many do send very specific data structures across the wire using tcp or less commonly udp

2574792
treemap	treeset
java has two built-in classes treemap and treeset providing red black trees

2574827
put	get
i don t really understand the purpose of the get and put functions here

2574962
nsstatusbar	nsstatusitem
items in the menu bar are nsstatusitem and the part of the menu bar in which they live is an nsstatusbar

2575016
getattr	setattr
well for that you could use python s getattr and setattr instead as you would on any python object

2575035
put	get
however more generally that won t apply and then get and put are convenient plumbing pieces whose meaning is perhaps clearer than writing the inner function directly

2575058
put	get
but if i put aaa bbb ccc when i print i only get ccc it cuts the previous off

2575065
getter	setter
i have a simple class getter setter and nothing more

2575099
udp	tcp
keep 1 udp for incoming connections roll out a new thread connection udp tcp for each new job

2575111
google-chrome	safari
but then it was not working for the google-chrome and safari browsers stretching worked but the hight of the pictures was only 2 mm

2575227
put	get
and put it in my flex 3.0 lib folder - just like where all my other 3rd party libraries are in place however with the yahoo flex map lib i get that error

2575239
bash	tcsh
bash tcsh csh ksh .

2575248
lisp	scheme
lisp and scheme have interactive mode

2575284

we all would love someone who has figured it out to post a simple project or detailed walk-through of implementing this so we can put the code that lots of people have worked hard on to good use

2575298
des	aes
as for security you should be fine with triple des or aes

2575307
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade my delphi to 2010 versioning and i tried to open and run application written in delphi 2006

2575365
mouseover	mouseout
there seems to be a bit of difference between the mouseout and mouseover events

2575365
mouseout	mouseleave
quick example of mouseout and mouseleave

2575365
mouseout	mouseleave
what looks like a much more in depth look at the difference between mouseout and mouseleave

2575368
client-side	server-side
you are correct in thinking that keeping two versions of your objects feels wrong -- the whole idea of gwt is that you can share your server-side objects on the client-side and if you start divorcing the two you re not taking full advantage of gwt

2575399
superclass	subclassing
as other have said this is not advisable but here s a contrived example that does what you re looking for--the superclass calls an overridden method which uses an argument that was passed to the subclassing s constructor

2575401
lisp	smalltalk
if lisp isn t your cup of tea a variety of smalltalk environments are worth mentioning

2575427
super	extends
if you use super instead of extends allowing you to pass a it s the other way around

2575472
cpu	hyperthreading
it s on a intel cpu with hyperthreading that is returning the wrong number

2575523
int	double
some cursory research states that bitwise operators in javascript are inherently slow because internally it appears that javascript will cast all of its double values into signed 32-bit int to do the bitwise operations see here for more on this. because of this i can t do a direct port of the java random number generator and i need to get the same numeric results as java.util.random

2575538
hide	show
i d like to hide some of these events from the month view like a summary with a visual que that there are more on this day than can be show

2575561
division	multiplication
bear in mind that a bit shift is directly equivalent to a multiplication or division by a power of 2

2575599
cpu	hyperthreading
an intel hyperthreading core is treated by windows as a muti-core cpu

2575633
hide	show
it is commented to death but in general you give it a container id in which your elements to show hide are and then some hide-all-then-show-one-of-them is done in the select element s onchange

2575642
getter	setter
we use a lot of getter setter so i wrote the following template

2575651
mp3	wav
i am looking at apple s auriotouch example for the iphone and i would like to play an mp3 or wav instead of using the built in mic

2575663
serializable	deserialization
everything works good so far i can send and recieve objects and i use some serializable deserialization code

2575689
uiview	calayer
i have a uiview that contains a number of calayer subclasses

2575690
udp	tcp
the difference between tcp and udp is that the former takes care of sequencing of data and retransmission of dropped packets plus a flow control slow reader slows down fast writer while the latter doesn t

2575690
udp	tcp
i agree that playing with udp and low-level protocol state machines is a lot of fun but it has been done already and decades of research went into tuning tcp performance

2575695
stdout	stderr
i encountered much the same problem and eventually decided to use threads to gather up all the data on a sub-process s stdout and stderr and put it onto a thread-safe queue which which the main thread can read in a blocking fashion without having to worry about the threading going on behind the scenes

2575698
stdout	stderr
i have a script that calls a filter program with system and replaces the file in the buffer with its output but there doesn t seem to be a way to detect if the lines returned by system where written to stdout or to stderr

2575731
int	chars
public void chars chars ch int start int

2575762
des	aes
now a days the symmetric encryption algorithm which des is of choice is aes which is like the spiritual successor to des

2575762
hash	md5
adobe essentially destroyed all the protection of aes in their pdf s by using an md5 hash of the users password as the key

2575762
hash	salt
essentially what this does is cryptographically securely hash your password with a supplied salt more on this in a bit a number of times supplied by the user

2575762
hash	salt
rather than taking a direct hash of your password a salt adds extra information to your input password creating a unique hash

2575762
rsa	aes
this aes session key is encrypted using the public rsa key

2575762
rsa	aes
the server decrypts the data using it s private rsa key and keeps the aes session key

2575803
stdout	stderr
you can use python to distinguish between stdout and stderr

2575814
listview	gridview
note that here lv is your listview not your gridview

2575839
width	height
for me the solution of setting the width height to zero and style to none didn t work out as it still showed a tiny window with an annoying shadow of what seems to be the border around a 0x0 window tested on windows 7

2575877
jstl	taglib
whenever you need to write some raw java code inside a jsp file which can t be replaced reasonably by taglib jstl and so on or el then the particular java code belongs in any way in a real java class like a servlet filter javabean etcetera

2575885
lxml	beautifulsoup
beautifulsoup or lxml

2575893
put	get
put it where you have the best skill set and you ll get the job done the quickest

2575936
equals	tostring
a property name p in the form of a string value is an array index if and only if tostring touint32 p is equals to p and touint32 p is not equals to 2 32 âˆ 1

2575969
hide	show
when you hide the one button first and then show the other there s maybe a little gap which creates the flicker

2575979
fiddler	charles
there s charles which is very powerful and fiddler which is free

2575995
hide	show
now i want it so at first only the first div is showing and the others are hidden but i have asp loop that generates clickable links for the various divs pages and clicking on any given link will show that div and hide all the others

2575996
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
you should throw a nullpointerexception or an illegalargumentexception if filename is null

2576002
haskell	sml
ml haskell scala f# sml and other languages can easily figure out the type from equivalent expressions in their own language mainly because they were designed with type-inference in mind from the very start

2576002
haskell	sml
by contrast ml haskell f# and sml support type inference so well because they have these sorts of restrictions you can t call methods before they re declared the first method call to inferred functions determines the type compilation order has an impact on type inference etc

2576007
post	get
the browser sends a http request which includes the url the request method get post etc cookies and a whole bunch of other stuff

2576021
mouseleave	mouseenter
if i handle the panel s mouseenter and mouseleave events and its child s mouseenter and mouseleave events the events are raised in this order

2576064
folder	directory
the file is imported into a folder named resources in the src directory of my project

2576077
udp	tcp
after studying tcp udp difference all week i just can t decide which to use

2576077
udp	tcp
the only other solution i came up with is to use udp and if there seems to be too great of loss of packets switch to tcp client-side

2576095
instances	transient	persistent	transient
a new instances of a a persistent class which is not associated with a session has no representation in the database and no identifier value is considered transient by hibernate

2576095
instances	transient	persistent	transient
you can make a transient instances persistent by associating it with a session

2576100
udp	tcp
if you can t lose data and you use udp you are reinventing tcp at least a significant fraction of it

2576102
udp	tcp
udp is simpler protocol than tcp and you can still simulate features of tcp using udp

2576102
udp	tcp
however i d firstly just use both udp and tcp check their behavior in a real environment and only then decide to reimplement tcp in terms of udp in the exact way you need

2576127
int	chars
my guess from your use of x is that content is encoding your hexademical number as an array of int and not an array of chars

2576136
udp	tcp
therefore tcp by definition is the right answer over udp

2576136
udp	tcp
the only other solution i came up with is to use udp and if there seems to be too great of loss of packets switch to tcp client-side

2576139
udp	tcp
start with the simplest setup i m guessing tcp for bulk data transfer and udp for non-reliable sensor data test measure find bottlenecks re-factor

2576196
lisp	scheme
another good resources is sicp which is specific to scheme a lisp dialect and available in full here

2576202
sorting	filtering
though you might end up writing a few lines of code here and there to implement a few extra features so that it matches the functionality of excel you know things like filtering sorting automatic value recalculation persistence printing etc. but it is a free one

2576213
division	addition
in your case you need two operations addition and division

2576215
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i always deploy the project to the integrated tomcat or glassfish start it and then just open the page in a real webbrowser firefox google-chrome safari ie etc which you run independently from eclipse

2576218
cout	cin
the bottleneck in your code is the use of cin cout

2576220
savefiledialog	folderbrowserdialog
messagebox openformdialog folderbrowserdialog printdialog colordialog fontdialog pagesetupdialog savefiledialog

2576231
int	boolean
automatic type conversion between pointers boolean int and just about anything

2576233
versioning	upgrade
sfloader was deprecated in symfony 1.2 - i think you need to look over the 1.4 api and the upgrade help from whichever versioning you re familiar with as these are going to be resources you ll need to refer to a lot

2576237
webkit	gecko
what i want to find is the most widely adopted most heavily developed easiest to deploy solution to get gecko or webkit into a swing app needs to run os x and windows

2576237
webkit	gecko
we would really like to use either webkit or gecko

2576240
itertools	functools
discover itertools and functools

2576251
subtract	add
i also want it to allow the user to add and subtract time

2576296
addition	multiplication
the trouble is when i need to implement things like addition and scalar multiplication

2576337
cpython	ironpython
jython and ironpython have changed their numbering scheme to match the cpython version whose features they most closely implement

2576366
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade to iphone sdk versioning 3.2 and ran into this problem

2576379
google-chrome	safari
the following seems to work but i d like to avoid printing errors to the console at least safari and google-chrome do when accessing location.href on the parent frame

2576413
fgets	strcmp
however the real problem why strcmp doesn t return 0 is you have to trim the string read from fgets which in most cases includes a newline character

2576420
cpython	ironpython
the syntax and feature set are controlled strictly by the first two numbers -- every is claiming to implement the same syntax and feature set in terms of language definition not of aspects the language-reference manual explicitly leaves up to the implementation for example both jython and ironpython have buh mean a unicode string literal while cpython has it mean a byte string literal

2576424
min	max
you could return either the max or min bug id

2576431
switching	screens
while i m watching movies i switching the display to the external monitor and my laptop screens goes black however it s still on and glowing in the dark

2576497
put	get
but when i put it in my project i get the error

2576512
udp	tcp
it can be done to beat tcp for stream transfer using udp if you don t have nat to think about

2576515
pop-up	dialog
if so pop-up your dialog

2576533
width	height
by increasing the font size the button stays the same width but increases in height meaning it s long and thin

2576535
folder	directory
there are a huge number of directory and subdirectories and i basically want to clean up all of the subversion .svn folder before i attempt to import to a new repository and i dont want svn to get confused

2576580
for-loop	loops
the scope of the sparam in the for-loop is static within that loops

2576611
inherited	properties
i have this scenario that i m testing flat file debatching for debatching i need to set maxoccur properties of the schema to 1 but for batch processing it should be instead of creating a two different schemas i want just to create a base schema and inherited from it and then change the maxoccur properties in the derived schema

2576613
memcpy	memmove
the similar function memcpy does not have reliable semantics if the areas to be copied overlap whereas memmove does

2576613
memcpy	memmove
in c++ you need to be cautious about using memmove or memcpy

2576723
tiff	png
so roll your own format but convert to png or tiff for display

2576737
button	checkbox
when it asked me to select the checkbox to create the main method there wasn t anything on-screen that looked like a checkbox with main or method next to it so i guessed that maybe what they meant was the modifiers radio button

2576750
int	chars
nb offered the basic types int and chars together with arrays of them and pointers to them but no further ways of composition

2576770
aggregate-functions	sum
i am using a query with aggregate-functions sum to generate the sum of each product

2576795
x86	64bit
msvc s implementation of a 64bit modulo on 32-bit x86 is some hairy loop filled assembly vc crt src intel llrem.asm for the brave so i d personally go with that

2576798
stdout	stderr
in tomcat unrecovered exceptions are usually logged to the stderr and that usually doesn t end up in the same logfile as the stdout

2576799
public	protected
itunes analogy aside the main frame details show all of the public and protected information needed to interact with that class or interface

2578377
for-loop	loops	children	parent

the udp stack on the remote machine will likely be sending a icmp port unreachable error if there s no socket open on the port that you are sending to

icmp	udp
the problem with these icmp port unreachable errors is that they re reported via the winsock code by failing a pending udp recv recvfrom call

2581605
ftp	smb
otroslogviewer user vfsfilesystems and can load logs from remote server ftp sftp smb http

2581625
int	chars
when you re printing the results your chars s are being extended to int s

2581629
width	height
it s a more general operation that works with two matrices also vectors are matrices iff the width of the first is equal to the height of the second but in this way you consider one of your arrays as trasposed to a column vector

2581636
put	get
better in my opinion to put a few read-only public properties in the class so that mappers can get access to the attributes they need

2581640
onclick	onchange
instead of a separate onclick for each option try an onchange on the select

2581658
quicksort	mergesort
when doing extreme optimizations you will likely find that in certain very special edge cases old and slow bubble sort may win over a glorified quicksort or mergesort

2581665
instances	transient
when i want to create a new instances of the object i lose my transient information

2581690

i am not able to figure out which options to give to getsockopt to figure out whether the socket is udp or tcp

2582000
filtering	grouping
if you want all null values for synthid to be in their own grouping then i would probably filtering the first list and then do a concatenation

2582028
melt	reshape
you can easily achieve this by using melt in the reshape package

2582032
int	double
double has range more than a 64-bit int but its precision is less dues to its representation since double is 64-bit as well it can t fit more actual values

2582032
int	double
note how max int can fit into a double without loss of precision and boost intmax_t 64-bit in this case cannot

2582053

the semantics of transient are precisely that the data is not persistent

2582228
persistent	transient
decide to persistent the transient field

2582228
persistent	transient
it doesn t really seem to be transient if you need it after merging the class into the persistent context

2582228
persistent	transient
maintain the value of the transient field outside of the persistent object

2582228
persistent	transient
one final thing the main use case i ve found for transient fields on domain classes is to demarcate derived fields fields that can be recalculated based on the persistent fields of the class

2582309
bindparam	bindvalue
i want to also mention that i have tried using bindvalue in place of bindparam and the data for the data variable will still not save

2582322
std	ostream
the problem was that std ostream is not copyable

2582353
recvfrom	datagram
udp socket is able to receive datagram from multiple clients with the recvfrom function

2582370
folder	directory
the only way i can think of is to do a standard loop and iterate several times but this limits me if a file or folder is several folder deep ... i can do this using n loops but that will only take me n directory deep

2582436
equals	tostring
you should probably override hashcode equals and tostring as well

2582450
int	double
c types are much faster than python types adding to c int or double can be done in a single clock cycle but less safe they are not arbitrarily sized and may silently overflow

2582518
post	get
you re setting values in the http header not get or post parameters in the http request

2582551

2582796
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchescancelled	touchesended
you will probably want to implement the touchesbegan withevent touchesended withevent and touchescancelled withevent methods

2582799
int	chars
the strings are always the same length of 65 000 chars and have lots of repeating int a sample appearing as follows

frequent versioning updates to the framework make it hard to keep your app up to date - upgrade can break in obscure places

2583080
iboutlet	ibaction
hook those objects up to iboutlet and ibaction in your uitableviewcell class

2583203
hash	salt
but should you store the salt unique for each user next to the hash password+salt in the database

2583204
width	height
you can do it with a fixed width positioned in center and with negative margins with half of the width and half of the height

2583226
getter	setter
that is you assume that external libraries work properly and generated getter setter methods if your language supports those do not have to be tested either

2583230
hash	salt
even if an attacker gains access to a database it s not that easy to work out the real passwords from the salt especially if you don t have the code and don t know how the password is hash

2583244
hash	salt
salt is used to increase the time that an attacker would have to spend to find a password matching the hash stored in database

2583370
tcpclient	networkstream
the read write portions of the tcpclient are thread safe as explained in the documentation for the networkstream class which is what the tcpclient uses for its actual io

2583388
for-loop	loops
while the benefits and shortcomings of this can be discussed to eternity the bottom line is that java is really sparse in syntactic sugar in fact only syntactic sugar in java i can think of is the enhanced for-loop and even then internally jvm knows only of while loops anyway

2583400
nunit	mstest
i seem to have missed something - in this step through it talks through downloading nunit and changing the original mstest reference to nunit

2583416
udp	tcp
there are many choices http tcp udp jms xmlrpc rmi corba c rpc or flash-drives carried by post pigeons

2583420
nunit	mstest
adding the reference to nunit is fine but you need to make sure that the attributes you put on the class and test methods are those of nunit and not mstest

2583502
put	get
and as you can see now you can get rid off that strange second if you put inside the loop

2583596
jboss	glassfish
if you plan to do some ejb3 3.1 development as well have a look at glassfish or jboss

2583604
post	get
depending on how the remote site is set up you could use a simple post there is an open data table for that 1 or you could create your own small custom data table and use 2 to send whatever headers including cookie you need over one or more get post requests

2583645
put	get
if you want to put all in the db then i would add a unique sequence number to all records in the in-between table lets call it seqid then still perform a query but instead of getting whole rows only get the sequence number

2583663
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari are probably being optimizing with getelementsbyclassname

2583692
superclass	subclassing
the default superclass constructor that does not take any parameters is implicitly called from the subclassing constructor

2583692
superclass	subclassing
if the superclass constructor takes parameters in then you need to call it explicitly and that call must be the very first statement in the subclassing constructor

2583719
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
all other cross-browser conflicts have been removed and works perfectly on all major browsers including ie google-chrome opera and safari but i get absolutely nothing from the httprequest ajax if the browser is firefox

in iis right click on the folder for hg select properties select the home directory tab

2583846
post	get
set the verbs to limit to get head post

2583858
getter	setter
having a variable public or having a variable private with public getter and setter is not the same even the getter and the setter doesn t make any transformation to the variable

2583858
getter	setter
getter and setter are made to do some kind of operation on the variable when this is set or it is get like caching or constraints check

2583858
getter	setter
a public getter or setter could be overwritten in a subclass specializing its behavior

2583858
accessor	properties	subclass	accessor
even with properties the behavior is not the same because you cannot overwrite an accessor in a subclass

2583862
int	chars
array is collection of similar type of data like int chars float number like that

2583887
integer	unsigned
the classic case of an unsigned 32-bit integer is with seconds since 1970-01-01 runs out in 2038

2583887
integer	unsigned
with a 64-bit unsigned integer you re safe

2583892
getter	setter
you are very right it s better to have the variable private and have public getter setter

2583892
getter	setter
this relates to what is called representation independance that fact that if external access happen through getter setter you can change the internal representation of the object without major glitches

2583909
gif	png
its very easy to use gdiplus to load a variety of image formats including jpeg gif animated png and so on

2583915
getter	setter
in most langauages like you say the recommendation is to encapsulate all fields with a property setter getter

2583915
getter	setter
then you may argue that getter setter are not required

2583915
getter	setter
pre-auto-implemented properties one would have had to write getter setter which may be considered overkill for a private inner class

2583969
serializable	deserialization
so the serializable and deserialization work correct now but i don t know if there are any other side effects

2583974
getter	setter
the usual reflex for a programmer is to set all fields in a class as private and offer an interface formed of a series of getter and setter to manipulate them

2583974
public	protected
the public protected and default none access specifier are needed in some cases

2583994
ceil	floor
if you expand the algorithm to use a different rounding function for each term rather than the same rounding function for all you can generate the other named modes _ ceil ceil floor ceil ceil ceil _ where _ means don t care will generate ionian but you will also generate many other modes that can t result in a natural scale

2584004
button	checkbox

2584297
3des	aes
symmetric encryption systems aes or 3des are much more efficient and they come with chaining modes which allow them to process input messages of arbitrary length

2584297
rsa	aes
thus it is customary to use an hybrid system in which a big message is symmetrically encrypted with aes using a symmetric key which is an arbitrary short sequence of random bytes and have that key encrypted with rsa

2584297
ssl	https
another well-known protocol meant for encrypting network traffic is ssl now standardized under the name of tls and often used in combination with http as the famous https protocol

2584346
mouseover	mouseout
hover is basically an encapsulation of mouseover and mouseout event and it is tied to one element

2584346
mouseover	mouseout
for instance if you have an implemented a menu as an ordered list and have implemented hover for list item then each and every element will have mouseover and mouseout event associated with it

2584358
min	max
basically it lets you preset the device width zoom level and max min zoom

2584425
pull	push
the extension prompts for the http password on the first pull push

nsstring	nsxmlparser	nsstring	nsdata
nsxmlparser can also take input from an nsdata object so in some cases you can use nsstring methods to read the file in the specified encoding and produce an nsdata in utf-8

2584760
post	get
what you probably want to do is redirect to your page after the update - do a search for get after post for more information

unix	bsd
my guess is that the vast majority of desktop users run the hotspot jvm from oracle s jre jdk or one of its forks soylatte on osx icedtea or openjdk on unix bsd linux and they don t fiddle with the commandline options so they will probably get the c1 compiler with the default 1500 jit threshold

in our case we detect the buggy vpn driver and swap out move and fillchar with the delphi 7 versions replace inttostr with a pascal version int64-version uses the fpu and since we re using fastmm we disable its custom fixed size move routines too since they re even more susceptible than system.move

2585958
onresume	onpause
the home button instead don t finish the activity when you press the home button the onpause method of the activity is called and when you restart it the method called is onresume

2585963
put	get
i have 2 blocks of code if someone could help me put them together i would get the functionality i am looking for

2586033
keydown	keyup
basically you will have to keep the states pressed or released of the keys you are interested and change them when you receive a keydown or keyup event

2586052
submit	submission
since you ve used the term submit i m assuming you want to send the table s data as part of an html form submission you can put the generated string in an input type hidden element

2586054
google-chrome	firefox
i m using a tooltip that works in firefox google-chrome and ie7-8 but in ie6 it doesn t appear

2586059
keydown	keyup
there should exist a keyup-event as well and by using both keydown and keyup you can achieve the effect you re looking for

2586059
keydown	keyup
one would be to let your keydown event initiate a repeating action and let keyup cancel it

2586059
keydown	keyup
keep a list of keys and toggle them on when keydown and off on keyup

2586066
put	get
while running the swf if you click into the textfield you get an arrow move cursor then you can double-click to put it into edit mode to select text

2586149
client-side	server-side
i ve created a view which i do both server-side and client-side validation on the page using dataannotation attributes which decorate each input on the form

2586156
hide	show
i want the text of #slider to read hide then show

2586172
folder	directory
while it s true that this method returns web sites as well i can t see how to identify them among other virtual folder a web site has different properties which are not returned in the virtual directory object and i can t find the web site description property which i d like to use to name the exported file

2586224
regasm	gacutil
i sometimes need to compile on the command line when i write simple stuff and also to use gacutil and regasm

2586258
google-chrome	firefox
i don t know why i think it s magic but it works tested on ie google-chrome and firefox

2586276
implements	extends
basically what you need to do is implements a class that extends sfwidgetformchoicebase and write a method render therein

2586294
libpcap	wireshark
wireshark on windows at least uses libpcap

2586371
inherited	properties
it has detected inherited methods properties

2586379
lisp	scheme
will almost always work -- the couple cases where it won t work are in prefix languages lisp scheme and co. or postfix languages forth factor bc dc

2586429
openrowset	openquery
you can use openrowset or openquery

2586442
put	get
when you get to the point where you ve got that much code it s easiest just to put it into a file and import that particular module

2586450
folder	directory
is it possible to create a directory folder for individual records in access 2007

2586466
children	parent
that is there is no way to make the parent aware of the methods of the children

2586480
maven	pom.xml
ok now that you ve provided the relevant part of your pom.xml i can say that you basically have two options here either get the sources of the plugin and install it in your local repo or get the plugin from the maven repository of the project

2586534
google-chrome	firefox
you can also use any dom inspection tools like ie8 s development tools google-chrome developer tools or firefox add-on firebug to see the actual css applied to the google map control and see which rules come from where

2586558
ubuntu	linux
some modern linux systems at least ubuntu have deprecated prelinking their internal linking systems are efficient in remapping libraries on-the-fly or they provide some other mechanism to allow libraries to load without conflicts

2586578
post	get
i want to know few things about the get and post in terms of jquery

2586578
post	get
i am not using either get or post in this method

2586578
post	get
either get or post while send and getting the data in php webapps

2586578
post	get
the code that i use first works fine even though i do not use any post or get methods

2586592
implements	extends
i am thinking of either extends defaultdatadescriptor or create a class which implements itreedatadescriptor

2586593
pull	push
this means that pull and push operations are automatically done with the main branch

2586600
put	get
2 if the __getattr__ hook didn t thrill you there s another option that i know of albiet with its own caveats and we ll get to those put the deprecated functions definitions inside __init__ and hide them with a custom __dir__

2586605
post	get
the differences between get and post is that using the get method parameters are sent as part of the url whereas with post parameters are sent in the body of the request

2586627
post	get
all data you send to a server from a browser in the normal case will be via http verbs request methods almost always get or post although there are others

2586627
post	get
jquery ajax methods can use get or post depending on what you tell them to do

2586628
textarea	textbox
is going to fail because text is not a property of html inputs or textarea which is how asp.net textbox are rendered

2586639
post	get
in terms of vocabulary the purists say that get should get information and post should post it

2586646
ready	each
when they are ready to crop the coordinates of each corner can be sent via ajax to the server

2586669
implements	extends
then we have abstractlist an abstract class implements list which provides implementation of almost everything a fully-fledged list needs - to create your own list implementation all you have to do is extends abstractlist and fill in a few methods

2586675
folder	directory
so instead of pasting them into the directory via explorer use visual studio to paste the files into the folder

2586749
ubuntu	linux
i would like to optimise this as far as possible at minimum inconvenience to end users who will probably use it as an uncompiled collection of python scripts and will be using windows mac and mainly ubuntu linux

2586759
folder	directory
for example if you want to create a folder whose name matches one of your id values as a sub folder under the directory where your database is stored you could use this code

2586787
unsigned	short
also comp_t is said to be floating-point value consisting of a 3-bit base-8 exponent and a 13-bit mantissa but i think u_int16_t is just a unsigned short int

2586814
qtextedit	qtextdocument
basically qtextedit allows you to read and edit qtextdocument object that is essentially what you want to serialize and deserialize

2586814
serializable	deserialization
implementing serializable deserialization of qtextdocument should not be way to complicated because all the building blocks of qtextdocument are serializable

2586851
rss	feed
can t an rss feed do the job for you

2586874
client-side	server-side
this question mixes client-side scripting with server-side parsing

2586912
nunit	mspec
i ve seen mspec used with nunit on some blogs and discussions

2586912
nunit	mspec
in fact most of the examples on the web that i ve seen demonstrate mspec with some kind of nunit dependancy or integration

2586912
nunit	mspec
my team is attempting to use mspec without nunit on a new asp.net mvc2 project

2586912
nunit	mspec
are there benefits to using mspec with nunit

2587093
post	get
i ll update my post once i get more information

2587163
hash	salt
i could instead send a random number or one-way hash of their e-mail address plus random salt

2587172
junit	powermockito
yes this works by using the powermockito rule available if you use junit 4.7+

2587176
folder	directory
i looked a bit more at that project and see that there is a folder directory under it that has the source code with the function you are referencing

2587189
jstl	taglib
your example is not mvc at all but a good starting point is the javaserver pages taglib jstl

2587194
virtualbox	bootcamp
also with bootcamp you have to reboot the machine to switch between windows and os x so virtualbox is the way to go

2587238
hide	show
i d like to load all the forms in one go so clicking through the buttons essentially hide show the relevant forms

2587250
post	get
i ve read in other post that the search controller should use get but i think it makes more sense to use post because of the large number of search params

2587250
post	get
this article talks about using binding instead of request.form to get at the post data

2587259
getter	setter
if you want to call predefined methods to do something in the get or set implement the property getter setter to call those methods

2587269
hide	show
i have spent the whole day trying to make a script which on submit hide the form and show hidden with animated progress bar

2587269
opera	firefox
finally my script works in internet explorer firefox opera but.

2587297
nunit	mspec
mspec does not depend in any way on nunit or xunit

2587297
nunit	mspec
what you can do although it s neither required nor do i see any benefit in doing it is to use nunit s assertion library assert.istrue et al. together with mspec

2587299
post	get
for the get vs post question i m still struggling with that general question myself but i do have an opinion on your specific use of it

2587299
post	get
now i may be way off with my get vs post opinion here but i think there will be a lot of agreement on the class vs formcollection opinion

2587301
qgroupbox	qtextedit
for example if the names of your qgroupbox qlabel and qtextedit are group label and edit you can use

2587314
width	height
x y width and height however mean different things for different shapes

2587331
division	addition
in particular note the last line in addition this implementation quarters this amount. i take that to mean that the division by four is in fact entirely arbitrary

2587376
switching	screens
if the users are spending a majority of their time on one screens and don t commonly want to switching to the other screens the tabbar may be a bit of overkill

2587419
int	boolean
when you pass a lambda to sort you need to return an int not a boolean

2587432
width	height
self.fvidscale_cap.set_property caps gst.caps_from_string video x-raw-yuv width 256 height 192

2587440
puts	gets
maybe use a sleep function after puts and gets to give the transaction time to finish and see if that makes a difference

2587450
redhat	fedora
my system is a centos system so i imagine it is probably either ferencing the default fontconfig.properties.src file or the fontconfig.fedora.properties.src file since centos and fedora are both derived from redhat

2587489
prepare	execute
you have no error checking on the prepare execute calls so there s no way to tell if either spit out an error

2587520
int	boolean
you cannot use an int in place of a boolean expression in a conditional is not legal

2587528
submit	submission
by submission it to a timer you can submit it to a new thread and not do the thread management yourself

2587549
client-side	server-side
so this is actually done server-side rather than client-side

2587557
pop-up	dialog
as security restriction every time you want to save a file it pop-up the save as dialog box asking the user where to save it

2587569
mxml	haxe
for this simple application i would suggest using haxe since it is free and easy to use for simple swfs no mucking about with mxml etc

2587576
put	get
it s inside a bigger array i need to get the first and second hef attribute seperatly so that i can put one href as a link and another with a

2587613
typedef	struct
the header has a typedef struct and a number of function declarations

2587615
implements	extends
public class myview extends myapp implements viewswitcher.viewfactory

2587622
min	max
the reason for the error is that you can not use aggregate ie min max count... functions in the where clause - only in the having clause can you do this

2587691
implements	extends
create a custom class mypanel that extends htmlpanel and implements hasclickhandlers

2587699
public	protected
also you might consider following the proper .net event pattern of making the event public calling a protected virtual method name onwhateveryoureventisnamed and in that method invoking the event with this and a new event args

2587702
post	put
i put his post here because i know you always active so please don t consider this a bad question and share me your opinions

2587751
min	max
i m looking for an algorithm to find bounding box max min points of a closed quadratic bezier curve in cartesian axis

2587770
getter	setter
however it s a good idea not to add any listeners unnecessarily and it s also a good idea to keep any sort of business logic out of getter setter but that s strictly for the sake of code legibility

2587789
folder	directory
assuming your server has mod_rewrite enabled you should be able to put this inside a .htaccess file in the root folder of your site inside a directory or virtualhost section

2587821
background-color	transparency	border-color	background-color
to answer the question as posed you can only set background-color and border-color to the transparency value

2587863
rss	feed
check if the page has a rss representation and pick the article text from the rss feed instead

2587890
mockups	balsamiq
balsamiq mockups for xwiki is the closest thing i ve seen

2587921
post	put
see this post and put a check for the object types before

2587923
profiling	instrumentation
if you enable full profiling of the application by line the instrumentation performed by aqtime will be so heavy and the data collected so much it will slow down your application a lot

2587941
post	put
i found i could use add_action loop_start interceptme to put something at the top before post or a single post but it still left the sidebar on the right

2587950
post	get
the difference is that one is accessed when a post is performed the other is accessed when a get is performed

2587980
hide	show
i m using a bit growing to a lot of jquery to hide some images and show a single image when a thumb is clicked

2588004
openerp	tryton
tryton might also be a starting point it s gpl3 and iirc a fork of openerp

2588036
gridview	sqldatasource
my gridview is attached to a sqldatasource and naturally has all the bells and whistles that that combination affords

2588071
erlang	scheme
according to the computer language benchmark game the luajit implementation seems to beat every other jit-ed dynamic language v8 tracemonkey plt scheme erlang hipe by an order of magnitude

2588107
wordpress	joomla
why not to use one of existing cms wordpress joomla drupal...

2588115
min	max
assuming you will only have one max huge assumption you can do min tableaid where grade select max grade etc....

2588118
vb.net	vb6
i have a vb6 application that needs to communicate with a vs2008 vb.net wcf server

2588118
vb.net	vb6
i have built a vb.net wcf dll to be used on the client side and it --almost-- works with the vb6 application

2588118
vb.net	vb6
when i try to run the vb6 app in debug mode i get could not find endpoint element with name nettcpbinding_icomportmanager and contract icomportmanager in the servicemodel client configuration section. using a dummy vb.net client app with the same wcf dll works fine

2588122
jflex	cup
use jflex to scan the input and tokenize and cup to create a grammar if you want to handle more input

2588142
inherited	properties
combobox and popupbutton extends different classes so they inherited different properties and methods

2588181
width	height
i have 2 canvases one uses html attributes width and height to size it the other uses css

2588202
visualvm	yourkit
for profiling you can use visualvm yourkit etc

2588205
min	max
if you just want a axis-aligned bounding box i think you need to find the min and max of each x y for each control point of all the segments

2588208
super	abstract
you cannot use an interface to enforce a constructor you should probably use a common abstract super class with the desired constructor

2588278
getter	setter
the getter and setter map the nid field to the id field

2588297
jobs	cron
i believe path alias also can be created in cron jobs but i m not quite sure

2588319
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
use existing core exceptions where appropriate argumentexception invalidoperationexception etc

2588378
stateless	stateful
we started a discussion about stateful or stateless webservices for this approach

2588404
width	height
it seems that the width and height attributes determine the width or height of the canvas s coordinate system whereas the css properties just determine the size of the box in which it will be shown

2588404
width	height
the canvas element has two attributes to control the size of the element s bitmap width and height

2588404
width	height
the width attribute defaults to 300 and the height attribute defaults to 150

2588457
post	get
if so i would send the data to delete via post instead of get so that it can t be navigated to directly

2588470
pull	push
pull push to remote git

2588533
for-loop	if-statement
can t go much simpler that one for-loop and no if-statement

2588551
exponent	modulo
to give just a very rough estimate on the speed of this montgomerys reduction i have an old benchmark that performs a modular exponentiation with 64-bit modulo and exponent in 1600 ns on a 2.4ghz core 2

2588642
ienumerable	iqueryable
that s why a repository should be an iqueryable and ienumerable

2588712
16-bit	64bit
i can t test anything to complete my post because i believe that command.com runs in 16-bit mode and 64bit versions of windows on which i m running don t support that mode anymore so no more command.com for me

2588751
folder	directory
it may map to a different folder in other languages but as long as you get the directory from the environment variable and not hard-code it then it doesn t really make a difference

2588856
ubuntu	linux
go get virtual box and create an ubuntu or fedora image or whatever other flavor of linux you may prefer and use that for development

2588858
maven	pom.xml
i have a stable opensource library and was wondering how and if i can publish my lib to maven official repositories so people can include it in their pom.xml files and get the dependency downloaded automatically

2588865
public	protected
another option is to create a public or protected constructor in base that will take the parameters and populate the vector directly

2588890
powerpc	i386
so if you are using the apple-supplied python on 10.6 distutils will supply -arch i386 -arch powerpc -arch x86_64 the three archs that it was built with

2588925
imagemagick	mogrify
you can use mogrify from imagemagick and floodfill to fill the countries with color

2588927
oembed	feed
i m using the jquery oembed plugin to display videos from a vimeo feed

2588945
multiplying	add
then to take the intersection of two vectors you multiplying the terms and to take the union you add the terms

2588974
public	protected
if you want the container in the base class to remain private you might consider adding a public or protected function in base to allow the derived class to add a range

2588974
public	protected
and as zdan suggested this functionality could be part of public or protected constructor for base if that makes more sense which is likely

2588997
udp	tcp
instead you can use udp and implement your own scheme for verification of data that is less stringent than tcp

2589032
integer	fractions
if you want an idea to get you started off the cuff i d suggest calculating the minutes in your input range remembering that a tdatetime value is a floating point where the integral value is the number of days and the fractions part is a portion of a day then incrementing thru the range and for each integer step day subtract the appropriate number of minutes for that day from the total based on your rules and the start end-time of the first last days in the range when those days are encountered in the range intervening days being of course complete 24 hour periods

2589050
put	get
key-value systems basically support get put and delete operations based on a primary key

2589102
mouseleave	mouseenter
i have 2 divs above each others at a given moment one is shown and the other is hidden the script should display #div2 when the mouseenter #div1 and should show #div1 when the mouseleave #div2

2589107
inherited	subclassing
enums are good for a fixed set of options - in your case you want the flexibility of inherited so just use subclassing directly

2589129
calloc	malloc
short answer change your innermost malloc to a calloc

2589142
uilabel	uibutton
i have a nib with a uiview that contains some uilabel uibutton etc

2589193
post	get
if you post some code you could get a bit clearer answer

2589223
firefox	safari	webkit	gecko	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this handles webkit safari google-chrome etc gecko firefox and khtml konqueror

2589257
width	height
for example if the aspect ratio width height of the screen is larger than the aspect ratio of the image then it s too wide - so scale the width of the image but keep the height the same size as the viewport

2589267
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
if you have wsdl use the svcutil.exe tool or the wsdl.exe tool to generate proxy classes and dtos for the xml messages being sent and received on the wire

2589282
min	max
an example being a list of ints and a struct containting two ints min and max for selection purposes

2589282
min	max
there selection would be based upon b a- min b a- max

2589325
sorting	filtering
actually if the task really is about users finding files of a particular size range sorting or filtering the list by file size by default or as a user option is probably the best solution

2589333
post	get
here is an msdn article on this and to get managed call-stacks i have few post

2589375
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i tested firefox 3.6 msie 7 safari 4 google-chrome 4 and opera 10 and they all do in fact support creating cookies via third party javascript even when third party cookies are disabled

2589378
put	get
in this case you can probably get away with because it looks like the filter on the id column will limit you to one record but generally what you need to do instead is put a full-text index on the name column and write the query like this

2589391
wikitext	mediawiki
i wrote some code to do this a few years back but it never got released because parsing mediawiki wikitext semantically is basically impossible

2589391
wikitext	mediawiki
the problem is that mediawiki allows you to freely intermingle wikitext constructs with html constructs and the official parser in mediawiki works by progressively transforming the wikitext into html mostly using a horrifically complex set of regular expression substitutions

2589391
wikitext	mediawiki
basically it s my opinion that mediawiki wikitext is unsuitable for any purpose besides being translated into html and if you want to parse anything out of it you re probably best off using a piece of code that translates it to html and then parsing that html

2589427
width	height
you need to define width and height in order for overflow to work otherwise it would just expand

2589462
cpu	processors
although the same opcode was chosen deliberately and as far as the processors state is concerned they make no difference the execution time - and the exact internal implementation - can differ on a ht pause vs non-ht nop cpu

2589542
httphandler	httpmodule
i want to resolve whatever from inside non-page contexts such as global.asax httpapplication httpmodule httphandler etc

2589543
wordpress	joomla
joomla drupal and wordpress all come with so many out of the box features you d have to strip out - look for something that starts fairly simple

2589555
google-chrome	firefox
of course i think google-chrome s developer tools and firebug web developer for firefox are tremendously helpful as well...each tool has it s area that it helps with

2589572
builtin	isinstance
the isinstance builtin is the preferred way if you really must but even better is to remember python s motto it s easier to ask forgiveness than permission

2589593
vim	textmate
i often work in eclipse but recently switched to textmate which is in my opinion the best text editor out there barring perhaps vim or something like that but i find the learning curve too steep to jump into that quite yet

2589660
hash	md5
normally with http-html requests cookies would store a md5 hash representing a session id

2589662
post	get
but per alex s post you don t need to manipulate the date string to get the sort order right...so lose the .split -

2589675
children	parent
when adding a child object to the parent children collection using the code below i can t get the id of the persisted child until i commit the transaction

2589697
width	height
i have a flash movie height 151px width 228 this is placed within a table cell

2589726
many-to-many	one-to-many
i am having trouble working out how to correctly cache one-to-many or many-to-many relationships in nhibernate

2589730
vbscript	jscript
if you need your code to be a service but to be activated every hour the easiest approach would be to make your service a com object and have a simple task scheduled every hour that invokes a jscript vbscript that creates your com object and calls simple method on it

2589746
children	parent
i m looking for a generic dao implementation in hibernate that includes parent child relationship management adding removing getting children setting parent etc

2589792
action-filter	onactionexecuting
all you have to do is access the actionexecutingcontext of an overloaded onactionexecuting method and make identity public instead of private so your action-filter can access it

2589858
chunked	transfer-encoding
server gives responses with transfer-encoding chunked here sample response

2589862
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
pick up its output with firebug for firefox or the built-in consoles in the developer tools in safari and google-chrome ie no help as usual

2589899
inherited	properties
however your class would need to inherited from qobject use the q_object macro and register the properties for all that to work.

2589931
profiling	benchmarking
of course only benchmarking and profiling will tell you if that s actually going to be a benefit for your particular situation

2589948
move	drag
after the drag and drop of the child form is completed the artifacts stay around generally but i ve found that setting focus to a different application s window and then refocusing back on to my application window that it is redrawn and all is good again until the child forms are move once again

2589960
width	margin
the fixed width keeps the text from filling the window and the margin 0 auto centers the h1 tag itself

2590000
strcpy	malloc	strcpy	strdup	strdup	malloc
strdup is basically a shortcut that does a malloc and a strcpy and you don t have to worry about the size of addr upfront

2590061
post	get
another way to do it which could be cleaner would be to get the url that jquery post to from the form s action attribute

2590075
integer	unsigned
it doesn t matter whether you declare your column as integer unsigned integer bigint or whatever

2590155
int	double
the type of a unix timestamp is an int and you are reading data as a double

if you are uploading the binary you are probably running into a library compatibility issue between debian and centos

2595563
int	double
converting a 64-bit int to double

2595610
width	height
i am having an issue with pagesettings.printablearea s width and height values

2595610
width	height
width height and size properties claim to get or set the values

2595610
width	height
attempting to set the height width or size gives a compiler error cannot modify the return value of system.drawing.printing.pagesettings.printablearea because it is not a variable

2595662

2595672
subtract	add	min	max
as far as placing it in the center calculate the average of the max and min for both the rectangle and the pie slice and add or subtract the difference of these to whichever one you want to move

2595728
post	get
i would recommend sticking with prism and trying to get it to work on your distro maybe post a question on so s sister site serverfault.com or superuser.com

2595761
width	height
after working with the .net gdi+ rectangle object i ve noticed that if i create a rectangle that is x 0 y 0 width 100 height 100 the right and bottom properties are set to 100 100

2595851
post	get
here is the relevant selection section if i need to post more code please let me know and i really appreciate any help with this... please forgive my alert message i was just happy at that point that i get something back from the row selection

2595852
cos	sin
xradius and yradius can t both be 0 because both sin and cos would have to be 0 for all angles included above for that to be the case

2595884
qobject	qwidget	qthread	qobject	qthread	qwidget
both qwidget and qthread inherit non-virtually from qobject

2595901
getter	setter
key problem here is that the printablearea property only has a getter it doesn t have a setter

2595907
pop-up	dialog
my problem is i d like to implement that dialog when the user attempts to close the browser rather than display the ugly little pop-up box

2595942
implements	extends
much code is shared between clients but there are also many differences which i implements by subclassing controllers and views to overload or extends existing features or introduce new ones

2595991
jar	war
assuming you are using an older ant distribution that lacks the war task use the jar task which war inherits from

2595991
jar	war
i don t know what your build.xml looks like but i would venture to guess it has a war or jar task

2595993
implements	extends
i am implements my own authorizationstrategy extends iauthorizationstrategy

2596003
ncover	dotcover
commenters have noted this to work in ncover as well as dotcover + nunit

2596008
stdout	stderr
if this happens to others i bet their libc is buffering their stdout stderr before sending the data to the os

2596021
google-chrome	firefox
cutting to the chase here it shows that google-chrome and firefox when set to remember the login-information for a specific website send these information with every single post back

2596021
google-chrome	firefox
ergo my timer with a tick every 30 second had its call back parameters extended with the user s login preferences when having set google-chrome or firefox to remember your latest login and password

2596021
google-chrome	firefox
this allows my site to support the login-preference memory in google-chrome and firefox

2596035
width	height
it is simplest to pass in double.positiveinfinity for the width and height because it allows your usercontrol to choose its own width and height

2596035
width	height
if you explicitly set the width height it doesn t matter much but this way your usercontrol has the option of using wpf s layout system to automatically grow when necessary if the data is larger than expected

2596035
margin	height
note that all the layout is done by wpf s layout given the usercontrol size and the specified height and margin

2596044
margin	text-indent
1 tweaking text-indent margin padding etc

2596044
width	font-size
because it would be dependent on font-size default white-space width etc

2596047
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
often it s good to use multiples of 1024 and 8192 has been shown as a good sweet spot for most applications and the reason the java s bufferedinputstream and bufferedoutputstream use that value for the default buffer sizes

2596071
expression-blend	silverlight
with silverlight it looks like if i want a drag and drop approach to build my interface i would need expression-blend to do that

2596081
google-chrome	firefox
the reason why firefox performed the binding and raised the onload event on the 1st snippet and the others didn t might be because the firefox google-chrome its user interface itself is written and automated using javascript - that s why it s so flexible and easy to write extensions on it

2596110
min	max
edit you can t group by aliases of group columns min max count etc but using aliases of functions concat you can

2596131
ienumerable	icollection
alternatively you could also use either icollection or ienumerable since they are also both interfaces implemented by the generic dictionary collection

2596144
folder	dir
like admin userscontroller also the controller file has to be put in an admin folder under the app controllers dir

2596202
srt	subtitle
take a movie with subtitle in srt format with the subtitle de-syncronized having a delay of say 3 seconds

2596228
children	parent
at the moment it traverses thru all the tree structure fine but switching from one parent to another does not close the previous children but rather only the each individual parent elements as a user browses

2596228
children	parent
i assume my problem is jquery isn t closing the children between each new parent so i need to make a call but i m a bit lost on how to do that

2596258
serializable	deserialization
learn about serializable and deserialization to find out how to do this

2596280
boost	allocator
in c++0x allocator should be able to call any constructor not just the copy constructor so it might be that boost s allocator already support this to an extent

2596293
getter	setter
create an additional surrogate property of string type with a getter and setter that reads or updates the actual property

2596295
chunked	transfer-encoding
since the content length of a gzipped response is unpredictable and it s potentially expensive and slow to compress it fully in memory first then calculate the length and then stream the gzipped response from memory the average webserver will send them in chunks using transfer-encoding chunked without a content-length header

2596295
chunked	transfer-encoding
you have to determine the transfer-encoding response header and if it equals to chunked then you have to parse it as a chunked stream

2596314
post	put
i m redirecting you to a previous post where you put a link to this topic i made sooner this day highlight text except html tags

2596329
content-disposition	content-type
--append lets you add arbitrary headers to the mail which is where you should specify the content-type and content-disposition

2596338
postgresql	mysql
so if i want the performance of doing reads from ram and the durability of writes to disc then the size of the tables are very limited compared to a traditional rdbms like mysql or postgresql

2596364
awt	swing
also think of the awt swing event-dispatcher thread

2596396
hash	salt
the dynamic salt is plenty - the main purpose of a salt is to prevent rainbow-table attacks if the hash are ever acquired by a malicious party and the reason for dynamic salt is to further prevent special-case rainbow table generation from breaking all passwords simultaneously

2596396
hash	salt
aside from that though it can t hurt to salt regardless of whether or not the library has salting built in though unless you re passing it more info than just the item to be hash it doesn t really have anything to use as a dynamic salt so chances are it doesn t salt for you if it s not already obvious that it does

2596438
width	height
the above code basically detects a single tap on a small image width 18 and height 36

2596452
width	height
even if the text size is far larger than the width or height of the textview

2596457
width	height
i have noticed and heard mentioned on other sites that if my image has a height or width greater than 2 15 i get a parameter not valid exception but i have not found any official documentation of this limit

2596499
int	boolean
for example a book item has two properties int pages and boolean hardcover

2596720
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
if you define your own data structure you have to manage all aspects of what you re doing -- if you want a variable number of records you ll need to manage that space with malloc free realloc

2596722
min	max
i want to give to algorithm parameters like min length and max line distortion

2596737
folder	directory
i personally use a relative path to a directory so i can change the root folder in case of system migration or load balancing

2596746
ant	maven
at my new gig they use ant and cannot be persuaded to move to maven

2596776
for-loop	arrays
anyways an easier way to do it is to calculate the length of the arrays and then calculate which variable needs to be used for that particular position using a single for-loop

2596805
vim	emacs
i would prefer to write my commit messages in vim but it is opening them in emacs

2596839
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this seems to fix most of the issues in firefox google-chrome ie7 and safari

2596871

they give an example of required #other checked but i want my field to be required if the #other field is either checked or filled i don t know whether it will be a checkbox radio button or textbox beforehand

2596927
width	height
copy a part of src_im onto dst_im starting at the x y coordinates src_x src_y with a width of src_w and a height of src_h

2596935
handsoap	curb
handsoap is active uses curb and nokogiri and was a delight to discover after my soap4r disappointments

2596942
g++	gcc
nowadays i understand that gccxml can output an xml file representing any c++ source that gcc can compile since it actually uses the g++ front end to do the parsing

2596951
datalist	repeater
you can use the data binding shortcut within the nested repeater datalist but not to set the datasource as you have done

2596952
freebsd	netbsd
receiving recommendations for commercial tcp ip stack implementation based on freebsd or netbsd

2597024
post	put
i ve read another post about this as well and there s a suggestion there to put the session tools config keys in the app config rather than the global config but i don t think that s relevant to this usage where the apps run independently

2597095
richtextbox	contentcontrol
the reason a readonly richtextbox doesn t scroll is because the default template for richtextbox uses a scrollviewer instead of a contentcontrol

2597118
hash	md5
in the .net framework there are a couple of ways to calculate an md5 hash it seems however there is something i don t understand

2597146
hash	md5
md5 represents the abstract class from which all implementations of the md5 hash algorithm inherit

2597146
hash	md5
md5cryptoserviceprovider computes the md5 hash value for the input data using the implementation provided by the cryptographic service provider csp

2597171
onresize	onload
if you want something to work onload and onresize you should do

2597195
post	get
i don t know why browsers favor their cached input field values over what is returned from the post yet give an honest representation of what is retrieved from a get

2597195
post	get
this might actually be what they d expect though and i generally like post then redirect to get as it prevents potentially damaging re-posting

2597232
int	chars
byte pointers chars s than word pointers int s

2597302
opencv	emgucv
it also seems it s the opencv project is my best bet so far i ll try and use it with this other project opencvdotnet or emgucv

2597369
avr	microcontroller
i have what i hope is a simple question pertaining to the avr microcontroller

2597374
queue	fifo
since you have only one worker thread and the queue is used in a fifo manner tasks will be executed in order

2597374
implements	extends
note many people will argue that you should not extends a threadpoolexecutor but instead say you implements executorservice and have your class contain a threadpoolexecutor which you delegate to aka composition

2597388
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
though i have been able to do it in ie and firefox but its not working for opera and google-chrome

2597399
opera	firefox
this works as expected in webkit browsers and opera but it seems like firefox doesn t update the background-color in css immediately after a mouseout event occurs so the current background-color doesn t get drawn if a mouseout occurs and it isn t followed up by another event that calls the draw routine

2597399
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
it works just fine in opera google-chrome and safari

2597419
min	max
heap structure can be built in o n time there is min heap and max heap

2597419
min	max
just by building the heap you find the min and max

2597486
audiotrack	audiorecord
i ve noticed that the c++ classes underlying the audiotrack and audiorecord apis in android both have a latency method that is not exposed via jni

2597486
audiotrack	audiorecord
as far as i can see the latency method in audiorecord still does not take into account the hardware latency they have a todo comment for that but the latency method in audiotrack does add in the hardware latency

2597520
width	height
it works but i have some try call editor event handler catch stuff in callee page because not every editor provides these functions and some attributes editor width height for instance that are loaded as variables declared in javascript

2597544
dependencyobject	observablecollection
another way of achieving this would be that you implement a new xxxviewmodel class that derives from dependencyobject and you put this one in the observablecollection

2597558
scons	autotools	ant	maven
you can use gnu make optionally with autotools ant maven cmake or scons among many

2597558
debian	linux
once you have the basic build working you can package your program as a .deb and or .rpm so it can be easily installable by users of major gnu linux distributions debian and red hat

2597584
viewdidload	viewwillappear
the content of viewa that u would be setting in viewdidload method of the viewcontroller of viewa can be set in viewwillappear

2597588
google-chrome	firefox
this application run well in firefox 3+ google-chrome and ie8

2597593
post	get
inside the function i call 2 other functions that use getjson and post with json as a return object to get some data

2597689
hide	show
try loading a local file that is blank or has a loading graphic when you hide it rather than just loading new content when you show it

2597691
set	bag
a multiset or bag is a set that can have duplicate values and on which you can do set operations intersection difference etc

2597716
serializable	deserialization
you basically can create an object and use that as the basis for your input or output values and soap will handle the creation of a schema for serializable and deserialization for you automatically

2597749
disk	ram
for example for a good 64-bit machine 64 gb of ram about bytes and a couple of tb of disk usable as swap space for virtual memory about bytes

2597749
disk	ram
i think it s more practical to put it this way especially on a 64-bit machine with decent amounts of ram and disk upper bounds of long integers are way bigger than anything you ll ever compute

2597750
vbscript	jscript
note that the abive is achieved without com purely via one registry setting and a file containing a blob of script javascript jscript vbscript etc. the script jscript vbscript may in turn work with com objects should your menu action logic reside in such an object

2597832
mouseover	mouseout
i am using javascript mouseover and mouseout events when i move my mouse very quickly the events are not triggered

2597863
hash	md5
md5 hash object 017f8ae0

2597863

2597863
hash	md5
md5 hash object 01806220

2597893
int	double
assuming you re sure the result will be convertible to int you can parse it as double and cast to int

2597899
int	double
you can parse the string as a double and later cast the double to int

2597899
int	double
however casting from double to int is subject to precision lost or even int overflow

2597942
subtraction	addition
this algorithm uses o 1 storage with the temp variable which could be eliminated using the addition subtraction swap technique i m not very good at runtime analysis but i believe this is still o n even though we re performing many swaps

2597973
post	get
is get not post

2598017
post	put
by contrast methods such as post put and delete are intended for actions which may cause side effects either on the server or external side effects such as financial transactions or transmission of email

2598036
width	height
taglib doesn t contain any information on component s attributes id width height title and ide cannot therefore check my syntax nor can it suggest attributes while i m typing

2598049
mouseover	mousemove
javascript won t try to interpolate between frames. meaning yes if you move your mouse fast enough one mousemove event will fire on one side of your object and the next mousemove will fire on the other side so mouseover and out never get fired and you re none the wiser

2598057
post	put
actions that don t seem to quite fit the rest model i m not sure whether put or post is the most appropriate method

2598057
post	put
so we could put post to

2598142
zlib	quazip
however there is an open source qt library called quazip which uses zlib comes with qt and provides just that

2598218
mouseup	mousedown
using listbox and it s events mousedown to get data with indexfrompoint method and mouseup to call calendar s doubleclick event

i am evaluating raphaeljs svg vml for developing a similar component like flicr map or google map based on purely drawing rather than utilizing images

2598404
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i need second part other browsers google-chrome and safari grabbing address bar but firefox is urgently

2598424
equals	compareto
compareto should return -1 when this is less than o 0 when they are equals and 1 when this is greater than o

2598429
accessor	properties
you can have the object implement all of its properties in terms of that dictionaryâ that is have the object own a dictionary and have its accessor retrieve values from and store values in that dictionary by sending it objectforkey and setobject forkey messages

2598483
cos	sin
the proper way of doing this would be using sin cos to generate the x and y coordinates for a semi-circle as stated in your question

2598486
division	modulo
i would like to define some kind of safe division and modulo function one that would return some predefined value when attempting to divide by zero

2598487
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
with ms.net you are fixed with key areas like os and web server but with mono you can choose almost any linux or unix distribution and you have more web servers which can run mono web apps like apache nginx lighttpd compared to dominant iis on windows

2598487
postgresql	mysql
also databases like mysql postgresql or nosql stuff runs better and are more supported on linux machines

2598514
gwt	cssresource
in order for gwt to report any css errors misspelled missing class names you need to be including your csss in your gwt project via cssresource check out the docs for usage examples etc

2598527
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it behaves perfectly in ie firefox safari but google-chrome seems to reload hang for a second when setting location.hash

2598569
boost	stl
p.s. i don t prefer a big switch sweat and also i know boost is capable of everything i would prefer a stl solution

2598573
put	http-post
what you actually want to do is to read the value of hour in case of page-submission via http-post and put it there as default value

2598577
jboss	glassfish
eclipse java ee has a lot of server adapters allowing development against many different application servers like jboss glassfish and websphere

2598580
gtk	gdk
ideally using only gtk gdk nothing x11-specific

2598609
equals	compareto
hence you may want to consider overriding equals and hashcode to make them consistent with compareto

2598611
google-chrome	firefox
works perfect in ie firefox google-chrome

2598614
versioning	upgrade
when we upgrade a library it would be useful to quickly find out which projects have a dependency on the library and might need to use the new versioning

2598725
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in other words it s implemented by safari google-chrome firefox and internet explorer on the client side and apache or iis on the server side

2598728
tolower	toupper
the problem is that tolower toupper are fundamentally broken for many locales

2598752
binutils	newlib
anthony green did a blog series on coming up with an instruction set porting binutils gcc newlib and so on as well as setting up sim and qemu to emulate a machine with this new instruction set

2598758
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
for reasons beyond my control i am limited to a ui that uses dropdownlistfor text fields checkbox radiobuttons only - no fancy special ui controls

2598776
accessor	properties
then define the set accessor for the properties as internal

2598855
nsurlrequest	nsmutableurlrequest
look up the documentation for nsurlconnection and nsurlrequest and also nsmutableurlrequest

2598882
std	ostream
i would expect that c++ std ostream behaviour is consistent with the c i o printf

2598884
post	get
somebody has written a helpful blog post about how to get started -

2598995
hide	show
it doesn t hide show at all your script isn t touching it anywhere

2599008
filesystems	fat
as your other zip operations work i assume that writing is not a problem and you have enough disk space quota and are not writing files bigger than 2gb on a fat filesystems

2599014
integer	unsigned
what i missed was that unsigned int8 tinyint and the like are all a syntactic sugar synonyms for integer type which is always signed long long and the lengths given are for internal disk storage only are adjusted automatically and transparently to fit any value on least number of bits and are totally invisible and inaccessible from the api side

2599020
firefox	safari
i developed some javascript enhanced pages that run fine on recent firefox and safari

2599033
uiview	calayer
so i replaced the uiview by calayer

2599076
draggable	droppable
i then use jstree to make the menu items draggable and droppable

2599085
hide	show
form is show by .showdialog method in response to click event of button same event handler sets to hide the form

2599105
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i m trying to get this thing to work in ie any version - works in firefox opera safari google-chrome ...

2599115
jar	war
if you have a war you can use the embedded mode of the winstone servlet container to get a stand-alone executable jar

2599134
inherited	properties
your best bet is to recursively loop through all controls on the page looking for all controls that inherited from the basevalidator class and then set their enabled properties to false

2599142
keydown	keyup
try triggering the jquery keydown keyup event manually

2599150
tiff	png
those images are png but could just as easily have been tiff

2599196
isapi	iirf
web server a public on the internet iirf ionic s isapi rewrite filter current version installed

2599240
filtering	grouping
you could add another state grouping for filteredstates with the members unfiltered and filtering

2599256
wtl	atl
it s a bit confusing what ui framework you are using as you tagged your question with visual c++ which would suggest mfc atl wtl or win32 but you also tagged it with .net and the methods and properties you are mentioning suggest winforms

2599256
hide	show
if you are using winforms the easiest way would be to create several panel instances on your your form that contain the groups of controls you currently have on the different forms and just show hide the right panel depending on which button was pressed and what is the previous visible panel

2599270
division	multiplication
as a general rule division is slow and multiplication is faster and bit shifting is faster yet

2599270
128bit	64bit
to determine if this would be faster than the brute force as there will be many more multiplies since we will be using 32-bit registers to simulate 64bit and 128bit numbers profile it

2599272
mamp	wamp
you do not need a domain to get started with the development simply install wamp for windows or mamp if your apple freak like me these programs act as self contained mini servers very useful for development

2599272
mamp	wamp
then i d suggest trying it all out using html for starters just so you get used to the wamp mamp sever before heading over to for a brilliant set of tutorials on php

2599273
rss	feed
i have been working on creating an rss reader app for the iphone which allows me to view rss from an external feed

2599273
rss	feed
however the project im working on i need to be able to view an authenticated rss feed which is behind a login

2599307
irix	linux
the construct has worked since 2004 on irix and now when porting it actually do work on linux gcc too

2599352
put	get
my only idea is to put some changeable element to first cell of each row so it must be able to set get my values for each row but can t find yet any examples of it .

2599388
width	height
getting element size position width height of elements is sometimes elm.style.pixelheight width in ie rather than elm.offsetheight width but neither is reliable in ie especially in quirks mode and sometimes one gives a better result than the other

2599388
opera	safari
key event code differences key event codes vary wildly though if you look at quirksmode or javascript madness it s hardly specific to ie safari and opera are different again

2599388
mouseup	mousedown	keydown	mouseup	keydown	mousedown
note just returning false in keydown keypress mousedown mouseup click and reset will also prevent default

2599396
sorting	filtering
then you could access the data for sorting an filtering via a typed model

2599464
min	max
max min and index slicing they all do different things

2599464
min	max
in your list the order may not be sorted like your example so using slicing will not get the max min for you in those cases

2599464
min	max
if you want to get max min values just use max min functions

int	boolean
having said that if you are really unsure about this you could use an int value instead of the boolean and use the interlockedexchange function to write to the variable

2600872

without javascript this would fire a http request to the servlet which loads the mail identified by 1 forwards the request to a jsp which hide the message list in the view and show the mail in the view

2600964
onclick	onchange
the right thing to do would be to use onchange instead but unfortunately that doesn t fire at a useful time in ie so onclick is what we re left with

the easiest way i have found to get past the problem is to just post to a different url and redirect back

2601526
superclass	subclassing
the method in the superclass uses a method that is defined in the superclass as abstract not really abstract but implemented in the subclassing

superclass	subclassing
if i took off the abstract method from the superclass and just leave the implementation in the subclassing it does not recognize the method and i get subroutine abstract method not found error

2601542

i have done this in c# before although i can t remember the implementation details now but i remember it wasn t particularly difficult a couple of lines of code only for a website i worked on which required uploaded jpgs to be displayed within a frame such as you might hang on your wall and we needed to know whether to add the landscape or portrait version of the frame

2601687
portrait	landscape
a lot of digital cameras now have sensors within them to detect if the picture was taken in landscape or portrait mode

2601761
google-chrome	safari
ie safari google-chrome

2601773
put	get
if the function does nothing it still loads the page if i put a dialog box to show it fired it was a lot of clicks eventually i either get a big red x in the data grid view area or it loads fine depending on the page i get a x for pre-production but the other two loads fine the message box still shows up hundreds of times when you select them first

pylons	turbogears	pylons	repoze.who	turbogears	repoze.who
now if you consider that turbogears 2.0 is built on pylons and uses repoze.who for authentication it would seem in that light that repoze.who is pretty popular and could conceivably be the generally accepted way of doing things according to turbogears

2602344
opera	google-chrome
also i don t want to load the page through a proxy with ajax and switching to google-chrome opera is not an option either

2602358

2603949
width	margin
one way to get rid of problems on ie6 is using the imperfections of ie6 you know that width 100 in ie6 contains the padding and margin too so u shoulding worry but i do agree with above answer new browsers dont see both so you should consider dropping one of them

2603949
width	height
as for min- and max- the only way i was able to do that is with jquery u can always use the getboundingclientrect dom javascript that works only on ie to determine the height and width if u dont want to use jquery

2603952
post	get
i ve taken the code from kennytm s post and incorporated it into the payback function this could be adapted to create the array in the initwithcoder function and then send it through like the original code but for now - this will get you a result

each inherited the master properties sheet use view properties manager on vs toolbar

2604289
inherited	properties
you now have to inherited each build properties sheet into the respective properties settings of the project

2604289
inherited	properties
for example 32bit release build properties sheet has to be inherited by the 32bit release properties settings

2604302
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout
the mouseover and mouseout events fire when entering a child element using mouseenter and mouseleave doesn t do this eliminating the flicker caused by removing and adding the span

2604302
mouseover	mouseenter
the mouseenter event differs from mouseover in the way it handles event bubbling

2604308
cgpoint	cgrect
cgrect cgpoint etc

2604308
free	malloc
however if you do allocate them on the heap then you will need to use malloc free to manage them yourself

2604314
gridview	objectdatasource
there s an objectdatasource attached to the gridview .

2604329
fgets	fread
it s like fgets or fread compared to file_get_contents

2604335
fadein	hide
in almost all cases jquery uses the display style attribute to hide things so using this to initially hide something will work with whatever you want to use the element for later whether it s a dialog a simple fadein etc

2604396
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

2604398
ubuntu	linux
i am running linux ubuntu 9.10 so the extension for an executable is executablefile.out i am just getting into modular programming programming with multiple files in c and i want to know how to compile multiple files in a single makefile

2604409
post	get
my last post was met by smarmy unhelpful answers comments so i ll get right to it

2604423
ssl	https
it is possible to detect via javascript whether the current page being viewed is over an ssl connection document.location.protocol https but that s about it

2604467
implements	extends
basically server adapters are eclipse plugins and allow to extends the ide by implements a set of generic actions start debug stop deploy undeploy that are translated into server specific orders

2604484
hex	binary
i d like the binary value and hex value

2604511
nullpointerexception	indexoutofboundsexception
sure you should never handle nullpointerexception indexoutofboundsexception etc

2604518
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
because unlike unchecked-exception runtimeexception error and their subclasses you are required to catch them

2604521
rss	feed
i created a library that leverages the syndicationfeed classes in .net and allows you to read and write media rss feed

2604542
post	get
some scripts accept both get and post indiscriminately

2604544
int	chars	hex	binary
my solution would be to take the string convert it to a chars array and then convert the int values of the chars array into binary or hex through the integer.tobinarystring or integer.tohexstring or integer.tooctalstring if you would like

2604544
hex	binary
just replace binary string with hex and the function will do the same thing

2604580
min	max
for example you may need to create a bidirectional map data structure which you can implement by composing two unidirectional map data structures or you may need to create a stack that keeps track of a variety of statistics such as min max mean by using an existing stack data structure with an element type that contains the value as well as these various statistics

2604666
haskell	sml	haskell	ocaml	ocaml	sml
for anyone who s spent some time with sml ocaml haskell etc

2604689
jar	war
get rid of all jsf jar s jsf-api.jar and jsf-impl.jar in the war s and rely on the jsf libraries provided by the appserver

2604689
jar	war
get rid of all jsf jar s in the war s and provide them in ear only

2604689
jar	war
align all jsf jar s in the war s out to be of exactly the same make version build

2604715
dlsym	dlopen
prompted by nikolais suggestion i m looking at dlopen dlsym

2604715
dlsym	dlopen
start my test application and load the .so using dlopen 2 rtld_now then try to get the symbol for a debugging function using dlsym

2604715
put	get
i cant even get it if i put the

2604715
dlsym	dlopen
dlopen dlsym calls in my executable i m guessing i m either compiling the lib wrong or using dlsym incorrectly

2604766
strdup	malloc
however to be consistent with sample code posted above using strdup which internally make use of malloc your destructor should be as below

2604811
x86	64bit
on a 64bit machine the environment variable processor_architecture is x86 in visual studio

2604826
min	max
max min ports etc i cant seem to find a solution

2604888
post	get
save post get headers with wireshark

2604888
post	get
plus i don t know what the post get headers are

2604891
ubuntu	linux
exact linux distribution release version - ubuntu 9.04 9.10

2604893
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
ie simply repeats the request so it works for your purposes but firefox safari and opera seem to discard the post data

2604909
put	get	post	put	post	get
http 1.1 has a few commands get put post delete and a few others

2604916
post	get
take note that you re looking for parameters in get or post requests as such

2604924
toolbar	tabs
in other words if you have 5 different tabs that require their own toolbar create 5 usercontrols that contain a toolbar and load the correct one into the region when the user clicks on the tab

2604931
post	get
the url is being accessed by the client app and it sends post get data

2604942
put	get
as long as i put sleep b w sending command the calc.exe get it right

2604964
hex	binary
the logic i wish to achieve is scan through a binary file until the hex code ffd8 continue reading until ffd9 and only save what was between them discards the junk before and after but include ffd8 and ffd9 as the saved part of the file

2604972
directx	gdi
wpf is nice because it is based on directx no you don t need to know directx at all and will use the gpu and not gdi objects like traditional other ui platforms from microsoft

2604978
free	malloc
i have done the single-malloc trick for 2d arrays simply because of the mental exercise and the added convenience of a single malloc single free and it works beautifully just make sure to get a well-aligned memory chunk

2605026
children	parent
in my app you can hide an item and its children just by setting the parent element s visibility column to 0

2605040
apache	nginx
i had both apache and nginx with passenger installed and working fine on the same arch linux machine serving a rails app

2605040
apache	nginx
once with apache running and listening on port 80 i started nginx listening on the same port and got an expected error about the port being already bound

2605040
apache	nginx
i stopped apache and nginx restarted nginx and started getting bad gateway errors whenever i tried to access the rails app under nginx

2605060
post	get
what data are you sending in post or get i would recommend look thru the post get messages in firebug net panel in that page there are many hidden values which i think are time dependent and changes on each page load and may be valid once so load page get those values and send them with post messages see these

2605070
post	get
you can do this with post or get variables

2605087
versioning	upgrade
so if they in the future releases a new versioning i just put application in the new system folder and its upgrade right

2605103
children	parent
alternatively you can store references to children in the parent with

2605125
stdout	stderr
now if for some reason you want to completely ignore stdout or stderr and never see it again you can define your own file-like classes that simply discard the objects

2605223
codeigniter	cakephp
then you might be interested in experimenting with some mvc frameworks like cakephp codeigniter kohana.

2605235
qfile	qtextstream	qfile	qchar	qtextstream	qchar	qstring	qfile	qstring	qchar	qstring	qtextstream
see the documentation on qfile qtextstream qstring and qchar all of which is available on the qt documentation website

2605253
ubuntu	linux
i want to develop say a command line interpreter in linux ubuntu in c

2605284
shadowing	named
it looks like you might have a named shadowing conflict where column id ... hides student.id

2605295
pull	push
clones get the source repo set as default for push pull in the .hg hgrc file

2605321
folder	directory
i.e you could write a post-build command to copy your folder to the output directory

2605324
getter	setter
getter and setter

2605349
getter	setter
afaik there is no standard name for a single function that acts both as a getter and as a setter

2605353
public	protected
public doesn t allow any such targeting and using protected to get the effect with inheritance is awkward if there really is no conceptual is a relationship

2605364
stdout	fflush
occasionally the stdout needs more than a write method fflush is another common one which stringio will handle

2605421
width	height
i want to set the width and height of the infowindow using v3

2605457
ubuntu	debian
for debian ubuntu similar users the package is called libio-all-perl

2605461
cvs	svn
i m not referring to cvs or svn

2605476
calloc	malloc
i ve read with interest the post c difference between malloc and calloc

2605476
calloc	malloc
i m using malloc in my code and would like to know what difference i ll have using calloc instead

2605476
calloc	malloc
if i use calloc instead of malloc then i ll have

2605476
for-loop	arrays
in both scenarios i m just writing to arrays in the sense that for any given iteration in the for-loop i m writing each arrays sequentially from the first element to the last element

2605485
width	height
try adding a div with desired width height and content inside the infowindow using infowindow.setcontent method

2605496
calloc	malloc
assuming the total amount of memory being initialized in your two examples is the same allocating the memory with calloc might be faster than allocating the memory with malloc and then zeroing them out in a separate step especially if in the malloc case you zero the elements individually by iterating over them in a loop

2605496
memset	calloc	memset	malloc	calloc	malloc
a malloc followed by a memset will likely be about as fast as calloc

2605499
post	get
if you have no control over the variables that are sent you may try using _server raw_http_post_data to get the original post request data before parsed then you can use the parse_str function to parse that string

2605502
inherited	subclassing
if you do need to allow uncontrolled inherited you re not willing to bet that subclassing will have very particular needs then you need to go for the full pattern

2605577
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
on my webpage when i press command link its opening a new page perfectly on ie7 firefox 3 google-chrome safari 4.0.4 but after this none of the parent page s command buttons are not working this happens only in safari.i am using jsf 1.2 mojara

2605605
width	height
i m not using it for an outlook newsletter but it should still work for that because it adds on the height and width attributes to the img tags

2605605
width	height
after dragging the control points to resize it just open the image properties and click ok and it will add the width and height attributes in again

2605646
versioning	upgrade
this seems to say that you can upgrade from any competing product or any existing versioning of visual studio even a trial one

2605646
versioning	upgrade
it doesn t explicitly mention the express edition but you could always install the trial versioning and upgrade that instead

2605678
unsigned	short	int	chars
the tricky thing is that the i should pass a 2 byte array for fid and int for len even though in c# fid is an unsigned short and len is an unsigned chars

2605686
typedef	struct
in the above typedef both entry entryp are defined apart from struct _entry

2605706
stdout	fflush
after your first printf call fflush stdout

2605708
int	chars
a chars is 1 byte an int is typically 4 bytes

2605715
int	chars
so for chars pointer it increments by 1 and for int by 4

2605720
mouseup	mousedown
i have tried live search from and i an struck in i need to get on mouseup and mousedown function for this code and i as i am new to ajax .

2605735
google-chrome	firefox
when preloading on testing server on mac i get io errorerror event- load never completed on firefox and google-chrome

2605753
ilist	icollection
seems to me you want that to be either a ilist or icollection

2605777
subtract	add
just add them all up and subtract the total you would expect if only 1001 numbers were used from that

2605786
subtract	add
if you know that we have the exact numbers 1-1000 you can add up the results and subtract 500500 sum 1 1000 from the total

2605808
capitalize	capitalization
in addition to alex s answer i note you seem to be using capitalization inconsistently - some first letters are capitalize and others aren t

2605808
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
bear in mind that while windows is not case-insensitive most platforms are case-sensitive - so if you weren t strict about using the same capitalization for the same name everywhere when you deploy you will get a lot of 404s in place of expected files

2605813
mouse	keyboard
jquery also has great hooks to fire javascript handlers in response to keyboard and mouse events

2605897
postgresql	mysql
i personally prefer postgresql over mysql and find it very scalable even with millions or even billions of rows when setup correctly

2605935
mouseleave	mouseenter
the toggle is fired on the mouseenter and mouseleave event thus creating the effect of the div to fold out on mouseenter and fold in on mouseleave

2605957
mouseleave	mouseenter
if you re going to use both mouseenter and mouseleave i d suggest using the hover function

2605959
children	parent
although you can only call so many of those in a day - so you may need to somehow keep track of which parent objects have their children updating and then process that offline

2605964
mouseover	mouseout
you can use the more common mouseover mouseout events to get a hover event that doesn t fire on internal mouse movements

2605964
mouseout	mouseleave
the mouse is over the element at page load time or the mouseleave the browser which can allow the mouse to leave the bounds of the element without firing a mouseout

2605964
hide	show
have separate function for over which show the content and out which hide it

2605974
mouse	keyboard
it works most of the time if nobody touches the screen mouse keyboard

2605980
google-chrome	firefox
for instance this works on ie firefox and google-chrome at least probably others

2606030
flexunit	cairngorm
does anyone know if it is possible to test remote procedure calls in cairngorm commands with flexunit 4

2606093
multiplying	add
every time you add a complex tool with byte-code generation you multiplying complexity

2606106
ant	maven
1 ant based and 2 the other maven based that consumes the jars of the other project via archiva

2606118
disk	ram
more bytes means more pages on disk and in sql server ram and thus more disk i o and more work for sql server

2606152
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux	solaris	irix	irix	linux
although it is not a posix standard interface the dladdr function is available on many systems including linux solaris darwin mac os x freebsd hp-ux and irix

2606176
versioning	upgrade
the main reason to upgrade to visual studio 2010 is the .net framework s new versioning 4.0 and all the accompanying tools you can use

2606176
versioning	upgrade
if you don t need this new versioning now you can delay the upgrade that s a reason

2606180
powerpc	i386
i am building for powerpc i386 and x86_64

2606182
postgresql	mysql
we support h2 mysql postgresql in our environment and i would prefer a solution which can be driven via jpa and reverse engineering ddl tools from hibernate

2606201
daemons	systemd
my eventual objective is to have several such processes running perhaps daemonized using the systemd daemons pear class and i would like to be able to manage them from some governing process also a php script

2606214
int	chars
given a string and an int n return a string made of n repetitions of the last n chars of the string

2606228
imperative	declarative
the common language runtime clr is designed as an intermediate language based on imperative programming ip but this has obvious implications when dealing with declarative programming dp

2606233
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i want to know which sites can give me information on the list of javascript functions that are supported by ie firefox opera safari

2606258
integer	unsigned
cast conv hex_val 16 10 as unsigned integer

2606470
onresume	onpause
activity is paused is written in the onpause method and activity is resuming in the onresume method of the activity

2606471
setinterval	settimeout
you might also prefer to use setinterval to avoid the repeated settimeout calls

2606539
strcpy	strncpy
for doing string concatenation i ve been doing basic strcpy strncpy of char buffers

2606542
post	get
i get the saved value fine but my model doesn t update on post

2606542
post	get
i get the list and it post the selected value back but does not pre-select the currently selected item in my model on the view

2606545
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox it s perfect and google-chrome it runs it once

2606557
strcpy	strncpy
if you only want to concatenate use strncpy don t use strcpy since it s more efficient

2606601
strcpy	strncpy	printf	strncpy	printf	strcpy
all printf functions check formatting and expand its corresponding argument thus it is slower than a simple strcpy strncpy which only copy a given number of bytes from linear memory

2606601
memcpy	strncpy
stick to strncpy memcpy when only need to copy a block of linear memory

2606609
strcpy	strncpy
strcpy strncpy etc only copies strings from one memory location to another

2606609
strcpy	strncpy	printf	strncpy	printf	strcpy
if as per your logic strcpy strncpy is already working for you no need to jump to printf

2606617
free	malloc
in fact for complex applications the performance of garbage collection is competitive with manual storage management based on malloc free

2606617
free	malloc
in this paper zorn describes how he modified some large heap intensive applications to use a conservative garbage collector instead of malloc and free

2606627
printf	strncpy
for most purposes i doubt the difference between using strncpy and printf is measurable

2606627
printf	strncpy
if there s any formatting involved i tend to stick to only printf rather than mixing in strncpy as well

2606652
public	protected
it s distinct from public protected and private

2606654
typedef	struct
a non-typedefed struct name in c requires struct to be prepended everywhere the type name is used so most people use typedef to create a new name for the type that does not need to have the struct keyword prepended all the time

2606654
typedef	struct
in all honesty the need to typedef to create new names for struct is a relic and it s a shame that c99 didn t follow c++ s lead and remove it

2606685
int	chars	int	double
according to this page decimal data type visual basic you need to suffix decimal literal values with the uppercase chars d otherwise the compiler will try to compile it as an appropriate but different numeric type like int long double etc

2606761
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
works nicely in ie google-chrome and safari but not in firefox or opera

2606774
hide	show
if it has show the ul or hide otherwise here is the prototype in php

2606804
typedef	struct
i actually don t use typedef for struct

2606845
width	height
that s because a span is an inline element by nature and won t accept arbitrary width nor height values

2606855
width	height
i developed an application which consists of uipickerview....it displays as default size in height of the uipickerview.i want to display the uipickerview as 320x480 size iphone simulator size ..so the whole screen has the picker view without using transorm property because it will stretched the whole view....its not looking good...even with selection indicator also stretched...i need not stretchable picker view..but need to show the picker view with the whole screen..we can control the width of the uipickerview..but how can we control the height of the uipickerview...

2606861
width	height
the span element being an inline element cannot take a width and a height

2606961
trac	bugzilla
in general people use what is called software configuration management software which usually includes a version control system like subversion mercurial git visual sourcesafe et cetera and a project management suite such as trac bugzilla google code sourceforge and the like

2606985
mp3	wav
looking for a program lib preferably in .net that can take a sound file mp3 wav etc and generate a sound wave image from it similar to image below

2607008
google-chrome	firefox
with google-chrome 4 and firefox is working fine

2607010
ubuntu	linux
spec linux ubuntu

2607029
memset	calloc
the calloc and memset approaches should be about the same and maybe slightly faster than zeroing it yourself

2607084
n-gram	words
it is generally implemented by doing statistical analysis of words and n-gram multi-word sequences against the metadata of the search engine s inverted-file index structures and query logs

2607138
spaces	delimiter
that will use arrays for storing arguments so it will handle even calls like spaces delimiter string and string with

2607199
.htaccess	httpd.conf
in your httpd.conf or a .htaccess put

2607314
google-chrome	firefox
in ie using sth like data.firstchild returns xml header and in firefox and google-chrome using data.firstchild returns root element.

2607316
floating-point	integer
the expression returns false in javascript but fortunately integer arithmetic in floating-point is exact so decimal representation errors can be avoided by scaling

2607316
floating-point	integer
as a practical example to avoid floating-point problems where accuracy is paramount it is recommended 1 to handle money as an integer representing the number of cents 2550 cents instead of 25.50 dollars

2607352
bellman-ford	dijkstra
however it s arguable whether this is really dijkstra or a bellman-ford with a priority queue

2607361
put	get
after actually considering chewing through my own wrists and dreaming of ips all night long + brute force googling trying anything i could get my digital fingers on i managed to put something together that actually works

2607367
uitableview	nsindexpath
- uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

2607376
firefox	safari
they re based on prototype but the core issue isn t watch out for any methods labels identifiers which ie considers reserved words but firefox or safari will tolerate

2607383
ironruby	ironpython
dynamically typed languages like ironpython and ironruby use dynamic language runtime which implements dynamic method calls etc

2607411
lisp	scheme
ruby lisp scheme scala clojure python perl php c# via mono .

2607426

2607512
hide	show
just show and hide that

2607583
post	get
since i just created an account to make my first stack overflow post to get an answer for this burning question

2607629
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that in my firefox 3.6 or google-chrome they just don t work together

2607631
width	height
i am catching the resize event and changing the height and width

2607698
textview	imageview
each item has inside a textview and two imageview

2607698
textview	imageview
for the whole item i can show the context menu after a long press but my problem is that the imageview changes as well when i am pressing the textview for example

2607698
children	parent
i think that all the children of a view are affected by an event in the parent but i am not sure

2607703
public	protected
i learnt today that java also has another access level which is implied if you don t specify public protected private

2607704
cairngorm	mate
as i search on internet people are using a lot different framework cairngorm to mate

2607727
udp	tcp
you can encapsulate udp in tcp of course but you d have to handle the udp part in userspace

2607727
udp	tcp
you can either use udp and send a discrete chunk as a datagram or you can but structs into tcp data and let them go as a stream

2607744
udp	tcp
tcp and udp are protocols from the same layer and they have functions that make sense only to them

2607744
udp	tcp
you could send udp header+data inside tcp packets but doesn t make sense at all

2607783
cdr	cons
all three calls to cons use functions to get their cdr

2607811
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome safari moz i generate see spans 1 2 3 4 ... etc

2607839
nsstring	nsdata
your problem is most likely a naming collision caused by using data as a property name because otherwise the code looks fine and both nsstring and nsdata should serialize easily

2607880
tomahawk	trinidad
i want to use inputlistofvalues component from trinidad in my application which also uses tomahawk

2607990
width	height
ie i m interested in writing my own widget that takes for instance height width

2608073
min	max
what is less commonly realised is if you give the mean value assuming your min and max averaged out give something approximating the actual mean you ll only hit that deadline 50 of the time

2608073
min	max
3 x max + 1 x min 4

2608073
min	max
personally i d give him somewhere around 2 x max + 1 x min 3 and have the rest as contingency

2608214
put	get
if your best dev quits and you have to put someone new on the project extend the deadline becasue that person has to have time to get up to speed you may have to eat the hours though the client may not agree to pay for that time

2608275
umbraco	dotnetnuke
cms projects like dotnetnuke which is vb or umbraco which is c# would be good learning tools

2608297
uilabel	uibutton
so find cars by must be just uilabel or uibutton put in specific view s point

2608302
put	get
without knowing anything about what you re trying to solve it s hard to say with any confidence but typically one wants to do things with what one has put into a list and to do anything meaningful with things once they re just object you ll need to examine their type and get reflective to kind of break away from language basics

2608304
width	height
gwt actually doesn t parse the width and height strings it just passes it to browsers dom and then the browser evaluates it appropriately

2608387
ubuntu	debian
sometimes php can be set up with different php.inis depending on how php is invoked -- i believe debian and ubuntu do this specifically

2608429
boost	stl
boost serialization also already knows how to serialize all stl containers

2608443
hide	show
i would like to allow each row the ability to show hide extra information

2608443

google-chrome	firefox
the code works absolutely fine on google-chrome and mozilla firefox

2608462
freemarker	velocity
i know that it is possible to do this with a java date object inside a velocity freemarker template something like but i would like to do this with datetool or freemarker core

2608482
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
if you still want the sliding animation but don t want the uinavigationbar you could use a uinavigationcontroller but hide the navigation bar with the setnavigationbarhidden animated method

2608497
qdockwidget	qwidget
i think you can use qdockwidget settitlebarwidget qwidget widget

2608516
mvp	presenter
im creating a lot of ui dynamically on the ui thread and binding to presenter mvp pattern which often start worker threads before the ui has first show

2608541
exponent	modulo
for rsa encryption i am using pear class crypt_rsa- encrypting with the public key which is a modulo exponent pair i get from working encryption system in .net.

2608594
pull	push
our security team allows us to pull from the build server but does not allow the build server to push

2608620
inherited	properties
i have say 10 different objects that inherited one object.they have different amount and type of class members but all of them have one properties in common - visible

2608638
public	protected
public and protected members are part of your classes exported api

2608683
post	get
i still have more to wade through but your post sparked the idea for the solution to get around the name conflicts

2608695
clearance	devise
you must develop your own authentication plugin or use an open source one like devise authlogic or clearance

2608717
put	get
i thought i should get rid of album_id publisher_id and artist_id in songs table and put them in intermediate tables like this

2608720
config	ini
but you can also use a config ini file or a xml file

2608736
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
so my appcontroler is a nsobject witch contains a uiwindow and a uiviewcontroller myviewcontroller

2608776
children	parent
if i search again for that string value in the parent xml then i may find 2 occurrences or many more if the parent has other children that contain an occurrence of that string

2608840
division	modulo
this linear index can be calculated into the 2-dim index by using modulo and division

2608887
kerberos	ntlm
i see a lot of links on google that say switch to kerberos but my server seems to only be accepting ntlm not negotiate as it would say if it was looking for kerberos so that is unfortunately not an option

2608892
getter	setter
i ve also seen that properties simply create getter setter functions on compile

2608902
requiredfieldvalidator	checkboxlist
since asp.net s checkboxlist control does not allow itself to be validated with one of the standard validation controls requiredfieldvalidator i would like to create a usercontrol that i can use in my project whenever i need a checkbox list that requires one or more boxes to be checked

2608916
draggable	droppable
i have an application where there are a number of droppable divs that accept only a single draggable

2608916
draggable	droppable
i do this by setting the accept option on all my droppable s to a function that check for a valid draggable and if it is already occupied

2608916
draggable	droppable
thus if a user tries to drop a draggable on a droppable that is already occupied the draggable reverts

2608916
draggable	droppable
what i would like to do is provide additional feedback when a user drops a draggable on top of an occupied droppable

2608954
onmouseover	onclick
ok so that s the bit you d change to say onclick instead of onmouseover

2608978
public	protected
as in this case why choose private members over package public or protected ones

2608999
post	get
to get real help i assume you ll need to post a repro project somewhere

2609053
bash	zsh
i ve tried this in both bash and zsh and get the same results in both.

2609088
post	get
you ll need to supply a function as the source for the plugin and have your function do the ajax post to the server to get the matching data

2609146
equals	compareto
this errors means that you re not overriding equals in foreignkeyconstraint and thus inheriting the equals from object so the following is not true from the javadoc of compareto

2609152
equals	compareto
i believe the basis of the warning is that as stated in the definition strange things can happen if you override compareto and not equals

2609155
equals	compareto
generally the value of compareto should return zero if and only if equals returns true

2609155
equals	compareto
it implements equality checks by invoking compareto and a compareto implementation that is inconsistent with equals makes the treeset violate the contract of the set interface which might lead to program malfunction

2609160
equals	compareto
it s telling you that there s the potential for compareto and equals to disagree

2609160
equals	compareto
so you ll potentially find yourself in a situation where compareto states that two objects are the same because tablename and fkfieldname match but equals states they are different because they re different instances

2609160
equals	compareto
there are a few java apis that depend on compareto and equals being consistant

2609182
qtabwidget	qsplitter
but some widgets are more like a layout manager than a widget such as qsplitter and qtabwidget

2609182
qtabwidget	qsplitter
like qsplitter qtabwidget has some behaviors which make a single layout not only unnecessary but not useful

2609248
ienumerable	ilist
i would strongly suggest using non-generic ilist or if that fails some generic lists don t implement it ienumerable since and invoke the add manually

2609268
innodb	myisam
my current database design uses myisam mainly as the storage engine i wonder if its possible to split some of the tables into myisam and some into innodb in the same database

2609276
glassfish	weblogic	jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish
it works in jboss and weblogic and should work in glassfish but haven t tried it

2609276
folder	directory
in you war directory create a web-inf classes folder and configure your ide to write the class files in this directory

2609310
innodb	myisam
i have myisam and innodb table and i use replication over 7 slaves never had a problem

2609315
division	modulo
i know the modulo calculates the remainder of a division

2609315
primes	modulus
i know i can use the modulus operator to see whether a number is even or odd and primes or composite but that s about it

2609399
put	get
as for testing things get an old dot-matrix printer and put it in hex dump mode if you really want the nitty-gritty

2609408
debian	linux
debian linux lenny

2609420
division	modulo
any time you have division and want to express the remainder other than in decimal the modulo is appropriate

2609420
division	modulo
also if you re ever in a situation where you may be accruing rounding errors modulo division is good

2609426
octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
i ve seen binary and hex used quite often but never octal

2609449
integer	fractions	division	modulo
modulo is also very useful if for some crazy reason you need to do integer division and get a decimal out and you can t convert the integer into a number that supports decimal division or if you need to return a fractions instead of a decimal

2609449
division	modulo
another case where modulo division is useful is if you are increasing or decreasing a number and you want to contain the number to a certain range of number but when you get to the top or bottom you don t want to just stop

2609482
mouseover	mouseout
i have image sprites that use jquery to set the bg position on mouseover and mouseout events

2609538
octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
one of the main reasons octal used to be more frequently used was that it is easier to convert between octal and binary in your head than hex to binary you only have to remember the binary representation of the 8 octal digits 0-7

2609538
hex	binary
however hex began to win out as word sizes that are multiples of 8-bit bytes began to win out and the need to read and enter data in binary became unecessary with console text ui and later gui debuggers

2609577
width	height
the aim is to a have a container div with a fixed height and width and have the html content within that div automatically scroll vertically continuously

2609587
gravatar	akismet
you can check for gravatar akismet or some other comment related plugins creating issues for u

2609591
put	get
i d put both copies of the content you can just .clone it to get the other copy in a container and scroll that that way you don t have to worry about moving two elements

2609641
memset	calloc
doing a memset or bzero that are called by calloc anyway is a good way to invalidate huge portion of your cache

2609656
vim	notepad++
just use notepad++ or vim

2609661
rss	feed
the slideshow and top 5 news rss feed

2609698
uploadify	swfupload
it perfectly explains what you need to do to keep your app secure and still use flash upload plugins like uploadify or swfupload

2609701
udp	tcp
setup firewall rules for that group bad example - opens all udp and tcp ports for a cidr range

2609705
rss	feed
or assuming that the entries in the rss feed are ordered properly

2609728
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
your for-loop s counter is called but you re using i to index the arrays within loops

2609732
keydown	keyup
your .live is firing correctly but the .val doesn t change until keyup fires keydown fires before the value is updated so your if isn t true until the 2nd key is pressed

2609738
gson	jackson
or if that does not work try another java json library jackson or gson

2609738
gson	jackson
they can do this conversion i know jackson can i would expect gson to be able to as well

2609739
post	get
so let s get back to the problem i stated at the start of this post

2609755
xslt	xquery
in most hosting languages environments like xslt xquery dom you can

2609820
cairngorm	flex
i would suggest learn the technology first concepts and syntax and then use a framework.since you mentioned you have done lot of serverside coding i would suggest after learning the basics of flex refer to learn cairngorm as it would naturally come to you since it follows the same principles of regular mvc pattern

2609834
post	get
the http request is always a post and on server side get methods throw an exception method not supported

2609866
x86	64bit
if your app works in 32 and 64bit it is 32-bit and therefore it goes in the x86 folder

2609868
inherited	properties
this properties is inherited from the htmlcontainercontrol class and is not applicable to the htmltablerow class.

2609871
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome will precache dns entries on the page but it doesn t pro-actively go and fetch pages firefox however does prefetch pages

2609874
backgrounding	multitasking
it sounds like they re using cooperative multitasking here to simulate loading the doc in the backgrounding - the activex posts messages to itself to process the next chunk or whatever

2609885
peer	p2p
i want to make a p2p chat client all i want it to do is to be able to send text across to each peer

2609891
int	boolean
as you can see each column in the ruby oo world represents a mix of types -- string string boolean int

2609902
int	chars
first the byte is converted to an int via widening primitive conversion and then the resulting int is converted to a chars by narrowing primitive conversion

2609910
width	height
since they are components and have a concrete height width the form would then know it needed to scroll and would do so accordingly provided that autoscroll was set

2609963
memcached	apc
see also in the manual 7.2.2 cache engines in cake in which it says there is support for apc xcache file and memcached

2609970
ubuntu	debian
if you want newer packages i usuaully start with debian sources and turn those into local packages -- as this incorporates whatever the package maintainers deemed worthy and will be closer to the package you will get at the next ubuntu upgrade

2609984
junit	testng
we use this at my work and it was easy to get up and running with junit and or testng

2610008
implements	extends
i ve implements a class that extends overlay and also override the ontap ontouchevent tried both

2610012
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
from the error it looks as if your gizmo class has an array of uinavigationcontroller not uiviewcontroller

2610025
folder	directory
actually you don t even need to do it manually because you can create a properties-file with configuration information and put it to the certain directory in the way that this file will be deployed to web-inf classes folder in your application server

2610048
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i have a page with a checkbox and a dropdownlistfor

2610056
qabstractitemmodel	qstandarditemmodel	qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel	qtreeview	qstandarditemmodel
i ve inherited from qtreeview to create a treeview that stores a qstandarditemmodel instead of a qabstractitemmodel

2610056

i ve successfully inserted my derived qstandarditem into my derived qtreeview s qstandarditemmodel

2610056
qstandarditem	qtreeview
qtreeview qstandarditem

2610060
width	height
in reality there s a good chance that we re dealing with a truncated triangle -- but the formula for that is also well known 1 2a 1 b + 1 2a 2 b where the a s are the height of the right and left sides and b is the width

2610108
onresume	onpause
activity provides the getcallingactivity method that you could add to logs in onpause and onresume as suggested before

2610179
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
you ll have to do a server side evaluation of the checkbox during the pastback and set the dropdownlistfor enabled or not

2610192
rss	feed
it is relatively easy for you to develop your own gadget that display your rss feed with more items

2610240
gridview	repeater	gridview	objectdatasource	gridview	sqldatasource	sqldatasource	objectdatasource
presuming web forms you would have a data control such as a gridview or repeater bound to a datasource such as sqldatasource or objectdatasource etc

2610263
post	get
when they post the form i get names of the item_type in the item_type_id parameter and i want to find the correct item_type and set the id to that

2610285
width	height
i would like to change the height and width attributes in the image tag if it is greater than 200x200

2610307
width	height
if you know that it s a jpeg you can just pull the first few bytes and parse the width height from the image header

2610334
rss	feed
handing out bookmarks to the rss feed same problem--no one will look at them

2610381
rss	feed
the rss atom idea is not bad -- it works on some projects when all developpers use rss frequently it only means one more feed in their aggregator

2610387
post	get
edit when you post you should get an array of values in php prefer index

2610465
g++	gcc
it s likely that since support for them exists in gcc to support c99 it was relatively straightforward to add support for them to g++

2610477
pull	push
as far as i know branches are as with everything else created locally without your control so if anyone decides to use a branch that branch will also show up in your main repository after a pull push

2610477
pull	push
projectname-main is cloned once being worked on and synchronized by doing a pull +merge and push back to the server regularly

2610477
pull	push
if the feature is ready for -main we pull -featuredescription into our local -main merge the changes pull -main from server merge again and push -main back to the server

2610502
filtering	grouping
haven t tested it so the grouping may not be what you want and the comparisons may be reversed but something like that should filtering

2610506
width	height
the friction here is that it cannot possibly decide if the width height pixels it read from the image file is a problem because there isn t enough storage available for the bitmap

2610532
hide	show	slideup	slidedown
i would use slidedown to show and slideup to hide instead of slidetoggle

2610532
hide	show
toggling is only useful when the same call can either hide or show

2610533
many-to-many	one-to-many
to me there is some kind of mismatch between your physical model and the mapping of your entities the physical model implements a many-to-many relation with a join table while the mapping declares a one-to-many relation

2610537
width	height
the solution is to not use height and width at all

2610555
vim	emacs
most clojure users use emacs or to a lesser extent vim

2610579
filtering	grouping
our main requirement is to be able to search filtering grouping sort all of these projects by metadata in sharepoint

2610620
autofac	castle-windsor
castle-windsor and autofac and to some extent structuremap but only when using nested containers will take care of disposing disposable components they create at appropriate time

2610629
textview	imageview
use a framelayout which contains an imageview with your icon and a textview with a ninepatch drawable as background in the right corner

2610632
rss	feed
it looks like facebook doesn t have rss feed for fan pages at the moment

2610632
rss	feed
you could use a tool like feed43 to create an rss feed

2610716
cdr	cons
cons car cdr and some basic operations

2610730
integer	unsigned
you can interpret the 32 bit crc value as an unsigned integer

2610731
width	height
the catch is that i want the div container width and height to remain constant unless a particular event causes a change to the inner widths

2610741
webkit	blink	google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
webkit blink safari google-chrome opera 15+ and microsoft edge are using a pseudo-element -webkit-input-placeholder

2610749
put	get
for some reason i do not get a title bar and back button in the 2nd view so i guess it is not being put on the stack correctly i have put a quick return button in the view for testing purposes so i can navigate backwards and forwards

2610751
multiplying	add
when i add the loop to multiplying it across the stage it just blinks while continuing to animate

2610810
sudo	chgrp
sudo chgrp uucp var lock

2610872
put	get
if you are trying to get all of the content from inside show_style and put it inside the fancy box i believe this is how you would do that

2610911
children	parent
if doing in the constructor for the worker class does not solve your problem and trying to catch signals in the parent ie sigterm sigint doesn t work you may have to try the opposite solution - instead of having the parent kill the children you can have the children commit suicide when the parent dies

2610929
inherited	properties
i ended up changing the inherited hierarchy such that all of our view models inherited from a base class that contains page content and other meta data as opposed to being an aggregate properties named data

2610932
jar	war
package ejb ejb or ejb3 ejb3 or jar jar or par par or rar rar or war war

2610978
implements	extends
depending on the features of your implementation language the getrenderer method could be an abstract method in your parent object class with return an instance of a parent renderer class interface which the specific renderers extends implements

2611033
hide	show
some browsers firefox for example are reloading flash movies as soon as you do a hide show display none

2611038
accessor	properties
the following example demonstrates how the array badchars can be changed by any code that accesses the path properties even though the properties does not implement the set accessor

2611042
postgresql	mysql
rspec coverage tested against postgresql 8.3.9 and mysql 5.0.90

2611043
awesomium	berkelium
awesomiumdotnet is a wrapper around both berkelium and awesomium

2611084
post	get
so finally the page get 2 times bigger at each post back and bang

2611137
for-loop	loops
it is even documented that loops variable from a for-loop is undefined outside loops

2611138
google-chrome	firefox
worked perfectly fine on firefox and google-chrome

2611138
google-chrome	firefox
however in google-chrome or firefox even if only 15-16 characters are displayed initially when the drop down arrow is clicked upon it show the entire name however long it may be

2611138
google-chrome	firefox
ffor google-chrome or firefox shows 123456789 and when it is dropped down it show the full name as 123456789abcdefghijkl

2611145
multiplying	add
assuming both ints are non-negative and int1 goes on the left and int2 goes on the right you need to figure out how many digits long int2 is multiplying int1 by 10 a bunch of times and then add them

2611158
google-chrome	firefox
it validates at jsonlint.com but neither google-chrome nor firefox s native json parse functions will properly parse it

2611187
children	parent
because the code does not wait for its children and it does not ignore sigchld signals the process accumulates zombies - processes that would be cleaned up if only their parent waited for them

2611208
google-chrome	firefox
you problem comes from an escaping problem when defining literals in firefox or google-chrome

2611208
google-chrome	firefox
so jsonlint.com is right and firefox is right and google-chrome is right also

2611247
post	get
you are using a get where you should have used a post

2611345
google-chrome	firefox
okay i m being a tad lazy -and optimistic - but having tested this in both firefox and google-chrome albeit only on ubuntu 9.10 the theory -at least- is sound

2611374
int	boolean
i m sure there are introductory books and web sites out there but a pretty efficient way of learning it is actually to get the intel references and then try to do simple stuff like int math and boolean logic in your favorite high-level language and then look what the resulting binary code is

2611391
virtualbox	parallels	vmware	virtualbox
install vmware fusion or parallels or virtualbox for running the windows os

2611391
virtualbox	parallels	vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox is free but parallels vmware promise windows app that blend in with my mac windows

2611393
folder	directory
unless you really need to have a linear history of your old releases imo the most practical thing to do is to simply move those versioned folder under your tags or maybe branches directory and make sure that releases are tagged correctly from now on

2611418
csv	tsv
if n is specified or if there s only one table it should parse the table and spit it to stdout as csv or tsv

2611453
hash	md5	hash	hmac	hmac	md5
hmac is for verifying a file s integrity and requires a hash algorithm at its core such as sha-1 or md5

2611496
put	get
i m trying to make a class where i put a key and value into the put method which puts the key in the k string array and value into the v string array however it is not being saved in the array when i do get or display

2611496
put	get
for example put dan 30 get dan returns null

2611509
firefox	safari
this works in safari but in firefox i get a prompt to download the file so i get like a pdftest.php file

2611526
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in every browser win mac google-chrome safari firefox opera ie6 and ie7 they all get the following console output

it is o n performance for both put and get

2611533
int	chars
variant c_test o_invoke_few_args const chars s int64 hash int count cvarref a0 cvarref a1 cvarref a2 cvarref a3 cvarr

2611536
persistent	transient
that being said if you don t want businessdate to be persistent at all annotate it with transient with jpa fields are persistent by default

2611560
onfocus	onblur
now i want to add onblur and onfocus

2611577
awt	swing
if you want to add instances of your class directly to swing controls it must extend a swing or awt type in this case jbutton

2611596
folder	directory
i like to view it similarly to the folder in a file directory tree just imagine folding and expanding the lower levels of directory

2611604
for-loop	while-loop
i have also found that a while-loop is faster than a for-loop

2611604
for-loop	while-loop
the difference in for-loop and while-loop

2611615
min	max	min	median	median	max
you would use a min-max-median heap to find the min max and median in constant time and take linear time to build the heap

2611615
min	max
deletemedian replaces the root with either the min of the max-min heap or the max of the min-max heap whichever maintains the balance

2611618
submit	submission
before submission we have a javascript functions that saves the action in a hidden action input and then performs the submit

2611635
range	max	range	min	min	max
that being said if it s not good enough you could create an array with max bucket value - min bucket value range elements and have each element in this array reference the appropriate bucket

2611640
cos	sin
sin phi cos phi

2611654
spaces	linefeed
as a carriage return linefeed and how many ever spaces for the indentation

2611656
button	checkbox
button canvas checkbox choice container label list scrollbar textcomponent

2611657
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works fine in ie7 firefox safari and google-chrome but in opera only the first line of sifr-ed text appears when the page first loads and after refreshing the page

2611681
mousemove	mousedown
but i do have capture of all the mousedown and mousemove events of the controls inside

2611711
many-to-many	one-to-many
in switching between one-to-many and many-to-many relationships the schema was updated but my data wasn t repopulated

2611730
apache	nginx
that is something before going to the lengths of c code compiled to binary and installed as an nginx or apache module

2611757
iboutlet	ibaction
i understand how to use iboutlet and ibaction to connect a simple button to a method that will repeatedly send random numbers to a textfield

2611773
octal	decimal
as for integer literals you can only work with decimal base 10 octal base 8 or hexadecimal base 16 numbers

2611796
int	chars	octal	decimal	octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
the type of a binary number is the same as any decimal hex or octal number int or even chars short long long

2611809
stdout	stderr
try changing the names stderr and stdout to something else

2611816
free	malloc
heap pointers allocated by malloc or new in the dll can not be free d or delete d by the exe or other binary

2611823
stdout	stderr	stdout	stdio
you don t need to declare open or close stdin stdout or stderr that s already done for you in stdio

2611824
implements	extends
if all of your clients implements the java.util.observer interface and either the server or if your class is a remote the class you are concerned with updating can extends java.util.observable

2611842
google-chrome	safari
as the name suggests it plugs the webkit rendering engine which powers google-chrome and safari into swt

2611858
unsigned	short
b unsigned char 1 byte + h unsigned short 2 bytes 3 bytes

2611924
webkit	gecko
it s not gecko but webkit based

you might also want to check out other algorithms such as boyer-moore rabin-karp and even the naive algorithm as there are situations inputs in which one is better than the others

2613283
ddms	adb
first you should use adb logcat ddms or the ddms perspective in eclipse to examine the java stack trace associated with the application has stopped unexpectedly so you can see what went wrong

2613480
public	protected
depending on the access level would be protected or public in .net you can use something like

2613501
superclass	subclassing
of course quite often it is useful for b s implementation of a method to invoke a s implementation on the same object generally because the subclassing is wrapping extra behavior around the superclass s basic definition

2613505
filtering	grouping
xml web services will allow you to hook directly into sharepoint using sharepoint s native web services you can then create a data view web part which will enable you to view collate filtering and grouping list items

implements	extends
the way i chose to implements user login is through a base userawarecontroller class that all controllers extends

2613534
getter	setter
and just set the property directly don t bother with the pseudo getter setter stuff

2613534
getter	setter
if you really need a getter setter code it for that specific use

2613566
typedef	struct
a final note typedef ing struct the way you are doing it is a c-ism in c++ the following is sufficient

2613579
maven	pom.xml
since maven 2.0.9 maven uses the order of dependencies in the pom.xml to build the classpath so you can manipulate it

2613596
subclass	abstract-class
if i just override the field in the subclass the operation is done on the value of the field in the abstract-class

2613596
subclass	abstract-class
i m open to any solution that would ensure that the operation will be done during the instantiation of the subclass ie putting the operation in a method called by each subclass in the constructor is not a valid solution because someone might extend the abstract-class and forget to call the method

2613663
superclass	subclassing
you can t do this in the constructor since the superclass is going to be initialized before anything in the subclassing

2613663
public	protected
make sure your base class has a public protected constructor also for this code

2613727
jar	war
now when i created war for my projects these changes was not reflected in the output war file the jar in lib folder of war has still the old code

2613731
public	protected	superclass	subclassing
make the constructor protected and offer no default constructor and subclassing implementers are forced to supply a value in their constructors - which can be public and pass a constant value to the superclass making the parameter invisible to users of the subclassing

2613739
vlan	packets
you can probably use an ioctl to get the mtu and if it is ethernet you can usually get the maximum packets size by subtracting the size of the hardware header from that which is 14 for ethernet with no vlan

2613744
superclass	subclassing
since the subclassing portion of your object isn t initialized until after the superclass constructor has returned there s really no other clean way of doing it

2613744
superclass	subclassing
this does not do what you d expect it to since the initializers and constructors of subclassing run after those of the superclass

2613750
implements	extends
huffy should instead extends bicycle and implements an interface so the methods of brandnames can be used

2613779
postgresql	mysql
since you re using php i recommend you use the pdo database layer with mysql or postgresql

2613782
int	boolean
in the case of objects and by object here i mean everything that has reference semantics everything but boolean number int strings etc a reference to them is passed by value so in your function you have a reference to the original object not a reference to a copy of the object

postgresql	mysql
it looks like you re trying to do a dwithin field lookup which does not work on mysql as of april 2010 but does in postgresql

2613944
jobs	cron
obviously if you only want one instance this is an expensive solution as one machine has to always be running and paying 80 a month for one machine to run cron jobs isn t cost effective

2613957
children	parent
order your query by lft asc this way you will always process a parent node before its children

2613957
children	parent
iterate through the results store reference for each by id as above and add this node to the children of its parent

2614025
bmp	png
i modified mike eshva s code and i made it work better.you can use it with either 1frame jpg png bmp or mutil-frame gif.if you want bind a uri to the control bind the urisource properties or you want bind any in-memory stream that you bind the source propertie which is a bitmapimage

2614044
int	chars
instead of trying to print chars as literal cast to int and print the hex value - then check the value against the unicode charts

2614100
post	get
may be i should use post differently ..but how do i pass the value from the form without posting it its ci so not get .

2614218
mouse	keyboard
the message queue is an internal windows structure that stores mouse and keyboard messages

2614225

so im doing a wxpython project where i added several tabs for a notebook each tab of the notebook a class and there is one tab where i added a checkbox in a tab lets call it for example tab1 and what i want is that when someone checks it a button that exists in other tab class called for example tab2 gets hidden where previously it was being shown

2614274
portrait	landscape
i have conditional code that should only work in portrait and if the device is in landscape i need to do something else

2614282
dictionary	map
this way you can map both classes and dictionary normally and still access your dictionary as

2614283
width	height
this is because the xaml you posted says that the rich text box s maxheight and maxwidth will be the height width of the canvas

2614335
inherited	subclassing
every class that i find will be a subclassing of the inherited type

2614412
int	double
the compiler will perform default argument promotions and actually pass values of type double and int

int	chars	int	double
which prototype you want to use - void printit double a int ch or void printit float a chars ch or something else - is for you to decide

2614426
move	drag
if you want a button on your view either drag it there using ib or move the code from drawrect to viewdidload

2614452
width	height
if the specified texture can t be accommodated the width and height texture values will be set to zero

2614480
post	get
when using forms you can specify how the variables are sent to your script using either get or post this is definied in your tag

2614480
post	get
post method hides the information from the user where as get method uses the website s url to pass variables eg

2614525
webmock	vcr
i m working with the auther of webmock a library that provides similar functionality to fakeweb to get vcr to work with webmock as well so that users of vcr could use either fakeweb or webmock as the http stubbing library

2614525
webmock	vcr
vcr will depend on either webmock or fakeweb but doesn t need both and will have certain version requirements for both

2614557

when you are building a more complex app or an app for distribution you ll probably use maven or ant or some other tool that makes your life easier

2614584
button	checkbox
validate elements except checkbox radio button on blur

2614649
sctp	tcp
in contrast to tcp sctp may be

2614663
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
you have only malloc calloc realloc and free

2614663
calloc	malloc
calloc is the same thing as malloc but performs the size multiplication for you

2614663
realloc	malloc
realloc takes a pointer previously malloc d and changes the size of the underlying memory block

2614663
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
free gives the memory back previously allocated with malloc calloc or realloc

2614740
mouseleave	mouseenter
the shorthand works for things like or something but for this you need to use the mouseenter and mouseleave events directly the same events .hover actually binds to

2614742
mouseleave	mouseenter
make sure you are using jquery 1.4 or later and according to the docs you need to use mouseenter and mouseleave rather than hover

2614757
implements	extends
it is possible for a class to implements multiple interfaces while it may extends only one class

2614757
inherited	subclassing
if however you want to provide any implementation in your template class then it is likely that you are best off just creating a class that has any commonalities that its subclassing have and just use plain old inherited

2614796
udp	tcp
tcp gives you the first udp gives the second

2614796
udp	tcp
that s one of the things that both tcp and udp offer over raw ip

2614796
udp	tcp
for messages that are too large for udp 64kb is the strict upper-bound since the udp header only has 16 bits for its length field you pretty-much need to use tcp for transport anyway so that you can reassemble the fragments hence soap goes over http over tcp and not via udp

2614798
bash	zsh
although it has a fairly rich feature set and the ability to interpret emacs lisp code which is greatest strength for me - it is poorly documented and lacks many of the capabilities of bash and zsh for instance

2614851
gentoo	linux
working with latest apache-tomcat on a gentoo linux server

2614884
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout
comparatively that s a tremendous amount of inline code even if you leave out the animation portion it s messy think mouseenter mouseleave not mouseover mouseout ...the former which .hover uses is more complicated

2614895
udp	tcp
the underlying protocol which the library uses must be tcp or if it is udp the library must guarantee the eventual receipt of the message

2614909
portrait	landscape
as part of this microsoft app s store has asked that i need to support landscape as well as portrait

2614909
portrait	landscape
supports both portrait and landscape

2614909
portrait	landscape
even if only a portrait or landscape

width	height
this way you can set the startpoint to 0 0 and the endpoint to the width and height of the canvas to get the result you are looking for

2614936
portrait	landscape
my goal is to have the layout work for different screen sizes and in portrait landscape

2614963
opera	firefox
in firefox opera and ie i can get them via

2615029
innodb	myisam
check if your database supports a roll back if you re using innodb tables and not myisam you can mix transactional and non-transactional tables but in most cases you want all your tables to be innodb

2615034
cvs	svn
so repo-wide merges don t cause the same disruptions as they would be in svn cvs where one repo often contains many unrelated modules which need to have separate merge histories.

2615034
cvs	svn
cvs svn allows different files in the working directory to come from different revisions while dvcs es usually have one revision for the entire wc always even if a file is be reverted to an earlier version it will show as modified in status as it is different from the file in the checked out revision

2615034
cvs	svn
svn cvs does not show this always.

2615034
cvs	svn
at least this is what i feel from my experience with cvs svn git and hg

2615078
int	double	atoi	getline
for int i know you can use the getline and then atoi but i am not finding an array to double function

2615090
stdout	stderr
if under some os the childprocess print out some errors warning on stdout stderr and the parent process is not consuming the streams the childprocess will block and not reach system.exit

2615110
wxpython	pyqt
for a multi-platform solution you will need to use a cross-platform framework like wxpython or pyqt - they both have support for reading and writing to the system clipboard in a platform independent way

2615119
strtol	strtod
take a look at strtod and strtol

2615133

division	subtract
after the division the divisor original one is multiplied by the result and the product subtract from the dividend

2615343
division	subtract
then it is corrected by adding or subtract the divisor if necessary if the result of the division was off by one

2615343
128bit	64bit
it s easy to divide 128bit integer by 32 bit one leveraging hardware support for 64bit by 32-bit division

2615343
subtraction	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
division multiplication subtraction and correction on 128 bit integer might be slower.

2615343
subtraction	multiplication
not the remainder directly but also the remainder using multiplication and subtraction like in the msvc procedure

2615349
super	self
might also point out that if you are inside a view you should use super instead of self

2615361

2615428
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
if you don t mind using browser-specific css you can get it working in firefox with -moz google-chrome and safari with -webkit and ie9 and opera 10.5 with the css 3 stuff that does not start with a hyphen

2615429
pull	push
with regard to that last one you can give seasoned developers direct push access to the main repository while for new or junior members their mentor pull from them and review their changes before pushing them

2615449
iboutlet	ibaction
in my controller i have two ibaction for both the increase and decrease actions and two iboutlet in order to disable the buttons accordingly

2615485
profiling	debugging
all too often i see attempts to profiling in debugging mode and the results from that will not be accurate

2615525
iboutlet	ibaction
if you wanted to decrease the number of connections but i don t think this is a value in and of itself you could add the target yourself using the iboutlet instead of using the ibaction

2615552
textwrangler	bbedit
the other that comes to mind it textwrangler which is a simplified version of the more popular bbedit

2615587
textwrangler	bbedit
i use bbedit and textwrangler is great although neither is strictly html

2615658
put	get
off-course if put the base element inside the xs all and not use xs extension at all i will get an unordered schema restriction

2615662
hide	show
looking at your site however it might just be better to hide any other open blocks and then show the one that was clicked

2615678
for-loop	loops
we would then need to add another loops that renders the intermediate circles inside the for-loop that we used previously to render the original circles

2615708
inherited	subclassing
inherited subclassing callback invoked whenever a subclassing of the current class is created

2615779
jtable	jlabel
i would do it like this...create a jpanel to contain the jtable on top and a jlabel on the bottom

easymock	jmock
tools such as jmock easymock java ee micro-container aspectj aspectwerkz spring ioc can be used to solve di issue

2616067
getter	setter
edit i missed the fact that the function expression is trying to make variable capturing to handle the getter setter creation inside the loop but the looping variable i needs to be passed as an argument in order to do it and since the function expression is there context the outer this should be preserved

2616067
inherited	properties
i would also recommend to use an inside the for...in loop to avoid iterating over user extended properties inherited from object.prototype

2616087

range	median
i have to get the median mode and range of test scores from one column in a table but i am unsure how to go about doing that

2616168
range	median
is there an sql command to get the median mode range or will i have to calculate this myself and how do you pull out numbers from the table in order to be able to calculate the mode median range

2616173
innodb	myisam
i ve got an application that requires the use of myisam on a few tables but the rest are the traditional innodb type

2616175

2616214
multiplying	division	multiplying	add
the book hacker s delight by henry warren has a whole chapter devoted to integer division by constants including techniques that transform an integer division to a multiplying shift add series of operations

2616214
multiplying	add
this page calculates the magic numbers for the multiplying shift add operations

2616241

2616525
pull	push
try to make another commit after the pull and then try to pull again review any possible merge and push the data

2616536
accessor	properties
properties create the accessor for you

2616581
getter	setter
i thought hey there s no getter setter for the xypoint object

2616581
width	height
i thinks its because origin is a pointer already and whats happening under the hood with width and height is that there is going te be created a pointer to them

2616586
mouse	keyboard
ideally i would like to control my movement by using the keyboard to move and the mouse to look around like you usually do in fps-games

2616596
accessor	properties
you can think of a properties declaration as being equivalent to declaring two accessor methods

2616603
width	height
the above interface will create simple accessor methods for width and height that can be called from other objects as or - these two are analogous

2616603
accessor	properties
but you would still want to declare a properties for it to generate accessor methods

2616611
getter	setter
getter and setter are mostly useful if you need to access an instance variable from another class or you re using bindings to get set them

2616611
width	height
so my guess would be that you need this functionality for the width and height but not for the origin

2616611
getter	setter
note that the getter setter do not make pointers out of the integers as you stated might be the reason

2616611
getter	setter
ints are ints and getter setter do not change that

2616643
boost	stl
i ve checked boost and stl and neither have an exact implementation

2616649
folder	directory
as soon i created the zip file in the directory somewhere other than directory in application folder everything worked fine

2616656
width	height
simply setting a child s width and height and expecting the layout to know it s supposed to respect your new values is no good what you need is some way to tell the layout node the values you d like to respect

2616695
free	malloc
they interpose versions of malloc and free that records the calls to alloc and free before then calling the actual system alloc and free functions to perform the memory management

2616814
equals	tostring
for example if you add a new field data would automatically include that field in the equals hashcode and tostring methods

2616827
maven	pom.xml
for git i do a separate clone for each workspace as the maven support in eclipse does not pick up changes in the pom.xml hierarchy like a new project easily

2616836
getter	setter
there is both a getter and a setter collectively referred to as accessors created for origin in the rectangle class

2616836
accessor	properties	getter	setter
declaring getter and setter using properties and then implementing them using synthesize is only one way of declaring and creating accessor and is there for a convenience if you have lots of properties to declare in the class interface

2616836
getter	setter
due to the dynamically-bound nature of objective-c method calls you don t even have to declare the getter and setter methods in the interface although it is generally best practice to do so if you are advertising them as publicly available to other classes

2616843
versioning	upgrade
i ve upgrade an asp.net web application to the latest build of fluent nhibernate 1.0.0.636 and the newest versioning of nhibernate v2.1.2.4000

redhat	fedora
another use would be the open source version is used to build a base for and get free development done that they can transfer to a closed enterprise version see redhat fedora and above comment about support + training

2616914
post	get
anything that has an active effect like a removal should be a form with not a form or link that causes get and the server-side script that does the removing should only accept post requests

2616923
cout	cin	ostringstream	std
also in c++ the iostreams library std cin std cout std fstream std ostringstream std istringstream etc. are preferred over c file objects

2616927
children	parent
as a side note the children can t have a higher z-index than their parent so everything inside .codbg is -1 behind the page then you need to fix the tab images the problem is not that they re behind the background it s that they re transparent and look darker on top of a darker background

2616937
children	parent
for example if you have an aggregator pom that is also the parent for the projects that it aggregates and the children and parent versions get out of sync this mojo can help fix the versions of the child modules

2616941
typedef	struct
both can be aliased namespace with and struct with typedef mylong name space lilstruct

2616949
uiview	caanimation
so you ve to determine what exactly your animation is in terms of color alpha transform animations and create manual animation maybe you ll have to use caanimation instead of uiview beginanimations context

public boolean onkeydown int keycode keyevent event

2616976
spoofing	traffic
people can always sniff http traffic and spoofing it

2616977
cout	cin
when using c++ you should use the std cin and std cout streams for console input and output

2617014
children	parent
windows doesn t maintain a strict parent process heirarchy like unix does - it records the pid of the parent when a process is created but when this process goes away it isn t updated because a process does not track its children so you can t update it

2617036
maven	cargo
maven cargo plugin to start and stop your web container

2617151
fgets	strtol	fgets	strtok	fgets	strtod	strtod	strtok	strtol	strtok	strtol	strtod
the better option is to use fgets to read input as text tokenize with strtok or similar and then use strtol or strtod to convert tokens to numerical values

2617155
vsto	add-in
i am developing a simple outlook 2003 add-in using vsto 2008

awt	swing
swing supplanted it entirely eleven years ago building on top of it to correct flaws in the awt 1.0 design

2617303
marshalbyrefobject	reflection.emit
however there are some ways to implement similar functionality such as using reflection.emit to generate assemblies and types on demand uing realproxy to create proxy objects for interfaces and marshalbyrefobject objects

2617305
implements	extends
second if you want to extends existing object by implements some behavior and related properties in a new module - you won t have a single reference for all occasions

2617338
system.configuration	system.web
if that doesn t work add references to system.web and system.configuration then try this

2617347

2617367
for-loop	loops
since in the other class i already have a loops for-loop shown above that simulates 6 times the s2 stack

2617410
for-loop	loops
minor nitpick your for-loop is actually encoding 11 items and not 10 like you make think from a brief look at loops count

2617416
content-disposition	content-type
there is a text plain content-type part instead of content-disposition attachment

2617421
public	protected
otherwise when the public dispose is called explicitly it calls the protected dispose true and also gc.suppressfinalize this to prevent the finalizer from running because there is nothing to dispose of anymore

2617500
public	protected
to make it more clear private and protected functions are not directly testable unless you will create a public function to call it

2617500
public	protected
so i end up converting some private and protected functions to public functions just to be able to test them

2617507
comparator	comparable
i have tried various methods to make this work - implemented equals and hashcode for the custom object comprising the list - implemented the comparable interface for the custom object - implemented the comparator interface for the custom object .

2617524
invokerequired	begininvoke
now i need to do the same for a textbox in an asp.net app but apparently neither invokerequired nor begininvoke exist for textbox in a web.ui

2617812
hide	show
i ve never had the best luck adjusting the show hide time

2617933
temporary	tablespace
note be careful here if the table is a really big table you may need to declare a temporary tablespace for it to work in.

2617980
jstl	taglib
the trick to getting this to work with standard jstl fmt taglib was to set up an interceptor that replaced the httpservletrequest s resource with our own

2618020
width	height
since hd seems to be .5625 ratio 16 9 i m thinking that i can just decide on a height and multiply it by the ratio to get the proper width each time plus 23px for youtube bar

2618027
put	get
yes you have to pay a subscription to the apple iphone developer programme to get access to a provisioning profile to enable you to put an app you have built onto your iphone ipod

2618028
erd	diagram
also a foreign key relationship is visible on an entity relationship diagram erd while a check constraint will never be

2618129
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
the long answer the sql-syntax isn t in the spec because it s entirely defined by sqlite the db-engine used by both safari and google-chrome the two browsers to support webdb with opera probably following soon ish and ms and mozilla refusing to follow just because of the fact that such a spec would be too dependant of the evolution of an external component

2618147
post	get
what s puzzling to me is that - whilst i know post will never work in the browser - i thought by setting the auth headers in the httprequest object and still making a get request that would all go fine

2618189
emacs	aquamacs
i am using emacs from the shell not aquamacs on a mac laptop however whenever i try to scroll up and down it doesn t scroll the file

3-tier	n-tier
not every solution needs to be 3-tier or n-tier but it is still important to understand the distinction

2618364
post	put
any post put or delete requests will be handled by apache as usual so you can wire up your application tier however you usually would

2618399
background-color	font-size
it sets the color and the background-color then the style textbox1 gets applied and it overwrites the background-color and adds font-size to

2618399
background-color	font-size
so in the end you end with the color from generictextbox the background-color and font-size from textbox1

2618415
innodb	myisam
if you need to move from myisam to innodb to get the fk functionality you need to consider the tradeoffs in performance between the two engines

2618736
int	chars
int send_all int sock unsigned chars buffer int len

2618738
keydown	keyup
the problem i did have was with it was that i had to get it to run on both keydown and keyup for it to work successfully

2618741
int	chars
typically a function taking a 2d array of int s and a 1d array of chars would be declared as

2618796
int	chars
assuming that you wanted an array of int and an array of chars the variant with pointers-to-array instead of references-to-array might look as follows

2618803
oncreate	setcontentview
the reason initial application activity extended tabactivity but layout xml with tabhost widget was not loaded via setcontentview in oncreate scope it was scheduled to load via runnable a little bit later

2618822

2618864
post	get
to get a better answer say which language you are using and preferably also post your source code

2618888
for-loop	loops
for-loop sets a variable to the snapshot length at the beginning of loops instead of checking textnodes.snapshotlength at the beginning of every loops

2618911
portrait	landscape
this should be simple enough the details of how to handle portrait to landscape orientation change are provided here

2618915
portrait	landscape
i have opengl only view that displays in portrait and landscape mode using projection matrix view s transformation is identity all the time

2618915
portrait	landscape
when i change from landscape to portrait landscape is the initial state view s frame is set to 0 20 320 460 and stays like this

2618915
portrait	landscape
initialy view is full screen i change it to 0 0 300 480 landscape with status bar and it works then it doesn t work when i try to chenge it for the second time portrait with status bar

2618957
int	boolean
to begin with a simple example if you attempt to subclass many of actionscript s primitive datatypes int uint number string boolean etc you get the following compiler error

2618957
inherited	properties
in this dialect functions are used as classes of a sort well prototypes and the ability for functions to have properties added at runtime is part of the power of prototypal inherited

2618959
firefox	safari
this works fine in safari but firefox 3.6.3 reports the file to be not well-formed

2618983
portrait	landscape
switch to previous layout orientation for example portrait landscape

2618983
portrait	landscape
switch to next layout orientation for example portrait landscape

2619002
firefox	safari
the code works fine on safari but fails on firefox 3.6.3

2619002
content-length	content-type
the http status is ok 200 the content-type is properly application json and the content-length of 2126 gzip d implies data came back

2619010
post	get
i want to be able to let a user get to a password protected wordpress page without needing to type the password so when they go to the page the password is submitted by a post url on page load

2619016
keyevent	keyrelease
responding to the keypressed or keyrelease event is fine for setting the focus to the text field but i need to then repeat the keyevent somehow so that whatever was typed is actually entered

2619019
post	get
for example if you had a page that took a get variable such as an attacker could post an image on your site like this

codeigniter	kohana
i haven t used any well-known frameworks or object relational mappers but i ve heard that codeigniter kohana and doctrine are a few good ones

2619047
inherited	subclassing
the hook method inherited if defined gets called whenever a subclassing is created

2619056
post	get
that code is only looking at the post variables not the get variables in the url

2619056
post	get
the request global contains both the post and the get variables which is what you want

2619056
post	get
the problem is those parameters are in the get array not the post array

2619078
post	get
using post over get gets you nothing tangible as far as security is concerned

2619140
getter	setter
you have to use a getter setter

2619183
button	checkbox
from the perspective of http both radio button and checkbox sets are pretty much the same thing except that selecting a radio button deselects all others in the group

2619185
getter	setter
xmlserializer requires a public getter and setter for every serialized property this is very annoying and can lead to some sub-optimal designs

2619206
pull	push
you may need to git pull origin before you git push origin master

2619235
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
further the row cannot be deselected by calling deselectrowatindexpath animated on self.tableview in viewwillappear or viewdidappear in the first controller

2619240
free	malloc
i would suggest in that case to use malloc to allocate the string inside the function but make sure whenever you call the function you free the return value eventually

2619245
boost	stl
note this method is roughly 2-4 times faster than the standard library routines and rougly 120+ times faster than stl based implementations stringstream boost lexical_cast etc for string to integer conversion - depending on compiler used of course

2619247
button	checkbox
i noticed that if you wrap a radio button or checkbox in a label the whole thing becomes clickable even without a for id pair in fact it seems to ignore this because i screwed it up

mappers can be implements as a collection of static functions or as an object - however the collection is less flexible if you want to extends or alter the behaviour for any reason such as mocking for unit testing

2620130
getter	setter
the model itself should simply be a collection of data either stored as public properties or preferably with appropriate setter and getter please don t just define a get set function pair for every variable or you might as well just leave them public along with other methods that operate on the data

in your first example all the multiplication and division must be done before the addition and subtraction

2621507
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
since the results of the multiplication and divisions are independent it really doesn t matter what order they re performed just that the results are used from left to right in the addition and subtraction

this could be wrapped in a maven plugin or for simpler integration used with the maven antrun plugin and the pre-bundled ant task

2621837
ready	each
what i can add to the workflow you mention is each developer should not create a feature branch only a current dev branch because the truth is the developer often doesn t know what exactly his her branch will produce one feature several because it ended up being too complex a feature none because not ready in time for release another feature because the original one had morphed .

2621879
cvs	svn
it s not a traditional way of working and is designed to be peer driven rather than hierarchical like svn cvs

the same will happen with 64bit to 128bit

2622087

2622145
jsf	seam
3 seam isn t a web framework it is more like an application stack that makes jsf ejb3 and hibernate all play better together so it shouldn t hurt that you have seam annotations in your ejbs

2622199
128bit	64bit
with 128bit you d need twice as much storage registers ram caches etc. compared to 64bit for common data types - with all the drawback that might have - more ram needed to store data more data to transmit slower wider buses might requires more physical space perhaps more power etc

google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome this works fine

2622898
postgresql	mysql
if they re not and you must use an abstraction layer to your database something like a custom db- escape which in your mysql architecture maps to mysql_real_escape_string and in your postgresql architecture maps to a respective method for postgresql i don t know which that would be off-hand sorry i haven t worked with postgresql

my goal is to use a std multiset container typedef eventmultiset called currentevents to organize a list of struct of type event and to have members of class host occasionally add new event struct to currentevents

2624451
google-chrome	safari
you ll notice that in safari google-chrome the latest available public downloads as well as the latest nightlies as far as i can tell you get a rather ugly background colour bleed

2624464
for-loop	loops
i am trying to change the value of upper bound in for-loop but loops is running till the upper bound which was defined in the starting

2624541
int	chars

2624641
subtract	add
when you add or subtract two characters you get an int32 in c#

2624747

floating-point	integer
actionscript 3 supports the number type which self-converts from integer to floating-point rather than experience overflow.

2624943
mouse	keyboard
i can implement event handlers for both the mouse and the keyboard but i can t for the life of me figure out how to tie the two together

2625082
vim	emacs
learning your way around either vi vim or emacs to start with will help

2625108
mouse	keyboard
you are able to use the keyboard arrow keys but you need first to select the control with the mouse

2625124
cos	sin
now you should be able to get the new x and y which i will call x3 and y3 by using the angle and the distance you want to travel where x3 d cos theta and y3 d sin theta

2625148
int	chars
if you want to test whether the int level matches the chars argument 2 then use

2625236
getter	setter
i ve never seen a system i really liked--activerecord is close but it makes a few rubiesque assumptions that i m not quite comfortable with--the biggest being supplying public setter getter by default

2625273
floating-point	integer
second your origin is printing out as 0 possibly because you are using d to format the x and y values which prints out a signed decimal integer but they are in fact decimal floating-point values

2625276
mouseup	mousedown
you could set the timeout for that element on mousedown and clear it on mouseup

2625357
int	chars
and the sample code has an int a string and a chars

2625420
multiplying	subtract	multiplying	transpose
then computing the inverse of a is just a matter of subtract the translation component and multiplying by the transpose of the 3x3 part

2625432
temp	tmp
among other things this seems to prevent file creation my snippets creating files in a current directory or tmp both errored out as well as file temp calls

2625464

uiview	subviews
i ve thought about setting the subclass of the subviews to a uiview subclass that automatically loads the nib file

2625502
min	max
if you don t have multiple rows that s fine - but you still need to choose an aggregate operator min max sum

2625523
google-chrome	safari
i have tested this in google-chrome 18 and safari 5.1

2625529
width	height
i m using loadmovie to load a youtube video player inside my flash website but i want to specify the width and height so it can fit my box

2625543

define a javascript object that represents your control on the client-side and on the server-side emit the call that will instantiate it with the client ids of the controls you ll be operating on

2625573
serializable	deserialization
there is no way to configure the native amf serializable deserialization from the flash player to give you warnings if remoteclass or any other metadata is set or not

2625600
postgresql	mysql
i d like to avoid doing anything that will break mysql postgresql and sql server support so extending the oracle10gdialect appears to be the most promising of the workarounds mentioned in hhh-1961

2625632
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
since it can store up to 5mb per domain in mozilla firefox 3 google-chrome and opera 10mb per storage area in internet explorer you can store answers and question ids in the dom storage

2625650
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in firefox google-chrome and even ie7

2625688
cpython	ironpython
there is a comment down below in this blog post that hints at the reason why it was so easy dispense with a gil for ironpython or jython it is that cpython uses reference counting whereas the other 2 vms have garbage collectors

2625732
youtube	vimeo
i know other api s authentication methods like in vimeo and youtube will allow you to specify a next parameter which is the equivalent of the post-authorize redirect url and it can be set at run time

2625746
httpconnection	downloading
i was thinking in getting the file using an httpconnection and a fileoutputstream like discussed in here android downloading binary file problems but i can t fgure out how to put it into the res layout folder

draggable	droppable
i m using jquery ui and jquery draggable all my draggable use jquery clone helper and appends the draggable to droppable

2625873
draggable	droppable
the position is not relative to the droppable which makes the draggable drop to random places

2625873
draggable	droppable
overall the droppable and draggable integration is not tight

2625917
fadein	hide	hide	show
your question confuses me a bit because .toggle is basically a show hide toggle but you have fadein

2625939
lisp	scheme
the usual thing to do with a symbol for a scheme or indeed any lisp interpreter is to look it up in some sort of environment

2625941
fadein	fadeout
so if you want an element to fadein and fadeout every other click have a toggle control 2 functions the fadein and the fadeout

2625948
int	double
because a double is higher it will merge the int into the 0.0

2625948
int	double
the same way can be done for converting from int double float to string

2625992
hide	show
i ve been trying to create some simple jquery that on click will remove the hide class from it s child ul but at the same time check that no other ul s with class of tier_2 are show aka the other s have the hide class

2625999
spaces	delimiter
tr translates the spaces delimiting the numbers into carriage returns because sort uses carriage returns as delimiter ie it is for sorting lines of text

2626023
mouseover	mouseout
use cleartimeout on mouseover event and use settimeout again on mouseout event

2626037
implements	extends
on the syntax level java was influenced by smalltalk while c# tried to stay closer to c c++ eg compare java s extends and implements with c# s notation and took a vague inspiration from vb on those concepts that weren t mappable to c c++ example property syntax

2626053
hide	show
you can use the show and hide jquery functions or toggle

2626053
addclass	removeclass	hide	removeclass
if i am wrong and you really do need your hide class you can use addclass and removeclass functions

2626055
ftp	smb
speaks http https tls ftp ipv6 understands smb

2626055
fastcgi	scgi
supports scgi and fastcgi and can thus be used to run elf binaries or scripts

2626097
m2e	pom.xml	maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml
however there is a maven plugin for eclipse called m2e which will read a pom.xml and construct a classpath out of jars it finds in the local repository and any remote repositories you ve configured

2626097
maven	pom.xml
it behaves largely like maven does in terms of finding the latest version for a given jar if you ve specified a version range in your pom.xml

2626131
accessor	properties
the only problem is that buttons properties does not have a set accessor and is defined like so

2626139
children	parent
in some circumstances if you validate the children objects before the parent object then the errors on the children objects will get reset before the object is sent to the jsp.

2626151
fgets	fread
each webpage uses fopen fgets fread to read common data like navigation bars from files

2626185
stateless	stateful
exchanges are generally stateless in the amqp model though there have been some recent experiments in stateful exchanges now that there s both a system for managing rabbitmq plugins and for providing new experimental exchange types

2626205
firefox	safari
the rollovers works pretty well on firefox but in explorer the larger images show up under the central div and in safari they don t seem to work at all

2626213
children	parent
now you ve got four processes two children and two parent

2626223
udp	tcp
one of their biggest changes was dropping tcp and using udp instead

2626240

use prepare statements for queries you execute repeatedly usually with different parameters

2626258
plink	prompt
secondly i need plink running which leaves a command prompt on the desktop clutter yuck

2626258
plink	prompt
if i use plink instead of tortoiseplink in visualsvn then i never get prompt for the password

2626269
post	put
i put a blog post together a few years ago on how to do it disassembling .net - appendix a

2626302
firefox	safari
my suspicion is that ie is swapping out the image for the last it finds firefox is using the first and safari is saying screw this

2626315
uicontrol	uibutton
uibutton inherits its target action methods from uicontrol

2626323
sorting	filtering
sorting arrows dont appear but are clickable and filtering are wildy off

2626339
prepare	execute
the caveat here though is that the difference between a prepare statement and a non-prepared one becomes negligible as the computation time to execute the query and fetch the data becomes large

2626387
uiview	subviews
when zooming those subviews are not resized which is actually what we are aiming for but the problem is that the uiview frame origin is moved across the scroll view in some rather weird way

2626389
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox returns a single image and some other browsers google-chrome presumably safari returns an array of images and then the function doesn t work as expected

2626483
put	get
when i run the app in the simulator it shows the way i want - basically spinning the entire time until the selected tab loads the data from the server - but when i put the app onto my phone i only get a split-second of the spinner before it disappears

2626525
ddms	adb
i m not sure about inside of netbeans but you can use adb logcat or ddms to examine the logs which will contain...well...something

2626563
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m talking about all versions of ie firefox safari and google-chrome

2626661
int	chars
i need a solution to check a string for invalid chars and return no if there is anything other than an unsigned int in a textbox

2626697
awt	swing
reading around it seems that althrough it s possible to mix heavyweight awt and lightweight swing components some problems seem to be unavoidable

2626704
actionscript	mxml
i have done some work with mxml projects using the flex sdk but never any actionscript programming

2626716
post	get
you might get good advice if you post to rec.arts.int-fiction explaining what you hope to achieve and giving your level or programming ability

2626743
awt	swing
if it is in awt or swing then you putting it in an applet is just a packaging issue

2626749
allocator	stl
hmm since you are in c++ it sounds like you are looking for stl allocator and or placement new

2626756
rss	feed
i am saving a reference to an rss feed in mongodb each feed has an ever growing list of entries

2626757
pop-up	dialog
currently internet explorer pop-up the open save cancel dialog box with no option to automatically open the file

2626757
google-chrome	firefox
i have accomplished this in both google-chrome and firefox by choosing automatically open files of this type from now on

2626775
cos	sin
another thing you may want to keep in mind for the future the math functions cos sin expect the angle in radians whereas the .rotation property is in degrees so you must convert before using

2626782
punctuation	words
you could further extend this to look for links that have words after them but no punctuation

2626804
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you should request your data reload as early as possible such as in viewdidload or viewwillappear depending on your reuse or otherwise of view controllers

2626827

2626885
profiling	debugging
such as debugging build profiling build and a release build

2626894
spaces	delimiter
the tokenization delimiter white spaces is very too simple for natural languages

2626903
folder	directory
when people talk about creating a directory structure do they mean the folder you make within the solution explorer folder you actually find inside of a .sln file or do they mean setting up and creating folder that reside in the same folder as your .sln file or your compiled application .exe

2626911
folder	directory
visual studio directory aren t just virtual folder though they can contain filter rules so when you add a file to your project it will automatically get added to the correct filtered folder

2626912
wordpress	joomla
many css frameworksd are popular in static psd 2 xhtml+css conversion and in wordpress drupal joomla theme development

2626921
put	get
i m not a fan of how this works in visual studio i don t get why they don t just put files in physical folders

2626937
yacc	bison
i m not exactly sure of the yacc bison parsing algorithm and when it prefers shifting over reducing however i know that bison supports lr 1 parsing which means it has a lookahead token

2626947
int	double
converting from to is just like converting from double to int - it has to happen in full view of the compiler you can t hide that conversion behind the compiler s back

2626962
implements	extends
since you don t want to implements zend_db_table_abstract you could extends your current model to on __construct preform the zend_registry get db and then store it to

2626982
free	malloc
if str was pointing to a block of memory allocated by malloc and you ve called free on that memory - then accessing isn t allowed after that point

2626989
int	chars
there are many ways to do this but yes it involves generating a random int using java.util.random.nextint and then using that to map to a chars

2627130
daemon	cron
now should i have a cron job that does rake ultrasphinx index regularly or will the daemon take care of indexing whenever a new object is created

2627197
super	self
calling super and adding a check at the end and all methods returning a modified copy of self too like #tr

2627212
rdf	owl
it has been built to simplify the use of fundamental semantic web technologies rdf and owl under microsoftâ s .net platform

2627223
int	double
i suspect that the first parameter is correct because it is cast to a double during the function call and that the others are interpreted as int s and then the bits are stuffed into a double

2627315
google-chrome	firefox
this behavior is reproducible in firefox and google-chrome

2627428
pecl	pear
there is a pecl extension and a pear package for id3 tags

2627434
bids	ssis
we need to setup a local development machine with bids to develop ssis packages as we do not want to install bids on the database server itself

2627462
mdpi	hdpi	screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi
it shows wvga and fwvga in mdpi for large screens and hdpi for normal

2627462
screens	hdpi
moreover there are two screens resolutions for hdpi 480 800 and

2627533
keydown	keyup
the best you can do is a keydown or keyup event on the usercontrol

2627533
keydown	keyup
however any control which marks a keydown or keyup event as handled will prevent the usercontrol from receiving that event and thereby making the menu s response to such direct keyboard access appear patchy and inconsistent

2627533
keydown	keyup
bottom line is if you must have this feature you could probably deliver it reasonably well with keyup or keydown event handling but you need to test the ui rigorously to see if there are any circumstances where it doesn t work

2627539
post	get
change form method from post struts default setting to get

2627539
post	get
send a get before post action executing

2627539
opera	firefox
i have never tried this because it still needs some extra authentication processing when get is received by filter layer based on my understanding from ms-kb and i would not like to change the behavior with other browsers firefox opera

2627539
post	get
detecting if post was sent with zero content-length you may get it from header properties hash structure with your framework

2627542
coldfusion	railo
it works on iis and apache using coldfusion or railo given you are not behind a proxy not natting your server ip and having only one ip assigned to your server not sure which ip would be shown if there are more than one

2627884
rss	feed
in the rss feed per each there is a tag and a that contains the same but encoded that contains the topic content like the image below shows

2627890
google-chrome	firefox
this script is working fine in ie but in firefox google-chrome

2627909
pylons	turbogears	django	turbogears
while using a full framework like django pylons or turbogears is nice you could also check out the more light-weight approaches

2627937
codeigniter	pyrocms
i use codeigniter specifically pyrocms for crappy 5 page brochure-ware but that is purely to let clients admin their own pages easily with a wysiwyg

2627965
freebsd	linux
i have a project where there are windows freebsd and linux servers

2628017
jar	manifest.mf
manifest.mf from the jar file

2628025
stdout	stderr
for this type of application stdout and stderr print to the console that you launched them from creating a new console if necessary

2628025
stdout	stderr
you can still write to stdout and stderr but they don t go anywhere

2628025
stdout	stderr
one trick for subsystem windows applications is that even though there s no console you can still pipe stdout and stderr

2628030
post	get
i am still looking into how this works but i thought i would post this to get you looking into that

2628045
google-chrome	firefox
the solution mentioned earlier works in google-chrome but not in firefox for whatever reason i am quite sure it was working some time ago

2628184
csc	vbc
update i am using the csc and vbc tasks and not the solution task

2628229
nsstring	nsdata
then once -connectiondidfinishloading is called you can convert your nsdata object into an nsstring using

2628239
free	malloc
most compilers will just invoke the underlying malloc free or similar when new delete is invoked

2628275
int	chars
my two cents sizeof int + sizeof chars may not be equal to sizeof foo because of structure elements padding so allocated deallocated memory block size is sizeof foo

2628288
cvs	svn
i d like to make them change from cvs to svn mercurial or git might be even better however i can t really recommand using a system i don t know well and switching to svn will already be a great step forward

2628293
folder	directory
at a guess i could either have the service write its log file in a logs folder at the top level of the site or i could leave it where it is and set up a virtual directory to point to it

2628314
pascal	delphi
for example it s quite possible to create a pascal application which runs faster when compiled with delphi rather than an old turbo pascal compiler

2628372

letter-spacing or word-spacing

2628545
jobs	cron
i have 5-6 jobs to be done by cron and i have separated php scripts for those jobs

2628567

if they have to run at different times then obviously separate cron jobs are warranted

2628625
rss	feed
modules contain reusable portions of code that we share across projects such as libraries to work with youtube or rss feed

2628638

2629139
boost	allocator
maybe you could create a custom allocator or just use boost s pool library

2629158
equals	gethashcode
you need to implement iequatable or override equals and gethashcode

2629182
post	get
if the service provider that you are trying to access via a web page has this set up it is a very simple call to xmlhttprequest and you will get access to the resources on that site without the need for jsonp especially useful for requests that are not get post head etc

2629193
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
if you inherited from string you are violating the liskov substitution principle which states that instances of subclassing should be substitutable for instances of their superclass

2629257
post	get
the entire transmission including the query string the whole url and even the type of request get post etc. is encrypted when using https

2629321
rss	feed
if i were you i would use friendly feed which is a feature of wcf data services which allows you to map properties to feed fields which would show as proper rss feed on any rss feed reader even the default feed reader from ie 7 and 8 would display them and sort them for you

2629417
jboss	weblogic
weblogic jboss websphere

2629439
intersect	contains

2632061
opera	safari
it s definitely not pretty but i m not sure why its not working for safari opera and ie

2632063
google-chrome	firefox
i know that google-chrome and firefox both have them so you should be able to see if any errors are being generated

2632094

what you are describing is a database design issue akin to implementing table inheritance where your master table is the parent and your type-specific tables are the children

2632136

im using the asp.net xml control and want to pass it a url to a rss feed and a stylesheet - so that i can style the rss myself on my website

comparator	comparable
treeset doesn t require its type parameter to be comparable because it can take an external comparator for comparing non- comparable values

2632426
comparator	comparable
if the type would have to be comparable you couldn t create a treeset with a non-comparable type and a comparator which you can as it is now

2632426
comparator	comparable
one way to fix this while still being type-safe would have been to have two classes one with a comparable type parameter and one with a non-comparable type parameter and no default constructor only the constructor that takes a comparator but i suppose the java devs didn t want to introduce two classes that basically did the same thing though one could easily be implemented as a wrapper around the other

2632433
comparator	comparable
you can pass the set a comparator object explicitly in which case the element type does not need to be a comparable

2632936
hash	md5
encode the information then store the md5 hash

2632944
disk	ram
this is not only on disk mind you - the pages are loaded into sql server s ram in their entirety - so by potentially bloating up your clustering key you d incur performance penalties due to the larger number of pages on disk and in ram that your non-clustered indices would need

my thoughts where a salt md5 hash of the mac address or device phone number but i can t figure out how to access either of those using the python apis within ase

2633094
stdout	fflush
it seems that process wmic.exe is never finished and i suppose it s stdout is never fflush so you don t receive anything throught qprocess readall

2633099
stdout	stderr
you might also convert your disp ... statements to fprintf stderr ... i think stderr is handled differently from stdout on octave

2633103
ready	each
your problem is that is being evaluated in the document ready functions context you can use the .each function to iterate over each .help

2633104
width	height
i was able to replicate the problem by puting the width and height in as a string rather and in integer in one of my ui dialogs so i would suggest checking that

2633117
hide	show
which grid columns to show hide

2633129
width	height
if i create a popup that is sized 50 width and 100 height everything works fine but if i try to create a full screen popup sized to 100 width and height it ends up displaying at 100 width and 75 height.

2633129
width	height
note the width and height are actually being expressed in pixels in code i m using percent to make the situation a little more understandable.

2633129
width	height
if you run this the bottom 25 of the popup is missing if you change the width of the popup to 500 then it will go full height

2633167

for-loop	loops
i could use a while loops or check if i 2 0 but i was wondering if there wasn t a way to do it with the for-loop

2633344
button	checkbox
since it s html you can use button text areas checkbox etc to show information to the user and get input from them and use css to style it all

anything you can express in vbscript or jscript javascript and want an html css front on is a good candidate for an hta

2633863
fseek	ftell
so a solution might be to use ftell and then fseek to get it to correct position

2633870
feedback	review
i would probably implement this by having a feedback or review model and your user model would have one-to-many feedback review and the feedback review would have a one-to-one relationship with the user who created it

2633876
feof	fread
i m not clear but if you re interested in knowing before you read the byte if eof has been reached put your feof test before the fread rather than after it

in general it s better to go through the property getter and setter whenever possible unless there is a specific reason not to

2634397
getter	setter
the reason it s good to use the property getter and setter even in the implementing class itself when if you need to change the implementation of the getter setter in the future such as adding needed side effects your code will already be in a good position to honor the new getter setter semantics

2634637
inherited	properties
not much about the inherited of ol properties to ul s

2634637
inherited	properties
to be clear my actual question is which properties should nested ul elements inherited from ol elements that enclose them

2634637
inherited	properties
as the right pane suggests nested ul elements do inherited properties from ol elements but the browser s default values of list-style-type and list-style-position override those specified by its parent

2634637
inherited	properties
just select the ul and notice that firebug says that it inherited the list-style properties

pascal	delphi
but i am still confused my impession about oo languages is they have performance overhead because their libraries are bloated.if you write in c++ using blitz++ library it will run faster if not as fast as c but normal libraries available for c++ make c++ slower than c same applies for pascal and delphi if you use delphi7 instead of delphi 2010 to compile your program it will run faster cuz delphi 2010 units are heavier warning i havent compared delphi 7 to 2010 nor have i compared c++ to c its just my impression created by reading on line forums and language vs language debate you people might think i am crazy but i d prefer a program even as minor as text editor to run with perfection even if my programs were to run on a supercomputer i would still like to optimize the hell out of my code may be i have obsessive compulsive personality disorder

public	protected
the public private protected keywords are not meant for security but rather for encapsulation

2635795
public	protected
you design your class by separating the implementation where the private protected members are used - those actually used to implement the functionality from the interface where you expose the public members - which users of the class -other objects- will access call and thus you are later able to change the private parts without changing the interface

2635818
ienumerable	ienumerator
can anyone please explain to me what is the difference between ienumerable ienumerator

2635834
ienumerable	ienumerator
so ienumerable defines just one method - getenumerator which returns an instance of ienumerator to do the actual legwork.

2635835
ienumerable	ienumerator
ienumerable means something that can be enumerated ienumerator is something that enumerates it

2635835
ienumerable	ienumerator
in the example above i would be ienumerator and myarray would be ienumerable

examples include the siena project and objectify

2638859
objectify	siena
on the other hand objectify only works with the datastore while siena is inspired by the datastore but is designed to work with a variety of both sql databases and nosql datastores

2638918
put	get
so in the page where those visitors have to come through to get to our site i put a simple line setting a session variable

2638992
put	get
you could use a startup class for this and put the startup class in the deploy.last subdirectory of deploy to get it run after other deployments are deployed

2639035
children	parent
a good thing with qt is that you can use the parent-children mechanism so that the children will be deleted when the parent is deleted

2639035
children	parent
as i never delete the parent view i need to handle this myself as the children might need to be deleted from different times when the view is shown

2639042
multiplying	multiplication
another very useful property of those matrices is that if you have two coordinate frames linked and defined by some rotation and translation if you multiplying the two matrices together then you just need to multiplying your transformation target by the product of that multiplication

2639077
free	malloc
since you assigned some malloc storage to it there needs to be a corresponding free

2639150
mdpi	hdpi
the way to solve this is to use the mdpi hdpi and so forth folders

2639150
screens	mdpi
so to finally answer your specific question if you have an image placed in your mdpi folder it will be exactly the same size regardless of the screens resolution as long as they are all the same density

2639150
mdpi	hdpi
in that case android won t look in your mdpi folder for the image - it will go to the hdpi folder and if it can t find it there it will take the default drawable folder

2639223
integer	unsigned
when you take the absolute value the result you get is 1 whereas the actual difference between the two numbers is 0xffffffff interpreted as an unsigned integer uint_max

2639223
integer	unsigned
the difference between two signed integers is always representable as an unsigned integer

2639223
integer	unsigned
to get this value with 2s complement hardware you just subtract the smaller input from the larger and interpret the result as an unsigned integer

2639230
int	double
here we want a pointer rather than an int or a double changed so we pass a reference to a pointer

2639245
pascal	delphi
both delphi and the latest free pascal versions implement widestrings as bstr - a string data type that is used by com

2639245
pascal	delphi

pop-up	dialog
very very similar to the ie browser control but it has all sorts of cool handlers for dialog pop-up including security warnings and file download save options

2639283
getter	setter
but this is poor modularity and it forces me to add getter setter functions every time i want to bind to a new aspect of the bean

2639285
submit	submission
since you are not actually submission the form why don t you just make the submit button as a button instead of submit and do the stuff in click event as shown below

2639346
innodb	myisam
if you definitely want to use the inbuilt mysql full-text search you could cut down the myisam table so that it just contains the text data you want to search and the primary key - and then retrieve the proper data from the normal innodb tables once you know the pkey

2639813
client-side	server-side
i can control client-side script and html on both parent or child and i can create new pages if needed but i can t make any server-side code changes

2639867
getter	setter
based on the context of how this array is created in used you may want to consider using an array of a wrapper class where your setter accepts a float and getter returns an int

2639870
rss	feed
you could use the magpie library which converts rss feed into arrays making it easy to foreach the data and then just wrap it up with whatever html you want

2639872
rss	feed
well its not clear to me if youre looking for a library to ease the parsing and conversion of the rss to html out put or if youre looking for a standalone module you can just throw a number of feed at and let it do all the conversion output internally

2639875
gif	png
you ll need to stick to png or gif

2639884

2640558
gdi	direct2d
comparing direct2d and gdi

2640564
hash	salt
the combination of the global salt account specific salt and password is hash via some hashing method in postgresql haven t been able to find documentation for hashing functions in postgresql but being able to use sha-2 or something like that would be nice if i could find it

2640600
hash	salt
in terms of cryptographic hash and the choice to use a salt or not you may be interested in reading don t hash secrets

2640600

superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
in my experience inherited works with uibinder as long as your subclassing ui.xml file defines all the ui field of its superclass

2641035
inherited	properties
if you want to control the width in the containing template you can use an inherited attached properties

2641056

2641056
rss	feed
if the rss feed looks like this for example

2641056
rss	feed
it displays an outer frame of your website with a link somewhere to return and in the center displays the url from the rss feed which was passed as a parameter

2641065
versioning	upgrade
if you always have the latest versioning you are exposing yourself to being hit by productivity consuming errors security updates are a different category to feature updates but still if you are running desktop software you can isolate your security exposure and decide your own reasons to upgrade

2641132
button	checkbox
added what i would like to do here is trigger an ajax call whenever the user clicks a toggle button checkbox but to improve responsiveness i want to toggle the button state immediately and only untoggle it if the ajax call fails

2641145
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome safari all have prioritized faster javascript execution in recent versions whereas ie may show performance in ie9 i hope they do myself. also realize this slideshow will run slow in mobile devices etc

2641219
accessor	properties
the easiest way i can think of would be to type marcy as dynamic instead of object and just call the accessor which if i remember correctly is actually represented as a properties on the .net side

2641233
concurrenthashmap	blockingqueue
if you re concerned about performance then i actually think it might be better if you use the blockingqueue or a concurrenthashmap

2641250
superclass	subclassing
you can map this with annotations and or xml mappings and have a single list hibernate supports polymorphic queries you can query on the accessory superclass and get a list of subclassing

2641264
implements	extends
all you need to do is extends the class implements onupdate and then call run to start the animation

2641282
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
i would write the long to a bytearrayoutputstream wrapped in a dataoutputstream and then retrieve the raw bytes although this will always give you your data in big endian byte order most significant byte first

2641316
integer	unsigned
imagine we have a 4 bit unsigned integer

2641339
webclient	httpwebrequest
when i did this i did it using httpwebrequest however per you can subclass webclient and override the getwebrequest method to make it support cookies

2641339
webclient	httpwebrequest
edit elaboration requested i can only elaborate how to do it using httpwebrequest i have not done it using webclient

2641358
webclient	webrequest
you have some basic support and gotta admit that at least the api is designed that is really hard to do stupid stuff it forces you to use async programming so no more one-thread-per-client non-sense but i d bet you ll miss the .net sugar utilities webrequest webclient etc

2641379
maven	pom.xml
the pom.xml is still set to war but after cleaning the project i am now getting classnotfoundexceptions for libraries that are being included as maven dependencies

2641425
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works great in firefox google-chrome and safari but in internet explorer nothing happens

2641449

you should also check for eof as well as newline - and that requires an int not a chars to hold the value from getchar

2641462
drawstring	drawrectangle
the .net graphics methods for this drawrectangle and drawstring can have the drawing coordinates specified in floating point

2641478
portrait	landscape
the user will spend most of their time immersed in fullscreen content in both portrait and landscape

2641501
inherited	properties
or it can also be compared to a properties getter which by design executes some code in order to return a value while yet having the interface form that comes across more like a variable but also has polymorphic behavior that can be swapped out whether by inherited or by swapping out the function pointer that would evaluate and return a value at runtime based on compile-time or environmental characteristics

2641517
children	parent
in other words a two-level hierarchy where the first child is on the same line as the parent but subsequent children on lines following distinguished from being a parent by a two-space prefix t above represents a literal tab in the text

2641580

2641669
mouse	keyboard
in gtk application there is 1 main loop which listens for events mouse click keyboard etc

2641670

2641845
portrait	landscape
weird problem after rotating my app to portrait picking the toolbar item and exposing the uipopovercontroller if i rotate back to landscape the uinavigationcontroller on the right side objectatindex 0 of the splitview changes the color of the navigation bar

2641870
width	height
you won t be able to see the button unless you specify a height width

2641881
free	malloc
ideally the free should be visible at the same level of scope where the malloc occurred

2641881

2641974
post	get
i created a blog post recently about getting gitosis and gitweb to play nice together because i had the exact same problem and i wanted to let others know how to get it working too

2641981
getter	setter
they are related values and kept consistent by the property setter getter methods and using the fact that frame is a purely synthesized value not backed by an actual instance variable

2642031
jpql	hql
however since hibernate caches parsed hql jpql you probably won t see a big performance gain

2642095
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
needless to say it works in firefox google-chrome safari and opera but it does not in ie8 and i guess in previous versions as well

2642110
superclass	subclassing
if you re in a subclassing of dice then you can call the superclass method with the super keyword

2642115
free	malloc
depending on the compiler implementation a free d block could still appear to contain valid data until a future malloc takes over the space

2642115
strcpy	strncpy
this means constantly checking string sizes on copies using strncpy and strncat instead of the plain strcpy and strcat or similar techniques

2642128
post	get
you can pass variables from the browser to the server either via post usually a form or get in the url

2642165
super	implements
i m not super duper concerned with this particular implementation it probably has bugs -- i m going to spend some time looking at shared_ptr s innards before using something like this in production code -- i m just concerned if in general there is a specific reason reusable reference counting goodies always seem to be implements using inheritance rather than composition

2642169
folder	directory
would remove everything folder files in the current directory

hide	show
in order to use this feature you have to activate tex-fold-mode which will activate the auto-reveal feature and the necessary commands to hide and show macros and environments

2642244
hide	show
once the mode is active there are several commands available to hide and show macros environments and comments.

2642251
email	dkim
having spf and dkim in place will certainly help matters and will help build reputation over time but if email sent from your domain ip did or do get classified as users by junk or you do other things that seem fishy to the providers like sending too many email to their domain per unit time no amount of effort on your end can overcome that

2642263
int	boolean
not really an answer but i think your code would be simpler if you used a boolean instead of an int something like

2642265
google-chrome	firefox
i want to mimic the functionality of google-chrome firefox for example when rearranging your bookmarks when you are dragging the menu item it creates a black line at the proposed drop point like this

client-side	server-side
following conallen s paper we defined a new uml entities stereotypes to represent a web page or portion of a page so that we could distinguished the server-side code java servlet or jsp from the client-side html javascript ajax that it generated

2642595
client-side	server-side
this approach was a lot work - we now had twice as many entities to model with since we were now modeling the client-side entities in addition to the server-side classes

for-loop	loops
functional approaches often eliminate complex conditional bodies within for loops if statements and continue statements because you can break the for-loop down into logical steps - selecting all the elements that match doing an operation on them .

debian	linux
i use linux as webserver distribution not chosen now but should be debian

2647413
width	height
use although width is preferable - i haven t tested for height for the image tag inside your gallery div and size the images large enough to fill a large screen depth so they do not pixellate when enlarged

2647463
post	get
what search module does is take the values from form_state in hook_form_submit and pastes them into the url then it sets the form_state redirect to that new url effectively storing those variables in the url and changing the post to a get

if i put in the correct values then i get the results i expect

2647537
postgresql	mysql
it works when using mysql but won t work with postgresql

2647627
filesystems	ntfs
that being said please make sure that the full path to the file do not exceed path length limitations of your filesystems and that the number of files in your folder doesn t exceed limitations either for example 65534 entries is the max for ntfs partitions

2647655
nntp	telnet
maybe i am showing my nerdiness here but i have actually written and read e-mails via smtp and pop3 read usenet articles via nntp and viewed web pages via http using telnet for no other reason than to see whether it would actually work

versioning	upgrade
i was finally able to get a successful build and ilmerge but now i get an error related to the framework versioning of topshelf when executing the upgrade fullduplex sample using the newly compiled libraries

2647735
maven	pom.xml
a directory structure will be created by maven and there will be a pom.xml inside your project directory

2647749
int	chars
this would have been much easier if you were sorting dword values int instead of byte values chars

2647751
for-loop	loops
a for-loop can always be replaced by a recursive function that doesn t involve the use of a loops

2647807
portrait	landscape

2647817
typedef	struct
using the typedef keyword you can add a name for the variable to the type namespace so that you do not have to use the struct keyword in your declarations

2647817
typedef	struct
the example you gave combined the typedef declaration with the struct definition but used different names for the struct in the type namespace and the struct namespace

2647817
typedef	typename
first prefixing a statement which looks exactly like a variable declaration with typedef defines a typename instead of a variable with the name specified

2647817
typedef	struct
defining a struct or class or union or enum automatically adds the name you used if any to the namespace which typedef adds names to

2647817
typedef	struct
mostly this compatibility has to do with noticing when someone typedef struct foo foo

2647842
post	get
updating an item on the get of a sharepoint page instead of on the post ie page.ispostback is false

2647868
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
make sure that in every uiviewcontroller uitabbarcontroller etc. in the shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation the return says

2647900
octal	decimal	octal	hex
that works okay because ecmascript defines that is the same as omitting the argument and consequently allows decimal octal or hex using decimal in this case

2647918
inherited	properties
updatemodel and tryupdatemodel did not seem to update inherited public properties

2647918
inherited	properties
solved mvc.net does indeed handle inherited properties just fine

2647928
range	max
i don t think it is possible however there are other markers you can put on the gauge to indicate start range max etc

2648030
integer	unsigned
uint is an unsigned integer

2648032
int	chars
and many people considered it good form to use abstract types rather than just specifying everything as a primitive int chars or

2648038
mouseover	mouseout
i think you probably want to have a mouseout handler on your themes div which slides up all of the nested uls and a mouseover handler for each tier_1 anchor that closes the other nested uls and slides open it s nested ul

2648053
firefox	safari
ie works just fine but firefox and safari are giving me trouble

2648087
int	boolean
for example there is no boolean type but there is an aliased representation of a int that tells you that a particular variable is supposed to be treated as a boolean

2648100
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
when using sqlconnection sqlcommand sqldatareader and friends that s all it took

2648187
bash	zsh
you should run this command not from a rails console but from your os console like bash or zsh

2648205
children	parent
this doesn t work without an extra bit of css html because the parent doesn t automatically grow to fit floated children

2648208
post	get
whether on stackoverflow or the apple forums you ll get a better response if you post a specific question with technical detail describe what you tried the results you got and how they differ from what you want

2648262
codeigniter	kohana
if you re looking for some direction on architecture and best practices i d highly recommend checking out a popular php framework like codeigniter or kohana

2648272
for-loop	loops
if you wanted to loops over specifically using a for-loop and output the corresponding message you could do

2648311
ostream	istream	std	ostream
also in the header you should write std istream instead of just istream same for ostream etc

2648346
sorting	filtering
the easiest way to do this while still preserving most of the functionality of a date field including sorting and filtering is by using an integer in the format of yyyymmdd

2648350
vsto	add-in
i m working on a powerpoint vsto add-in and am needing to get at the margins between list items

2648362
pull	push
doing a bzr push or bzr pull results in the removed file s being removed on the other branches other sites that use our code

2648362
pull	push
we need a way to make sure that a bzr push or bzr pull doesn t actually remove those from the working copy

2648410
post	get
well it s definitely being caused because either the post or get variables have a bad value for expires

2648489
wordpress	joomla
i m doing this for free so i need to use a free cms like wordpress drupal or joomla

2648495
inherited	properties
mvc will bind to properties of the inherited class

2648507
getter	setter
of course this only applies to languages where getter setter are the norm but is not directed at any specific language

2648540
fullcalendar	datejs
if my main plugin detects that any of the plugins datejs ui datepicker or fullcalendar are loaded then it would load a simple wrapper extension for it that would provide the required parse and format functions

2648549
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
if you didn t use them both the accessor and mutators getter and setter would have the same name

2648557
firefox	safari
as a side note safari 4.0.4 only scrolls horizontally sometimes and the scrolling feels sticky and jumpy whereas firefox always smoothly scrolls horizontally

2648563
put	get	post	put	post	get
in a full restful app you d use the different http methods of post get put and delete to handle records

2648568
websphere	ibm
i want to develop richface implented app on ibm websphere

2648577
boost	stl
it seems to me that being familiar with the stl and boost leads to use of dependency injection quite a bit

2648607
prepare	execute
and the prepare statement is execute -- working on those data

2648621
implements	extends
you will need to implements your own class that extends abstractstatushandler

2648662
serializable	deserialization
the problem apparently is that you ve serializable a class of type a and try to deserialize it or cast it after deserialization to type b a different type

2648670
getter	setter
the automatic grouping of getter and setter when all functions are listed in their alphabetical order greatly helps to distinguish between simple data access and advanced functinality

2648720
jar	war
actually a war web application archive file is a jar file

2648720
jar	.war
every servlet container accept jar packed application with .war extension

2648733
width	height
i can easily calculate the width of the squares in the grid by ie 100 n but i am having issues calculating the height

2648745
fgets	fread
you could use fgets fread etc

2648771
google-chrome	firefox
i m almost certain that this is an html 5 feature it s supported on google-chrome and firefox 3.5 and was wondering if somebody knew how is the browser feature called

2648775
put	get
i put matlab to work code below and found when either a or b is negative you get zero

2648775
range	min
otherwise you get b so the answer is b min a b if a and b are positive though strictly speaking the answer should be none of the above because there are no range restrictions on either variable

2648781
put	get
file will get the contents of a file and put it into an array

2648818
post	get
to get all post that belongs to a single user you can add this line to the user s model

2648853
folder	directory
i m aware of the kb article regarding this error in streets tips but mappoint 2010 runs fine on its own and as i said the app runs fine from within vs or when run from a non-protected folder if i do an x-copy of the files to my user s directory it runs fine

2648854
ilist	icollection
earlier i was having a similar problem where i was trying to implicitly cast inventory from an ilist to an icollection

2648861
hide	show
i understand that the technique tends to be show all rows filter the set show hide that filtered set

2648887
ienumerable	ilist
and even then it only works with ienumerable and not ilist

2648917
inherited	properties
in the first approach when you instantiate your next view controller you could set an array properties to inherited from the current soon-to-be previous or parent view controller

2648917
inherited	properties
with this approach if you rearrange your view controllers or insert new view controllers into your vc hierarchy you wouldn t need to debug child view controller properties inherited from parent view controllers because a reference is always available from the app delegate

2648920
width	height
you can animate width and height of an invisible clear object very easily

2648932
children	parent
each tag can have children parent but only the children are saved

2648935
submit	submission
i d like to do this so submission the form automatically closes the lights out messagebox rather than app users seeing what happens in the iframe after they submit the form

2648939
for-loop	loops
if you want to loops through you d have to use each or a for-loop

2648974
post	get
however a datatype of script will turn a cross-domain post into a get as per the documentation

2648987
passenger	unicorn
by decoupling that it lets the myriad ruby frameworks rails sinatra ramaze etc target a single interface and the myriad app servers mongrel apache with passenger unicorn etc do the same

2649051
ssl	https
ftps ftp over ssl tls - it s equivalent of https which in simple terms means it s encrypted version of the ordinary ftp protocol

2649054
children	parent
usually an element can only have one parent but multiple children - ie it s a foreignkey from child to parent

2649054
children	parent
the way you have it each element can have multiple parent and multiple children so i don t see how a hierarchical relationship is possible

2649056
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
i m curious as to the procedure for writing browser plugins for browsers like google-chrome safari and opera

2649102
client-side	server-side
alternately if the json serializer on the server supports a replacer parameter as crockford s and ecmascript 5th edition s do you could supply a replacer that formatted the date into a string server-side and handle it there since you said you don t want to parse the date client-side although the jquery tag suggested to me maybe you did

2649114
getter	setter
a getter setter is used to hide a private field from the publicity you can avoid direct access to a field

2649117
getter	setter
getter setter separate interface getter setter functions from implementation how the data is actually stored

2649124
jboss	weblogic
your configuration may be different because you are using weblogic rather than jboss

2649139
lisp	prolog	lisp	scheme	scheme	prolog
include one language that supports class abstractions like java or c++ one that supports functional abstraction like lisp or ml one that supports syntactic abstraction like lisp one that supports declarative specifications like prolog or c++ templates one that supports coroutines like icon or scheme and one that supports parallelism like sisal

2649143
getter	setter
getter and setter allow you to control how data members of an object can be accessed or changed

2649163
maya	blender
works with blender but collada support is coming so that should open it up to xsi maya and max

2649170
pdcurses	ncurses
i d recommend looking at pdcurses which is a windows-compatible replacement of ncurses

2649189
width	height
the font sizes are adjusted so that the height is scaled down for longer lines of text such that each line has equal width

2649205
webclient	webrequest
you may consider using webrequest webclient classes

2649267
vsts	tfs
most of the other main features of vsts relate to tfs and team explorer which i believe are independent of projects solutions

2649302
lemmatization	stemming
i am guessing stemming lemmatization would help as well

2649322
bufferedreader	ioexception
i am trying to ensure that a file i have open with bufferedreader is closed when i catch an ioexception but it appears as if my bufferedreader object is out of scope in the catch block

2649324
int	chars
why could not you just use 1 byte int value to store ascii chars

2649324
int	chars
if you call printf you apecify the datatype in the call so you could say to printf that the int represents ascii chars

2649333
put	get
when does the 5 get transferred into aglobal by the loader and how does it know to put 5 in aglobal

2649338
put	get
it doesn t seem to matter what i put in the command string the commands all work manually but get permission denied errors when executed via system

2649347
getter	setter
public accessors getter and setter make sometimes sense

2649370
stdout	fflush
or you can use fflush to fflush the stdout

2649407
many-to-many	one-to-many
tags and posts are a many-to-many association not one-to-many

2649420
apache	nginx
i have been following these instructions for setting up a django production server with postgres apache nginx and memcache

2649443
int	chars
there is was no 1-byte int type other than chars and signed and unsigned variants thereof

2649479
pull	push
then i just push pull to the appropriate remote it s a bit messy but it works

2649482
int	chars
the chars type can be though of as just another numerical type just like int short and long

2649482
unsigned	short
char is just the numeric type that holds a single singed unsigned byte the same as short is the numeric type that holds a signed 16 bit word

2649482
int	chars
1 byte int chars

2649483
int	chars
the chars type is a one byte int in c actually not quite true- it s an integral type large enough to hold any chars from the basic chars set but its size is implementation dependent. note that you can have both signed chars and unsigned chars something that doesn t make a lot of sense if you re talking about a data type that only holds chars

2649483
int	chars
but the one byte int is called chars in c because that s the most common use for it again see disclaimer above.

2649492
do-while	break
this is called an unlabeled break statement and its purpose is to terminate while for and do-while loops

2649503
put	get
another way that i ve used in the past to get a few people to beta test my apps is have them put the apk file on the phone s sd card

2649512
post	put
basically it says a single request does not support transactions and it doesn t make sense to support them since only one entity and cud operation is involved in a single post put delete request

2649512
post	put
using batch requests a whole bundle of post put delete requests being sent in one step from client to the server

2649523
int	chars
in c chars is an 1 byte int and that is also used to store a chars

2649523
int	chars
a chars is just a 1 byte int in c

2649536
daemons	systemd
this is a good case for using a database especially if you can architect the systemd such that there is a data collection daemons that manages the continuous communication with the embedded device

2649579
for-loop	loops
before this block of code is a for-loop that goes through each message in the box and after it is loops that just goes through parts for each imap structure

2649598
hide	show
obviously the show hide is targeting the id selector but i can t help but wonder about that period in the control s name

2649627
integer	unsigned
otherwise if both operands have signed integer types or both have unsigned integer

2649627
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand

2649627
integer	unsigned
then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type

2649627
integer	unsigned
if the type of the operand with signed integer type can represent all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned

2649627
integer	unsigned
integer type then the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to the type of the operand with signed integer type

2649627
integer	unsigned
otherwise both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type corresponding to the type of the operand with signed

2649627
integer	unsigned
for the bolded rule to be applied it would seem to imply you need to have have an unsigned integer type who s rank is less than the signed integer type and the signed integer type cannot hold all the values of the unsigned integer type

2649631
hibernate	gilead
i am using gwt for the ui and hibernate with gilead to connect to a mysql database backend

2649634
folder	directory
i was able to find dxerr.h in the folder and the path is also being included in the vc++ directory tab in the options window

2649664
min	max
a ui box that displays random number between min and max value for 2 seconds then shows blank for 2 seconds then shows another random numer for 2 seconds then shows blank for 10 seonds and then repeats the cycle infitely until form closed

2649735
g++	gcc
under gcc g++ i have compiled a static .a call it some_static_lib.a library

2649766
activemq	rabbitmq
if you have tons and tons of data and you need aggregate tables you should look into offloading statistics collection and perhaps the database queries themselves to a queue like rabbitmq or activemq

2649771
lxml	beautifulsoup
use a html parser such as lxml or beautifulsoup

2649791
multiplying	add
strength reduction add instead of multiplying

2649803
int	chars
in this case i m using a chars and int but if i use long and long long int c99 then i get similar behaviour

2649830
serializable	deserialization
if anyone can look into this for me as i ve no experience with serializable or deserialization i d be very grateful

2649843
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
the total space that an element takes up is the height width + padding + border + margin

2649876
unsigned	short	int	chars
however let me observe that if what you want to use is an unsigned 8 bit int just use s uint8_t already and its 16 32 64bit companions and keep away from all the chars s short s and int s in this world

2649895
post	put
i will post code if somebody could narrow down what code to put

2649917
post	get
when you know that just use c# to post the same values and you ll get the same sheet back

2649931
jar	war
you can deploy a jar file into a war file or you can deploy a jar file into the classpath of the server or still yet you can deploy a jar file into lib folders of most servers

2649935
adam	adlds
if all you re trying to achieve is some quick and easy connectivity to an ad adam adlds instance for relatively simple operations it might be worth sticking with that namespace - otherwise i would strongly recommend you invest the time to learn the protocols namespace

2649940
swt	swing	cpython	ironpython
two more options somewhat more out of the box would include leaving cpython behind and leveraging ironpython which runs on the .net runtime and hence has access to windows.forms or to be really obtuse gtk# via mono and jython which runs on the jvm and can leverage either the quite messy swing which has some native windows widget support or swt which supports native windows widgets

2649945
int	chars	int	double
simple types bool byte chars short int long float and double

2649957
wxpython	pyqt
yes you can use pyqt or pyside another qt binding or wxpython

2649966
linefeed	delimiter
i m guessing that to fix this i need to write some other line-delimiting character into the end of the stream instead of cr linefeed that the mainframe will recognize as a record delimiter

2649999
linefeed	delimiter
i actually had the exact same problem and i fixed it by using just linefeed as the delimiter

2650021
folder	directory
the actual implementation of auth is actually kept in the kohana_auth class which is located in the kohana folder which part of the module directory structure

2650021
folder	directory
to extend the auth module add your own functionality you simply place an auth.php file in the classes folder of your application directory

2650041
zlib	libpng
i have installed the gnuwin32 set of utilities including libpng and zlib

2650092
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
browsers like netscape-based browsers google-chrome safari and opera uses npapi plugin system you can learn how to write npapi plugins in and

2650093
jobs	cron
the #1 problem that anybody runs into with cron jobs is that usually for security reasons cron jobs run with a minimal

2650107
addclass	removeclass
i ve tried both ways of replacing the class attr class lock and removeclass then addclass

2650114
folder	directory
i m trying to use the directory_map source directory false function to scan through user uploaded folder files

2650134
accessor	properties
this way the properties s accessor which you create with synthesize will handle calling retain for you

2650157
spaces	delimiter
the only work around i could see and this is kind of sketchy is if the username were to be typed as a single entry with a string first last delimiter by a spaces in place of the username

2650197
ant	maven
another alternative to ant is a product called maven

2650197
ant	maven
both ant and maven do the same thing but in quite different ways

2650197
ant	maven
lookup ant and maven for more details

2650247
dlsym	dlopen
but also write some initialization that calls dlopen on the original library and dlsym to get the function pointer to the original oldfunc

2650253
dlsym	dlopen
from there you want to look at the dlopen and dlsym calls to get at the actual functions in the original library

2650305
min	max	min	median	median	max
i am simply taking the min max mean median q1 q3 as my feature vector for each 4x4 block

2650330
aptana	radrails
radrails 3 is supposed to have it aptana 3 will have it

2650359
glassfish	geronimo	geronimo	jonas	jboss	jonas	jboss	geronimo	jboss	glassfish
if you re looking for a java ee server you basically have two options glassfish or jboss geronimo or jonas just have too small communities and i m not aware of serious references for them - which doesn t mean there aren t any - i wouldn t pick them

2650377
width	height
you may also want to control width and height use a different profile from the default one etc -- the command-line arguments let you do all that

2650394
post	get
if youre still having problems post back here and well help you get through it

2650415
cvs	svn
project-wise it would be best to store these changes in separate folders as in a svn or cvs repository

2650423
jar	war
packaging into jar war ejb-jar ear

2650423
ant	maven
so as you can see compiling is only a small part of the build and the best practice is to fully automate all the steps with tools like maven or ant and to run the build continuously which is known as continuous integration

2650458
getter	setter
i have a simple boolean object with a getter and a setter

2650506
hide	show
simply put the view should concern itself with the ui details show hide enable disable ui elements and leave all business logic processing to the controller

2650525
uiview	subviews
note tableview2 is actually a subviews of the parent uiview as opposed to the parent being a uitableview

2650574
innodb	myisam
then you ll have to change your storage engine for innodb myisam tables do not support transactions technically you won t get an error but a rollback won t rollback anything

2650593
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
based on firefox s behavior i haven t tested ie opera or safari

2650645
post	get
i am trying to get my most voted post to display in my views post index.html.erb view

visible programs can even be controlled by java.awt.robot keyboard mouse

2650707
libjpeg	libpng
i also have fall back code that will call libpng libjpeg my .gif loader etc

2650749
integer	unsigned
method calcular paquete as cantidaddebytes as integer as unsigned small integer

2650760
children	parent
if you want all the children of the parent container to set their own opacity regardless of the parent you can just set the alpha channel of the parent panel s background instead of setting opacity to get a slightly transparent background without impacting the child elements

2650760
children	parent
however if you want all the children except one to adhere to the parent s opacity that is a little more complicated

2650778
pull	push
you need to run bzr rm --keep in all locations manually before updating them with pull push

strcpy	strtok
allocates exactly one char for storage into which you are then copying more than one - strcpy needs to put at a bare minimum the null terminator but in your case also the results of your strtok as well

2650820
free	malloc
the reason it may work on a different system is that some implementations of malloc will allocate at a certain resolution a multiple of 16 bytes no matter what actual value you ask for so you may have some free space there at the end of your buffer

2650837
post	get
using tokens in conjunction with the post redirect get design pattern seems to be the best available solution

2650852
solaris	bsd
on solaris and bsd you can consider using dtrace as a general application monitoring tool

2650885
pbm	pgm	ppm	pgm	ppm	pbm
emacs has built in support for xbm and pbm pgm ppm images

2650885
gif	png	tiff	png
emacs is compiled to recognize jpeg png gif and tiff images also but displaying these image types require external dlls which are not bundled with emacs

2650885
gif	png	tiff	png
those dlls for the various image formats are as far as i know - xpm xpm4.dll png libpng13.dll zlib1.dll jpeg jpeg62.dll tiff libtiff3.dll and gif giflib4.dll

2650913
button	checkbox
i was wondering if there is a way to be able to get the flexibility of a checkbox check uncheck in addition to disabling or enabling the other checkbox when one of them is checked or unchecked instead of using three radio button

2650913
button	checkbox
using a checkbox as radio button was just a thought

2650933
free	malloc
besides klatchko s correct point that the standard does not provide for it real malloc free implementations often allocate more space then you ask for

2650945
button	checkbox
you should not use checkbox as radio button or vice-versa this is inconsistent with the user s mental model so it confuses people

2650958
put	get	post	put	post	get
or you can structure your controller tests so that the code in my_method is exercised as part of a controller action that can be called by one of the standard http verbs get post put delete

2650958
post	get
ultimately it has to be possible to reach any code that your controller uses by setting up tests with get post etc because otherwise rails couldn t do it and your app wouldn t work

2650970
gif	png
i did the same thing for jpeg62.dll and giflib4.dll and now my emacs supports jpg gif and png files

2651057
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
if you re planning to upgrade anyway this might be a good opportunity to simply back up your data uninstall your current tfs and install the 2010 versioning -- the upgrade scenario is delightfully simple

2651057
versioning	upgrade
you can perform an in-place upgrade by doing an upgrade on the same hardware that was running the earlier versioning of team foundation server

2651057
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
when you use this path you must uninstall the previous versioning of team foundation server install team foundation server 2010 and then run the upgrade wizard

2651066
cos	sin
but with a flipping of cos and sin i was able to get it to work

2651091
post	get
if i change the get to a post everything works fine

2651137
public	protected
so can i consider a protected internal member as a public member in the same assembly

2651137
public	protected
see i am able to access protected internal in a non deriving class...so its working as public in same assembly..what do you say

2651141
width	height
assuming furthermore that a pixel is relative to mm equally in length as in width that means monitor is 1080 1920 th times as height as it is with

2651141
width	height
and since w and h are known from the resolution setting you can now calculate the screen s width and height in inches cm mm as well

2651246
folder	directory
be sure to unzip in the root folder so it creates the directory structure correctly and replaces the deployment manifest .application in the root folder that points to the right version

2651248
httpresponse	request	httprequest	httpresponse
at system.web.services.protocols.serverprotocolfactory.create type type httpcontext context httprequest request httpresponse response boolean abortprocessing

2651256
centos	linux
the container environment is centos linux system

2651264
maven	m2e
that way of adding dependencies is better managed by maven with m2e

2651288
disk	ram
since it s mainly an in-memory store you will need enough physical ram to store 90 2gb but not all of this needs to be in one vm or one machine obviously. coherence also has persistence configuration to save and load cache data from disk but i am not sure of the file format probably some coherence-specific thing

2651297
x86	64bit
a typical use cases in the x86 world is the translation of 16bit real mode code to 32 or 64bit protected mode code to not to be forced to emulate a cpu in real mode

2651384
google-chrome	safari
you could tr to target webkit broswers only in your css to separate the behaviours of ie and google-chrome safari ius a webkit browser too

2651384
google-chrome	safari
then use setup the properties that work for ie in the ie css and the properties that work for google-chrome safari in the normal css

2651384
google-chrome	firefox
note that even between firefox and google-chrome there are a few differences in how they interpret css

2651419
onclick	onsubmit
i ve tried adding onclick alerts to the submitt button and onsubmit alerts to the form elements and i can verify that the submit button is being triggered and that the form does get submitted

2651445
uitableview	nsindexpath
so if you change the data source you should also check that your is - uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath method is updating all the cells to the correct new values

2651455
inherited	properties
in this example #main-content inherited the properties of .grid_19 it s a div with 750px of width 19 columns with a semantic id

2651475
versioning	upgrade
i am just wondering on what versioning of visual studio 2010 to install professional or premium if there are a few people in the team with a mix of vs2010 professional premium would opening solution project files be an issue ie incorrect versioning or prompts to upgrade prjects

2651483

2651675
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
asp.net asp.net-mvc html.actionlink keeping route value i don #39

2651693
qframe	qwidget
i mean which class do we need to use in qt qframe or qwidget

2651817
post	get
an important note is that jsonp works only with get methods and not post

2651830
qscrollarea	qframe
qframe qscrollarea etc

2651832
vim	emacs
if bandwidth is too narrow or you don t manage the linux box you could access via ssh or telnet and work in console mode with emacs vim gdb and all that stuff

2651836
temp	tmp
for the directory itself you can either get the dirname of the filename generated by the above functions or in windows you can get the environmental variable temp and on unix-likes you can either get the variable tmpdir or use tmp if tmpdir is not set

2651849
webrat	cucumber
update unless i m mistaken capybara has more or less superseded webrat and generally the there s an opinion that cucumber level tests should exercise the actual user interface and not the api that interface interacts with

2651889
bazaar	git
winmerge version 2.12.4 already includes a filter but at least in my installation the filters for subversion git and bazaar were commented out

2651903
button	checkbox
styling checkbox and radio button with css and javascript

2652033
folder	directory
that way the tests are obtained when the code for the project is checked out and you don t have the test projects folder polluting the directory structure at the project level

2652054
put	get
the most likely candidate would probably a combination of locate to find the position of the and then a pair of substr calls to get the portions before and after then using concat to put them back together

2652056
unix	bsd
for unix linux bsd variants you have codesourcery s free toolchains and the gcc toolchain from gnuarm.com

2652082
apache	nginx
in this particular project we re using django and nginx or apache

2652083
implements	extends
in c# i think dictionary extends or at least implements a collection

2652118
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
this is not a problem for addition and multiplication but it would be a problem for subtraction and division for example

2652139
telerik	radwindow
i have two user controls that contain the telerik radwindow

2652238
filesystems	fat
there s a limit on 512 entries in the root directory of fat filesystems

2652238
filesystems	fat
this limit comes about because the root directory lives in a particular place on fat filesystems

2652259
min	max
then you can left join on this and convert to dates based on number of days between min and max

2652535
addition	multiplication
in addition your computations might be cheaper since you apply your algorithm for fewer digits depending on how expensive multiplication is in base 3

2652547
division	multiplication
it s just as fast as going the opposite direction if not faster given that division generally takes longer than multiplication

2652588
division	multiplication
even simpler and probably even faster because multiplication is faster than division is dav s answer which is the most natural algorithm.

2652597
ssl	https
upload the file using ssl tls with https or a socket + sslstream and let the server require the client to present an x.509 client certificate

2652660
width	height
also add height and width of your image

2652667
websphere	ibm
i m pretty new to websphere application development and i m missing the source attachment for all the classes in the packages in my ibm rational application developer setup

2652719
versioning	upgrade
now there s two months between those dates but generally adacore seems to and understandably upgrade their pro versioning before migrating the upgrade into their gpl versioning

2652758
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
it can use the getelementbyid and getelementsbytagname methods to quickly get elements for a specific id and for a specific tag name

2652882
google-chrome	firefox
that s a standard html5 feature only supported by google-chrome 4+ and firefox 3.6+ so far

2652898
mvp	presenter
actually my scenario has mvp pattern.now most of the interaction between presenter and view in most forms is the same - user clicks add a new row is added with some default values for the entity to show in the grid n some other common stuff

2653088
hash	md5
this example simple takes a hash of the filename in this case md5 just because you re probably familiar with it

2653088
hash	md5
the sscanf just gets the first character of the hash and turns it into a number between 0 and 15 since md5 returns a hexadecimal number

2653137
gridview	rowdatabound
what i m trying to do is handling a sort of rowadded or rowdatabound like in aspx gridview event

2653175
yslow	pagespeed
pagespeed and yslow run in the browser and do not only measure loading of one url but also of all resources linked on that url in addition to import and url directives in css files and javascript resources lazy loaded while the dom is loading

2653184
rss	feed
this can happen in quite a few circumstances for example when calling url site with set or when using request redirect or when generating an rss feed using the feed helper

2653208
mouse	keyboard
but a view essentially has mouse and keyboard events as input and drawn pixels as output

2653236
teamsite	interwoven
i see in the book the definitive guide to interwoven teamsite mention of objects for the interwoven livesite product

2653236
teamsite	interwoven
as it stands now from my limited understanding it appears that the least path of resistance is deploying interwoven s livesite with the existing teamsite implementation so content can be both consumed and rendered via rss .

2653247
min	max
if you only want one you need to decide which one and do that in the code you could use a top 1 with an order by you could use max you could use min etc depending on what your real requirement for the data is

2653272
serializable	deserialization
system.servicemodel.web and the class is datacontractjsonserializer for json serializable and deserialization on windows phone 7 - sorry about the inaccurate reply i have corrected after a comment posted here

2653288
nsstring	nsdata
note hasheddata is nsdata not nsstring

2653332
mvp	presenter
unlike the presenter in mvp a viewmodel does not need a reference to a view

2653377
put	get
you should be able to get around this by updating the security policy but it s generally better to not put your libs into the tomcat container which i assume you are doing

2653388
cvs	svn
in the past i ve used the value of date -u + y m d h m s as we were using cvs not svn

2653502
mp3	wav
i ve got a couple of wav files and possibly a mp3 that i d like to mix down to a single wav or mp3-file

g++	gcc
does g++ any version but gcc 4.1.2 is most interesting have any options that would

2653564
width	height
2 dimensions of your cube again vector of 3 floats describing height width and depth of cube

2653564
direct3d	directx
directx direct3d documentation has lots of info this kind of stuff if this is what are you looking for

2653582
google-chrome	firefox
you may also find it handy to use firefox or google-chrome as you can edit bits of css live this means you can very quickly see if you the differences of overflow auto or overflow scroll for example

2653590
for-loop	loops
not exactly the code so i don t really need suggestions about refactoring but my problem is this - with this code i get a compiler error for the first - variable arrayindex hides a variable in an enclosing block. as far as i can tell arrayindex is local to the first for-loop and shouldn t exist by the time we reach the second loops

2653609
remoteview	appwidgetprovider
so in your appwidgetprovider class whenever you are updating your appwidget you need to create a remoteview object build up all the view settings for your appwidget using that object and then make one call to appwidgetmanager.updateappwidget when you are done

2653639
srp	principles
make sure the gateway classes conform to srp and the other solid principles

2653668
width	height
i have some internal calculations i need to run based on the height and width of the custom control

2653672
datalist	repeater
if you use asp .net web forms then you can look at listview datalist and repeater controls

2653713
division	multiplication
hopefully everyone knows that division is a big time sink even compared to a multiplication

2653795
g++	gcc
i don t think such option feature exists in gcc g++

2653798
gridview	rowdatabound
you should be using the gridview s rowcreated or rowdatabound events to modify information

2653801
rss	feed
the data is going into an rss 2.0 feed using the some standard rss attributes as well as some custom defined google attributes

2653887
snmp	mib
a mib allows a snmp client to interpret the information returned by the agent by giving it a readable name rather than just the oid correctly displaying data in the desired format etc.

2653910
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this work fine in firefox and ie but in safari and google-chrome the buttons end up in the same spot causing them all to display sub menus when you hover over the first button

2653914
puts	gets
case 2 the member puts in an area city county etc. and gets a list of members in that area

2653914
post	get
search post code + radius 5miles 10miles etc and get a set of applicable post codes to then join onto the membership records in the database

2653923
webchromeclient	webviewclient
basically i m retrieving the web view from the xml and setting it a webviewclient and a webchromeclient

2653930
folder	directory
or you could use the isdir field if you only want files in the directory not folder

2653930
folder	directory
for a list of folder in the directory excluding

2653949
webkit	gecko	awt	swing
i d like to have gecko webkit or another webbrowser embedded in java as a swing awt control

2654063
textview	imageview
all i m trying to do is open a very simple application that is supposed to do nothing but display an imageview above a textview

2654068
vpn	lan
if the file is on your lan or vpn you can use a unc path

2654103
google-chrome	firefox
it works in ie7 mode and firefox google-chrome etc

2654134
mouseup	mousedown
you can use images instead of drawing the whole close button it would be much easier to use for example imagine you have 3 states for the button mouseup mousedown pressed which must be declared as an enum and in the event handlers of your custom control just need to change the enum to mousedown mouseup or pressed

2654155
sudo	passwd
if you want to only allow people with a passwd to run a program then the secure way is to create a new user account that owns the program and have a script that uses sudo to run the program as that user - it will prompt for the users passwd in a secure way

2654181
decoder	encoder
the commons codec library provides a base64 encoder decoder for you to use

2654192
versioning	upgrade
if you can t upgrade to the latest versioning the blog post sifr 3 and ie8 1.bottom js error has a possible fix

2654206
vim	emacs
there s always emacs or vim i lean towards vim but that s just my opinion

2654256
pop-up	dialog
pop-up a dialog for the user and ask

2654331
accessor	properties
and the technology you need to pass values around is an understanding of objective-c properties and in general accessor methods

2654335
width	height
it may be easier to figure out the height and width of your custom control rather than the cell of a datagrid

2654335
actualheight	actualwidth
your control should have access through framework element to the properties actualheight and actualwidth

2654335
width	height
also the sizedchanged event will be fired on your control every time the height and width change

2654335
width	height
i highly recommend placing this height and width logic inside of your control

2654353
put	get
vim might not know how to indent your filetype or you may have to download the filetype plugin and put it in the right folder i don t know where to get that plugin

2654398
stdout	stderr
so you might want to add flags to control whether you want to capture stdout stderr and stdin

2654414
ienumerable	iqueryable
i had a partial class for one of my entities from linq-to-sql with an iqueryable property but somehow returning an iqueryable from an entityset caused my later queries to behave in an ienumerable read linq-to-objects way even though they were acting on iqueryable types

2654478
pull	push
push pull etc is working as expected for existing repositories

2654517
extjs	mootools
so learn one or more of the big javascript libraries closure extjs mootools dojo jquery etc. but also learn how to do all of the same things that the library does without using them

2654526
post	get
i m trying to get various sizes post listing results 160x160 single.php 618x150 and for some reason the single.php one works but only half way

2654538
superclass	subclassing
a getclass in a superclass called from the subclassing will always return the class object from the subclassing which is good i think

2654619
hide	show
i implemented this jquery show hide code and everything works fine except that the box that i want to hide with slow javascript browsers ie 6 is hidden after the webpage has been loaded or at least all the js

2654624
put	get
i put this in a new class instead of using the hashtable get set methods direct because this leaves room for customization so the messagebox could be created in the get and more than 1 piece of information could be stored in the set to handle messagebox title buttontype content etc etc

2654640
post	get
for example a get request to mydomain.com foo 53 to get foo 53 or a post to mydomain.com foo to create a new foo

2654661
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the problem being the timelines vertical multicoloured lines on the right and this looks and works fine in firefox and opera for mac and pc ie8 but scary things happens in google-chrome and safari

2654675
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
you ve got two options either 1 just use a zip library like sharpziplib or dotnetzip or 2 try to use the system.io.packaging namespace

2654698
ubuntu	linux
i have an application which runs on tomcat 6.0.20 server on linux ubuntu server

2654705
folder	directory
you could then either put the plugin packages directly into the root directory of that new project or because you don t want to change the file structure you could add the folder in the properties for the plugin flex library project in the source path tab under flex library build path

2654722
children	parent
scan that list pick up each node find its parent node in the same list binary search or dictionary lookup add it to the children collection of the parent node

2654760
width	height
the curvycorners.js is good choice to go with and as opposed to inline elements you can apply corners to block level elements only because they can have width and height

2654779
hash	salt
encrypt hash and salt passwords rather than storing them plain-text

2654779
ssl	https
use ssl https for login and any pages where sensitive data is entered

2654809
inherited	subclassing
the category would add to uiviewcontroller subclassing that import the category all the code necessary for presenting a modal ttmessagecontroller without requiring you to duplicate or use inherited

2654813
hide	show
the kicker is that it has to increase the colspan by one for each hide show

2654819
webrat	cucumber
define my own cucumber steps into which i use the webrat set_hidden_field method like this

2654833
apache	nginx
i now have nginx set up as reverse proxy to apache

2654833
apache	nginx
the static request that came in where directly delivered by nginx without having to go to apache

2654833
apache	nginx
now that i moved all the static content to another domain is there still a need to have nginx in front of apache

2654833
apache	nginx
are there any other benefits of having nginx and apache running for only dynamic content

2654845
execl	fork
you d have to fork a subprocess have the parent wait4pid on the child s pid while at the same time in the child calling execl on the file isthereanyapplesleft to make it run

2654846
integer	unsigned
c99 doesn t say much about this but you can check whether or you can use fixed size types like uint32_t 32 bits unsigned integer

2654860
width	height
each one was of size width height and each element corresponded to a pixel - i hope this makes sense

2654866
integer	unsigned
it defines types such as uint32_t for an unsigned integer of exactly 32-bits and uint_fast32_t for an unsigned integer of at least 32 bits and â œfastâ on the target machine by some definition of fast

2654946
ant	maven
here s a sample project ant and maven

2654960
memcpy	strcpy
as they are defined as const char i can not change them using strcpy memcpy .

2654961
put	get
i have put in the -g flags but when i try to find debugging symbols i get only

2654973
apache	nginx
nginx in front is the best solution in case you use apache 1.3 br

2654973
apache	nginx
nginx can easily serve thousands of conections but apache can t

2655023
apache	nginx
set up nginx as a reverse proxy in front of apache

2655043
nsstring	nsdata
forcing the nsdata to become nsstring

2655064
jtextfield	jlabel
for each of your elements jlabel jtextareas and jtextfield

2655095
width	height
and upon thinking about this some more why not iterate on the width height in nested loops and simplify things a bit

2655100
folder	directory
the web.config and any class files in app_code or compiled assemblies in the bin folder will not be able to be downloaded those directory are not mapped to virtual directory which people can download from

2655132
pull	push
i would like to have a mercurial repository on my website so that i can push pull as i make updates to it but i do not have ssh access only http or ftp

2655186
oncreate	ondestroy
and i assumed that ondestroy would always happen before a new instance of the activity was created so that the new instance in oncreate could load the state stored by the old instance

2655186
oncreate	ondestroy
one which was on its way to being destroyed onpause was called but was yet to enter onstop or ondestroy and one which was in oncreate

2655189
memcpy	strcpy
this may be beside the point but you can t change anything with neither strcpy nor memcpy

2655199
disk	ram
my machine is no slouch either core 2 duo 2 gb ram and plenty of disk space

2655209
put	get
but if i put it in the app code then the plugin doesn t magically figure out how to get at icandysettings even though i am using import in the plugin and export in candysettings

2655252
equals	gethashcode
but if you mean that you have should if you don t want a compiler warning or possibly unexpected behavior in your code to override gethashcode when you override equals then yes

2655285
button	checkbox
even if it the popup panel were something like a list of checkbox it could be databound to the sortedlist i have ready to go and an ok cancel button combination to accept or ignore things

2655335
int	double
this isn t the source of your crasher but the g format code is for double not int

2655358
getter	setter
instead i d have to change bar to have an explicit backing field and write explicit getter and setter

2655358
getter	setter
it s almost as bad as having to write explicit getter and setter for each property

2655359
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
when running the app from the filesystem firefox opera safari and google-chrome all behave as expected

2655375
floating-point	integer
the result of the computation is likely something like 5.999999999994 as the floating-point result is not necessarily exactly an integer

2655381
int	chars
the c specification doesn t put any assumptions on the size of an int except that it must be greater or equal to the size of a short which must be greater or equal to the size of a chars

2655389
children	parent
do to several constraints i want to disallow selecting items that are next to each other basically you can t select multiple items with the same parent and parent are handled differently from children

2655437
children	parent
children should be sent sighup when the parent process dies - however

2655445
vmware	virtualbox
i think you need to do a few things first decide if you are talking about an emulation or a virtual machine like a vmware or virtualbox

2655597
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m using prototype.js for my web app and i have everything running on google-chrome safari and firefox

where eventtype might be dom loaded keypress etc. and it works just fine in google-chrome safari firefox

2655618
min	max
you can loop through the lines in the csv and use bash script variables to hold your min max amounts

2655810
backtracking	greedy
so i tried this does two things 1 reduces backtracking because of the greedy match of all but a comma 2 allowed the regex optimizer to only use the alteration once on the first field

2655815
inherited	subclassing
setting your subclassing fetch mode to parallel affects table-per-class and vertical inherited hierarchies

2655815
inherited	subclassing
under parallel mode kodo issues separate selects for each subclassing in a table-per-class inherited hierarchy rather than unioning all subclassing tables together as in join mode

2655847
implements	modifiers
all operations in mongodb are atomic on a single document and we support nice update modifiers which make a lot of operations that would need a transaction easy to implements and fast

2655944
hide	show
i have a console form hybrid application in c# and at the moment i have to rely on user32.dll to show hide the console window

2656016
put	get
i m not aware of any central list of articles but if you just need a large number of them rather than a complete list bearing in mind that any complete list will always be out of date anyway then you could probably put something together with wget to recursively follow links within wikipedia from the main page and store the urls you get

2656017
hide	show
so then the user fills this textctrls out and clicks the button to create the item and i basically want only to show the name and description and hide the hiddendescription but to do it so i can use it later

2656026
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
closing a sqlconnection should destroy any resources that the sqldatareader is using

2656026
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
you don t need to dispose the sqlconnection if you dispose a sqldatareader that was created with commandbehavior.closeconnection

2656041
hide	show
and here is an example of show and hide jquery

2656045

iprincipal	iidentity
population of the iprincipal and iidentity for the current user

2656847
jstl	taglib
however that may not be the underlying cause since i had that same error when using jetty-maven-plugin and jstl taglib header in my jsp

2656847
jstl	taglib
and only javax.servlet jstl 1.2 is listed in my pom s dependencies since it now obsoletes taglib standard 1.1.2 which was a suggestion given above

2656888

2656916
width	height
here s an alternative way to swap the width and height

2656927
rundll32	shell32.dll
my first thought was to use rundll32 to call shell32.dll s shellexecute but it look like it needs parameters that i can t type from the commandline such as a reference to the parent window

2656943
for-loop	arrays
the levels are made up of an arrays of tiles and i use a for-loop to go through each one i know it may not be the best way to do it and i may need help with that too

2656963
rss	feed
im using drupal 6.x and created an rss feed of the recent images using the views module

2656963
rss	feed
i have a feeling an rss feed might not be the best way to go about this but it s all i could come up with

2656994
set	bag
i couldn t find out the source of this problem but the fix is to avoid using set and use bag or something else i only tested it with bag instead

2657002
for-loop	loops
you will notice that if you look at the function signature for for and apply they have one critical difference a for-loop evaluates an expression while an apply loops evaluates a function

2657022
twig	smarty
there are a pretty bunch of templating engines you could use there s smarty there s twig and a lot of others

2657022
codeigniter	cakephp
you could also use a full-featured framework like zend symfony cakephp codeigniter etc

ever since upgrading to visual studio 2010 i m running into an issue where the first web request of any type webrequest webclient etc. hangs for about 20 seconds before completing

2657129
put	get
the best way to get a handle on the .bindings file is to sort it which will put all the objects and their attributes together and make it more human-readable

2657148
stdout	stderr
syntax errors will output to stderr not stdout

2657178
ostringstream	std
i then realized that the c string i am getting from the function is destroyed when the function returns because std ostringstream is allocated on the stack

2657178
ostringstream	std
i later noticed that out of type std ostringstream was allocated with static storage

2657183
free	strdup
strdup allocates a copy of the string on the heap which you have to free manually later with free i think

2657189
128bit	64bit
in theory this should compile to just two move instructions because the vget_high and vget_low just reinterpret the 128bit q registers as two 64bit d registers

2657197
ostringstream	std
the static local variable std ostringstream out makes no sense in this case unless the std string being returned was also static which your observation is showing to be not true

2657236
boost	stl
one option you could use the boost serialization library has a capability of serializing stl vectors

2657242
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i tried the same code on safari firefox and opera they are worked correctly

2657268
interpreted-language	compiled-language
after reading some material on this subject i m still not sure what the difference between a compiled-language and an interpreted-language is

2657276
interpreted-language	compiled-language
another way of putting it is that interpreted-language are code is translated to machine instructions step-by-step while the program is being executed while compiled-language have code has been translated before program execution

2657313
next	except
using 5 ws where 1ws does not know about the others except the next one is a business requirement

2657328
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
for addition multiplication and subtraction there s a fairly good explanation including the carry bits in the calculation and then throwing them away is far easier than figuring out the carry bits if they were thrown away originally

2657371
lisp	scheme
like other lisp but not scheme emacs lisp has separate namespaces for variables and functions it is a â lisp 2 â not a â lisp 1 â

2657388
width	height
it will work as long as the width or height of the signature control is not greater than 256

2657422
google-chrome	firefox
everything is ok in firefox google-chrome and ie8

2657427

then when the user clicks on either technology or latest the sports will hide and the one clicked will show up and so on

2657484
slideup	slidedown
for something quick and simple you can use slidetoggle or slideup slidedown

2657518
gina	winlogon
in general i wouldn t advocate writing a replacement gina or credential provider in .net as you d inject a dependency on the .net framework into the winlogon process - one slip and you could end up with a machine that refuses to boot

2657525
int	double
int totalcombination int math.pow 2.0 double vowelcount

2657547
width	height
or try this version on the assumption that the first 4 bytes are used to store the width and height of the signature 2 byte short ints for each

2657560
getter	setter
obviously the appropriate setter getter init etc for the class

2657560
getter	setter
i don t want to set each nscell using setter and getter because then i m breaking the whole model concept by storing data in the nscell instead of referencing it from the array controller

2657571
free	malloc
it s good if you want to learn really low-level details like how the memory is managed but memory management is suddenly an important consideration as in correct usage of malloc free

2657571
haskell	ocaml	haskell	scheme	ocaml	scheme	lisp	scheme

width and height being image width height

2657670
hide	show
makes sure the text doesn t show up over the image yet doesn t hide it for seo screen reader purposes

2657697
google-chrome	firefox
works perfectly with google-chrome and firefox but not with ie

2657757
google-chrome	firefox
it is aligned in google-chrome and firefox but in ie7 it looks like this

2657769
width	height
set its height and width to the full height and width not restricted to the form size but related to the table size

2657793
pull	push
pull went smoothly but as soon as i tried to push back my changes tortoisegit needed my authentication key which was not configured

2657812
post	get
following this post which i posted some time ago i now get the same error every time i try to rewire 2 web s urls

2657839
interpreted-language	compiled-language
another approach is metaprogramming if an interpreter of a language is implemented in a form of a simple translator which targets another interpreted-language it is very easy to re-target it later to some compiled-language or replace the target interpreter with a compiler

2657870
width	height
it s better to use an existing one that it s under development and first try to use it as is make sure that it handles your code and generates what you want then learn how to adjust its width to match the container automatically adjust its height to its contents put the toolbar in an external div and you ll have what you want

2657899
folder	directory
most info i ve seen online suggests keeping all my project folder in a single place as in no separate directory for python or java with each project containing it s own git repository and simply having a snippets directory containing all single-file scripts experiments that can be converted into projects at a later date

2657912
vxworks	lynxos	vxworks	qnx	lynxos	qnx
the commercial solutions mentioned are for qnx vxworks and lynxos

2657912

2657927
modula-2	oberon	modula-2	algol
in wirth programming languages line algol - pascal - modula-2 - oberon - oberon-2 each subsequent language is simpler and at the same time more powerful than the previous one

2658053
innodb	myisam
then you can experiment with maybe making the info table innodb and the files table myisam

2658056
disk	ram
if the pdfs are on disk and not in ram your disk needs to be accessed

2658081
google-chrome	firefox
i can t click the last 3 links in the following code when i use firefox or google-chrome

set display width and height display height - menu height size to contentmanager

2658165
hide	show
show hide menumanager on menu button click

2658167
struts	stripes
the stripes framework is like struts but only better

2658193
struts	stripes
stripes like struts does not really do a lot for your app

2658194
post	get
pass this in as a get or post

2658216
struts	stripes
stripes is just a better struts which isnt much

2658237
put	get
you can put any ruby code into your .irbrc file which will get evaluated whenever you run irb

2658277
onbeforeunload	onload
so that if the users browser is ie then the variable alert onbeforeunload and if it is not ie for example firefox else then alert onload

2658288
put	get
but according to stroustrup the real reason why microsoft and sun decided to get rid off multiple inheritance is that they have vested interest to do so instead of putting features in the languages they put in frameworks so that people then become tied to their platform instead of people having the same capability at a language standard level

2658338
int	double
i also have an extra vector as the target value for each instance it is of double type for regression it is of int for classification

2658376
copying	overwrite
by the way moving all characters back to overwrite the old line is like copying each character in a different position and removing them from their old position

2658393
public	protected
if we define a property as public property and in this property we have a protected getter

2658393
public	protected
if property is public what does defining a protected getter for that means

2658397
public	protected
the protected before the getter so to say overwrites the public for the getter part of the property

2658403
inherited	properties
the protected get means that this properties s getter can only be accessed from a inherited class of this class

2658470
superclass	subclassing
the usual cause of this is declaring the adoption of the protocol in a superclass and then forgetting to implement in that superclass of a subsequent subclassing

2658486
switching	screens
and the below code is activated in all screens for orientation to control the user to switching from one orientation to other mode

2658486
switching	screens
so exactly what i want i want my appliaction to be in portrait mode for all screens i dont want my appliaction will switching to other mode.it remains the same as in portrait mode after rotation to any other mode

2658513
portrait	landscape
my application is completely navigation based and my query is that navigation based application can switch to any mode i mean orientation to portrait to landscape

2658536
getter	setter
in c# you are allowed to have getter and setter with access levels see access modifiers different than the overall property

2658542
width	height
width 50px but when the content of the div is changing dynamically i want to let the height adapt to the change

2658554
graphics2d	bufferedimage
every reference to graphics2d i can find is dealing with either games or writing directly to a file but i just want a bufferedimage returned

2658573
ncover	fxcop
i also got nunit ncover and fxcop running without too many problems

2658614
actionscript	mxml
i have this problem - everytime i deploy the app to the cloud i m having to hardcode the ip address of the server into the actionscript mxml files and for certain reasons i am forced to choose a different ip everytime

2658648
free	malloc
i know the problem is in malloc and free but can t find exactly where why and how to fix it

2658677
free	malloc
when you allocate space for n char and copy a string of length n into it i think that overwrites the metadata that malloc maintains at the end of the array and this bug shows up when you call free to deallocate the memory as free does not find that meta data

2658684
hide	show
hide show divs using javascript

2658716
valgrind	memcheck
valgrind in its memcheck mode will output memory access errors with a stack trace of where in the program they occurred

2658744
int	double
on systems where an int is 32 bits a double is usually 64 bits and so can exactly represent any int

2658758
minimum	max	min	max
for an interval a min a max of non-negative integers we can compute a bitwise minimum a 0 where bits are independently set to 0 whenever that is possible within the interval

2658758
min	max
for b min b max we do the same and get b 0 and b 1

2658758
min	max
it is easy to check for a bit which values it can take for an a from a min a max

2658758
min	max
for bit n if all bits m with m n agree in a min and a max then the value is forced otherwise it can be 0 or 1

2658758
min	max
edit unfortunately this is wrong consider the case where a min a max b min b max 1 2

2658762
getter	setter
with getter setter and a piece of code to map the record fields to them you can remove this but you ll add some complexity

2658769
integer	fractions
integer . fractions

2658769
integer	fractions
if one of them must save fractions information after all it should represent a number then it means that it has less bits for the integer part

2658769
integer	unsigned
to be more specific an int uses 32 bits to represent an integer number maximal unsigned integer of 4 294 967 296

2658769
integer	unsigned
a float uses 23 bits to do so maximal unsigned integer of 8 388 608

2658851
inherited	properties
it s in this constructor function that the actual creation of new jquery objects happens and in this case they are created using prototypal inherited which refers to a properties of the constructor called prototype when creating a new object giving that new object to the constructor as the this keyword

stdout	stderr
here s the relevant stackoverflow question call a mathematica program from the command line with command-line args stdin stdout and stderr

2659043
128bit	64bit
for example it would be reasonable for an implementation to make both long and long long 64bit and make intmax_t 128bit

2659053
teamcity	nant
you can shell out to msbuild from nant if desired and you can also execute nant scripts directly from teamcity

vmware	virtualbox
i want to send mouse clicks and keyboards keys to a window running a virtual machine such as vmware or virtualbox

2659108
vmware	virtualbox
but i think it s related to how vmware or virtualbox intercept keyboard events

2659154
width	height
your error is not that getvalues isn t inherited but that you try to access the inaccessible members width and height

2659172
uitapgesturerecognizer	uipangesturerecognizer
if you re developing for 3.2 or later uipangesturerecognizer and uitapgesturerecognizer are probably your friends

2659207
colt	jama
if you want to stay in pure java and work with a mathematics library you can also look into using colt which is adapted from jama although you could be better off just using jama directly

2659221
public	protected
for the classes that derive from cpoly if you want them to be able to use the members whether functions or variables then you must make them either public or protected

2659221
public	protected
if you specify protected all of the members inherited that are public or protected will be protected

2659234
opera	firefox
based on the info there i put this small bit of code together seems to stop the space bar and down up arrows from moving the scrollbar in both opera and firefox

2659241
httpresponse	request	httprequest	httpresponse
when a request is made and just prior to the httpapplication instance being created asp.net initializes core objects such as httpcontext httprequest and httpresponse which means they will exist when you get to the application_start event in global.asax

2659248

this works fine and i m able to get the minimum value the problem is when i put this code inside my class it doesn t seem to work

2659283
postgresql	mysql
in raw sql with a standard-conforming database engine postgresql sql server oracle db2 ... you can just use the sql-standard rank function -- but that s not supported in popular but non-standard engines such as mysql and sqlite and perhaps because of that django does not surface this functionality to the application

getattr	setattr
some other functions that have relatively complicated implementations more complicated than the underlying magic methods are likely to be are iter and cmp and all the attribute methods getattr setattr and delattr

2659640
int	double
things like int also access magic methods when doing coercion you can implement __int__ but do double duty as types

2659676

you ll have to check with spotify pandora last.fm themselves and see if they have any available intents to bind like that

2659704
int	chars
i know that a chars and an int are calculated as being 8 bytes on 32 bit architectures due to alignment but i recently came across a situation where a structure with 3 shorts was reported as being 6 bytes by the sizeof operator

cldc	midp
i am developing a j2me application cldc 1.1 and midp 2.0 and i was wondering

2659744
valgrind	memcheck
if you can run the software you wish to probe on linux or mac os i d suggest looking into valgrind specifically valgrind memcheck tool

2659747
subtract	add
i have to build some financial data report and for making the calculation there are a lot of if then situations if it s a large client subtract 10 if it s postal code equals 10101 add 10 if the day is on a saturday make a difficult calculation etc

2659753
int	chars
i don t know where you get the idea about chars or int being calculated as 8 bytes

2659753
int	chars
no every type is calculated in accordance with its size chars as 1 int as 4 on a 32-bit platform not 8 but 4

2659753
int	chars
for this reason when the structure contains the members of the same type the total size of that structure will normally be the exact sum of the sizes of its members a structure of 3 chars s will have size 3 and the structure of two int s will have size 8

2659753
int	chars
note chars counts as 1 int as 4 and the extra 3 padding bytes between them make it 8

2659784
firefox	safari
i imagine that safari is somehow updating its cached version of the page whereas firefox isn t

2659784
firefox	safari
in this case both safari and firefox work as expected

2659817
innodb	myisam
innodb resides in var lib mysql ibdata unless you ve used the innodb_per_table setting in which case it s stored much like for myisam tables

2659826
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this feature is called the bfcache and both firefox and safari have it as well as opera

2659940
g++	gcc
with either gcc or g++ just add -g to the command line

2659950
hide	show
a basic principle of oop is information hiding hide the implementation details and show only a description of the basic services to the caller

2659950
implements	extends
if the user of the interface does not need to extends any other class it can extends this abstract class otherwise it needs to implements all methods from the interface

2659979
implements	extends
in java you can only inherent extends from one class but you can implements more than one interface so sometimes you will have to use interfaces when you need that sort of multiple inheritance and when you decide not to use composition over inheritance

2659995
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the limit is in msie and safari about 2kb in opera about 4kb and in firefox about 8kb

2659995
post	get
if you need to send large data then better use post instead of get

2660033
outputstream	inputstream
yes a thread is needed or you wait block until the copy is finished for copying the inputstream to the outputstream

2660037
bash	zsh
the variation he mentions at the end are not portable across all shells though it is not in the posix standard for the shell language and simpler shells do not support it though ksh bash and zsh all do

2660056
google-chrome	firefox
now firefox google-chrome is good with this

2660065
int	double
i understand that c will promote the int to double type as variables xn and x0 are of type double but strangely enough in a book the second expression with casting was emphasized

2660136
firefox	safari
this works as expected in firefox 3.6.3 and safari 4 but does not work in multiple ie versions

2660211
tabcontrol	tabitem
i ve created customtabitem which inherits from tabitem and i d like to use it while binding observablecollection in tabcontrol

2660211
tabcontrol	tabitem
my class extends typical tabitem and i d like to use this class in tabcontrol instead of tabitem

2660271
emacs	aquamacs
you could then setup emacs aquamacs make the remote shell call

2660276
int	double
i need to process the elements of the vector differently according to their int double etc

2660286
tabcontrol	tabitem
you will need to create a custom class derived from tabcontrol and override getitemforcontaineroverride to return your custom tabitem

2660300
inherited	subclassing
if you re not adding any new attributes to the view controller you can implement the two methods in a category on uiviewcontroller and all the subclassing will inherited it by default

2660369
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

2660416
firefox	safari
firefox and safari were behaving differently because firefox needs no-store in the cache-control header directive - no-cache is not sufficient to disable caching for the page

2660447
google-chrome	safari
warning this is compatibility code for very old versions of safari and google-chrome

2660447
google-chrome	safari
this code is now only useful if for some reason you have a need to support safari 5 and older or google-chrome 6 and older

2660447
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this should only be done when safari or google-chrome is detected since other browsers don t support drag-and-drop onto elements and can be used in combination with the html5 drop event for firefox 3.6+

2660450
post	get
i ve even gone so far as to verify this by modifying code to look like runandignorethrow and i ll still get a crash post ui shutdown

2660476
integer	unsigned
when you add 2 to an enum the result is an int or unsigned int or possibly some other integer type if the enum contains really big values which isn t allowed to be assigned back to an enum without a cast

2660512
put	get
when i put this in an extension however the real prototype doesn t get modified

2660528
cvs	svn
git supports many topologies including the centralised cvs svn approach

2660562
postgresql	mysql
no database mysql postgresql oracle etc.

2660578
portrait	landscape
everything works fine in portrait mode but turning the device to landscape produces strange visual quirkiness

2660615
codeigniter	yii
i was surprised to see that codeigniter and yii pass referencs of objects and can be accessed via the following method

2660661
getter	setter
in fact i d argue for avoiding accessing instance variables directly in methods other than accessors getter and setter -dealloc and -init.

2660678
put	get
there is no standard way to get those brackets you have to put them through the code while iterating through your array and writing them to the file

2660771
width	height
and while on the subject but with just a slight deviation i d like to download just enough bytes to determine a jpeg s width and height information

2660798
post	get
i want users to be able to make http post requests to my xml-based api though and not get bombarded with this

2660856
free	memcpy
you don t need to memcpy or free the value you just need to keep track of the pointer

2660862
width	height
for example in ff c0 00 11 08 01 de 02 d0 01de represents a height of 478 and 02d0 represents a width of 720

2660914
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
running it through firefox google-chrome safari same thing happens on all

2660955
getter	setter
the best approach to this would be to only access the instance variables through getter setter methods and override those

2660966
qmouseevent	qwidget	qtableview	qmouseevent
since qtableview is a qwidget you could also re-implement mousedoubleclickevent qmouseevent e which would tell you which button was used

2660970
rss	feed
i think rss feed reader should be model in rails

2660970
rss	feed
very simple rss feed reader is described by travis on rails read comments you don t need to use open method

2661000
division	subtract	division	multiplication
do an integer division followed by a multiplication and subtract

2661017
kerberos	ntlm
you must use kerberos because ntlm does not allow for identity delegation since you are passing credentials from the user to the sharepoint server to the external system

2661065
treemap	treeset
googling around give me some hints about using treeset treemap

2661071
boost	allocator
you can use the boost interprocess library for some allocator which work inside shared memory

2661087
folder	directory
i m just trying to isolate the files in a directory but the -d operator keeps treating all the folder contents as files .

2661094
for-loop	loops
you can check the advanced bash scripting guide s section on loops for more examples of looping constructs besides the c-style for-loop you ve listed

2661101
int	chars
there is an incompatible types error because you are assigning arrays of strings type chars in c to arrays of pointers to int such as

2661101
int	chars
as chars are represented internally as numbers letters correspond to their ascii values c is able to convert chars to int so it attempts to treat variables x and y as arrays of pointers to chars instead of int hence the

2661124
inherited	properties
however it seems as if opacity is a properties that inherited from parent elements even if i explicitly set the opacity of the div to 1

2661142
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i m looking for a way to programatically control a browser on a mac firefox or safari or google-chrome -ium or opera but not ie using python

2661151
folder	directory
its generally good to create a virtual directory and point it to the actual physical location instead of putting all your files projects in wwwroot folder

2661155
mvp	presenter
in my opinion the correct way to do this would be to implement some sort of mvp structure in the application so that a presenter manages the view dialogbox es among other things and knows how to pass simple data to the view for it to display the presenter would handle the mapwidget data the view would take care of displaying it on the dom

2661216
integer	fractions
fixed point generally refers to a fixed number of bits for the integer part and a fixed number of bits for the fractions part

2661216
integer	fractions
by your description i m going to guess that you have 1 bit of integer and 23 bits of fractions

2661219
post	get
i currently can get it to post the data to a new php page but it seems to be the ajax function simply remains on the current page which is great for some things just not this not redirecting to the new page

2661223
min	max
i have set the min and max sizes as well and they don t seem to have any effect

2661282
ubuntu	debian
i am using the xecjk package in xetex 3.1415926-2.2-0.9995.2 tex live 2009 debian on ubuntu

2661330
superclass	subclassing
since method lookup is done a run-time the subclassing implementation will always be used even from a pointer of the superclass type

2661340
error-handling	exception-handling
the final ingredient is a static function track getstate which simply returns a list of all currently active scopes -- this can be called from an exception-handling handler or other error-handling mechanism

2661390
rss	feed
searching the google for new rss feed doesn t return anything that looks useful at least not on the first page

2661390
rss	feed
auto-discovery links can open a can of worms because of duplicate content being served using different protocols rdf rss and atom so you have to determine which to use or multiple feed with alternate content listed

2661398
cucumber	autotest
more about autospec autotest and cucumber

2661402
chi-squared	weibull
given a set of real numbers drawn from a unknown continuous univariate distribution let s say is is one of beta cauchy chi-squared exponential f gamma laplace log-normal normal pareto student s t uniform and weibull

2661407
client-side	server-side
your question is rather confusing--ajax calls are all client-side any server-side technology can return data to the client

2661415
gif	png
for example take an image jpg png gif compress it resize it and save as png

2661432
gif	png
i think the following routine will retrieve just the image heights for jpg gif and png or return an false condition on a 404 or other image type

2661432
gif	png
unfortunately jpeg pushes its height value pretty far out in a file unlike gif or png and so i had to read the file that far out in bytes

2661432
gif	png
then with those bytes it scans for jfif png or gif in that header to let us know which file type it is

2661432
width	height
on whatever random image i find i set width in the img tag of the html and it automatically resizes the height -- but looks good only if the image is under a certain height

2661442
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome seem to be adding extra padding margins in regards to the text within the boxes at one of the pages within my website

2661446
post	get
i m using the post redirect get pattern on a form of mine

2661448
ubuntu	linux
in the makefile.in of an existing c++ project on linux ubuntu it has this

2661466
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari add an opening tag

2661498
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested on google-chrome but should work on firefox and safari too

2661500
serializable	deserialization
if you have small volume of input output data a webrequest would be better and probably faster but if you need to pass complex objects a web service will be suitable because it will handle the serializable deserialization of these objects you won t need to parse them in your code

2661555
udp	tcp
you could make a socket connection tcp udp to a port number on a remote host

2661611
multiplying	add
but it only takes one multiplying and an add

2661628
division	multiplication
it requires only 8x8 multiplication and a final division by 255 which can be approximated by simply taking the high byte of the sum

2661668
post	get
you can write a cli script in almost any language that supports making get post requests php python bash with curl java... and perform the same call as submitting form will do.

2661671
put	get
also to make things even more entertaining after completing this report you can put it in another parent report then you will get the same report for multiple customers

2661701
children	parent
no deleting parent will delete children if you have cascading turned on

2661724
cpu	hyperthreading
7 does recognize ht hyperthreading and doesn t schedule multiple tasks to the one cpu core that is probably the only benefit 7 has over xp

2661731
hash	md5
but you could also use md5 or sha1 to make a hash value of the actual image

2661744
organization	naming
subsequent components of the package name vary according to an organization s own internal naming conventions

2661752
put	get	post	put	post	get
your webdav handler will need to process the requests and dispatch the appropriate method handlers to handle the various http methods get post put delete move copy etc.

2661758
division	multiplication
the integer division by a constant is done using integer multiplication by a related constant

2661794
spaces	delimiter
it takes your input search and replace splits them into arrays of strings delimiter by spaces generates a regexp that finds the input sentence with any number of whitespace html tags and replaces it with the replacement sentence with the same tags replaced between the words

2661809
google-chrome	firefox
i have a problem whit cross browser output i m trying to get the top and left css attribute of a div but firefox gives me the exact pixel position and google-chrome give me the percentage

2661830
put	get
marshalling an interface from one thread to another can be done by using comarshalinterthreadinterfaceinstream to put the interface into a stream move the stream to the other thread and then use cogetinterfaceandreleasestream to get the interface back from the stream

2661832
post	put
that is to put a list of threads as a property on your post class and put a list of post as a property on your threads class

2661843
multiplying	division
in this very cas you should multiplying all your values for 1000 and do a division at the end of the calculation or better resort to precise calculation extension

2661869
button	checkbox
getting the list of inputs is slightly harder since we don t want to include checkbox radio button etc

2661872
int	chars
the second part of the puzzle is that chars values are always promoted to int or rarely unsigned int when passed as part of a function s variable-length argument list

2661873
int	chars
chars alone is interpreted as an int

2661875
int	chars
chars the kind of thing that a 1 evaluates to are int but the s formatter for printf expects a pointer

2661878
int	chars
the expression yields a single chars and in expressions that is widened to an int

2661913
int	chars
for example __declspec dllexport int my_function chars

2661913
int	chars
first option __declspec dllimport int my_function chars

2661950
post	get
that being said i cannot from your post determine how exactly you get your search results returned

2661963
super	implements
it appears to me that there are no or very few open source framework that implements the super class idea instead they use the autoload feature of php

2661963
codeigniter	kohana
the kohana 2 series is a php-5 only codeigniter rewrite plus improvement

2661967
gitolite	gitosis
i guess that one can configure gitosis or gitolite to do similar check or you can write your own upate or pre-receive hook

2662019
client-side	server-side
the reason you do not have svnadmin is that it is a server-side program not a client-side program

2662022
int	chars
use atoi to convert the chars data to int

2662030
int	chars
note that this reads the data into int timestamp low medium and high are int s a string version looks like this timestamp low medium and high are chars arrays

2662050
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it is supported by the nightly builds of firefox safari google-chrome and opera

2662060
width	height
you could also try using this method which creates a bitmap from the object and returns the bitmap s height width

2662061
submit	submission
once the user enters the details and clicks submit show a confirmation page preview of how the submission will be listed

2662076
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome 4.1.249.1045 safari 532.5 is not officially supported by

2662078
postgresql	mysql
the dump would take the form of insert statements like the one you can get with mysql or postgresql or xml like the one created by ddlutils

2662087
width	height
if you match the height width style attributes on the inner ouer divs the inner comes before the and you give the inner a higher z-index than the image it ll perfectly overlap the image

2662095
google-chrome	safari
the gwt part of apps runs absolutely fine on webkit browsers like google-chrome and safari

2662112
dlsym	dlopen
posix use dlopen and dlsym

2662128
mouseup	mousedown
for this i need to be able to send mousedown and mouseup commands to the window of my application

2662207
directx	gdi
wpf uses directx and hence the gpu instead of winforms which uses gdi for everything

2662216
pop-up	dialog
the click on a day view changes to agendaday then on a time of the day and a dialog pop-up opens with a form

2662219
min	max
i m generating a random number between min and max with this code

2662231
lwjgl	jogl
jme3 can use either lwjgl or jogl for rendering

2662244
min	max
to generate a random integer between min and max try this

2662244
min	max
to generate a random decimal floating-pt number between min and max try this

2662270
webkit	gecko
otherwise don t - if you re lucky your html might render identically in ie8 and the current gecko webkit browsers

2662299
datediff	difference
generate the month difference as a divisor datediff uses end of month as the month boundary

2662309
udp	tcp
so you need to build something onto either udp or tcp to give you that

2662341
int	boolean
sourcedragmask is what s called a bitmask an int that represents a a number of boolean flags

2662345
google-chrome	firefox
you should be ok if the page works in the other browsers firefox google-chrome opera...

2662351
implements	extends
all of this is easily implements with wrappers if you don t want to extends the prototype

2662356
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome safari and firefox you can use html5 history.pushstate and history.replacestate methods

2662383
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
by testing on the latest safari with webkit nightly google-chrome and firefox you ll find that it really doesn t matter which kind of the loop you re choosing if it s not for each or for in or even worse any derived functions built upon them

2662417
free	malloc
another solution would be to use malloc and free but that gives a level of indirection that i do not want

2662422
mouse	keyboard
this might confuse some users if they use the mouse to click instead of the arrows enter on the keyboard

2662431
rss	feed
when you are filling your model with rss feed data instead of model.create ... use

2662431
rss	feed
there is no chance to get some event when rss is updated without downloading whole rss feed again

2662439
folder	directory
...as your wsgi file is in a directory called apache under your project folder

2662468
free	malloc
you can have a look at the way it s done with the stl containers but i doubt you can spare yourself malloc s and free s

2662487
decoder	encoder
i m trying to code a simple base64 encoder decoder to test my programming skill

2662495
button	checkbox
this document provides some examples of how to manipulate checkbox combo boxes and radio button

2662495
filtering	grouping
using the construct of groupname.fieldname appears to be useful to manipulate the widgets as a grouping in acrobat javascript but the fields of a grouping cannot be enumerated without enumerating all fields and filtering for the groupname and the collective value of that grouping cannot be determined without programatically inspecting the values

2662507
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
so a firefox opera google-chrome webkit user doesn t have to download all those additional hacks that make the web app work on ie

2662520
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
basically i am using uinavigationcontroller and then push uitableviewcontroller or sometime a uiviewcontroller

2662522
fgets	fread
i would consider reading a bigger buffer with fread fgets and parse the resulting string instead of reading character by character

2662567
iprincipal	iidentity
i d suggest creating a custom iprincipal and iidentity classes which also can interact with your membership provider and set those on the thread

2662595
lxml	beautifulsoup
in my case links can be outside of a tags and be not well formed in many ways like n in the middle of link so i try to grab as much links as i can and check them later in other scripts so no beautifulsoup lxml etc

2662625
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql and sql server 2008 all have geo-spatial features either natively or via extensions which include spatial indexing and implementations of the haversine formula

2662660
free	malloc
the memory returned by getenv is not allocated by malloc and should therefore not be free by free

2662660
free	malloc
in general none of the c standard library functions that are not part of the malloc family should be free using free or in fact free at all

2662686
allocator	stl
also stl s vector allocator and deallocations are abstracted away through the use of allocator the second template argument of vector

2662710
int	chars
the int thing was a typo on my part i really meant it to be chars

2662737
pop-up	dialog
just use jquery ui dialog make it a modal pop-up and put your uploading buttons etc on the pop-up and it should just work fine

2662739
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
so i created a subclass of uiviewcontroller put an instance of it inside mainwindow.xib and connected it s view outlet to the uiwindow declared as window inside the app delegate

2662739
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
edit i think it might be related to me attaching the uiviewcontroller s view outlet to an uiwindow instance

2662769
spaces	delimiter
i have a file delimiter by spaces

2662782
width	height
now the problem is that i can t get it to scale properly in width but height is perfectly fine

2662782
width	height
you see how the chart fills the 400px of height but not the width

2662799
onclick	onsubmit
though when one gets unexpected form submit or unexpected following links in this way unexpected because your form s onsubmit or your a s onclick has a return false

2662819
versioning	upgrade
ps - when i say upgrade i mean full install of the new versioning with full format of the hdd

2662832
put	get
you should put the awk scripts inside single quotes and use variable passing to get the shell variables into the awk script

2662861
getter	setter
if you have processing in your getter setter this method would quickly become bloated

2662863
dependency-injection	singleton
have in mind that an object can be de-facto singleton but still be obtained via dependency-injection rather than via singleton.getinstance

2662906
google-chrome	firefox
and now the code works in both firefox and webkit based browsers like google-chrome

2662908
range	minimum
scale-value calls range and minimum for each call

2662909
min	max
use min max to clamp the bounds of the matrix

2662909
for-loop	loops
use a for-loop to loops over all neighbors

2662974
hide	show
the code above show how i hide and show the scrollbox

2662986
uiview	uiwindow	uiview	subviews
uiwindow is a uiview so you can do something like this to get the subviews of it

2663049
children	parent
with that in mind you could use parent relationships as adam suggests and keep an incomplete count on each node which counts the number of immediate children that aren t yet complete

2663054
int	chars
so an assignment like the tries putting a pointer into a chars -sized int

2663115
next	except
and each node points to the next node except for the last node which has null for next

2663120
versioning	upgrade
when .6 came out i upgrade cassandra and thrift which threw errors in my code www dot copypastecode dot com 26760 - i was able to iron out the errors by converting the necessary types however in the versioning that compiles now only seems to read one item back im not sure if its not saving db changes or if its only reading back 1 entry

2663129
gtk	cairo
or maybe your best bet is to move to an alternate imaging library that doesn t use video memory there are a quite a few open source ones freeimage imagemagick cairo though you will have to at least get the gtk packages from mono for it to run

2663181
hash	md5
assuming you re not doing anything important like deleting an md5 or similar hash function should be plenty

2663220
ati	nvidia
the length of the returned string is empty on nvidia and ati cards but on intel cards this one returns the string no errors.

2663247
udp	tcp
i m trying to write a syslog listener and so far so good on getting it to accept incoming messages through tcp but i also want udp to function

2663258
hide	show
you can hook the focus and blur events of the control and use them to show and hide the elements you want to show and hide

2663356
public	protected
class trackersinglemarkerimpl public trackersinglemarker protected trackerimpl __pattern_size_x __pattern_size_y __pattern_sample_num __max_load_patterns __max_image_patterns

2663375
google-chrome	firefox
i tried firefox google-chrome and internet explorer

2663431
onfocus	onblur
i tried onfocus and onblur it didnt work out

2663465
mouse	keyboard
we can intercept mouse and keyboard events on both os x windows linux we can write a component that not only looks but also behaves identically on all three platforms

2663465
mouse	keyboard
working identically on all platforms where java can give you notifications about mouse and keyboard events.

2663471
png	tga
you should also use a file format which supports an alpha channel png tga ...

2663637
mp3	wmv
i m currently letting vlc stream a wmv file while it converts the file live to h264 with mp3 audio

2663746
uiview	uiwindow
uiwindow inherits from uiview so although i don t have much personal experience with this exact thing you should still be able to get it to draw to a bitmap context of some kind and then use two different uiwindows each with only an image view on a them pushing the actual pixels to their respective screens

2663746
super	implements
this is considerably easier if you only want to mirror one specific custom view and not including it s subviews because you can have that view on the device screen to capture any input and then design it in a way that you have a method to call to draw it in whatever context it s in some drawrects might work fine as is and the call that from a super special awesome custom subview on the other screen which would implements drawrect to just call the method on the actual view

2663753
savefiledialog	folderbrowserdialog
savefiledialog for a file or folderbrowserdialog for a folder

2663756
savefiledialog	openfiledialog	savefiledialog	folderbrowserdialog	folderbrowserdialog	openfiledialog
there are 3 controls folderbrowserdialog openfiledialog and savefiledialog

2663804
put	get
the problem is i always get my alert message displayed the saved value is not put into the label so somehow 0 is always true

2663809
calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	malloc
this usually would require three separate allocations malloc calloc strdup... and consequently free separate releases free

2663810
.htaccess	httpd.conf
php directives can be set in apache s httpd.conf and .htaccess files and you d end up with differences even though the main php.ini files are identical

2663839
profiling	benchmarking
we recently switched some maths types vec3 vec4 matrices etc. over to use structs instead of classes and as well as being slightly quicker in benchmarking it also reduced the gc pressure we had hundreds of megabytes of vec3 allocations over a relatively short period of time discovered via the clr profiling

2663856
post	get
if you need to pass that much data use post not get

2663899
daemons	systemd
qt s signal slot systemd is very easy to use and ideal for a network daemons service boost also includes a signal slot systemd but it is harder to use and does not include an event loop

2663901
ienumerable	iqueryable
understand the difference between iqueryable and ienumerable

2663943
client-side	server-side
fundamentally sure javascript is a very powerful language and so you can do development in it server-side just like you can client-side and if you do client-side scripting as well you get some definite reuse benefits using javascript on the server

2663979
range	max
the first point in the range is when an alert will be sent to the user the second point is a max limit

2664008
octal	decimal
integer literals starting with a 0 are interpreted as octal not decimal in the same way that integer literals starting with 0x are interpreted as hexadecimal

2664009
octal	decimal
prefixing an integer with 0 makes it an octal number instead of decimal and 010100 in octal is 4160 in decimal

2664020
mouseup	mousedown
my first instinct would be to create a subclass of nstextfield and override some or all of mousedown mousedragged and mouseup to create the dragging behavior you want

2664055
background-color	font-size
the two ways have differences for example the ie element.currentstyle property expect that you access the ccs property names composed of two or more words in camelcase maxheight fontsize backgroundcolor etc the standard way expects the properties with the words separated with dashes max-height font-size background-color etc

2664064
octal	decimal	octal	binary
you may find these macros helpful to represent binary numbers with decimal or octal numbers in the form of 1 s and 0 s

2664117
hash	md5
on authentication you calc md5 of password typed by user and checking equality with your stored md5 password hash for this user

2664154
hash	salt
for example use a hash of the user s ip address and a salt provides extra security against someone stealing or sniffing the user s security cookie

2664197
hash	salt
store encrypted salt hash

2664225
g++	gcc
although it s been said that the support for c++0x new features in g++ are in experimental mode many gcc developer claimed that you can use most of the new features in your codes and get the program to work

2664301
division	modulo
i don t really understand how modulo division works

2664304
division	modulo
the result of a modulo division is the remainder of an integer division of the given numbers

2664308
division	modulo
modulo division is simply this divide two numbers and return the remainder only

2664331
division	modulo
modulo division gives you the remainder of a division rather than the quotient

2664335
addition	multiplication
for instance you could treat the data as base 2 16 for multiplication but base 2 32 for addition

2664361
strstr	strtok
alternatively you can take a look at strtok and strstr

2664379
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox i get 15 bars

2664383
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
works fine in firefox and opera for mac but in google-chrome and safari the third level sticks or hangs as a watermark after you move the cursor away

2664391
mouse	keyboard
i want to catch any keyboard or mouse events which were designed with other applications

2664402
mouse	keyboard
you probably want to use the keyboard hook and the mouse hook to watch for mouse events

2664409
textview	imageview
something similar for your imageview which presently looks like it is going to overlap the second textview

2664435
folder	directory
assuming you have created it in your app s documents folder app sandboxes for the simulator are in and contain the application and it s documents library and tmp directory

2664441

this works fine on testing servers but not the production server which is running the same thing centos and apache works on ubuntu though

2664445
pow	sqrt
i am trying to implement my own version of pow and sqrt function as my custom library doesn t have pow sqrt floating point support

2664457
pow	sqrt
fdlibm the freely distributable math library has sqrt and pow along with many other math functions

2664464
client-side	server-side
it sounds like that you re using client-side includes with help of html or element instead of server-side includes with help of

2664464
client-side	server-side
so to solve your particular problem just use server-side includes instead of client-side includes

2664468
superclass	subclassing
i want to utilize polymorphism on these subclassing by declaring pure virtual functions in the superclass then have the children implement those functions

2664482
cos	inverse
arccos is the inverse function of cos not the multiplicative inverse

2664490
xna	slimdx
so long as you stick with managed directx or slimdx and not one of the newer frameworks like xna then the api translates fairly directly from managed to unmanaged

2664501
post	get
i can post code here if needed but im not sure if that is necessary or possible as you may need to see all of the source code to get the right idea

2664504
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this is the case for all of the following browsers ie7 safari 4 firefox 3.5 google-chrome 4.1 opera 10.51

2664522
cos	inverse
since the cos of an angle is always between -1 and +1 there is no way to compute the inverse function acos of a value outside that range or it means you passed nan to the acos function

2664535
super	implements
personally i would implements the protocol on the super class but implements the methods like this

2664588
codeigniter	cakephp
i have been developing in php since 2000 and still have a bunch of php systems in production using both codeigniter and cakephp

2664622

i believe you just need to set the width and height of your canvas when you create it in the html

2664663
width	height
space width and height

2664670
accessor	properties
you should use the bracket notation properties accessor

2664706
portrait	landscape
for instance if in the onopen event you changed from portrait to landscape orientation you won t have an accurate count of how many pages there are in the report because the report hasn t been formated at the time the onopen event fires

in google-chrome and safari this produces a cryptic error

2665246
folder	directory
any suggestions e.g adding some rules to open_base_dir and getting php to recursively copy the folder to the other domain remember it s on the same dedicated box so it just needs to traverse the directory not ftp things

2665247
public	protected
yet you may still use the private protected and public functions within the controller for additional logic

2665289
folder	directory
for instance whenever developers create a changerequest which can encompass change in 3-40 files i have to create a directory structure distributed across 32 folder

2665299
mouse	keyboard
if your application is a true win32 service then on vista and beyond the application won t receive keyboard or mouse events - to close a security hole search for shatter attack microsoft isolated all services to prevent them from interacting with the user

2665697
inherited	properties
simple question regarding properties value inherited in usercontrols

2665719
xna	slimdx
if you can do stuff with slimdx or xna then you should be able to transfer your skills over to unmanaged directx pretty easily

2665734
inherited	properties
these properties can be defined to inherited their value from the ancenstor

2665734
inherited	properties
you have to look in the documentation for each properties if it is inherited or not

2665734
inherited	properties
the borderbrush borderthickness and background properties are not inherited wouldn t make sense most of the time

2665734
inherited	properties
an example for an inherited properties is the datacontext properties since it makes sense for child elements to have the same data context as their parent

2665828
folder	directory
i have a folder i set as the current directory from within visual studios which includes pngs ogg config.json etc

2665832

2665835
min	max
is there a way to use for-loop to assign min max coordinate to each cell

2665857

post	get
i m using jqgrid for a table input and setting up the url as a servlet which will deal with the get and post requests and save the rows to a java object

2666124
bazaar	svn
you could try bazaar bazaar as it supports workflows but i don t know if it is really faster or wait for svn 1.7 with wc-ng and centralized meta-data

2666237
min	max
just decide what you should do with max and min values

2666249
entity-relationship	diagram
i d like to improve my understanding of cardinality constraints in entity-relationship diagram

2666346

- you can use this application as a base to build wpf applications in which it is easy to add pages usercontrols and switch from one to another with three kinds of animations slide flip and cube

2666357
calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	malloc
the correct method for returning strings in c is allocating them on the heap with malloc or calloc and return this pointer to the caller which will have the responsibility to free it when it won t be needed anymore

2666376
google-chrome	safari
previously an iframe was used however this is not able to work across all browsers as it touched on third-party cookies which are hard to implement and impossible in safari and google-chrome

2666391
antivirus	mcafee
it was because of mcafee antivirus

2666416
try-catch	exception-handling
this method uses a try-catch block that catches exception-handling objects but exception-handling is not thrown within the try block and runtimeexception is not explicitly caught

2666420
folder	directory
alternatively you might not have changed the value for the string hello - to do that go to values folder in the project directory then edit strings.xml

2666487
google-chrome	firefox
i can t seem to make it work on firefox 3.6 google-chrome 5 tho and this is when i started searching for the reference on w3c

edit think about it again the obvious solution would be to convert your binary number into an integer or hex and store that

2666526
sdl	devil
apart from the other answers mentioning sdl and devil there are two more options to consider

2666550

i ve tried adding my view to the top uiwindow in the uiapplication sharedapplication windows array and while this does place it above the uikeyboard if it s visible it doesn t place it over the statusbar which makes sense

2666809
post	get
as a kernel module you completely override the linux routing mechanism and as a userland binary you simply get a duplicate as you mention in your post of each packet from the interface

2666809
packets	pcap
packets can be directed through the click graph by way of pcap filters and a variety of other mechanisms

2666845
inherited	properties
your best option in my opinion is either using a uniform interface and extend it or extend the prototypes from which your objects inherited then you can use instanceof before going forward with the method call or use the somewhat cumbersome operator in order to avoid the access of nonexistent properties methods

2666860
int	chars
in the first example an int is large enough to hold the result of multiplying chars s so there is no overflow

2666875
getter	setter
and at the end of a class i have a getter and setter for it

2666875
put	get
i m building the project with maven and i put file in src main resources this is the error i get when trying to read file

2666879

webrat	cucumber	rspec	capybara
works with webrat | capybara cucumber | rspec etc

2666946
int	chars
so for a system with signed chars s the two last lines are in effect which means that when you write char_max in your code the compiler sees a plain 127 which has type int

2666950
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the site is working correctly in safari google-chrome and firefox mac and win but in internet explorer i get an error related with mootools line 59 character 102

2666984
range	max	range	min	min	max
given that the values are 32 bit depending on the range of min and max modulo max-min+1 may be good enough though there is a small bias if this interval is not a power of two

2666984
min	max
say you have min 1 and max 5

2667025
post	get
post me a sample standard .dat file if u have one and i ll try and get back to you as to how to parse it in matlab.

width	height
i would like to obtain a new bitmapdata with width and height of the object represented by non-black pixels

2667157
width	height
for example let say i have a bitmapdata 400x400px but the object represented by non-black pixels occupies the rect x 100 y 100 width 200 height 200

2667157
width	height
of course i have no coordinates for that rectangle i need somehow to make difference between a full black bitmapdata and the original one and construct a new bitmapdata different width and height

2667199
put	get
here its my app.config if i try to get the key values from the appsettins sections i always get null but if i try to get them from applicationsection its no problem the thing is that i need put that applicationsection on a web site but on a web site i can put applicationsettings

2667204

what you are trying to implement is actually a well known pattern used in web-developing called the post redirect get pattern

2667205
hide	show
if over - show else - hide

2667297
put	get
i saw some people put all modules in one view stack and so the application interface is only load once but when the application get larger the whole compiled swf would be very big

i d use a general purpose scripting language perl tcl etc

2667675
unsigned	short
i know the size field would be an unsigned short type but what about the other two fields

2667694

2672440
range	minimum
if you do end up using a function call to get valid range recommended to keep clutter to a minimum and organization higher i d add an overload

2672489
hide	show
not everyone thinks that has value but i m a firm believer that it s the job of source control to show us not what we wished had happened but what actually happened -- every deadend and every refactor should leave an indelible trace and rebasing and other history editing techniques hide that

2672501
public	protected
so you can make a base class s protected members public or private

2672501
public	protected
or a base s public members protected or private

2672501
public	protected
you cannot however make a base s private members public or protected

2672513
uiview	subviews
anyway if your class is a subclass of uiview and is a subviews of the viewcontroller you can get the viewcontroller s view by accessing the superview property to get your parent view

2672698
integer	unsigned
so i found some similarities between arrays and set notation while learning about sets and sequences in precalc set notation a | cond a1 a2 a3 a4 ... an given that n is the domain or index of the array a subset of natural numbers or unsigned integer

2672734
integer	unsigned
if that is the case since the sequence number is an unsigned 32-bit integer then what happens after more than ffffffff 4294967295 bytes are transferred

2672737
qtcpsocket	qtcpserver	qtcpsocket	qudpsocket	qtcpserver	qudpsocket
in particular see the qtnetwork module - a few of its relevant classes for your cause qtcpsocket qtcpserver qudpsocket

2672785
put	get
i m new to jquery but for some reason i cant get the php code to display correctly when i put it in my jquery script

2672796
hex	binary
the simplest approach especially if you already can convert from binary digits to internal numeric representation and from internal numeric representation to hexadecimal digits is to go binary- internal- hex

2672796
hex	binary
this does not apply to your specific example but in many cases when converting from binary to hex you can go four digits at a time and simply lookup the corresponding hex values in a table

2672807
hex	binary
you could simply have a small hash table or other mapping converting each quadruplet of binary digits as a string assuming that s your input into the corresponding hex digit 0 to 9 a to f for the output string

2672807
hex	binary
each bunch of 4 binary digits via a hash or other form of hashing turns into the hex digit to put in that place in the output string

2672835
button	checkbox
button checkbox radio reset or

2672839
hex	binary
binary and hex are natively compatible

2672853
haskell	ocaml
whether you re in a hybrid functional oo language like f# or ocaml or in a purely functional language like haskell where side-effects are relegated to the io monad it s mostly the case that a ton of the work required to manage a gui is much more like a side effect than like a purely functional algorithm

2672896
actualheight	actualwidth
by hooking into the loaded event of each and checking actualwidth actualheight you can get the dimensions

2672933
hash	md5
the result is always the same because an md5 hash has always the same length

2673118
inherited	properties
you can request the scrollbox to recalculate its scrollbar properties by calling the realign method it inherited from twincontrol

2673141
inherited	properties
it is important to use the hasownproperty method to determine whether the object has the specified properties as a direct properties and not inherited from the object s prototype chain

2673241
portrait	landscape
even in landscape mode it should be like portrait mode

2673268
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you could also use something similar to below in the viewdidload viewwillappear methods

2673282
post	get
while trying to send a post request via xmlhttp.open post url true javascript to the server i get an empty

2673304
hide	show
do i need to create all screen at startup and then show hide them depending on what is clicked

2673307
linfu	spring.net
castle can be used amongst others you have the choice you can also use linfu spring.net ... to create dynamic proxies of your entities

2673307
inherited	properties
this behaviour is the reason why nhibernate wants you to create every properties as virtual by default nhibernate will create a new class using this castle or linfu ... proxy provider which inherited from your entity and it will override all the properties so that it can inject the code that is necessary to retrieve the necessary data from the db

2673351
libsvm	liblinear
have a look at liblinear and for non linear svm s at libsvm

2673363
spaces	delimiter
i need to visualize a text into a delimiter spaces

2673513
subscript	superscript
i d like to convert mâ² to m2 but in a generic way that does this for all superscript or subscript not just a simple replace statement

2673535
int	double
fundementally the primitive types supported are double int bool and string

2673554
ant	maven
i build the project using the maven goal war exploded and then i copy that directory to jboss with an ant script

2673568
subscript	superscript
in unicode you can only have certain characters as superscript or subscript

2673568
subscript	superscript
if you are trying to convert formatted text that could contain all kinds of characters as superscript or subscript that means they are not directly represented as unicode and it would depend a lot on the format of the text

2673600
width	height
i have some problems when i try to bind the height and width of a window to properties in my view model

2673600
width	height
when the program is started the getters of windowheight and windowborderthickness but not windowwidth are called so the height and the border of the window is set properly but not the width

2673623
cassini	iis
works fine with local iis cassini but not on our test iis servers

2673625
rss	feed
you can make sure you get all future tweets by subscribing to your twitter rss feed with google reader

2673632
dns	spf
to reduce the chances of being marked as spam because your mail comes from an address that doesn t tie up with the dns records mx or fallback a for a domain add an spf record to the dns for all the domains saying that mail from the sending ip address is fine

2673685
ssl	https
for only login purpose i want to use ssl https and so instead of using gwt-rpc i am trying request builder and calling a servlet with https

2673724
subclass	abstract-class
when you think of an abstract-class it is usually something you need to subclass in order to use

2673786
put	get
i got one in my page that is working fine but i have put another one in the same page and i can t get it to work

2673826
ceil	floor
use round or ceil or floor functions otherwise declare the type before like int

2673862
serializable	deserialization
if you are thinking of serializable deserialization from into objects jdo is the perfect way to go

2673890
glibc	strace
this is the strace output 0x200 is epollrdhup that is not defined yet in my glibc headers but defined in the kernel

2673891
put	get
i know it s pretty funky but i d figure i put it here to get feedbacks

2673946
udp	tcp
that being said qt4 does include a network module which supports udp and tcp the basis for communicating over the internet

2673951
peer	p2p
the other problem with creating p2p software is that developing it on your own you will have very few peer to test with even if you do create a bunch of virtual computers

2673969
inherited	properties
aside from the fact animating is useless before appending first in some browsers backgroundcolor properties isn t inherited from the css class until it s attached to dom

2673976
implements	extends
i have implements a custom field by extends the manager class

2673980
draggable	droppable
i have some drag and drop functionality on my website i am wanting to hightlight the area that is droppable with a chage in border color when the draggable element is clicked starting to be dragged

2674023
folder	directory
maybe you added a folder in your solution directory and moved the wanted file there

2674030
client-side	server-side
then you shouldn t be doing it in server-side but in client-side

2674032
hide	show
the problem i have is that the script uses string values in an array whereas i probably want to create the different hidden divs and show hide depending on the element clicked

2674032
hide	show
so you can see atm the script changed the content of item-title based on the key of the titles array what i would also like to do is show aquapanel when aqua is in focus and obviously hide all of the other elements there are more than 1 in the real example.

2674067
onclick	onchange
onclick is really the wrong event to be using here it should be onchange

2674067
onclick	onchange
however you will typically see onclick used instead because there s a bug in ie where it doesn t fire onchange until you unfocus the checkbox

2674141
opera	firefox
for example i load some page into opera firefox etc. there is a text on the page which is a link

2674185
google-chrome	firefox
edit tested on firefox google-chrome ie6 ie7 and ie8

2674204
rss	feed
hope this link helps you.this explains to display the activity indicator for parsing action of the rss feed

2674271
put	get
but once i put the actual tree root in the task_struct or even in the i get a segfault

2674299
uipangesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer
there is the uigesturerecognizer base class and there is a concrete uipangesturerecognizer don t know how useful they are but i would try them if i had more time

2674309
mouseover	mouseenter
the mouseover event is triggered when the mouseenter an element

2674320
button	checkbox
user will check one or many checkbox and click on delete button which is actually submit button then the respective records for selected checkbox are get deleted

2674320
button	checkbox
when user selects one or more checkbox and clicks the submit button then a jquery code is get executed in which

2674320
button	checkbox
if user pressed the no button then it should unchecks the checked selected checkbox and should not submit the form

2674324
width	height
the c# code i use which returns a rectanglef because i want to know both the width and the height is as follows

2674328
serializable	deserialization
and what is more wcf has built in serializable deserialization

2674391
rss	feed
i m currently using regular expressions to search through rss feed to find if certain words and phrases are mentioned and would then like to extract the text on either side of the match as well

2674409
ivar	subclassing
unless you explicitly add an ivar and property to your button by subclassing uibutton and assign the view controller to it it and any other view has no access to its or any of its superviews view controller

2674454
put	get
back to your question to get a you can either put it in a literal string surrounded by single quotes like so echo my string note though that variables are not substituted in literal strings

2674471
sorting	filtering
is there a way to pass these filtering values to the server-side actionresult griddata based on the selected date and multiple selected values and also it persist while paging or sorting

2674477
filtering	grouping
i ve looked at the organic grouping filtering but no luck there

2674526
draggable	droppable
html 5.0 offers drag and drop built in but you will probably need to use draggable and droppable from the jquery ui library

2674587
activemq	rabbitmq
look toward message brokers like activemq rabbitmq zeromq

2674602
mktime	strftime
i don t know how you get those numbers 69 137 but you can use gawk s mktime and others like strftime etc

2674636
versioning	upgrade
there may be a javascript answer to this but i try to avoid that as much as possible since it sometimes leaves you open to versioning upgrade issues

2674639
fgetc	fread
it is better to either in using fgetc and parse as it comes in or read into a buffer fread and process it from there

2674659
superclass	subclassing
but what i have such a thing in a superclass and make a subclassing

2674700
google-chrome	firefox
browsers that collectively cover 95 of the world firefox google-chrome ie6 7 8

2674707
multiplying	add
please note that multiplying a by 10000 b by 1000.....and e by 1 will not working since and therefore i will lose it when i add the values up

2674741
width	height
the only reason customtitleview.bounds has zero width and height is because you ve initialized it that way by using cgrectzero

2674894
firefox	safari
i have tried lots of different settings and every other browser firefox safari ie8 renders the text below the image

2674900
children	parent
then it will return the complete array of children for that given node parent

2674922
put	get
put all that database code on the server side where it belongs and use an ajax call to get that data from a server-side component

2674971
int	chars
in this example when you re using chars they are casted to int

2674972
client-side	server-side
is server-side logic it s placing the literal client-side id in the output to the client so before it looked like this when rendered in the html

2675001
keydown	keyup
if you can pass keyeventargs to your class from a keyup or keydown event handler you have access to the keyeventargs.modifiers property

2675104
hash	salt
however the basic answer to your question is to add a random per-user salt and switch to a slower hash

2675107
hash	salt
since a rainbow table is a series of precomputed hash chains for various passwords it is easily foiled by adding a salt to the passwords

2675107
hash	salt
because hash functions usually remove much of the local correspondence between input and output that is a small change in input produces large seemingly unrelated changes in output even a small salt will be immensely effective

2675122
client-side	server-side
if i understand it right you need some client-side software which acts as a local server to which other applications connect this software then connects using ssl to your server-side software which in turn takes the data out of the ssl tunnel and routes them further

2675122
client-side	server-side
in this case you would need client-side and server-side ssl tls components

2675160
post	get
however gmail does a post with this information and i would like the form to be a get so that the information is in the url of the search results page

2675162
width	height
when i create the bitmapimage the pixels height and width are both 0

2675196
range	max	range	min	min	max
there is a method that returns an array with a min and max values within this range i.e 13 15 20 27 50 .

2675196
min	max
where 13 is the min and 240 is the max

2675244
width	height
i want to set some default width and manage height according to its content in a way so that neither horizontal nor vertical scroller appears

2675249
min	max
to find min and max from incoming array

2675313
google-chrome	safari
not sure about safari but google-chrome has a command line switch for this

2675321
moq	typemock
i know i wouldn t need this with typemock however with something like moq i need to use the adapter pattern to enable the creation of mocks via interfaces for code i don t control

2675346
post	get
i have the below code and i am trying to get each users post into a seprate div currently it shows all the post in one div

2675350
noscript	meta
there is a noscript tag that have a meta to redirect the user to a page that alerts him about the disabled javascript.

2675357
hide	show
i need to just hide the tab and div and when i click add tab i should just show the hidden tab and div

2675357
hide	show
i am not sure how to show hide the tab and div property

2675361
hash	salt
the recommended way to store passwords is salt + hash but because it becomes unrecoverable it is useless in your case

2675369
accessor	properties
in the case of a properties say public string dataasstring the get accessor would house the logic to encode all of the data into a string while the set accessor would decode the input value and set all of the data in the class instance

2675391
getter	setter
if your property s getter or setter are performing substantial calculations then moving them to a method is generally encouraged

2675398
getter	setter
to make things more easy to use wrap the qcombobox with a python class that offers setter and getter for the current db key and which hides the mapping

2675413
punctuation	words
1st thing i thought i d do is setup an example with a mix of scenerios i could test against its sitting with punctuation in html tags ones that we ve applied this to already in other words the script has run through this before so no need to do again

2675456
groupbox	panel
put all the textboxes where the user will enter a value inside a common container like a groupbox or panel control

2675490
apache	nginx
you can also use nginx to offload ssl processing from the apache instances

2675490
apache	nginx
nginx and haproxy live together on a heartbeat cluster and feed requests into a pool of apache boxes on the backend

2675513
udp	tcp
there are slightly more than 500 ports defined about half udp and half tcp

2675514
width	height
trying to get height and width of gtkeventbox

2675566
lisp	scheme
the example is in scheme but i ll take an answer in any lisp

2675569
uitableview	nsindexpath
void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

2675609
versioning	upgrade
we have a product that includes a reasonable database part 100 tables 500 procs functions views so we need to be able to deploy new databases of the current versioning as well as upgrade older databases up to the current versioning

2675611
bufferedreader	printwriter
i m trying to use the java commands pw.println and br.readline in matlab because i have set up a socket input_socket2 between matlab and a command-line program i want to control using java classes bufferedreader and printwriter

2675614
gentoo	linux
i m trying to update eclipse 3.5.1 on gentoo linux from the galileo discovery site and i get this error message

2675657
post	get
it was just that my framework used was sanitizing all get post requests

2675705
accessor	properties
for example if you submit an input with name test you should have the following accessor in your action form class which respect javabeans convention for properties named test

2675728
updatepanel	scriptmanager
basically i have created a custom control that uses an updatepanel and as i understand it i need to use a scriptmanagerproxy to make it work since there should only be one scriptmanager per page and is is declared in my .aspx page .so how do you use this beastie is it just a matter of adding

2675744
versioning	upgrade
support can then go get the script for any versioning and use the redgate tools to either create from scratch or upgrade

2675756
children	parent
we can store it in array format with parent in position i and its children in 2i 2i+1

2675781
catalyst	embperl
on submission the form sends the value of the search string from to a back-end script for example a perl cgi script iplemented using cgi.pm for simplicity though these days use more modern web frameworks such as perl s catalyst or templating frameworks such as embperl

2675786
postorder	inorder
you can save the inorder and pre postorder traversal of the binary tree in the file and reconstruct the tree from these traversals

2675793
pull	push
currently clients push new data to the server and pull new data from the server on 15-minute polling loop

2675793
pull	push
the server currently does not push data - the client hits the messagecount method to see if there is new data to pull

2675816
vb.net	vb6
also here is the vb6 code by cvs 2600hertz translated to vb.net

2675855
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
but in google-chrome firefox and safari content became inactive

2675913
libcurl	typhoeus
i know there are a few libcurl examples but my tries with typhoeus haven t been successful so far

2675956
min	max
in this case the max query will need to browse over only 1 record while the min query will have to browse all records from 2001 and further on

2676047
hlsl	glsl
i never used hlsl but i did use glsl a while back and i must admit it s terribly far in my head

2676072
getter	setter
actually a property is just a pointer to methods usually getter setter when they are generated by visual studio or other high level language most of the time

2676089
filtering	grouping
found out you need to set a relationship between organic grouping grouping node post and organic grouping grouping member filtering

2676107
width	height
don t use inline styles the height you re setting on the .content and .content_ie classes this makes even less sense since you re setting other style properties like width through the css

2676107
width	height
for the ie-specific declarations a better approach is to set up your styles so that you can take care of the cascade - set the base styles height width etc on the .content class and then apply a few ie specific rules like the different height

2676115
hide	show
control has a setvisible boolean method and composite inherits from control which you can use to show and hide a component

2676157
int	chars
as mentioned above k evaluates from right to left so the _ic function takes whatever is to its right and converts it to an int value this includes both single chars and chars vectors

2676193
integer	unsigned
specifically i m thinking about 24 or 32 bit unsigned integer operands

2676210
int	chars
a switch works with the byte short chars and int primitive data types

2676210
int	chars
it also works with enumerated types discussed in classes and inheritance and a few special classes that wrap certain primitive types chars byte short and int discussed in simple data objects

2676252
udp	tcp
i would possibly use a method similar to ms exchange - connection and authentication via tcp ip then notification of update s from the server to client via udp then the client recieves the udp request and downloads the update via tcp ip

2676257
ssl	https
it s a matter of configuring your web server to use https http over ssl rather than http cleartext http to serve the page

2676265
ssl	https
as to the server configuration it s unclear what server you re using so here s a tomcat-targeted example how to configure the server to use https ssl

2676295
implements	extends
implements my own trigger which extends simpletrigger and contains shared state that could run its own triggerlistener

2676307
bluetooth	usb
any way is possible bluetooth wifi or usb

2676309
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
that works on ie6 and up at least firefox and other gecko-based browsers google-chrome and other webkit-based browsers opera etc

2676312
websphere	ibm
c program files ibm websphere mq bin amqmdnet.dll

2676323
ssl	https
when privacy is a concern i d go for the safest option serve data over ssl via https

2676327
children	parent
in git a particular commit knows about its parent s but not necessarily about its children

2676392
portrait	landscape
remember also that you can use two different nibs for portrait and landscape modes

2676443
getter	setter
suppose a class has private data members but the setter and getter are in public scope

2676443
getter	setter
if you inherit from this class you can still call those setter and getter -- enabling access to the private data members in the base class

2676454
getter	setter
because the getter and setter are public -- they re callable by anyone not just derived classes

2676480
getter	setter
getter and setter do not give you complete control over private data members

2676509
getter	setter
using getter and setter like this does not really make sense in c++

2676571
yacc	bison
what you at least normally want to do is have yacc bison if you must produce a header y.tab.h by using yacc -d and include that in your lexer

2676571
yacc	bison
edit i forgot to mention one other point with a bottom-up parser like bison yacc byacc generate left recursion is generally preferred to right recursion so you d generally prefer to change this

2676656
versioning	upgrade
i m happy to compile up my own copies of what-ever versioning is best the stable versioning closest what github runs presumably 1.7.x if that is the only reliable way to proceed but if i m unlikely to experience problems pulling changes between 1.5 1.6 1.7 then i d prefer to keep to the standard repository versioning to make updates upgrade of git as painless as possible

2676661
accessor	properties
another way to do this if this makes sense for your project is to 1 in your nib file add an object controller 2 set the class of that object controller to your model class 3 in your model class create an instance variable for the slider float sliderfloatvalue 4 create accessor for the float properties readwrite assign float sliderfloatvalue

2676681
accessor	properties
the properties or indexer mycomponent.value cannot be used in this context because it lacks the get accessor

2676689
getter	setter
in our case we are deriving the value returned from the getter to get stored in the db and the setter has no functional purpose

2676724
public	protected
maybe if you make access modifiers of entity fields default or protected or public then hibernate will initialize fields directly without using setter i read something about it but i m not sure that it works

2676737
post	get
after looking at some of your other post i realize that you may not be in control of the dataset you get

2676805
public	protected
if later it is you can make it protected or public as needed

2676838
children	parent
if i m a parent reap any zombie children waitpid -1 null wnohang

2676882
google-chrome	firefox
it caches on firefox and ie and not so much in google-chrome or safari.

2676942
typemock	moles
both typemock and moles have the goal of isolation in mind

2676942
typemock	moles
these are the advantages in typemock i have not yet discovered with moles

2676942
ncover	partcover
support for code coverage tools ncover and partcover

2676956
rss	feed
i have a rss feed i need to display in a table its clothes from a webshop system

2676956
width	height
the images in the rss vary in width and height and i want to make a table that shows them all

2677016
mouseleave	mouseenter
you could add things like setting the interval on mouseenter and clearing it on mouseleave so it s not checking every second someone is on your page but this should give you a basic idea

2677055
mdpi	hdpi
create ldpi mdpi and hdpi versions of it this is detailed in the article linked above

2677111
puts	gets
data not such a multiple gets base64-encoded with a trailing character catenating it puts the in the middle of the string which is not a valid base64 string

2677117
django	web2py
i was planning to write a new webapp i figured out two options for my backend - web2py or django

2677117
django	web2py
could i just use jquery as a replacement for django and web2py and finish this webapp

2677143
hash	salt
storing the salt alongside the user data does not weaken the hash

2677188
rss	feed
there is a free toolkit for consuming rss feed that might make this easier

2677260
getter	setter
as others have mentioned if you annotate a property getter method then hibernate uses the setter when reading values from the database

2677260
getter	setter
this implies that if you annotate a getter then it needs to call a setter when reading the object from the database

2677268
rss	feed
actually it appears the issue that you re getting is because you have to be logged in to slashdot in order to get that rss feed

2677268
rss	feed
to see what i mean log out of slashdot and then reload the link you provided above - it takes you to an html page instead of the rss feed

2677297
public	protected
if you re not sure what the class s interface is you re not to interfaces or those interfaces aren t yet fully defined start with everything private and make things public protected package-private etc

2677306
coalesce	isnull
looks good to me but in this particular case you can isnull instead of coalesce

2677311
daemons	launchd	daemons	systemd
visual studio 2010 changed the help systemd to run a little daemons and launchd the systemd default web browser to view it

2677311
google-chrome	firefox
i m using firefox for my system browser but would like to use google-chrome for vs help

2677316
memset	malloc	memcpy	memset	memcpy	malloc
with the exception of run-time sized cases the typical idiomatic way to use memset as well as memcpy malloc etc. is to do

2677366
post	get
in order to pull off this attack the attacker must know the server the path to the script and all of the post get parameters but he doesn t need your password or cookie

2677379
google-chrome	safari
if you can restrict yourself to advanced browsers with html5 goodies you can do even more client-side further lightening the load on your server and enhancing scalability how much you can demand of the browser varies widely with your app of course -- if it targets iphone android or other advanced mobile phones specifically or if it s an enterprise-internal web app where the users can be made to use google-chrome or safari say you can be far more demanding than if you want millions of random users out on the open web

2677379
flask	tipfy
for the server-side part i d suggest an ultralight microframework on top of werkzeug and wsgi such as flask or if the server uses app engine tipfy there are others esp

2677379
client-side	server-side
i would not place on the client-side anything that needs security though - since all of your javascript code jquery or not can be examined and hacked easily anything you want to be safe should live server-side

2677440
userid	usergroups
it seems incredibly inefficient for me to first get the id of the supplied usergroups then get the results in userusergroup where usergroupid equals that then get all the userid from that query and then for each of those ids query the user table to grab the object corresponding to that id

2677523
chown	chmod
you should adjust the file s privileges such as chmod 700 file_name and make sure the file is owned by your web server chown apache apache file_name

2677565
google-chrome	firefox
it works in both firefox and google-chrome but not ie

2677574
versioning	upgrade
there are a lot of these jars so if we were to upgrade to a newer versioning of adf we would have to go into every application and redefine some pretty redundant dependencies

2677592
charindex	substr
basically i m using charindex to find the delimiter | and then using substr to find everything just before the delimiter

2677606
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i was hoping someone could help me figure out what to do about a browser inconsistency issue between safari google-chrome and firefox

2677606
google-chrome	firefox
here s a screenshot the one on the left is google-chrome right is firefox

2677638
jar	manifest.mf
little variation of #2 create a jar with a manifest.mf referencing all the jars using a relative path and declare a dependency on this almost empty jar with a system scope

2677709
post	get
ajax to me is when you actually make a server request to post or get some information with out the page refreshing ie full post back

2677736
client-side	server-side
asp.net is primarily a server-side technology stack which dynamically generates most of the client-side code

2677776
prepare	execute
you have to check for errors at each stage of the process when you connect when you prepare the statement when you bind when you execute and when you close

2677797
margin	text-align
as you can see in navbar i tried to use text-align center or margin auto but it still wont center the whole menu.

2677881
post	get
if you re trying to quickly get a grasp on the major trade-offs involved in nosql systems check out this blog post i wrote visual guide to nosql systems

2677928
post	get
and you do a get or post submit to the same page who have the form and if the user hit back in the browser the password field gets blank

2677933
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
when i am in firefox google-chrome and safari clicking on that image fires the showsomeinfo that s specified in the radio s onclick

2677951
hide	show
now the two alternative contents are each inside a and a js script decides which one to show and which one to hide

2677974
hide	show
then it gives a button the ability to show hide the video i m assuming that is the intended behavior

2677985
int	boolean
all java objects everything except primitives such as int float boolean etc... are references to the pointed-to-object

2677997
csla	.net
i generally write custom build scripts for this and when i tried this time to build a simple .net assembly which internally uses csla it started giving me linq errors

2678011
switching	screens
after you grab a page switching context to the ui thread and update the screens to show how much data you grabbed

2678023
post	get
this blog post also has quite a few useful details about how dlls get resolved as side-by-side assemblies

2678033
hash	hmac
the hmac function builds on established hash functions to use a known key to authenticate a string of text

2678045
put	get
in my lib folder i put a file with a class that should do a render_to_text with template.xml.builder but i get

2678071
maven	cargo
a cleaner solution would be to use the maven cargo plugin and this is my suggestion

2678119
disk	ram
to sum it up i expect either disk cpu or ram to be exhausted before the package slows down but instead its as if the ssis package is taking an afternoon nap

2678171
pop-up	dialog
the dialog that is asking if it s ok to update never pop-up

2678189
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have the following line of code that works fine in firefox google-chrome and safari but not in internet explorer 8

2678189
hide	show
the function simply show and hide a div on clicking the hyperlink

2678221
width	height
based on the ball position you should be able to determine if the ball collides this is based on the fact you treat the ball as a simple bounding box with a set height and width

2678249
put	get
i have to use reflection when adding them to know in which array to put each item which is not desirable and i still can t preserve the ordering as i just extract all the items on each list one by one and put them into a new object array on the property get

2678286
keydown	keyup
i am attaching handlers to the keydown and keyup events of a silverlight 3 textbox as so

2678286
keydown	keyup
when i comment out the keydown handler then the keyup will trap the event otherwise only the keydown handler is triggered

2678297
width	height	portrait	landscape
update it seems that desktop safari uses the width and height of the screen at the moment and gives itself an orientation of portrait or landscape based on that

2678310
children	parent
and in such situation one had to search through all the children of the most parent class that defines the member

2678331
voip	sip
i create a sip session with mjsip to an external voip provider

2678331
voip	rtp
when i diagnose the network traffic with wireshark i see a bunch of rtp traffic from my localhost behind some kind of nat to the voip provider and nothing back

2678331
voip	sip
the software linphone works using the same localhost and voip provider - though it is using a different sip stack

2678343
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout
unlike mouseover and mouseout the mousenter and mouseleave events won t fire when moving to or from a child so they ll behave like you want in this case

2678343
mouseleave	mouseenter
for cleanliness though i d bind .live mouseenter and .live mouseleave separately and remove the if it s much easier to look and see what s going on might be just me though

2678364
onresume	onpause
even that is not completely reliable so you can also write state to preferences when in onpause and read them in onresume

2678391
abstract-class	superclass
abstract-class - a class meant to conceptualize a common ancestor but of which actual instances are not meant to exist shape is an abstract superclass for rectangle and triangle

2678416
inherited	properties
if this is the case you should inherited from usercontrol and you would have the properties available on design time without any other addition

2678434
fixed-point	fractions
the next two steps are more dsp-specific there might be c-callable pragma s to speed up particular math operations like fractions fixed-point math

2678447
pop-up	dialog
you would never be able to do this using facebook only something that uses browser auth the browser pop-up a username pass dialog

2678489
maven	pom.xml
this means that during development use intellij s build based of the pom.xml files which is incremental and quick and only use maven stand alone for continous integration and releases

2678504
google-chrome	firefox
when i refresh the page in google-chrome or firefox everything works fine but when i refresh in ie7 i get a blank page

2678634
jpql	hql
in hibernate i want to run this jpql hql query

2678721
versioning	upgrade
you should figure out all the changes that have been done to your new database and write out a script of all the sql commands needed to upgrade the old database to the new versioning that you re using alter table a add column x etc

2678724
django	web2py
in ror or django or web2py you can describe a database as a set of classes that remaps to tables and the framework having being provided with a connection string to the desired database generates the tables fields relations and in the case of ror and web2py it also keeps it up-to-date eg removing a class drops the table adding a property to the class triggers an alter table add etc

2678727
pop-up	dialog
when the user clicks i want the real image to pop-up in a dialog

2678732
portrait	landscape
the documentation says that if i want to support both portrait and landscape i basically have two ways of doing that

2678770
int	boolean
now each of these questions poses a different but very type specific answer boolean date float int

2678791
getter	setter
using getter and setter is the way to go

2678811
portrait	landscape
for instance of the user is holding the device in landscape mode i have already manually rotated the ui to landscape mode and he she clicks the screen lock it will rotate the ui to portrait mode even though the user did not move the device at all

2678819
put	get
i would like to put a hashmap with id name pairs into the autocompletetextview and get the id of the clicked item

2678826
getter	setter
if you need to create any validation in the future you ll want a setter getter

2678832
getter	setter
i use getter and setter in a class if there is more logic involved that just returning this.value

2678845
getter	setter
that entirely depends on what the getter and setter are doing

2678845
getter	setter
but if they are pure javabean like getter setter then i d rather access the variable directly by either a or this.a depending on whether there s a local variable in the scope with exactly that name

2678845
getter	setter
personally i would just keep the getter and setter pure according the javabean spec and add another getter or setter with a self-explaining method name whenever i d like to do something more than just getting setting the value

2678891
cos	sin
if the cylinder of radius r 0 and height h 0 is the image of x y z r cos ï r sin ï z on ï âˆˆ 0 2ï and z âˆˆ -h 2 h 2 then simply choose ï and z randomly on these intervals

2678902
elf	dwarf
bintuls deals mostly with the executable format elf - the debugging stuff stuff is kept in the dwarf format

2678902
elf	dwarf
altogether parsing through elf and dwarf to pull out the types is pretty scary and non-trivial - though exactly what a debugger already has done

2678920
nsimage	nscell
currently i m drawing an nsimage in a custom nscell like so

2678924
voip	rtp
so the voip client ignored the corresponding rtp requests

2678937
google-chrome	firefox
i ve run the sample page on vista ie8 ie8 compatability google-chrome 4.1 and firefox 3.5.9 - if you like i can also do xp and win 7 - but so far they all appear to work in a similar fashion

2679064
integer	unsigned
i am trying to find out the maximum value for an integer signed or unsigned from a mysql database

2679076
rss	feed
this is my javascript function which grabs an rss feed via the proxy script and then spits out the 5 latest rss items from the feed along with a link to my stylesheet

2679076
rss	feed
the goal is to be able to grab the rss feed parse it to grab the titles and links and spit it out into some html on any website on the web

2679076
rss	feed
i m basically making a simple rss widget for my site s various rss feed

2679076
rss	feed
they way my site creates rss feed is that the first title is actually the rss feed title

2679106
for-loop	arrays
i want to make this output on php with a single for-loop with that arrays

2679112
getter	setter
getter and setter are part of the interface

2679125
src	attr
var src this attr src

2679139
google-chrome	firefox
if you re serving the page from the file system firefox and i think google-chrome will see it as originating from a different domain

2679167
setinterval	settimeout
the return values from settimeout and setinterval are completely opaque values

2679201
firefox	safari
this problem only occurs in ie as upon testing i found it was fine in firefox and safari

2679226
profiling	instrumentation
the option that you choose depends on which of the three types of profiling you use sampling instrumentation or global

2679281
draggable	droppable
edit oh i forgot to add i had to do this because it appears that sortable draggable droppable doesn t work on lists deeper than one level

2679349
apache	lighttpd
web server software that continuously run like iis apache or lighttpd can execute php scripts without ending themselves

2679358
kde	gnome	fontconfig	freetype
fontconfig is a cross-platform library for finding fonts by either direct name times roman or common aliases like serif - it s what most modern linux software like the gnome kde desktops use to find fonts and is used in conjunction with libraries like pango for text layout and freetype for font rasterizing

2679414
inherited	properties
since basepage inherited from system.web.ui.page they will get access to all of the page methods and properties as well

2679470
hide	show
i m looking for a show hide component much like the toolbox from vs2010 and eclipse s panels when something is maximized

2679539
getter	setter
don t forget the synthesize to create the setter getter

2679590
rss	feed
parse a rss news feed from wsj

2679610
post	get
i had a routine to compress the http post get request parameters into a unique signature

2679611
inherited	properties
uitextview inherited from uiscrollview so you can therefore access all of the same properties as with a uiscrollview

2679621
boost	stl
for example the following boost classes could be used to some extent where one expects an stl container

2679623
for-loop	arrays
i d do that inside of a for-loop starting at 1 and going to the end of the _files arrays

2679645
submit	submission
the easy way out is to read that function yourself and see what it does - if it just submit the form then maybe you can get around it by submission the form without clicking on anything

2679663
subtraction	add
take one off the year and add 12 to the month since there are always 12 months in a year then perform the subtraction

2679705
uiview	subviews
i instantiate my uiview instances in -viewdidload and add them as subviews to the view controller s view property

2679749
realloc	malloc
there is no standard way to ask how much memory has been allocated by malloc realloc

2679754
free	realloc
your best bet is to reallocate copy and then free the memory explicitly -- realloc is quirky

2679782
django	web2py
web2py and django are for server-side

2679782
client-side	server-side
in fact web2py contains jquery and has many plugins that combine client-side and server-side functionality and are based on jquery

2679782
django	web2py
jquery is agnostic on which server-side framework you use web2py django or other and server-side frameworks are also agnostic on which client library you use jquery prototype etc.

2679806
lan	intranet
more info this is for an internet solution not intranet lan

2679874
int	chars
in c chars are just a type of int except that they can be signed or unsigned int is signed by default

2679874
fread	strtod	strtol	fread	strtol	strtod
you might look up scanf or strtod or strtol combined with read or fread

2679879
typedef	struct
if you want it to be 16-bytes in size typedef a struct that has 16-bytes of member data within it

2679882
x86	mips
most colleges teach assembly on something like mips because it s much simpler to understand x86 assembly is really ugly

2679882
x86	mips
it s definitely the conventional wisdom that x86 is inferior to mips sparc and powerpc

2679906
pop-up	dialog
idea catches them and pop-up a dialog to let you change the startup memory settings and then exits when you are done

2679922
x86	y86
some assembly classes teach an ultra-simplified subset of x86 called y86 which is simplified beyond the point of not being useful for real use no shift instructions or some teach just the basic x86 instructions

2679944
put	get
however when i try to connect using the synchronous connection i still get the error and i don t see the challenge functions being called when i put in logging

2679971
inherited	properties
below is a properties i have on my base control class most controls i created inherited from this the comments should indicate the reason for what looks like hacky code but essentially this is much more reliable than designmode on its own

2680041
subtract	add
for example most x86 integer add subtract instructions modify the flags register

2680041
subtract	add
after performing an add or subtract the next operation is often to look at the flags register to check for overflow sign bit etc

2680057
for-loop	arrays
i then used the tag to create an arrays of then wrote a for-loop that took the values i needed out of the each arrays object just by getting the range of the tags

2680125
x86	mips
while not a fault of x86 per se x86 calling conventions weren t standardized like mips was mostly because ms-dos didn t come with any compilers leaving us with the mess of __cdecl __stdcall __fastcall etc

2680196
post	get
if it is in php give the name of that and use the post or get method after that you can use the option of isset or that particular button name is checked to that value

2680198
submit	submission
it s important to pay attention to this detail otherwise your can really frustrate your users when they submit a form yet nothing happens and their data is lost because your code failed to detect a form submission

2680204
post	put
i put a post together on the topic and i m hoping to find a way of working around the problem but if not i think i ll be going back to a python + django combination until cold starting java requests has less of an impact

2680378
post	get
the first thing we do is get the most recent post

2680378
post	get
all we re getting it for is to get a single post id and then we add a hidden custom field thus the underscore it begins with called

2680407
atof	strtod	atoi	atof	atoi	strtod	printf	atoi	printf	strtod	printf	atof
consider using printf or atoi or atof or strtod

2680409
single-quotes	double-quotes
i have tried using setattribute for loops adjusting both and single-quotes and double-quotes etc

2680416
width	height
however my sprite class s parent which is the uicomponent has width height of 0

2680438
pull	push
i ve made something that works almost exactly this way except that the remote repo that receives the push is on the same machine as the repo that afterward pull

2680490
hide	show
when the checkbox is checked change focus copy current value and hide and show the appropriate text field

2680641
stdout	stderr
the example receives stderr separately from stdout without using a temp file

2680700
aptana	rubymine	textmate	notepad++	textmate	aptana
in more practical terms if you use mutliple os and editors such as at work i used rubymine on win xp and textmate on my macbook at home and one of our developers uses notepad++ and another aptana and we even have one who uses netbeans all of these editors interpret tabs differently - different indentation but 2 spaces are always 2 spaces

2680710
merb	ruby-on-rails
however that is changing in ruby-on-rails 3 thanks to merb influence and yehuda katz in particular one but not the only one of the ruby-on-rails 3 core merb and jquery core members

2680714
many-to-many	many-to-one
i have lazy fetch in almost every many-to-many relationship but i have a lot of many-to-one relationships between entities but this is the great advantage of jpa

2680720
getter	setter	illegalstateexception	illegalargumentexception
if you really really think it is a problem that the future client code might not use your bean correctly then i would rather validate the state of the bean in the getter or setter and throw a runtime exception like illegalstateexception or illegalargumentexception

2680724
lxml.html	beautifulsoup	html5lib	beautifulsoup	html5lib	lxml.html
there are really only 3 reasonable ways to parse html as it is found on the web lxml.html beautifulsoup and html5lib

2680783
tstringlist	tlist
see efficiency of tlist and tstringlist

2680790
jar	manifest.mf
have a manifest.mf with following content and pack it to your jar file as meta-inf manifest.mf

2680810
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
then add the uinavigationcontroller s to the uitabbarcontroller so there should be 4 uinavigationcontroller s one for each tab

2680815
qtreewidget	qtreeview
you should inherit qtreeview instead of qtreewidget

2680815
qabstractitemview	qabstractitemmodel
and i fear that you may have to specialize from qabstractitemview qabstractitemdelegate and qabstractitemmodel

2680862
treemap	treeset
sortedset look-ups for contains are log n check the javadoc but i m pretty sure treeset s underlying structure is treemap whose in turn is a red-black tree and in the worst case no loops or loop at very end it will have to do n look-ups

2680886
google-chrome	safari
safari uses a pdf plugin of its own something exclusive to safari and not present in other webkit based browsers like google-chrome

2680927
getter	setter
yes absolutely if only to prevent you from writing the same getter and setter in every controller that has deal with your table of configuration settings

2680927
getter	setter
write your getter and setter once ideally in a generalized way in my_model and write your complex queries once in the model then call them in as many libraries controllers or views as desired

2680968
colorbox	thickbox	shadowbox	lightbox
i personally tried lightbox thickbox no longer supported colorbox and shadowbox and found colorbox to best fit my needs

2681148
preorder	inorder
i have used an algorithm similar to the one which we always use to recovery a binary tree through the preorder traversal and the inorder traversal

2681184
post	get
if i navigate to the .asmx file and click the addtab method i get a list of soap 1.1 and soap 1.2 xml but not the http post request

2681184
post	get
if i navigate to it locally i get all three soap 1.1 soap 1.2 and http post

2681216
submit	submission
you are putting the combine fields functionality into the submit event handler which is fine but you don t stop the form from submission so you will never see the result of you operation on the original form

2681251
children	parent
a parent is not coded on the basis what is required by children

2681269
serializable	deserialization
if you need to save a set of objects to disk then read them back and do that repeatedly as the objects change i would say you need to look into serializable and deserialization

2681273
post	get
i had written a custom search query for moss 2007 to get data where contenttype is post

2681298
sudo	passwd
sudo gem install mysql passwd

2681323
gridview	repeater
i have nested a repeater in gridview

2681323
gridview	repeater
right now it is showing gridview rows and repeater header for every case whether data is there or not for that particular grid view row in the repeater

2681323
gridview	repeater
i want to hide the gridview row and repeater header when there is no data present for that particular gridview row

2681388
war	manifest.mf
mvn war war is intended to create a deployable artifact which needs the information inside pom manifest.mf as well ...but the war exploded is only intended for testing deploy into a particular folder instead

2681467
move	drag
the problem is that i should be able to move that element around but if i append it to my dom i can t drag it at all

2681487
sorting	filtering
the only way to allow user chosen sorting is to manually filtering and check that it s either desc or asc

2681508
put	get
second thing you should put the menu all in one list with sublevels as nested lists and get rid of img separators - they can be added as background images trough css

2681521
width	height
i m using ckeditor 3.2 trying to change the width and height of the ckeditor from javascript i have used several methods all unsuccesful

2681529
apache	nginx
serving static files with django is a bad idea use apache nginx etc

2681555
children	parent
however if your data structure guarantees that it s acyclic you can use tree algorithms on your graph by simply treating parent as children

2681605
subclass	abstract-class
an abstract-class can have constructors - they cannot be invoked directly but only as part of constructing a subclass instance via a call to super in the subclass constructor

2681613
super	abstract
one cannot make an instance of an abstract class but subclasses can call super name

2681623
subclass	abstract-class
you can have references of type abstract-class refer to a subclass non abstract object

2681623
super	abstract
and in order to construct a student object you need to have the person parts of the student initialized thats what exactly the constructor of the abstract super class is called for

2681722
ssl	https
now you have ssl ready to be used try to use your login form via https and see what happens

2681767
int	chars
also given that std exception what returns a chars object describing what happened whereas your api returns an int code indicating the type of exception.

2681809
for-loop	loops
for example you know foreach loops is heavy and if we use for-loop is better

2681809
for-loop	loops
i want a tools to convert my code to best performance code.for example when i compile my c sharp code to il code this tools convert foreach loops to for-loop for best performance

2681813
width	height
each img.jpg file has properly width height but the drawn image is too small

2681852
chunked	transfer-encoding
this will enable you to set transfer-encoding chunked in your header

2681880
folder	directory
i store my js images css etc in the content folder underneath the virtual directory

2681880
folder	directory
if you then view properties in iis manager of the content folder create it as a virtual directory then remove the wildcard mapping

2681880
folder	directory
then set the content folder back to a normal directory

2681897
public	protected
i ve tried both a private and protected get accessor but the override won t compile unless the accessor is public

2681897
accessor	properties
the properties or indexer cannot be used in this context because it lacks the get accessor

datamapper	activerecord
also datamapper is much more ruby syntax friendy and features like lazy loading when doing chainable conditions like activerecord in rails 3 are there from the beginning

2681920
datamapper	activerecord
datamapper also has a feature that every record in the database maps to one ruby object which is not true for activerecord

jpa	javax.persistence
if you are only using the jpa part you might further trim down by only depending on the javax.persistence api

2682202
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
also according to firefox and safari and presumably google-chrome supports gifs for cursors so you can try using a 1px transparent gif

2682243
client-side	server-side
it makes it much easier to write the client-side javascript part of ajax applications no matter what language the server-side part is written in

2682280
post	get
post you use request.form get you use request.querystring

2682374
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome shift + refresh

2682387
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	ddms	adb
if you are running linux i m running debian but this will work on the ubuntu too you may find that ipv6 is bound and that is preventing eclipse and the ddms from connecting to the adb

2682422
routedevent	frameworkelement
what you want is to fire an icommand in your viewmodel based on a frameworkelement s routedevent

2682470
tiff	png
you may want to use sdl_image official library to load jpg png tiff etc

2682486

this and the concept of multi-user systems with no write access to application directory for regular user accounts is the reason why user data should be kept in the user s home directory and not anywhere near the app installation folder

2682487
int	boolean
found int boolean

2682548
folder	directory
in each language directory i have two folder snippets and projects

so to make the app run on windows 7 64bit do this in visual studio go to the project properties and in the build tab platform target change any cpu to x86

2682608
centos	linux
in the external environment linux centos it worked after hours because i don t have root access and i had to configure cpan to operate as a non-root user

2682651
ant	maven
build tools ant nant maven continuous integration css frameworks

2682658

centos	linux
in the external environment linux centos it worked after hours because i don t have root access and i had to configure cpan to operate as a non-root user

2682705
hash	md5
you could have the protocol send some kind of data about the file before transfer such as an md5 hash that could be checked by the client against the received bytes and back to question 1 send the ack nak if the hash matches

2682731
width	height
i ve defined the height and width in the main usercontrol

2682731
width	height
i ve defined the same height and width in the outofbrowsersettings.xml file

2682753
int	chars
it s going to be a performance memory trade-off anyway because writing one int is generally faster than three chars separately

2682759
mouse	keyboard
for example in ie the event is fired the same way with the keyboard and the mouse but in firefox to trigger the event with the keyboard you need to press enter when the item selected is the good one

2682759
onchange	onblur
the event is also fired when the select loose focus onblur - and only if onchange has not already been fired as gaby pointed out

2682773
min	max
length max - min + 1

2682773
min	max
therefore the answer is length - 1 2 plus 1 2 for even min plus 1 2 for even max

2682773
min	max
note that and the bonuses are 1 - min 2 2 and 1 - max 2 2

2682784

like the parent captures rollover even if i am over one of it s children

2682857
textview	imageview
in interface builder add the imageview behind the textview uncheck the opaque box for the textview

2682867
implements	extends
they are just like parameters except instead of passing in an primitive or object you pass in a class that implements an interface extends a class yes they also work with interfaces depending on method parameter

2682873
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
opera internet explorer google-chrome and safari all come with good debuggers built in links go to information about the debuggers

2682879

when i debug the applicaion i can see that this transient attributes are not null just before calling the persistent method and when it enters my prepersist method all transient attributes changes to null

2682889
superclass	subclassing
as of the most current version django does not allow a subclassing to have a variable with the same name as a variable in its superclass if that variable is a field instance

2682925
hide	show
if you re not using the object tag you can show hide this div via javascript

2682928
range	minimum
the minimum number of even numbers possible in a range is equal to half of the length of the array of numbers or rangeend - rangestart

2682948
int	chars
taking your required condition with + meaning string concatenation on the rhs and int addition on the lhs the checksum of any string would be the sum of the checksums of its individual chars

2682950
uiview	subviews
override hittest withevent in uiview to always return self and it will no longer pass touch events to subviews

2682989

post	get
apologies for the rather verbose and long-winded post but this problem s been perplexing me for a few weeks now so i m posting as much information as i can in order to get this resolved quickly

2683093
imperative	declarative
since c++ is not a declarative language but an imperative one you have to derive yourself a procedural implementation of that translation process before you start coding

2683136
ssl	https
to listen to a shoutcast server through ssl you would need to set up a proxy on another port that forwarded https requests to local http requests

2683138
put	get
i was going to put what i m actually getting but in doing the tests for this i ve managed to get a test program to output the text in the right format as is

2683188
folder	directory
then we create the form into the lib form directory of our app folder

2683214
prepare	execute
i then execute the setstring method to populate the wildcards of the prepare statement

2683244
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
the first is a checked exception while extending runtimeexception will result in an unchecked-exception

2683339
postgresql	mysql
to my experience the ones which do so are at least the postgresql 8.x and mysql 5.x jdbc drivers

2683356
int	double
if you know that there are only int longs and double can be passed as parameters then you can change method signature to

2683356
int	double
this will work for byte short int long and double

2683393
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
note the rgb ... value is the first match in the array because that is the way firefox google-chrome safari and opera return it independently of how you assign it

2683415
put	get
if you now put in you will get an error

2683464
rss	feed
if need updates from google news you can use rss feed as well

2683481
superclass	subclassing
the first parameter to super must be the current class ie the subclassing not the superclass

2683505
mef	prism
information about the use of mef in the next version 4.0 of prism

2683505
mef	prism
i searched for mef prism to find this info

2683512
hide	show
one thing i found with hide and show was that sometimes if you set the display to none show will not work

2683595
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome

2683608
cos	sin
cos x 2 1 - sin x 2

2683613
cos	sin
when you need performance you could use a precalculated sin cos table one table will do stored as a dictionary

2683626
hash	md5
since all of these passwords are stored somewhere i wondered if there was any weakness in the hash themselves for standard hashing algorithms used to store passwords like md5

2683629
getter	setter
you re also not supposed to call setter and getter manually

2683633
getter	setter
you define foo to be a property with getter and setter

2683633
getter	setter
those getter and setter use the variable self._foo since you coded it that way

2683640
cos	sin
you d still have to calculate sin x and cos x but it d be decidedly faster if you don t need a high degree of accuracy

2683641
viewmodel	caliburn
about the messagebox service in caliburn v2 trunk shellframework module there is a question answer viewmodel abstracting the functionality of a messagebox with the advantage of letting you to design the ui for the dialog

2683643
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome

2683656
hash	salt
more importantly you would most likely salt the password so that even the same passwords do not produce the same hash

2683684
getter	setter
the difference with a property is that it s available from the outside and that getter setter methods are used

2683708
cgi-bin	ini
i am using dbxpress as the conduit to the ms sql server db and the two ini files dbxconnections.ini dbxdrivers.ini and two dll s required for the connection reside in the same folder as the executables wwwroot cgi-bin

2683737
cos	sin	cos	exp
it could and might well take longer to do it this way just because eulerâ s formula is mostly used to compute the complex exp using sin and cos â and not the other way round but there might be some theoretical optimisation possible

2683737
cos	sin
the headers in for gnu c++ 4.2 are using explicit calculations of sin and cos inside polar so it doesnâ t look too good for optimisations there unless the compiler does some magic see the -ffast-math and -mfpmath switches as written in chiâ s answer

2683801
calloc	malloc
i thought any call to malloc or calloc allocated heap space

2683806
hash	salt
the password update method salt and hash the password for security

2683806
hash	salt
however my model validates empty passwords but still a n salt hash of an empty password gets saved

2683816
automapper	structuremap
what you need to do is setup automapper like this structuremap is ioc

2683817
accessor	properties
if we apply the encapsulation concept the ui should take care only for the public properties better if them have accessor methods

2683873
maven	pom.xml
the component that adds the pom.properties and the pom.xml files to the generated archive during war war is the maven archiver

2683889
jsf	seam
i am using a jsf 2.0 to create a web app purely jee6 without spring seam etc.

2683908
getter	setter
note for the example you have python this is overkill there is no need to use getter and setter methods unless they are going to have business logic in them

2683948
cos	sin
if you need less precision than the built in sin and cos give you it may be an option

2683953
udp	tcp
tcp connections and udp datagrams cannot simply be passed around as they would in lower levels

2683963
cos	sin
modern x86 processors have a fsincos instruction which will do exactly what you re asking - calculate sin and cos at the same time

2683963
cos	sin
a good optimizing compiler should detect code which calculates sin and cos for the same value and use the fsincos command to execute this

2683991
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
nullpointerexception are extensions of runtimeexception and are therefore unexpected occurances in your program flow

2683997
classcastexception	illegalstateexception
the one sentence answer i would give is that it is the result of a programming error and programming error exceptions are not checked exceptions illegalstateexception classcastexception etc.

2684002
google-chrome	firefox
everything works in firefox and google-chrome

2684002
google-chrome	firefox
my only other theory is that some random css class could be applying a weird attribute to my iframe but again i would expect that to affect firefox and google-chrome

2684046
folder	directory
if your .project and .classpath files are within the eclipse workspace you should define a linked folder to reference and or create files in directory outside your workspace

2684125
hide	show
hide the loading image after it s load it s show the image

2684148
jstl	taglib
ensure that you re declaring taglib in top of jsp files as per jstl 1.1 tlddoc click any of libs to see them

2684154
cos	sin
if you are willing to use a commercial product and are calculating a number of sin cos calculations at the same time so you can use vectored functions you should check out intel s math kernel library

2684160
hash	md5
my question really boils down to how one would combine multiple fields into one md5 or other hash value

2684182
versioning	upgrade
you need to upgrade your versioning of .net to .net framework 4 and download linqpad for .net framework 4.0

2684334
punctuation	words
i am pasting my code on how i am getting rid of trailing punctuation mark from a words

2684396

i don t want to send these by get method or post method.

2684397
packets	pcap
if you re looking for a pcap only solution you re going to have to intercept the dns request packets examine it and assemble the proper reply before the dns server replies

2684398
getter	setter
i have a feeling i will need to implement a class and getter setter on the android side

2684408
bazaar	git
learning a version control tool git mercurial bazaar subversion... is one of the best things you can invest your time on

2684417
folder	directory
most of my items are dlls that need to be put into a folder below the deployment directory

2684431
google-chrome	firefox
for those of you who are trying to figure out what the whole point is read this javascript nextsibling firefox bug fix i have code that does my language translation that works in google-chrome and ie

2684434
button	checkbox
when the submit button is clicked i want the user to get a javascript alert to check atleast one checkbox if none are checked

2684455
qstandarditem	qtreewidget
i have a class that inherits qstandarditem and i put the elements in a qtreewidget

2684519
int	double
note the dangerousness of this construct when you just merely assign double to int in vb.net the double will be accidentally downsized to int

2684554
stdout	stderr
perl scripts die with their messages going to stderr so you will need to capture stderr as well as stdout to see what happened

2684557
width	height
if the pictures height becomes to big for the window then the picture should resize itself according to the height and not the width

2684566
stringbuilder	printwriter
simply replace the stringbuilder with the printwriter that the servletresponse.getwriter method returns

2684603
min	max
i want to search out the max min of an array by simply iterating through and catching the largest

2684658
tunnel	vpn
for connectivity you will need to establish vpn tunnel of some sort between the client server and your server

2684684
keydown	keyup
i ve played around with every combination of keydown keypress and keyup reading event.keycode event.charcode and event.which but i can t find a single combination that works across all browsers

2684759
nginx	lighttpd
as the video files are static files they should be served by a more static oriented webserver like lighttpd or nginx like it s done with photos

2684859
rar	zip
and now when ever i try to restore a directory the rar zip files are copied to the system hard drive instead of extracting their contents to the hard drive

2684859
rar	zip
my alternative is to write a program that traverses the folders on the external drive and extracts files from the rar zip files

2684870
int	chars
g++ compiler complains about conversions between related types from int to enum from void to class from const chars to unsigned chars etc.

2684950
pop-up	dialog
when i call the application in a browser the ie s standard login dialog pop-up

2684964
portrait	landscape
one other thing is that the lock is just that a lock it should not force you into portrait mode if you are in landscape

2685007
mouseup	mousedown
on mousedown you could have it change the image to what you expect to see for the pushed in and change it back on mouseup

2685010
put	get
when you are finished with the struct you will need to remember to release the memory for the string or you will get a memory leak because again the struct is not responsible for the memory containing the string only for remembering where you put it

2685033
richfaces	trinidad
in jsf 1.1 and until recent implementations of jsf 1.2 richfaces trinidad etc the order was setpropertyactionlistener or attribute - actionlistener - action

2685033
icefaces	trinidad	richfaces	trinidad	richfaces	icefaces
in jsf 1.2 and now implemented in richfaces and trinidad not sure about icefaces the order is actionlistener - setpropertyactionlistener or attribute - action

2685062
post	get
you can t pass post in a redirect - only get vars

2685076
google-chrome	firefox
firefox gives the error invalid label and google-chrome uncaught syntaxerror unexpected token

2685145
stdout	stderr
from the javadocs all its standard io stdin stdout stderr operations will be redirected to the parent process through three streams getoutputstream getinputstream geterrorstream .

2685153
min	max
i set up some short test containing all special cases of floats nan + -inf min max value 0 and random numbers

2685153
sorting	grouping
if you use a grouping length of 16 bits only 2 iterations you have a huge memory overhead when sorting small arrays but you can beat array.sort if it comes to arrays larger than about 100k elements even if not very much

2685221
children	parent
since the parent arguably doesn t care if it has children the event-based approach is ideal

2685221
children	parent
people are stating that the parent clearly know what children are interested in them and i simply tend to disagree with that statement

2685221
children	parent
my designs usually have the children dynamically interested in the parent and the children subscribing to the events is generally the most favorable way of doing so

2685258
google-chrome	safari
i just cannot find a reference doc for webkit google-chrome safari

2685307
implements	extends
this devx article discusses how to implements your own logging by extends the cassini source code yourself but doing so introduces other problems if it s not done properly

2685307
cassini	iis
like cassini the neokernel runs any asp.net web application that works under iis and it addresses the above problems

2685385
put	get
however i d like to get the same effect from using a bookmarklet - however when i put

2685393

but i also need to get the exact adress of where he is and put it in a string

2685395
pdfbox	itext
googling around i see there s itext and pdfbox

2685404
getter	setter
i have a java class containing all the columns of a database table as attributes member variables and corresponding getter and setter

2685410
xsl-fo	xslt
apache fop is a java library that can covert xslt formatting objects xsl-fo to pdf

2685452
cassini	iis
it is not based on the cassini source code although like iis and cassini it uses the asp.net processing pipeline for asp.net files

2685470
post	get
take a look at this post to get some insights on setting this up.

2685512
keystore	jks
i export into cer file then with java keytool i import into java keystore jks

2685519
bmp	png
i have an application that can load various graphical file formats such as bmp jpg png emf etc.

viewdidappear	viewwillappear
viewwillappear viewdidappear does not fire and i am told that if the view controller is instantiated in code which is the case these don t fire

2685563
width	height
and then check the properties of the image it is zero width and a garbage number for height in fact same number no matter what the image is

2685572
implements	extends
restrictions from this you can t implements extends two or more interfaces classes that would be same without the generic parameter and are different with the generic parameter

2685628
formview	datalist
i have a datalist and formview

2685628
formview	datalist
the formview s datasource has a filterexpression to pull whatever s been selected on the datalist

i read a post which he added fields for the email but it does not say where exactly should i get the session value

2685674
firefox	safari
this happens on multiple browsers firefox 3.5 3.6 safari internet explorer 7 8 and multiple platforms mac os 10.5 10.6 and windows xp 7

2685684
inherited	properties
i have a problem where the pages won t compile because the views can t see the model s properties which are inherited from lower level base classes

2685687
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is a little more strict than mysql about type conversion and does not let you implicitly cast convert between numbers and strings

2685782
int	double
directcast really has no business with assigning compatible primitive types int double and their lower and higher counterpart

2685789
width	height
this javascript may also add a background element that is styled to be translucent and to span the entire screen height and width and blocks interaction to the page element under it

2685857
put	get
i do understand i could put a variable is_valid false if the load fails and then check the object using a get method but i think there may be better ways

2685908
rss	feed
the laptop has a small app that simply parses the rss feed our ci server produces

2685924
google-chrome	firefox
tested against ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox 2 firefox 3 google-chrome and iphone

2686000
width	height
i have a php script im currently using that creates thumbnails based on a max width and height

2686004
haskell	scheme
haskell has a good name-spacing scheme that means that two type classes can both have a function of the same name and a type can still implement both

2686021
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
so the typeclass num describes numeric types with addition subtraction and multiplication operators

2686021
int	double
so you could use it to sum a list of int or a list of double or a list of complex because they are all instances of num

2686021
int	double
in the sum example you can pass it a list of int or a list of double but you cannot mix double and int in the same list

2686042
dllmain	getprocaddress
there is no guarantee that dllmain of that binary will be called and therefore if you then attempt to getprocaddress into a function inside that binary results are completely unpredictable as global variables may not have been initialized

2686189
post	get
use a post instead of a get post are not cached

2686190
width	height
what i really want to do is find out where viewrenderbuffer is calling its width and height parameters from

2686190
width	height
in the code below i can see that the backing width and height are being taken from the binded viewrenderbuffer and through the renderbufferstorage call

2686190
portrait	landscape
i don t want to use the screen default 320x480 though because if i display a landscape photo on portrait view it will be stretched out and vice versa

2686213
cvs	svn
as part of migrating full cvs history to hg i ve used cvs2svn to create an svn repo in a local directory

2686218
google-chrome	firefox
it only has to work in firefox 3+ and google-chrome

2686248
rss	feed
i am using the following script to generate a rss feed for my site

2686298
printf	atof
i could then exchange data between the c# code and c++ code by using a null-terminated text string and the c++ methods would be simple wrappers around printf and atof functions

2686325
inherited	properties
when you replace the prototype properties with another object this object has it s own constructor properties generally inherited from other constructor or from object.prototype

2686326
nunit	mstest
my unit test background is nunit and mstest

2686335
iprincipal	iidentity
i m trying to encrypt some userdata to create my own custom iprincipal and iidentity objects using forms authentication - i ve serialized an object representing my logged in user to json and created my formsauthentication ticket like so

2686397
postgresql	mysql
on the relational part i have mysql oracle and postgresql

2686455
nsformatter	nsnumberformatter
for instance my data would be 123.4329387 i want to display 2 03 which i have no problem doing with a subclass of nsformatter or nsnumberformatter applied to my nstextfield in the column

2686478
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in firefox but not in google-chrome nor safari

2686478
pop-up	dialog
my guess is that both don t create a pop-up dialog that asks the user whether to save or open the file

2686478
google-chrome	safari
correct me if i m wrong but i think for both google-chrome and safari it automatically downloads the file

2686479
client-side	server-side
the code you posted is a server-side call not a client-side one

2686483
put	get	post	put	post	get
i can get the blogger post url from but i can t put that in a src string because blogger s template system is weird

2686510
children	parent
so even though your sky object has mouseenabled set to false your sky and it s children still take up space and therefore still give sky s parent container a hit area to intercept mouse events

2686513
width	height
you want to work out an offset rather than a new width height so that the new sample stays in proportion then use the offset when generating the new image and give it a fixed width height so that it ll crop to a square

2686524
range	median
3 find out which bucket range the median lies

2686611
pull	push
and there are a lot of other people who had already made git pull for the branch release so i cannot use git reset + git push -f

2686628
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you are to go with the border-radius solution there is this awesome website to generate the css that will make it work for safari google-chrome firefox

2686637
client-side	server-side
be careful how you manage dependancies between client-side code and server-side code

2686637
srp	principles
make sure you consider useful design patterns and principles single responsibility principles srp interface segregation principles isp common reuse principles crp

2686656
firefox	safari
i ve tried the example on but only in safari because firefox won t load it at all and it didn t work

2686659
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
the problem occurs where you add subtract multiplying or divide before a comparison where the exponent and mantissa are adjusted

2686681
agile	greenhopper
i use greenhopper which is an agile process addon

2686717
x86	64bit
if the representation is transformed for example from 64bit memory format to 80-bit internal register format on x86 i would expect that the assertion could possibly fire in some circumstances

2686724
width	height
the problem is i m trying to get the loaded image s height and width inside the function gallery_image_load_complete

2686724
width	height
for some reason this image height and width are off it s astohugh the image hasn t fully loaded

2686729
post	get
basically you need to redirect the post request to a get request immediately after processing the action so that the result page will be delivered by a http get request

2686729
post	get
refreshing this http get request won t execute the initial http post request anymore

2686734
gif	png
gif is smaller because it s based on an colour palette of 256 colours rather than the separate rgb values for each pixel or group of pixels in jpg and png

2686744
client-side	server-side
much more powerful you get inheritance and there some good side benefits like using the same methods for server-side validation as you use for client-side

2686755
sorting	grouping
the temporary table often writes to disk so you get an expensive disk i o as part of the grouping sorting

2686775
gif	png
jpeg is bad at that kind of thing and you ll probably find png to compress better probably better than gif too

2686836
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
this very simple example works on google-chrome safari and opera

2686861
gif	png
png and gif both use lossless compression but gif only works with 8 bits so it requires your image to have 256 colors or less - this often results in a grainier picture

2686882
portrait	landscape
all testing was done so far in portrait mode so i could focus on programming the main features and later on just do some adjustments for landscape

2686882
width	height
and here enters the problem in - void didrotatefrominterfaceorientation uiinterfaceorientation frominterfaceorientation i added some logging to check the sizes before proceeding but apparently the values for width and height are wrong i say wrong because at a first glance the values does not make sense to me

2686926
postgresql	mysql
mysql supports an optional serial data type presumably for compatibility with postgresql since serial is not standard ansi sql

2686926
integer	unsigned
you get the same number of distinct values whether you declare an integer signed or unsigned 2 32 for an int and 2 64 for a bigint

2686935
post	get
since you do get some of the data i would maybe start using jquery to create some type of a checksum of the form elements and values it knows about and send this aggregated checksum along with the form post

2686937
hex	binary
xxd -r then restores the binary file from the hex file

2686962
fflush	gets
the id gets assigned after the fflush

2686969
slideup	slidedown
it is just slightly modified versions of the built in slidedown slideup so that they become slideright slideleft

2686970
folder	directory
okay i ve gotten past this exception by manually creating the webdriver-extension.zip file and copying it to the selenium firefox folder in my site-packages directory

2686977
portrait	landscape
it is using the default setup popover in portrait table view on the left in landscape

2686977
portrait	landscape
the problem i am seeing is that when the app starts in the simulator running in landscape mode the ui paradigm is the one intended for portrait mode master list is a popover is what loads

2687027
mdpi	hdpi
i know the android drawables website but i would like to get the correct hdpi mdpi and ldpi version preferable the original ones

2687042
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
everything works just fine in firefox safari and google-chrome

2687048
gridview	sqldatasource
i have asp gridview displaying client requests using asp sqldatasource

2687068
config	ini
use a config file such as a ini which is supported by php to specify a data directory and read from

2687088
folder	directory
you need to use a temporary directory that is within the folder hierarchy of your web application

2687108
submit	submission
pressing enter in an input field submit a form which depending on your form s action attribute may well be submission the form to the same page causing it to appear like a refresh

2687112
width	height
if your view is auto-rotating then the width height have been translated for you but when you ask for the actual dimensions of the screen you get back the actual dimensions of the screen

2687196
hash	salt
the password is hash and has a salt

2687196
hash	salt
because of the lack of documentation i do not know if the salt is append to the password and then hash how how it is created

2687199
post	get
the correct method would be to follow the prg post redirect get pattern

2687245
width	height
x + width left edge y + height bottom edge.

2687301
boost	stl
that said you may just want to use stl or boost for foreach unless you specifically want to create your own

2687316
width	height	min	max
i removed the min and max width and height lines and changed the android layout_width height attributes to the size i wanted and everything is now working out just fine

2687377
post	get
i chose to create a custom back-end if anyone has gotten this working with signals please post code - i wasn t able to get it working that way

2687382
udp	tcp
there are some schemes of tcp udp datapath

2687382
udp	tcp
code for clusters don t require handling of long distance links or slow links as for default tcp udp stack

2687386
client-side	server-side
select image cd and then any resolution and click add to order. the order will be recorded on the server-side but on the client-side i need to reset the product drop-down to select so that the user will know that they need to select another product

2687416
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
each instance of nsdocument manages one or more instances of nswindowcontroller and each instance of nswindowcontroller can manage one or more instances of nsviewcontroller

2687441
put	get	post	put	post	get
i m looking for a java string constant to refer to http request methods get post put etc.

2687454
titlebar	window
i want the panel being shown as active when the hosted control get focus kind like the behavior of a normal window whereas the window becomes the panel and the titlebar becomes the toolstrip

2687475
division	multiplication
don t make assumptions about byte order i don t do any bit shifting -- i assume gcc will optimize my power of two multiplication division for me

2687486
int	boolean
you could combine a bunch of boolean into a single int column and use bit masks to read the values but this seems unnecessarily complex and is something i would consider only if there was some high-end performance need for it

2687499
submit	submission
in other words when you do a form submission http post from your spring form it s then calling that submit method

2687516
pop-up	dialog
this will cause the call to _openfeeddialogiframe to actually call _openfeeddialogwindow so your feed dialog will be in a pop-up instead of in an iframe

2687641
children	parent
this way each parent can have multiple children

2687664
google-chrome	firefox
prints in firefox 3.6.3 and google-chrome 5.0.375.9

2687690
maven	pom.xml
pom.xml maven dependencies

2687712
portrait	landscape
the application holding the camera preview is set to landscape view as it does not display the preview correctly in portrait orientation

2687720
memcached	apc
using memcached instead of apc which is accessible from anywhere not just a single apache instance

2687721
int	chars
the variable test is the string a test2 is the int 64 the chars number of and test3 is the int 97 a

2687721
int	chars
the surprise is probably that in ruby the elements of strings are int not strings or chars

2687735
int	chars
ruby 1.8 int contain chars numbers for single chars indexing

2687739
for-loop	loops
you need to wrap the contents of the for-loop in a function that takes i as a parameter then call the function in loops

2687792
min	max
doing it like the code above should solve your min max issues if you want to stick to your current method then set values like this

2687804
google-chrome	firefox
i ve been able to produce this with css3 and it works flawlessly on firefox and google-chrome

2687831
post	get
i have an array for checkboxes that i need to pass alongside the regular form in an ajax post but can t seem to get this to work

2687834
youtube	vimeo
i m going to shamelessly plug my script which automates checking for valid formats automatically choosing the best quality format for a video and works on both the flash and html5 variants of youtube pages as well as vimeo

2687849
boost	stl
so i use boost shared_ptr for all the various reference-counting benefits it provides -- reference counting for starters obviously but also the ability to copy assign and therefore store in stl containers

2687926
width	height
the only problem is that if the height and width are not equal the rotated image will no longer appear at the jlabel s origin 0 0

2687926
width	height
if i have an image whose width is greater than its height rotating that image using this method and then painting it will result in the image being painted vertically above the point 0 0 and horizontally to the right of the point 0 0

2687932
sorting	filtering
i also need the column filtering sorting for the cgridview to work using ajax

2687934
put	get
then put a usb cable with the mini-usb plug on the end to get plugged into the android phone

2687943
vb.net	vb6
we have a suite of related products written in vb6 with some c# and vb.net projects and all the source is kept in a single subversion repository

2687947
post	put
ps sometimes rest implementations use http put to create a resource and post to modify or act on an existing resource

2687953
inherited	subclassing
note that this doesn t directly support inherited -- if for example class foo maps in type2templ to template bar then you make a subclassing baz of foo but don t explicitly record in type2templ what template its instances should use you ll get the default template for baz s instances

2687957
apache	nginx
i use nginx for my frontend and reverse proxy back apache development server so i think if it does require some sort of mod_rewrite work i will have to find something that would work with nginx

2687961
int	chars
i ve already asked a question of converting int array to chars but it was recommended to start a new thread on this in the networking section instead

2687969
firefox	safari	webkit	gecko
starting from version 2.0 the library allows integration of microsoft internet explorer apple safari webkit and mozilla firefox gecko engines for rendering html web pages thus ensuring compliance with many internet standards html 4 css xml javascript adobe flash and others

2688004
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
of course we also support firefox safari opera and google-chrome but that s boring my testing algorithm is as follows

2688004
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
before release confirm that opera safari and google-chrome are still correct

2688053
children	parent
each object keeps track of its parent owner and children

2688071
serializable	deserialization
for example a big-endian platform might always convert to little-endian before sending and likewise convert back to big-endian when receiving. you cannot treat non-pod types as a stream of bytes such as std string so you need to write serializable functions for those to transform their data into a stream of bytes and deserialization functions to transform it back

2688083
ubuntu	linux
since i use ubuntu microsoft would need to release a linux version of their browser - and because halley s comet will return long before that happens i am staying away from ie

2688086
getter	setter
there s no const keyword as in other languages however it is possible to create a property that has a getter function to read the data but no setter function to re-write the data

2688086
getter	setter
use the fact that we chose these very names for our own getter setter and create a keyword-dictionary using the double asterisk applied to all the local definitions of that scope to pass parameters to the property function

2688098
mouse	keyboard
bunch of initialisation functions are called -- including methods where i can specify my own mouse and keyboard handlers etc

2688116
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari both support xhr2 uploads with progress events so you can do progress bars etc

2688129
width	height
btw you may have a problem with the label reporting its preferred size - you might need to override getpreferredsize and account for swapping the images width and height if rotated

2688149
fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream
objectoutput objout new objectoutputstream new fileoutputstream f

2688155
put	get
about the only thing i can t get working correctly is when i put a disclosure-button on my custom cell xib

2688209
typedef	struct
the old non-c++0x workaround for the missing templated typedef would be to use a templated struct with a nested typedef

2688261
daemons	systemd
the serice discovery daemons should willing to accomodate these dynamic changes in the systemd

2688267
profiling	debugging
it s sort of the de-facto standard php debugging and profiling tool

2688277
xdebug	xhprof
in addition to the excellent xdebug as mentioned by others you can also look at xhprof

2688279
put	get
you need to first start all threads in a loop put them in an array list or some similar container then join them in a separate loop to get concurrent execution of the methods

2688304
junit	easymock
still now i am using junit i came across easymock i am understanding both are for the same purpose

2688349
junit	easymock
i am not sure but i think junit and easymock instead of being exclusive to each other are supposed to work in tandem together

2688349
junit	easymock
this purpose of providing mock objects in junit is served by easymock and other similar mock object creators

2688374
put	get
anything you put after response.end won t get executed because it throws a threadabortexception to stop execution of the page at that point

2688388
button	checkbox
i don t use submit button to submit the selected checkbox indeed i use link anchor to send those values

2688411
free	malloc
only call free on addresses returned by malloc family functions

2688424
shadowing	named
shadowing is based solely on named not at all on the types of the parameters.the compiler observes that there is a function in derieved-class that hasthe correct named and it stops looking

2688427
free	malloc
malloc means removing a suitable block from the list free means adding it to the list again

2688430
free	malloc
it has to do with how malloc and free are implemented

2688430
free	malloc
one possible way to implement malloc free is to put a small header before each allocated region

2688430
free	malloc
if that string constant is in read-only memory it often is this hypothetical implementation would cause a segfault and crash either after a later malloc or when free adds the object to its freelist

2688441
getter	setter
if i have a class person with a property name and its getter get_name and setter set_name methods then after instantiating the objects and setting the property

2688446
free	malloc
it would certainly be possible for an implementation of malloc free to keep a list of the memory blocks thats been allocated and in the case the user tries to free a block that isn t in this list do nothing

2688466
calloc	malloc
it s known that calloc is different than malloc in that it initializes the memory allocated

2688466
memset	calloc	memset	malloc	calloc	malloc
so in everyday work i regard calloc as malloc + memset

2688470
free	malloc
malloc and free on a conforming hosted c implementation are built to standards

2688470
calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	malloc
the standards say the behavior of calling free on a heap block that was not returned by malloc or something wrapping it calloc is undefined

2688470
free	malloc
you won t break the standard by making the behavior of free on blocks not allocated by malloc consistent and even possibly useful

2688471
versioning	upgrade
if you do not have something seriously wrong with your persistence frameworks than you should be able to upgrade the app on devices while retaining the data just by providing the users with a new versioning of the .ipa file

2688480
getter	setter
you usually want to use getter setter to get more control over what can be assigned to a property and what can t

2688480
getter	setter
in either case you should force the use of the getter setter by making the property private or protected otherwise it s pretty pointless

2688497
post	get
i m going to flesh out jason s answer i ve marked my post as a community wiki so i shouldn t get any points for this

2688500
free	calloc
because on many systems in spare processing time the os goes around setting free memory to zero on its own and marking it safe for calloc so when you call calloc it may already have free zeroed memory to give you

2688513
webkit	gecko
a possible path is to use some layout rendering engine such as webkit or gecko

2688518
mockito	easymock
you might reconsider using easymock though - most people are currently using or in the process of switching to the more advanced and more actively developed mockito inspired by easymock

2688522
calloc	malloc
the short version always use calloc instead of malloc +memset

2688522
memset	calloc
in some cases calloc will do less work because it can skip memset entirely

2688522
calloc	malloc
memory allocators like malloc and calloc are mostly there to take small allocations anything from 1 byte to 100s of kb and group them into larger pools of memory

2688522
calloc	malloc
however since the program you re asking about is allocating for a large amount of memory at once malloc and calloc will just ask for that memory directly from the kernel

2688522
memset	calloc
the standard library zeroes the ram with memset and returns from calloc

2688522
memset	calloc	memset	malloc	calloc	malloc
this is an enormous amount of extra work and explains why calloc is faster than malloc and memset

2688522
memset	calloc	memset	malloc	calloc	malloc
if end up using the memory anyway calloc is still faster than malloc and memset but the difference is not quite so ridiculous

2688522
memset	calloc	free	calloc	free	memset
in general the shared pool might have junk data stored in it from old memory that was used and free with free so calloc could take that memory and call memset to clear it out

2688522
memset	calloc
the calloc function is not using some special memory-aligned version of memset and that wouldn t make it much faster anyway

2688522
calloc	malloc
the performance difference here is much larger i measured more than three orders of magnitude on my system between malloc +memset and calloc

2688522
calloc	malloc
instead of looping 10 times write a program that allocates memory until malloc or calloc returns null

2688527
children	parent
note that when a parent was expanded the children were traversed in

2688531
realloc	calloc	free	calloc	free	realloc
calloc and realloc are valid object sources for free too

2688551
post	get
if you escape a value obtained from get post cookie input it will already have addslashes applied to it so passing it through mysql_real_escape_string will in fact double quote

2688552
inline	inlining
if the operations are inline and optimised well by your compiler you shouldn t usually see any difference between writing the code well using operators to make it readable and maintainable and manually inlining everything

2688552
inline	inlining
i would recommend writing the code with operators and then if you can prove you can speed it up by manually inlining duplicate the code and manually inline the second version

2688569
post	get
there are some examples of doing this using get and post in the net http documentation

2688595
jquery	curvycorners
jquery curvycorners plugin

2688595
jquery	curvycorners
so if you really want curved corners i would recommend you to go with jquery curvycorners plugin

2688622
keydown	keyup
i think you are using the keyup or keydown events in those events you get actually the key what was pressed not the actual character if the user presses a or a you will get 65 as the key code

2688631
short	base
in short you can convert a pointer to a member of an accessible non-virtual base class to a pointer to a member of a derived class as long as the member isn t ambiguous

2688631
short	base
in short you can convert from a derived to a base if you can convert from a to a though you can only use the on objects that are of type d or are descended from d

2688668
daemons	launchd
once i ve completed the process i ve made some adjustments to allow running it as a daemons mostly storing the standard output to a file to allow easy logging and then create a bash script that launchd a start-stop-daemon command

2688670
trie	tree
b+ tree section characteristics trie unfortunately spread all over the article

2688693
trie	tree
but if you want to get the first n children from a substree then a trie is the best choice because you simply visit less nodes than in a b+ tree scenario

2688768
phpmyadmin	adminer
if you mean by dumping creating sql code to recreate the table i d suggesting using existing tools to manage mysql such as phpmyadmin or adminer

2688789
uiview	subviews
however if i add both as subviews to the base uiview the touches only get tracked is the semitransparent uiview since its the last one added

2688789
uiview	uiwindow
i also tried to use hittest in addition to subclassing uiwindow but the base uiview needs to push pop navigation controlling ability so i don t think i can subclass uiwindow to push onto the navigation stack

2688843
width	height
but they may not be very well-formed for example the width or height attribute may be missing

2688849
fsockopen	die
die fsockopen call failed with error number

2688919
min	max
the in the regex means quantifier for a min of 3 and a max of 30 repetitions

2688919
min	max
means min of one and max of

2688938
int	chars	int	double
for information attribute arguments can only be of types bool byte chars short int long float double string system.type and enums

2688963
google-chrome	safari
also not php related but you can see the complete request header along with the responses in any webkit browser safari google-chrome via the resources-tab in the developer tool

2688976
trie	tree
finally b+ tree is admittedly more difficult to implement than a trie it s more on a red-black tree level of complexity

2689002
stdout	stderr
i could redirect the stderr and stdout output of the command to a temporary file which has a random file name then tail the file and pipe to grep for the end conditions i.e

2689076
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to drag one img and so it fires ondragenter for ie and dragover event for standard browsers on ie and firefox after the user drags it could fire ondrop event however on webkit based google-chrome and safari i need to cancel or preventdefault on the dragover event doing that so will disable the dragging

2689091
force.com	salesforce
i think ant using the salesforce force.com migration tool is the way to go for the most part

2689208
hide	show
when the user clicks the first button you can then hide it and show the disabled one making it look like the same button was disabled

2689231
put	get	post	put	post	get
rather than casting to formsauthentication simply get the cookie .aspxauth or the name specified in the web.config and send it to flash and then let flash put it as a post variable while uploading then read request.forms postvariable and create the formsauthenticationtickt as illustrated by the tutorial in the question

2689246
google-chrome	safari
webkit safari google-chrome does allow multiple backgrounds

2689349
daemon	cron
and restart the cron daemon

2689390
jobs	cron
if this is the case you may want to set up a few different cron jobs and do it in batches

2689390
rss	feed
don t scrape html when there is a json or rss feed you could use instead

2689408
int	double
compare this with for example - this is a pointer to a function that takes double as a parameter and returns int .

2689441
stdout	stderr
but i want stderr stdout redirected to a separate frame as is the feature of wx.app

2689464

cos-all-limited.1.2 an all model group must appear in a particle with min occurs max occurs 1 and that particle must be part of a pair which constitutes the content type of a complex type definition

2689598
portrait	landscape
basically the first view is portrait the second landscape the third portrait again yes i know this is less than ideal but that s the design and i ve got to implement it

2689598
portrait	landscape
if i pop the controller back to my portrait view which has an appropriate shouldautorotate... then that remains in broken landscape view until the device is returned to portrait orientation

2689628
folder	directory
i created a database with empty schema which i dropped in the root folder of the project and in properties i choosed build action embedded resources and copy to output directory copy always

2689914
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
operating system is linux ubuntu or centos if that would matter

2689916
hide	show
therefore parent.remove view2d and parent.add view3d is not really a solution and we have to call setvisible false and setvisible true on the jcomponent s that contain our 2d and 3d views in order to hide and show them

width	height
img border 0 src images header.jpg width 550 height 90

mdpi	hdpi	screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi
it s my understanding that designing three unique interfaces ldpi mdpi and hdpi would be the best way to go about supporting all the potential android screens with minimal scaling distortion

2691368
mdpi	hdpi
this post as well as a google search leads me to believe that ldpi is just 75 of the mdpi image and the hdpi is 150 of the mdpi image

alexdown s answer is quite right -- under 1.8 you need a one-row relation to do this like oracle s dual or the interbase firebird table

2692305

in my linux box ubuntu the destructor is called correctly

2692323
int	chars
the shortest code by chars count that will abbreviate an int no decimals

2692343

put	get
this is a little tricky since _##name will normally get you _name no matter what you put in

2692676
equals	gethashcode

2692770
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome but does not work in ie8

2692816
haskell	ocaml
i can t speak to ocaml but i d say that the main difficulty in haskell is that deserialization requires knowing the type in advance --there s no universal way to mechanically deserialize from a format figure out what the resulting value is and go from there as is possible in languages with unsound or dynamic type systems

2692829
put	get
i am building a restful data store and leveraging conditional get and put

2692829
put	get
during a conditional put the client can include the etag from a previous get on the resource and if the current representation doesn t match the server will return the http status code of 412 precondition failed

2692857
versioning	upgrade
if any of the plugins are still under development take this opportunity to upgrade to the latest versioning both for 1.4 support and because the latest versioning likely fixes bugs etc

2692886

punctuation	words
i would basically like to figure out if a words has a punctuation mark at the end and change the color for characters before the punctuation mark

2693037
inherited	properties
the hasownproperty method should be used to avoid iterating over inherited properties

2693107
tolower	toupper
and how tolower and toupper are implemented

2693107
tolower	toupper
the issue is that tolower and toupper don t create a new object but modify existing object

2693134
.when	each
i m using qt 4.6.2 .when i compile the project using macx-g++ meaning the g++ compiler it doesn t include the stdafx.h automatically for each header

2693139
linefeed	delimiter
i don t know of a way to specify more than one child delimiter with the flat file schema by itself but one possible solution could be to write a custom pipeline component for the decode stage of your receive pipeline to replace the crlfs with lfs then use linefeed as the delimiter on the flat file schema

2693143
agile	metrics
agile methodologies are rather prevalent these days but i cannot seem to find much documentation on what metrics are most useful and why

2693163
mouseup	mousedown
i can t comment on the prototype specifics but you could probably do this by creating an interval using setinterval that is started on mousedown and is stopped using .clearinterval on mouseup

2693172
for-loop	loops
in case 2 - since the variable is scoped only within the for-loop it cannot be accessed outside that loops

2693205
put	get	post	put	post	get
simple examples of controllers in a restful architecture suggest four actions per controller -- index create update delete -- corresponding with the get post put and delete

2693217
explode	substr
it looks like you could substr on the space then explode on the s and then be able to get each piece to work with

2693219
put	get
if your problem was that your resource contains the last-modified date and last-modified user and you had to do a get after every put then i would be more convinced of the need to twist the rules

2693227
getter	setter
for example a class with only getter and setter

2693247
mouseover	mousedown
it doesn t draw the mouseover or mousedown state and it doesn t support the indeterminate intermediate state

2693262
mouseup	mousedown
there is an event for when the mouse is down mousedown and one for when the mouse is up mouseup

2693284
post	get
it may be ok in your application to do so but consider that get post request are not the only places that data can be retrieved

2693311
uiview	subviews
i am adding a uilabel as a subviews to a uiview and sometime later i want to hide it

2693348

2693366
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest versioning of jquery

2693367

unchecked-exception fall into two categories those that extend runtimeexception and those that extend error

2693389
put	get	post	put	post	get
my controllers have methods get put post delete etc

2693395
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception runtimeexception are intended to deal with programming errors and other unexpected problems but should be caught and handled in the application

2693417
post	get
the database is adding it s row at the same time my post page runs it s query to get the id back i think

2693441
hide	show
i am trying to show hide a flash object based on click of button but the code is not working

2693447
extjs	mootools
you should use jquery mootools or extjs for something like this

2693448
bluetooth	usb
for what it s worth i ve noticed much bigger delays opening bluetooth virtual com ports than regular or usb ports

2693489
linefeed	delimiter
since linefeed and crlf both share the linefeed character i set the line delimiter as linefeed 0x0a

2693489
linefeed	delimiter
notice that since the linefeed and crlf delimiter have different lengths 1 and 2 characters respectively i had to do a couple more changes to the schema to ensure that both are handled correctly

2693489
linefeed	delimiter
however in order to still be able to handle the linefeed line delimiter make sure you set the allow early termination flag to true

2693516
hide	show
but i don t want to show hide the gif manually on every request too

2693526
google-chrome	firefox
results are identical in google-chrome and firefox

2693556
initializer	class-method
i collect a ton of these in my web service class and just initializer the web service class and let methods on this class call class-method on the results classes

2693564
integer	unsigned
then the compiler correctly decides i want a unsigned int there and generates an expensive call to a 16x16 bit integer multiply routine

2693564
integer	unsigned
as i read the integer promotions described in 6.3.1.1 the effect of the first line shall be as if foo and 10 were promoted to unsigned int the multiplication performed and the result stored as unsigned int in foo_u16

2693590
getter	setter
update of course if this conversion is only need for one field of one class it might be more simple to define a pair of alternative setter getter getfieldoneasstring setfieldoneasstring in your class and use in your mapping

2693606
ssl	https
generally ssl load balancing means that the client is talking to the load balancer over https and the load balancer is talking to the web server via http

2693620
int	chars
the promotion is guaranteed but the promotion is made to signed int type if the range of unsigned chars fits into the range of signed int

2693620
int	chars
if your compiler interprets it differently it could be a bug in the compiler again under the assumption that range of unsigned chars fits into the range of signed int

2693632
draggable	droppable
it gives offsets for the draggable element and the droppable element

2693632
draggable	droppable
and with a little math you can get the position of the draggable element relative to the top left corner of the droppable

2693655
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
my understanding is that since the variable is a local array the memory comes from the stack and does not need to be free and moreover since no malloc calloc realloc was used the behaviour is undefined

realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
malloc calloc or realloc

2693677
hash	salt
i can hard code the seed for the key iv which is hash with sha256 with a time stamp salt and then assigned as the key or iv in php source code that s on the server so that is pretty safe

2693681
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
you can only free something you got from malloc calloc or realloc function

2693740

allocate a 2d array of integers in the size of height width

2693790
put	get
now i like to get the content in out and put them into array

2693805
g++	gcc
ccache howtos have examples which suggest to create symlinks named gcc g++ etc and make sure they appear in path before the original gcc binaries so ccache is used instead

2693822
cout	cin
by the way since you appear to be using c++ or at least your choice of tags says so perhaps you should try std cin std cout

2693830
ostream	istream	cout	cin	std	ostream
if you are using c++ then using the c++ i o stream library std cin std cout std ostream std istream std fstream etc. is a far better way to perform input output than using these other functions

2693878
pull	push
for the sake of simplicity and interoperating with a less-capable system svn it is recommended that all git svn users clone fetch and dcommit directly from the svn server and avoid all git clone pull merge push operations between git repositories and branches

2693901
jquery	scriptaculous
if you were using either afterupdateelement in prototype scriptaculous or the result function in jquery this would be possible and a lot more straightforward

2693923
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for safari google-chrome and firefox you can use the css3 border-image

2693928
gtk	cairo
i answer myself cairo uses premultiplied color argb and gtk only it s able to manage true color rgba

2693938
filesystems	ntfs
you won t get true filesystems transactions for ntfs in xp

2693976
ant	maven
basically maven and the jdk but if you are using any other maven plugins like nsis or ant then you need to archive those as well

2694001
uiview	subviews
i have following problem i generate subviews uiview in an uiscrollview including uiimageviews

2694010
voip	sip
starting with 4.0 of course you can build it asset tracking services gps logging corporate messaging think microsoft office communicator for iphone etc. regulatory compliance monitoring order notifications custom sip h.323 endpoint for a voip switch etc

2694027
int	double
here sum s call to sum_helper is not a tail call because sum_helper returns a double and sum will need to convert that into an int

2694195
post	get
the moment i get to the 5 post the first item i had selected is dropped

2694207
websphere	ibm
ibm - mqc7 websphere mq v7.0 clients

2694230
qiodevice	qdatastream
if the contents of msnlogfile are strictly text you need to pass the qiodevice text flag to open and use qiodevice readline or qiodevice readall however if it s binary data you d have to use qdatastream readrawdata and read the data back out in the correct order with correct sizes

2694237
thin	webrick
webrick apache mongrel thin etc.

2694243
width	height
this div is a fixed height but uses a scrollbar for its variable width

the scrollbar resets perfectly fine in google-chrome safari and ie8

2694299
postgresql	mysql
in other words is mysql better or worse than postgresql to handle unicode etc

2694323
pull	push
to tell git to associate your master and the remote master branch so that when you just type git pull or git push with master checked out it ll assume you meant origin s master

2694327
children	parent
however they most certainly were present in the database and caused fk exceptions as hibernate tried to delete only the parent without first deleting its children which you ve likely also encountered with the nonnull in place

2694406
mouseleave	mouseenter
i have attached mouseenter and mouseleave events to it to show a menu connected to the element using prototype

2694445
initializer	class-method
specific answer class-method are loaded at load time and are always available to your application the code overhead for loading them via a class initializer is minimal compared to the large amount of work you describe

2694511
postgresql	mysql
in my experience both mysql and postgresql handled unicode quite okay

2694574
ireport	subreports
the code in the ireport xml datasource subreports tutorial is broken

2694591
comparator	comparable
it uses the comparator or comparable instead

2694594
equals	gethashcode
the base-type is the obvious choice but i wonder if it isn t more appropriate to just override equals and gethashcode

2694598
hash	salt
you should rewrite this with mysqli or pdo and using a newer hash function as well as a salt

2694601
google-chrome	firefox
i don t have this issue in firefox 3.6.3 or google-chrome 4.1.249.1059

2694613
portrait	landscape
i have successfully implemented everything i need in terms of layout so that full landscape functionality is now supported in my app previously i primarily used portrait mode to display content

2694658
equals	compareto
the compareto method claims two instances are equals if the hash code happens to match could be a difficult error to catch without code review

2694671
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
so i figure out how high the row is going to be based on the string width and the width of the cell and then compare that with the room left on the page based on the current y position the page height and the bottom margin

2694727
put	get
i have two system.windows.media.color a and b and need to get a and put over b to simulate tranparency

2694741
hide	show
even using hide show doesn t work in ie6 7

2694784
hide	show
2 you have 1 nib for your vc and just hide show elements using the hidden property of uiview and its subclasses

2694784
superclass	subclassing
there is a nib for normal mode a nib for edit mode and each mode has a vc that subclassing a common superclass

2694831
equals	gethashcode
i m interested to see how equals and gethashcode are used collectively when storing and retrieving items

2694836
folder	directory
where projectbinfiles is an item representing the files in the bin directory in the source directory and stagebin is a property representing the bin folder in the published site s directory

2694900
gitignore	hgignore
i m spoiled by gitignore and hgignore which i just copy to a repository and then use git commit -a without having to care about checking in junk

2694945
config	ini
you ll need to know where your config ini file is and load your app

2694958
inherited	subclassing
ishynum is an old-style class because it doesn t inherited object or one of its subclassing

you re using this- name out in the public context but it s still constructed in the class and if it s protected it won t be overwritten

2695133
quicksort	mergesort
to analyze quicksort and mergesort requires a decent level of what is known as mathematical sophistication

2695186
ftp	smb
smb ftp http webdav

2695200
boost	stl
the downside to precompiling is that you can only have one pre-compiled header per project so people tend to make a single precompiled.h or stdafx.h and include windows.h boost stl and everything else they need in there

2695202
width	height
if you have an html of a certain width and height set in css if there are more values then you can possibly fit in that height then the browser adds a vertical scroll bar

2695228
cvs	svn
i was able to create two separate cvs dump files and when i used svnadmin to load then into svn repository i wasn t able to keep the structure i had in cvs

2695235
youtube	vimeo
that s what most people doing hd video in flash use eg youtube vimeo etc

2695280
implements	extends
use extends solid line closed unfilled arrowhead which is consistent with how java uses the extends and implements keywords

2695282
hide	show
and of course there is still another method use some javascript code to show hide specific parts of the page depending on the browser detected from that javascript code

2695293
width	height
for other browsers you may also need to set the wrapper div s height and width to be equal to the object s height and width

2695303
ant	maven
in the java world there are two main methods of packaging and deploying web apps ant and maven

2695305
width	height
your best shot would probably be to listen for flash.events.fullscreenevent.full_screen and when that occurs force a reset of the width and height of the video object

2695332
maven	m2e
at the time of writing the m2e plugin has and always has had a very nasty bug where it generates its own version of the application.xml descriptor file rather than use the one maven would otherwise create

2695332
maven	m2e
what s worse you cannot remove it to be replaced with maven s version as it keeps getting regenerated by m2e

2695353
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
ie6+ firefox 3.5+ google-chrome safari 3.1+ opera

2695383
rsa	aes
also if you store the password in a recoverable format as in a block cipher like aes or stream cipher like rc4 or an asymmetric cipher like rsa then you are in clear violation of cwe-257

2695406
inherited	properties
class movable inherited from renderable and also has properties such as x y z and functions like move

2695424
portrait	landscape
instead just create a normal view put a table view on its left side your detail view on the right side and then set the autosizing stuff appropriately so that everything looks right in both portrait and landscape

2695436
richfaces	icefaces
talking about jsf there exist several rich ui component libraries which can be used on top of jsf such as richfaces showcase here and icefaces showcase here

2695507
children	parent	google-chrome	firefox
this works just as it should in firefox google-chrome ie8 - but ie7 will not expand the parent element along with its children

2695509
int	chars
everything in a file is binary a chars an int etc

2695538
sorting	filtering
i have an index view for example that has ui elements for sorting filtering and pagination via will_paginate

2695569
int	chars
the reason a number is showing up as garbage in notepad is because your saving an int value - saving ascii code 0-9 which have funky chars associated with them

2695594
haskell	ocaml
a lot of people misunderstand javascript possibly because its syntax looks like most other programming languages where lisp haskell ocaml look completely different

2695610
profiling	instrumentation
it could be indeed something related to profiling to instrumentation the code

2695614
division	subtract
if you re using any of these algorithms and you need to do division also don t forget to make sure that you subtract 1 when appropriate

2695639
portrait	landscape
when the text field is being edited the keyboard is visible and i rotate the device from portrait to landscape and then try to scroll the table view it keeps going past its bounds instead of stopping and bouncing

2695649
superclass	subclassing
tags declared in the superclass will be available in subclassing without having to be redeclared

2695705
boost	stl
everything else you mentioned boost libraries stl etc can be easily discovered while self-educating but good and rational design is much harder to learn

2695706
min	max
i say if you need to run sql queries to calculate things like min max avg or to perform sorting restrictions or joins based on the values then you should create the 100+ columns

2695708
width	height
i ve read all over the internet that i should not define fonts or anything with absolute pixel height width size and instead use em .

2695708
width	height
however what do i use to define image height width .

2695729
ant	maven
perhaps you need to think more like ant and less like maven in this case

2695759
std	ostream
you have using std ofstream instead of using std ostream so it doesn t know what ostream is

2695774
put	get
put that in change the friend declaration to and get rid of all the using stuff since it s bad form to put using in a header and you should be okay

2695789
toupper	uppercase
you should use toupper function from character unit to uppercase unicode strings

2695835
addeventlistener	onload
it s usually a better idea to register an event using addeventlistener or attachevent methods than the onload onsomething property because it will not possibly disrupt any other javascript code from the same page

2695841
width	height
i have a scrollview width 320px height 100px on my uiview inside it i add 10 images with width 106.5px each

2695852
many-to-many	one-to-many
use many_many relationship type to setup many to many connection between models an associative table is needed to break a many-to-many relationship into one-to-many relationships

2695855
folder	directory
when compiling running the server the files under that directory get compiled into the project s target folder together with all other groovy grails classes

2695855
folder	dir
is there a way to force grails to copy certain classfiles from target folder into the resources folder within the user dir

2695956
vim	emacs
most ide editors pale in comparison to the like of vim or emacs

2695956
vim	emacs
and of course debugger integration and project management and the like aren t going to work as well in vim or emacs because they re not full-blown ides though you can do a lot of that stuff with them

2695956
vim	emacs
but often the power of vim or emacs overshadows whatever the ide has over them

2695956
vim	emacs
of course it would be great if you could combine all of the great features of vim or emacs with a full-blown ide - and there are some attempts to do so - but there are always problems with it and even the best attempts are far from perfect

2695956
vim	emacs
so you re often still stuck with the choice of vim or emacs and the features that they bring or an ide with the features that it brings

2695956
vim	emacs
edit going into why vim or emacs is far more powerful in many respects than your typical ide could get quite lengthy and there are already several questions on so which cover that

2695956
mouse	keyboard
you type in text and use your mouse to navigate around which while sometimes quite useful it can be quite a bit slower than just using your keyboard

2695956
vim	emacs
they might add some useful features like ctrl-d to delete a line but what they add is generally very limited compared to what you d get in vim or emacs

2695956
vim	emacs
they have many other programming-specific and language-specific features which vim and emacs either lack or in which they are much harder to get to work - such as good context-sensitive code completion refactoring tools project management etc

2696082
int	double
you can use std pow but with double or you can do a lot of casting to make it work with int

2696086
uilabel	uitextview
i have an nsmutablearray of custom views that are pretty much 1 uitextview and 1 uilabel with a custom back ground image these are created as they are need i start with 2 though the first one is only 2 uitextfields and the other is normal of these

2696125
decoder	encoder
there are five .py files in the module s directory __init__ two leading and trailing underscores it s formatting as bold decoder encoder scanner and tool

2696129
put	get
the problem is that i can t work out how to pass around a var data type and keep it strongly typed and if i try to put it in my own class eg i get errors when i try to add later where clauses because my class has no translations into sql

2696173
pow	sqrt
in python 2.6 the float .__pow__ function uses the c pow function and the math.sqrt functions uses the c sqrt function

2696173
pow	sqrt
for example calling c pow x 0.5 simply calls the sqrt function

2696174
post	get
it works fine when a small amount of data is posted but if i post data larger then approx 29mb i get a asp.net 404 error

2696179
cgpoint	cgrect
there are similar cgpoint and cgrect functions as well

2696237
rdf	owl
i want to create a simple application using jena and sparql that inserts deletes updates and queries some owl rdf data

2696315
uilabel	uibutton
i usually do not make properties or even have members for views that will live in the view hierarchy unless i need to manipulate them for example changing the text of a uilabel or the state of a uibutton

2696317
inherited	properties
iterates over inherited user-defined properties in addition to the array elements if you use a library like mootools for example which extend the array.prototype object you will see all those extended properties

2696351
post	get
you re doing a post request however your browser will be doing a get request

2696369
floating-point	integer
for example the compiler guarantees not to use integer arithmetic instructions on floating-point numbers

2696402
super	implements
i implements it with ctypes but it s super slow in comparison to the native versions

2696431
sip	sdp
a lot of sip proxy s are forced to mangle the ip addresses in sdp when user agents put private ip addresses in them

2696472
getter	setter
the common way to differentiate between getter and setter is by the const-ness of the object

2696498
hash	salt
yes store your users passwords as salt hash

2696508
mouseup	mousedown
change the click handler to mousedown and mouseup for swapping images

2696557
post	get
i have been developing an asp.net mvc application where i need to make large amounts of jquery post and get request to call controller methods and get back json result

2696557
post	get
the problem is i had to write different jquery post and get request url on local intranet deployed by making virtual directory and live server

2696560
equals	gethashcode
for .net 2.0 you could implement equals and gethashcode for your class but this might give undesirable behaviour in other situations where you don t want two player objects to compare equals if they have the same name but differ in other fields

2696608
getter	setter
get and set are getter and setter for the property so when ever you call this property the value returned by return in your get is what you get

2696608
getter	setter
when ever you dont want to directly expose any variable private you can make property of it using varable names in getter and setter otherwise mere get

2696621
nsurl	nsdata
in either case the url paramter is an nsurl instance not an nsdata instance

2696628
equals	gethashcode
assuming you are using the system.collections.generic.list class if the cplayer class does not implement it will use the equals and gethashcode functions of the cplayer class to check if the list has a member that equals the argument of contains

2696631
width	height
try adding some view inside frame layout or give some fix height and width to it

2696661
polymorphism	specialization
polymorphism on the other hand is when you can abstract out a specialization

2696677
post	get
if i call any blog post say by it s title from a queryset how can i get the entry before and after the post in it s published order

2696696
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval repeats the call settimeout only runs it once

2696700
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval fires again and again in intervals while settimeout only fires once

2696701
terminate	timeout
basically my application is forced to crash and burn failing remote procedure calls and eventually being forced to terminate by the operating system after a timeout period has elapsed seems to be on the order of 20-30 seconds

2696705
opera	firefox
your code running ok on my firefox 3.7 opera 10 and ie6 but you could try different approach by using dom functions

2696716
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
ie google-chrome safari opera etc

2696717
allocator	stl
with two pointers per node stl list is doubly-linked the overhead is 200 or 400 on 64-bit platform not counting the overhead of the default allocator

2696770
hide	show
the reason i needed to hide items is because when updated they might be show to the user rather then refilling the listbox and interrogating the telephone center again

2696774
postgresql	mysql
can access postgresql and mysql databases

2696776
width	height
mostly i have problems with grid width but in some cases on ie6 also with the height

2696799
width	height
sum up all the width height of the tiles create a new bufferediage get the graphics object from it and do g.drawimage tile1 xoffset yoffset g.drawimage tile2 xoffset2 yoffset2 and so on

2696819
int	double
when using compound assignment operators on variables of type int ensure that the expression on the right-hand side is not of type long float or double

2696841
cpu	processors
several cpu architectures have multiple stack pointers - even lowly 8-bit processors such as the m6809

2696844
weka	orange
orange and weka already included naive bayes knn.

2696876
min	max
if they overlap then the left edge of overlap-rect will be the max r1.x1 r2.x1 and right edge will be min r1.x2 r2.x2

2696876
min	max
so the area will be area max r1.x1 r2.x1 - min r1.x2 r2.x2 max r1.y1 r2.y1 - min r1.y2 r2.y2

2696921
rss	feed
you need to do this through vbscript and load in the seperate urls and read the rss in an the set the three crawls to the feed you should be able to have as many crawls as you like it just means the vbscript will be quite large

2696971
int	chars
chars int len -1

2696992
postgresql	mysql
openoffice base can use odbc to connect to almost anything including postgresql and mysql

2697049
rss	feed
the dog types is extracted from an rss feed and so the image in the table cell needs to match the each cell s dog types tag

2697049
uitableview	nsindexpath
and under - uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

2697070
post	get
you might want to read this blog post get your func on

2697107
width	height
update as the answers point out adding width or height to the

2697118
post	get
basically when you do ajax post you can get the user s id using

2697132
width	height
ok i have tried something like this and when i inspect the elements using firebug height and width attribute is there withe right values..

2697143
width	height
yes you can you can use the width and height methods to get the dimensions of the images

2697143
width	height
the load even is fired when all images and external resources have loaded into the page along with the dom so you can use that and use the width and height methods to get the dimensions of the images

2697206
equals	gethashcode
looking at the .net sources reflector ftw i can see that seemingly only the hasttable class uses gethashcode to improve it s performance instead of using equals to compare objects every single time

2697237
onclick	onsubmit
also you should avoid onsubmit onclick in favor of addeventlistener or better yet a nice javascript library like jquery

2697257
multiplying	add
instead of taking the two hours to print plus the amount of time it takes to open the tar archive see if the files are out of date and add them to the archive you are actually multiplying those times together

2697263
boost	allocator
different solutions have come up in time and most of them require dynamic allocator of the actual datum boost variant can avoid using dynamically allocated memory for small objects --thanks msalters

2697266
addition	multiplication
here is some code which demonstrates addition and multiplication

2697297
width	height
load the images via ajax in the background and hope for the browser to cache them so that they are instantly there when you add the elements to your div and you can retrieve width and height immediately

2697308
inherited	properties
it looks like your c class doesn t work because it s inner b class inherited from a s b properties object

2697334
listview	gridview
listview or gridview

2697378
rss	feed
those are available as rss feed

2697378
rss	feed
as a sidenote downloading several rss feed each time you want to display your resulting page is not a good idea it will slow your site down a lot -- which means you need to put some caching mecanism in place

2697456
google-chrome	firefox
when i edit and save using google-chrome firefox seems to not understand the above way of formatting

2697502
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox

2697508
versioning	upgrade
i m trying to upgrade our company s 4.1.22 versioning of mysql to 5

2697514
inherited	properties
if this is the case then you need to understand that this is overriding the datacontext inherited from the parent and the listdetails properties now refers to the tasklistcontrol datacontext and not to the datatemplate s datacontext anymore

2697518
portrait	landscape
i created few labels on landscape mode but my application works on portrait

2697531

2697549
implements	extends
i ve implements a class extends date in java to represent that in classic date format

2697607
boost	allocator
the idea is that if i want to switch between boost interprocess several different options for shared memory and allocator i just modify the typedefs

2697692
multiplying	addition	multiplying	multiplication	addition	multiplication
a transformation is nothing more than a matrix multiplying a vector to produce the transformed vector so if you don t understand matrix multiplication and addition you can t get very far

2697698
accessor	properties
events are accessor for a delegate just like a properties is an accessor for a field

2697703
sorting	grouping
you would be sorting around 20 200 10 million 2 20 billion grouping id pairs each grouping of 20 users times the number of grouping each user is in 2

2697734
uiview	subviews
you probably could set up some kind of master-touch-controller in the container uiview that finds out what is happening and then calls certain methods of its subviews forwards the events

2697747
width	height
if you will try do this on the wrong place either your changes will not working or you ll have to fix height or width of some jqgrid components see correctly calling setgridwidth on a jqgrid inside a jqueryui dialog

getter	setter
i normally use getter and setter methods on my objects and i am fine with testing them as mock objects in simpletest by manipulating them with code like

2697915
outputstream	inputstream
so you could write an inputstream and outputstream yourself to perform some trivial translation on the bytes of the zip file

2697938
getter	setter
my ide is not able to show me hints for magic setter and getter

2697938

finally as mentioned in another answer if you have a lot of third party libraries to install for your project that don t exist in other repositories you might want to install a repository manager like nexus artifactory or archiva which will allow you to perform the install commands you mentioned through a web-based interface

2698470
onmousedown	onmouseup
the onmousedown and onmouseup would normally be on the image instead of the document but since i don t have any kind of handle you just end up dragging the image itself in safari anyway

2698477
agile	metrics
as for question 1 i don t see any reason those metrics would be bad in an agile process

2698491
equals	gethashcode
note if you redeclare the equals methods this way 1 you ll need to check the classes of the objects you get passed since you can t guarantee they re cars or persons anymore and 2 you ll probably want to override gethashcode as well especially if you decide to make them both equals object cause gethashcode should return equals hash codes for two objects that are equals

2698523
mouseover	mouseout
when the menu is hiding onmouseenter or mouseover it shows onmouseleave or mouseout

2698554

the advantage of getting familiar with stl and boost is that they are a good source to learn about templates and meta-programming in c++ which in turn can be used in devising better designs

2698935
for-loop	loops
i m reading an ebook on php right now and the author noted that the difference between a while loops and a for-loop is that the for-loop will count how many times it runs

2698958
for-loop	loops
if you use the while loops people are going to wonder why you didn t use a for-loop

2698984
min	max
if you want to limit to 15 chars as you mentioned in a comment you can use to delimit a min and a max lenght

2699003

2699205
put	get
and all you have to do is return old image once you get response from server same way as you put the loading.gif

2699291
put	get
the classic way to trigger this bug is to put bush hid the facts in a file save it reopen it and scream about conspiracy theories but i guess 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 works too except that you don t get to scream about conspiracy theories

2699318
disk	ram
the only choice i could think about is changing the wrapper class and point the temp file to ram disk which bring this problem up

it would seem that the interval accepted data type is double however if you set a value bigger that an int to the interval and call start it throws a exception

2699569
dictionary	map
std map though is actually implemented in a way that many operations are slower than dictionary as its size gets large

2699569
dictionary	map
for suitably large examples of each dictionary overcomes the constant factor by which it s slower than std map and will actually do operations like lookup insertion etc

2699569
dictionary	map
i definitely wouldn t try introducing a new general-purpose type for use in python based on std map which has worse algorithmic complexity in time for many important operations andâ in at least some implementationsâ leaves some optimisations to the user that dictionary already has

2699609
min	max
snowsize min + int max rand rand_max + 1.0

2699628

2699656
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
note a runtimeexception is an unchecked-exception

2699656

i ve gone through several iterations too many to post and all i get is a blank div.

2699834
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception runtimeexception on the other hand are used whenever an exception could be expected somehow but there is no reasonable way to deal with it then and thus a try catch statement would be just annoying and a waste of space

2699854

but it s often not a problem especially when dealing with get post parameters

2700131
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
the unchecked-exception classes are the class runtimeexception and its subclasses and the class error and its subclasses

2700131
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
to summarize runtimeexception are a subset of unchecked-exception for exceptions from which recovery is possible but unchecked-exception is not a synonym of runtimeexception as many are answering here

2700182
int	chars
when the compiler passes that value to printf it promotes the signed chars value to type int and it retains its negativity

2700208
int	chars
when the chars 0xda is promoted to int to pass to printf the compiler is doing a sign-extension converting it to 0xffffffda which is the 32-bit representation of -38

2700208
integer	unsigned
signed integer types are widened by sign-extending and unsigned integer types are widened by zero-extending

2700417
boost	stl
that seem so specific that i can t see how it would get in stl or boost

2700492
inherited	properties
extension methods are a great way to simulate multiple inherited in c# though there are no extension properties maybe someday says eric lippert

2700543
rvm	bundler
ryan bates also has some great railscasts on rvm and bundler

2700609

like i said in my comment on marcus post you should put a try catch around the call to the function itself to ensure that any other exceptions are being caught

2700948
phpunit	simpletest
as for the choice between simpletest and phpunit check out my recent question about phpunit vs

2700948
phpunit	simpletest
simpletest - the answers to that question notably gordon s managed to convince me of phpunit

2700961
for-loop	loops
i still remember when first learning about the for-loop in c the mental effort that had to go into understanding the execution sequence of the three control expressions relative to loops statement

2701004
hide	show
only in firefox when i click the a href link to hide show the div firefox display a dotted border around the href link which i don t understand why and it shouldn t be

2701045
uiview	uiwindow
as techzen mentioned the code is trying to send a uiwindow message to a uiview which does not have the method

2701045
uiview	uiwindow
here window was used separately by the main application as a uiwindow and window was also being used by wpgamestate as its viewport a uiview causing ambiguity within the frameworks

2701092
inherited	properties
the problem i m running in to is i am wanting to have a single base class that all my properties classes inherited from so that i can store them all together

2701092
inherited	properties
so my problem is i cant figure out how to implement a properties structure so that i can have them all inherited from some base type but code like what i have above would throw a compile time error

2701092
min	max
if i want to get the max and min values of a property given its string name i have methods that are completely generic that will pull out the associated abstactproperty from each element and find the max min no matter what the type is

2701095
getter	setter
that s why java has getter setter

2701095
getter	setter
the java getter setter equivalent would be

2701108
getter	setter
nope you would use getter and setter methods instead

2701112
jar	manifest.mf
recently logback and other logging frameworks have had added code that adds jar versions to stacktraces based on information in manifest.mf which is very helpful in reproducing bugs

2701132
google-chrome	firefox
non ie browsers that we have tested firefox google-chrome do not exhibit this behavior

2701136
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
the java idiom is to use mutators accessor getter setter

2701179
put	get
by the way to get data into a template field similar to what asp.net would put there you just add

2701181
rtos	ecos
so if deterministic and fast response to external events is a requirement you ll need an rtos such as ecos

2701194
button	checkbox
button is positioned below checkbox

2701271
pop-up	dialog
a layered panel is not a window but has the appearance of a pop-up or dialog box

2701297
getter	setter
i don t really like getter and setter but i accept them as part of the java conventions

2701299
mouse	keyboard
load the page and reproduce the behavior by the following -- note that this is all done using the keyboard no mouse clicks

2701361
google-chrome	firefox
there are many options out there but your best bet is to write your tests with firefox firebug or google-chrome

2701397
decoder	encoder
asn.1 would be ideally for me but its implementation in python cannot generate encoder decoder out from notation

2701422
mouse	keyboard
it also aims to minimize the number of mouse clicks necessary to select a date and or time and provides wai-aria keyboard accessibility for users without a mouse

2701427
inherited	properties
i guess the ideal situation would be to inherited from some kind of class that wouldn t even have the text properties defined but that d have position size etc properties available

2701433
firefox	safari
after some more work on this i figured out that it worked in firefox and safari

2701443
postgresql	mysql
i came from the web-app web 2.0 crowd who normally hear news about mysql postgresql or even key-value column-oriented storage solution

2701462
superclass	subclassing
this is implicit and does not need a hard cast because java knows that everything the superclass can do the subclassing can do as well

2701462
superclass	subclassing
the reason for this is because the subclassing could have some weird methods that the superclass doesn t have

2701462
superclass	subclassing
in general if you want to instantiate a class to call something in its subclassing you should probably just instantiate the subclassing to begin with -- or determine if the method should be in the superclass as well

2701541
pop-up	dialog
one more thing the form itself is also in an iframe as part of a pop-up modal dialog like a jquery ui dialog only slightly different

2701541
google-chrome	firefox
i see the same behavior in both firefox 3.6 and google-chrome so it s got to be my problem and not a browser quirk well at least that s what i think to be true

2701553
hide	show
the sec div hide and show properly but a radio button is never selected

2701556
junit	testng
in our case we were happy with web driver and setup method of junit for us so we didn t move to testng

post	get
if anyone can post anything relevant to the user name placed into the report server db and how that relates to sharepoint integrated mode you ll get the bounty

2701588
daemons	systemd
everyone already thinks this way this is why my tiny linux systemd with only 10 daemons will never be secure because i can t be bothered to go find all the insecure by default things and fix them

2701638
apache	nginx
where 8888 is what apache is listening on nginx s 80 - localhost 8888

2701679
unix	solaris
i got the same problem in a unix solaris

2701680
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
a little mousedown mousemove and mouseup logic on the usercontrol itself will let you easily move the splitter left and right and the two panels will properly block this everywhere but over the splitter so your logic for checking if the mouse if over the splitter is as simple as can be

2701700
super	extends
replace extends by super

2701719
width	margin
if you know the width you can set the position and then back the margin off

i have llvm bitcode files manually generated that i linked together with llvm-link i also have a library written in c compiled into bitcode by clang and archived with llvm-ar

2701981
hash	md5
don t use md5 it s just not a very secure hash

2701981
hash	salt
don t just hash the password you ll want to salt it too

2701981
hash	salt
as for generating the password i think you are on the right track - i would just generate it when they create their account email it to them then hash it and store the hash and a random salt on the user record in the db

2702001
screens	mdpi
if your app does not say it supports densities then android will run in compatibility mode where it makes the screens look like an mdpi screens scaling all coordinates and drawing to match the real screens density

2702001
screens	hdpi
running in an hdpi screens like droid this is a 1.5x scaling so every other pixel will be mapped to two pixels on the screens

2702038
vbscript	jscript
you may consider switching from vbscript to jscript jscript is what microsoft calls javascript

2702038
vbscript	jscript
note that you don t have to quit vbscript cold-turkey you can still interoperate between the two in the same asp file but if you declare jscript first you need to confine your vbscript to sub or functions and vice-versa otherwise unpredictable things can happen

2702427
post	get
get your post into a variable in this case and then just remove the first 30 words

2702435
getter	setter
you re coming from a java background where one of the basic rules is always to use getter and setter methods rather than let users access attributes

2702435
getter	setter
since in python we have properties we would not need an api change in that instance so we can safely avoid the boilerplate and cruft of setter and getter

2702445
anjuta	gedit	anjuta	kdevelop	gedit	kdevelop
i personally use xcode on mac os x gedit or anjuta or kdevelop on linux and code blocks on windows

the above code create the div sets some html for it using html and hide it initially on because later you want to show it

2702493
printf	strtod
if you re really concerned with portability i m not sure that there s any better option than using printf and strtod and assuming that you may not necessarily have any more accuracy than the absolute minimum required by he relevant specification section 5.2.4.2.2 of the c99 spec.

2702499
width	height
using containercontroller.getcontentbounds returns me size of whole sprite of the letter with ascent descent empty parts not the height width of the actual rendered letter

2702526
ia-32	x86
for x86 processors see intelâ 64 and ia-32 architectures optimization reference manual probably appendix c

2702582
nsurl	nsstring
the second line fails because datawithcontentsofurl expects to be given a pointer to an nsurl object and while you re passing it a pointer that you ve typed url is actually pointing to an nsstring object

2702599
pop-up	dialog
i m going to assume that the browser should pop-up a small dialog asking for credentials

listview	gridview
if you are using a gridview or a listview etc and are producing views to populate them via the adapter getview pos convertview viewgroup you might encounter confusion i did once

2702891
width	height
you ll need some sort of javascript on the client-side set up to pass back the height and width to the server through querystring parameters cookies hiddeninput etc. so that on your next page load you ll have those parameters on the server side

2702891
width	height
this would redirect you for example to and then you could pull out the height 1240 and width 300 parameters in php fairly easily

2702891
width	height
despite being called window height width you will actually be getting the height and width of the browser viewport

2702891
width	height
it might be annoying for clients to have to go through a redirect like that but there is no way to know what the client s height width are on the first http request you receive on your server

2702893
crypt	md5
it should not over-rely on built-in libraries md5 crypt etc - because i want to benchmark the quality of the php-to-scala conversion not the quality of the library implementation

2702920

each one of those objects could potentially have an array of errors and i d like to get just the unique message out of them and put them in another array say called error_arr

2702983
nfa	dfa
if we do then how do we come to know that which regular expression is accepted by nfa dfa so that we can begin with the answer

2703026
nfa	dfa
if you are asked to show that some language is not accepted by a dfa nfa you almost always have to apply the pumping lemma which is used exactly for that purpose

2703034
nfa	dfa
nfas and dfas accept equivalent regular languages so one way to show that a language is regular is to create an nfa or dfa for it

2703057
touchesbegan	touchesended
i suppose you could simulate the touches by calling the touchesbegan touchesended methods directly on the uiview check the uiresponder class

2703098
google-chrome	firefox
this jquery statement works in recent versions of firefox and google-chrome but throws an error in ie 8

2703114

the following code works for me on firefox mac windows safari mac windows and ie8 windows of course

2703304
google-chrome	firefox
btw this is for a google-chrome firefox extension so ie compatibility does not matter

2703304

ended up using tostring because getter don t allow me to redefine the whole attribute a function must be associated with it

2703314
firefox	safari
the below code works in firefox mac windows safari mac windows and ie8

2703333
getter	setter

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
how to get this work in all browser firefox safari google-chrome and ie 6 7 8

2703347
accessor	properties
using a function is your best option for now however the new javascript standard ecmascript 5th ed. which is being implemented now by all major browser vendors gives you a method to create accessor properties where you can define a properties with a get and set functions that will be internally called without worrying to treat this properties as functions

2703352
getter	setter
see john resig s post javascript getter and setter and the defining getter and setter page at the mozilla developer centre for more information

2703354
minimum	max	min	max
the syntax is where min is a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

if you do need it as an ivar use an atomic properties and locks and only access it through accessor

2703428
cpython	pypy
just keep in mind most of the time c is faster than python but then again most of the time pypy is faster than cpython

2703437
drive	createfile
drive using the createfile

2703437
drive	createfile
you can use the createfile function to open a physical disk drive or a volume

2703444
width	height
then we go through some css gymnastics to get the width height position correct

2703445
width	height
the best approach is to change the frame height width and positions when the orientation changes

2703448
vim	emacs
a slightly tougher choice might be emacs again using the same approach as with vim

2703518
hide	show
if it needed you can makes div with jqgrid sometimes visitable and sometimes invisible using using hide and show jquery functions

2703585
vb.net	vb6
ever since i moved from vb6 to vb.net somewhere in 2005 i ve been using ctype to do casting from one data type to another

i want it to be such that the children are 100 width and height of the remaining space after padding is calculated not before

2703668
profiling	debugging
pragma error and message are very handy especially inside conditional compliation blocks error the release for ephone build is unimplemented message extra debugging and profiling code is enabled in this build

2703732
webclient	httpwebrequest
i don t know enough about vb.net yet to use the richer httpwebrequest class so i figured i d use the simpler webclient class to download web pages asynchronously to avoid freezing the ui

2703759
setinterval	settimeout
in example dividing all work into small pieces and then running them sequentially with some delay using settimeout or setinterval between each task

2703796

2703803
children	parent
i want to replace tag with tag but not replacing all the children elements just the parent

2703815
pull	push
if you later improve the skeleton and push changes to it you can work them into an existing project with git pull myserver skeleton and then merging

2703823
children	parent
note that this actually removes the parent element and inserts a new one so all details such as event handlers and data will be lost on the parent but is preserved on the children

2703858
post	get
this is a commonly pattern in asp.net mvc applications one action accessible through get that renders a view containing a form and a second action that this form will post to

2703873
width	height
i want it to be such that the children are 100 width and height of the remaining space after padding is calculated not before

2703873
width	height

2703884
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
so i am messing around with simple layouts here and they work fine in my latest versions of firefox safari google-chrome and opera but ie6 is basically saying

2703884
width	height
if you haven t set a width or height on me i m assuming it s zero

hide	show
i want to show or hide some elements textviews and edittexts with checkbox

2704039
implements	extends
for making this instead of developing from scratch my own sorted list i would implements the queue interface or extends the already existing priorityqueue or any other sorted collection that may apply better

2704039
comparator	comparable
i would define the node class as an implementation of the comparable interface or instantiate my queue with a comparator instance and override the priorityqueue add method to add the new node only if another object is not already in the queue incrementing the counter otherwise

2704087
google-chrome	firefox
and b somebody must have figured out how to install google-chrome or firefox on ancient versions of windows by now

2704088
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
web applications on iphone android or even certain desktop browsers some recent versions of firefox google-chrome and opera use the w3c geolocation api to request your location

2704108
post	get
you will need post because get is usually limited in size to 1-2 kilobytes

2704113
versioning	upgrade
check your local git versioning and upgrade to the latest one

i m using lots of c++0x in particular variadic templates and functions auto and decltype and rvalue references

2704305
try-catch	exception-handling
and for last use try-catch and handle exception-handling throw by service

2704343
width	height
i d assign a width height to the if you use the method above to prevent this behavior or to the image if you use your current method

2704394
int	chars
for example a shirt might give +4 to the chars s int and +2 stamina while at the same time a pair of pants may have +7 strength and nothing else

2704394
int	chars
so let s say that a chars has a healthy choice of armor to use 5 pairs of pants 5 pairs of gloves etc. we ve designated that int and perception are the most important stats for this chars

2704438
sorting	filtering
since i am using the filtering below my sorting is not functioning the way i want it to

2704527
multiplying	modulo
i get the concept but in an example they provide a polynomial which we will represent as the array has an inverse g of so that when we multiplying them and reduce the result modulo 3 we get 1 however when i use the ntru algorithm for multiplying and reducing them i get -2

2704537
google-chrome	firefox
when i use firefox or google-chrome i get the result i want but when i use internet explorer 8 even if i use td style height 100 the height of the nested cell depends on it s content

2704563
public	protected
... the second rule is that members inherited from a private base class become private members of the derived class even if they were protected or public in the base class

2704591
profiling	instrumentation
as your performance test environment will never be perfect you should have sufficient instrumentation monitoring that you can measure performance and profiling your app in production

2704689
bash	zsh
i do not know how it is in bash but in zsh you can define preexec and precmd functions so that they save the current time to variables preexec and precmd so you will be able to find the approximate running time

2704733
let	curry
in the curry computation you can use let

2704748
folder	directory
i d like to clean up some directory after my script runs by deleting certain folder and files from the current directory if they exist

2704757
cout	cin
following which cout will not necessarily be flushed before input is performed on cin

2704774
lisp	scheme
metacircular lisp and scheme implementations usually assume the existence of some basic primitive special forms which then have to be implemented in assembler c or a limited subset of the language in a low-level style

2704791
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu release karmic kernel linux

2704792
stdout	fflush
as soon as your scanf will grab the stdin this will lock that buffer also preventing the stdout of your other thread to fflush its data to the screen

2704824
filtering	grouping
now iâ d like to give these two grouping in some cases same rights with before filtering

2704828
google-chrome	firefox
but i noticed one thing checking the console messages in firefox and google-chrome i saw that the script gets executed multiple times in firefox whereas in google-chrome it just executes once

2704828
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly fine in firefox but in google-chrome it gives me a top is undefined error

2704834
width	height
the report is designed basically to render a small shelf label of the size 40mm width and 20mm height

2704834
portrait	landscape
the problem comes when i print this report from my program in vb.net dynamically setting data to some text fields the result is that crystal somehow changes the print orientation not the paper orientation as in portrait or landscape

2704844
min	max
what i don t understand is that how to use these local max min in each octave

2704869
put	get
so i only need support for get and put operations

2704897

i was in your position as well long time ago when i learned java and its collection classes or swing or awt for that matter

2704899
ubuntu	linux
i am running qt creator on a linux ubuntu 9.10 machine

2704930
getter	setter
set a unique reuse identifier for that cell configure it when you create it and from then on simply reset the data components this is easiest to do if you create a custom cell controller class so that it can track all the parts and use setter getter for the data

2704959
jndi	jta	jms	jta
i write java code using jms ejb jndi jdbc jsp servlet struts struts jta swing poi gwt gae jdo ibm mq mq jni xml sax dom c++ win32 as well as our own class libraries and probably some more than i can not remember

2704986
post	put
creation through post requests is similar to what s normally described as a rest api though in real rest you d typically use a put request instead of course

2704986
post	put
you just need to create a blob of data representing your document in any of the formats listed here -- depending on your programming language simplest may be text csv for a spreadsheet and application rtf for a text-document -- then put in in an appropriately formatted post data

2704998
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
you could get the table by it s id using getelementbyid use getelementsbytagname to get the rows columns and or use jquery to help do it for you

2705023
firefox	safari
the image is not displayed tested on safari safari mobile firefox

2705054
multiplying	add
you ll need at least 28 bits to address within a 256mb memory module the exponents add when you multiplying them

2705061
single-quotes	double-quotes
in your sql query you should not use double-quotes arround string-values but single-quotes

2705077
client-side	server-side
as php runs on the server-side you cannot access the client-side time from php php doesn t know much about the browser -- and you can have php scripts that run without being called from a browser

2705091
int	boolean
basically i want a generic method for getting a stored android preference by key and this code albeit ugly works for a boolean but not an int when it blows up with a classcastexception

writing an app that will include the ability to decompress zip and rar files

2705182
mouseout	mouseleave
if i have an outer div and an inner div element i want a single mouseout event to be triggered when the mouseleave the outer-div

2705220
mouse	keyboard
the way you handle user input events whether you handle everything like which key was pressed etc in lua or whether there are for example separate events for each keys on the keyboard in an extreme case depends on the game you re trying to make a turn based game might have only one event handler for all events an rts should have more events and an fps should be dealt with care mainly because moving the mouse will happen every frame

2705224
mouseleave	mouseenter
what you more often want is the mouseenter mouseleave model which considers element trees as a whole so you d only get mouseleave when the pointer was leaving the element-or-its-descendants and not moving directly into the element-or-its-descendants

2705224
mouseleave	mouseenter
unfortunately mouseenter mouseleave is currently an ie-only event pair

2705226
subtract	add
there were 12 bits available to store numbers in so we would add 1024 to the value before storing it and subtract it after retrieving it

2705231
rss	feed
using a third party rss feed on your site

2705231
rss	feed
most providers of rss feed are happy

i believe the issue here is the mixing of post and get

2705286
fast-forward	merge
i prefer making sure to first rebase the bug-fix branch on top of the development branch to make sure my fixes are still compliant with any work which may have been done in parallel on said main branch before merging that dev branch with the bug-fix one fast-forward merge the main branch now reference all the fixes

2705290
junit	testng
testng is a test framework like junit but is also support grouping and multi-thread over large set of test data in table format

2705294
versioning	upgrade
everytime we upgrade the software we need to manually edit the various configuration files and add 3rd party libraries that we use in the current versioning of the software

2705327
maven	pom.xml
that can be a text file or a maven pom.xml for instance

2705367

if the clients only need to ask if there is anything new the lightest protocol that is easy to implement is udp the next lightest would be pure tcp both using indy clients

2705567
post	get
i have read some post about the differences between these 3 relationships and i think i get the point

2705613
hide	show
and also you could hide the page content and show it when its ready

2705619
superclass	subclassing
i can see relations drawn lines between superclass and subclassing

2705632
int	chars
enum s would come in handy only for values that take on one of a small number of predefined possibilities and those possibilities aren t values that are naturally represented by int chars strings floats colors or other more specialized data types

2705642
vbscript	vb6
i have an application written in a combination of asp vb6 vbscript and asp.net c# that consists of a website part soap-like webservice part and a queue processing part processing incoming files in a hotfolder

2705648
oncreate	setcontentview
i ve read that it s important to call setcontentview early in an activity since it builds the view objects that may be manipulated by subsequent code in oncreate

the below code generally works in firefox safari and ie8 see here for google-chrome woes

2705709

2705774
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
your code as posted works perfectly in firefox safari and google-chrome with the latest jquery

2705791
google-chrome	safari
there doesn t appear to be any difference between font-weight normal and font-weight bold in google-chrome and probably safari

2705796
range	minimum
then simply store the minimum and maximum coordinates of each rendered string and test the point against each bounding box to see if it s contained in that range

2705800
opera	firefox
everything works fine in firefox opera etc. except ie

2705808
rtp	rtsp
netapex using live555 s openrtsp tool to access the wms2.christiannetcast.com yes-fm link they are using a wms server and do not support rtsp with rtp transport

2705825
post	get
if by hide you mean to remove it from the address bar than you could use a post request instead of get or a custom http header

2705837
webkit	gecko
so as i found out there are open-source layout engines webkit gecko that can probably be used for this

2705841

2706475
thin	webrick
if thin doesn t work either try using webrick merb -a webrick

2706505
put	get
a good possibility to not put a fully hard-coded path in your code would be to use dirname __file__ in one of your php files to get the full absolute path to the directory containing that file and build up from there to get to your database s file

2706506
rsa	aes
this key is then used to encrypt communication between the webservice and silverlight client with aes which is also encrypted with the rsa public key

all my passwords are stored in an md5 hash that was applied to an ascii byte array but i m trying to migrate my application s user data to a system that stores password in an md5 hash that is applied a unicode byte array

2706726
hash	md5
md5 is a one way operation you can t deduct anything out of the hash concering the original string

2706737
hash	md5
if so it solves your problem as unicode encoded in utf-8 and ascii would have the same md5 hash

2706765
width	height
essentially you need to wrap your element set the wrapper s height and width to that of the inner container then set the inner container s height to 0px

2706784
swt	swing
swing and swt are not really frameworks for building applications they re just collections of widgets. so you usually have to write more code - and that s code s really custom to the app project company

2706790

2707013
glassfish	weblogic	glassfish	geronimo	jboss	weblogic	jboss	geronimo	jboss	glassfish	weblogic	geronimo
you can do that if you re using a java ee app server like weblogic jboss glassfish geronimo or websphere

2707035
many-to-many	one-to-many
i think the reason that i m a little confused by this question is that technically it s actually a many-to-many relationship not really a one-to-many

2707053
hash	md5
i ve used php s md5 function to hash images as they were uploaded to a gallery

2707062

mouseout	mouseleave
you could also listen for the mouseout event if you want the div to disappear when the mouseleave the container div

2707110
fast-forward	merge
if you want to be able to count on doing this you may want to use the --no-ff option to git merge to force merge commit creation even in the fast-forward case

2707127
getter	setter
if you re developing a class which is going to be used publicly by others beyond your control then lean towards the getter setter model

2707127
getter	setter
it s often ok to do an initial round with publics and then change them to getter setter later

2707129
gif	png
ends in a .grraphic_file_format_extention jpg jpeg gif png

2707203
redmine	trac
i was wondering when is the right time or the correct project size to start using project management applications like redmine or trac

2707216
redmine	trac
i m not familiar with redmine but assuming it has functionality and complexity comparable to trac i would recommend going for it earlier rather than later -- and i wouldn t really call trac a project management tool a term which makes me think of microsoft project gantt charts etc and whose appropriateness to software development projects is much iffier and debatable but rather an issue tracking tool

2707234
pull	push
kinetic scrolling a scrolling mechanism where you don t use a scrollbar to scroll the content but you touch the list itself and pull and push it

2707245
int	chars
the above will work for real ascii because the first 128 code points of utf16 the encoding used in c# s string type have the same numeric values as for ascii and so casting the c# chars value to int is fine

2707261
punctuation	words
the regex to match all words and punctuation would be

2707278
getter	setter
i m new to java and for a hw assignment we had to create a person class that has a constructor getter setter for the attributes of firstname lastname phone

2707289
g++	gcc
i need to compile a c++ code that uses std gnu++0x option to the g++ compiler in the makefile.am as this option is compatible only with gcc 4.3 and above the build crashes on my machine where i have gcc 4.2

2707316
getter	setter
i do not know what you mean by how does each loanapplicaiton instance know which person attribute it is to go with but assuming your getter setter are public then you can invoke those functions from your loanapplication class

2707320
g++	gcc
gcc runs fine but with g++ i get a long list of errors

2707343
changeset	cherry-pick
if you were able to compute the diff by cherry-pick non-contiguous changeset then logically you would also be able to merge those changes in a single operation

2707432
button	checkbox
just a window with few button radiobuttons checkbox picturesbox few sliders

2707436
hide	show
then id like to show hide that div based on if it has any labels in it that were auto generated by the jquery validation plugin

2707445
mouseover	mouseout
both slaks and nick are correct in pointing out that you can use the hover method instead of mouseover and mouseout

2707446
uilabel	uitextview
you can use a uilabel or uitextview to draw the text

2707458
width	height
i would like each cell to be of a fixed size say 40px width and 30px height

2707471
width	height
make sure that you are assigning width and height in pixels rather than percentage to the table as well as its cells and rows

2707499
yslow	pagespeed
i have gone through most of the yslow and pagespeed stuff but am left wondering about a particular detail

2707556
geronimo	jonas	jboss	jonas	jboss	geronimo
if you stick strictly to the java ee apis in your code then jboss or geronimo or jonas or ... will run it as well as any other compliant application server with the only changes being required in the server-specific deployment descriptors

2707573
gif	png
when draw method is called for pngs and gifs some internal alpha blending method make its work it does not touch alpha channel of bitmap selected in dc it only combines color channels using internally stored alpha channel data of the png gif image

2707583
put	get
strangely there is a lot of resources on the web on how to create bundle jar creating the metadata creating the jar provided you have the classes inner jar to put inside but very few things on how actually get theses classes compiled

2707593
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
it extends runtimeexception meaning it s an unchecked-exception

2707658
firefox	safari
everything works fine in ie firefox safari

2707684
ant	maven
an osgi bundle is usually packed by ant or maven which are supported by eclipse

2707694
multiplying	add
an alternative would be to call random.nextdouble instead and multiplying it by the size of the desired range then add a base value.

2707708
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
notice that by making the rule for contain the rule for this grammar makes sure all multiplication division operations occur lower in the parse tree than any addition subtraction

2707710
width	height
the returned size always has the correct width calculated however the height is always slightly shorter than what is expected

2707737
innodb	myisam
note that this will run much faster in myisam than innodb because count is expensive in innodb but nearly instant in myisam

2707807
openfire	ejabberd
i would use an xmpp server like ejabberd or openfire to power the backend

2707839
std	ostream
std ostream is not the best place to implement filtering

2707839
std	ostream
you probably want to write a class derived from std streambuf containing a wrapped std ostream or a wrapped std streambuf and then create a std ostream using this std streambuf

2707884
toolbar	tabs
making a command group available makes it possible for these methods to be used however they can be turned on and off with more fine-grained control via the menu visibility and toolbar visibility tabs of the customize perspective dialog

2707889
google-chrome	firefox
during preview the urls get opened firefox spaces are spaces google-chrome spaces are 20

2707909
allocator	stl
i ve read the documentation and lots of forums but it doesnt make sense some of them say to use the stl others use custom allocator

2707912
getter	setter
in eclipse is it possible to create automatically getter and setter for a field

2707916
getter	setter
my plugin lets one create fields with getter or setter

2707916
getter	setter
i should mention that eclipse has create getter setter from the source menu

2707916
getter	setter
problem with that is it creates both getter or setter

2707919
getter	setter
on the generate setter and getter screen you have select getter button on the right - use it

2707925
equals	gethashcode
i ve overridden gethashcode equals methods as follows

2707933
put	get
on a lan local area network a home or enterprise network an arp or rarp request will get you a mac address and many more informations as much as the network administrator put when they configured the network possibly the exact location of the computer

2707947
equals	gethashcode
your equals and gethashcode implementations do very different things

2707947
equals	gethashcode
you have no mention in gethashcode to the m_ownertree that you are using in your equals implementation

2707948
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
if thickness were a class i would inherited from it and define properties in the subclassing to store my additional data items

2708068
hide	show
there are 2 properties to do this directly errorcontainer and errorlabelcontainer for example of you wanted a list of the errors in your and the to hide show based on if any are present you d do this

2708068
hide	show
the above will hide if there are no errors show it if there are any

2708068
hide	show
this works even if you have a description help message or something at the top of the div and the errors are just a portion of the div determined by the errorlabelcontainer selector...it ll still hide show based on any errors and leave your message help untouched

2708081
typedef	struct
i often work on private projects using the winapi and as you might know it has thousands of named and typedef struct like memory_basic_information

2708150
width	height
a better solution is to specify the height and width of your images in the html

2708183
width	height
i have an uiimage which loaded from sqllite with method imagewithdata nsdata i just find the height and width of the size both be zero

2708208
int	double
i need to see account.in to confirm but i suspect that the int transaction type appears before the double transaction amount just like the problem statement says

2708208
int	double
this would attempt to read the int as nextdouble which is okay but the double as nextint would throw inputmismatchexception

2708243
width	height
i am trying to create a custom command button that defaults width and height to specific settings

2708243
width	height
however it won t compile because it tells me that i can not override width or height

2708294
jrails	ujs
the trend in rails especially rails 3.0 seems to be towards using ujs but it is not clear to me why this is better especially when you get so many useful helpers such as remote_form_for from rails jrails

2708297
width	height
width and height are not virtual members check control class in reflector so the simpliest way is to override defaultsize property

2708297
width	height
if you check control class in reflector you will see that height and width use a lot of internal private members

2708327
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox and safari and google-chrome

2708346
ready	each
each user other then the creator should click a ready checkbox

2708346
ready	each
each user will also have an ajax request every second or less to see who else is ready if the game has started etc

2708352
int	double
so for and max_size will differ that much as int and double differ

2708385
getter	setter
i added my own implementation not because yours didn t work but to show how you could delegate responsibilities to classes which reflect the problem domain making the code a bit more readable though considerably longer with boilerplate getter and setter

2708412
instances	transient
instead of trying to merge the transient instances

2708436
put	get
in the end i m trying to get what s left for customer and what s left i put into 3 array lists

2708460
hex	binary
the visual studio binary editor displays lines hex and ascii versions in a fraction of a second

2708466
accessor	properties
you should either create it as a properties or create accessor variables for it

2708490
postgresql	mysql
you maybe a ruby and rails veteran but you might still not be a master of things mysql specific if you always used postgresql

2708512
for-loop	arrays
note that your for-loop skipped the first element of the arrays mine doesn t

2708571
inherited	properties
the default value of the viewstatemode properties for a web server control in a page is inherited

2708585
tabcontrol	tabitem
the resource dictionary xaml i use to style the tabitem of a tabcontrol is given in full here

2708609
inject	interceptor
probably the simplest is to use an interceptor to add a request attribute and inject the value of from spring config

2708621
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
my view is that option 1 is clumsy code and involves unnecessary creation of an arrays even though the for-each loops is more efficient than the traditional for-loop in option 2

2708636
datediff	difference
it looks like you ll want to use the datediff function which returns the difference between two dates in days

2708642
hide	show
or the other way round initially hide it and then show it when js is enabled

2708661
width	height
.newentry .colorbox width 80 height 80 iframe true onclosed function location.reload

2708662
int	double
i would like to make sure that int and double types are entered and if the user enters garbage lets him repeat the procedure

2708696
ceil	floor
choose either the ceil or floor of the y value that you get

2708696
subtract	add
add or subtract 1 to it if it is not a direct hit and if either of those hits cut the remaining distance in half and do it again

2708705
puts	gets
so a user puts in his emai and date in a form and it gets stored in my database

2708720
post	get
incidentally this isn t really a programming question so if you want to post more details and get help you might have better luck at serverfault.com the companion site to stackoverflow.com that deals with system administration questions

2708734
hide	show
i m using jquery to show hide different li-elements based on their classes

2708738
ubuntu	debian
all these systems are affected running ubuntu karmic ubuntu hardy debian etch

2708753
uiview	subviews
i didn t use subviews but painted my things with -drawrect inside an uiview subclass

2708760
mvp	presenter
i also suggest you to look for another variation of mvp called presenter first

2708773
typedef	struct
what if you get rid of the typedef and define your struct like this

2708839
hide	show
here is a tutorial called simple jquery show hide div that show how to accomplish this

2708849
glut	glew
the simplest way to achieve that is by using opengl glut glew

2708855
integer	fractions
some causes include divide by zero integer overflow etc. and integer divide by zero is most likely the reason since you re implementing a fractions class

2708970
folder	directory	folder	dir
basically i want it to look at the output of dir see all the folder for each directory cd into it unzip all the zip archives then remove them then cd back and do it again until there are no more

2708985
width	height
dx is the width and height

2709018
translation	localization
localization often is crap and it s hard to get help since the tremendously well done translation makes it impossible for you to find out how the feature you re having problems with could possibly be called in english while at the same time german help is not available

2709022
division	multiplication
few processors implement remainder in hardware rather it s synthesized from a division and a multiplication

2709023
postgresql	mysql
if you want full utf-8 support upgrade mysql to at least 5.5 or go for another rdbms like postgresql

2709026
aptana	radrails
aptana radrails is a cross-platform ide that will run on windows

2709042
integer	unsigned
at the end of all my calculation the answer is ax and it is treated as an unsigned 16 bit integer

2709061
pkcs#12	pfx
however you must export the certificate as pfx pkcs#12

2709077
expression-blend	silverlight
i have expression-blend 4 and i want to create a button to export to an image file the current view in silverlight

2709100
cos	sin
cosf and sinf are simply the float versions of cos and sin

2709100
cos	sin
the normal cos and sin functions return double values instead of float s

2709163
prop	each
once you do some small optimizations may make sense -- for example start with summing constants equal to one more than the smallest negative value of each propriety to all the property values and targets so that every prop value is 0 -- now you can sort the slots by value for some property or the sum of all properties and do some pruning based on the knowledge that adding one more slot to a partial hypothetical solution will increase each cumulative prop value by at least x and the total by at least y so you can prune that branch if either condition makes the running totals exceed the target

2709180
jobs	cron
now just add the heroku rake cron command to a crontab on any unix server of yours or even directly to your personal computer s crontab if you re running linux or mac os x and you can be scheduling cron jobs for your heroku application as you please and without being charged for it

2709207
mouseup	mousedown
i ve found that if you mousedown in the div#canvas and mouseup with your pointer over a placed or vice versa then a new doesn t get placed

2709247
mouseup	mousedown
i believe its not a click unless the mouseup and mousedown occur on the same element

2709248
uilabel	nsstring
here s the code where i m trying to put the nsstring into the uilabel

2709307
google-chrome	safari
i want to use like the safari google-chrome type of css3

2709351
post	put
i figured out how they did it and put the answer in the original post after the edit mark

2709355
getter	setter
and use getter setter instead of directly accessing the properties

2709434
boost	stl
i can write a wrapper class around boost regex to do the first one but i was hoping there would be a built-in or a more elegant way to do this in c++ boost stl c

2709439
int	double
this means that in the method when the compiler does know it is dealing with a float f is the float formed by the first four bytes of the double passed to the method and i is an int formed from the second four bytes of the double passed

2709448
base	fractions	integer	fractions
while basing the condition on t may seem appealing is unlikely to work unless the t_step is a multiple of for some integer n -- fractions cannot be represented exactly in a float unless this condition holds because floats use a binary base

2709460
inherited	subclassing
because inherited exposes a subclassing to details of its parent s implementation it s often said that inherited breaks encapsulation

2709474
mouseup	mousedown
i can listen to events for focus blur mouseup mousedown etc. but i don t think i can reliably figure out the state of the menu from those events

2709474
mouseup	mousedown
for example mousedown followed by mouseup could mean the user clicked and dragged to a selection and released in which case the menu is now closed or clicked and released to open the menu in which case the menu is open

2709474
onfocus	onblur
for my own use i m just keeping track of whether the select has focus using onfocus and onblur

2709518
mamp	wamp
to run a test environment in mysql php download mamp the mac counterpart to wamp

2709573
ceil	floor
the problem there is that the approach of examining the lines along the ceil floor of the point of intersection only works if the section is aligned with the vertical or horizontal axis though the intersection point

2709573
ceil	floor
more likely the thin section will be inclined at some angle away from the axis and the ceil floor neighbors will not intersect the section on integer coordinates

2709585
np-hard	np-complete
it was ... shown to be np-complete in 1972 and the optimization version of set cover is np-hard

2709590
post	get
in the page you select a station and post it then you get new page with data

2709660
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
is there a mechanism which will work across all major browsers like ie firefox google-chrome opera

2709685
pull	push
however watching for .hgtags is fine too so long as you re sure hg update is being run the push in and of itself doesn t update the local working copy outside of the .hg repo without hg update or hg pull -u

2709752
integer	unsigned
for a long value you need to add the length info l and u for unsigned decimal integer

2709756
haskell	ocaml
you could certainly launch your program as haskell or ocaml then have it do a foreign-function call right out of the starting gate mdash

2709764
g++	gcc
gcc g++ and clang to compile code in various versions

2709764
textmate	textwrangler
if you don t like it try textwrangler free or textmate paid

2709764
vim	emacs
vim and emacs are two other good editors but i don t recommend you to try them right now because they use obscure and non-standard key combinations so you will spend a lot of time learning how to use them instead of programming

2709767
strlen	calloc	printf	strlen
the usual answer is to allocate a very generous buffer unlikely to overflow let printf output to that and then use strlen to determine the actual string length produced calloc a buffer of that size + 1 and copy the string to that

2709782
subset-sum	np-complete
this problem is essentially a generalization of the subset-sum problem which is np-complete yes to multiple dimensions

2709866
int	double
the int version took 0.3 seconds the double 0.66 on my 2 ghz single-core machine

2709878
versioning	upgrade
when we want to upgrade the spreadsheets we push a new versioning out to a shared drive but dont have any way of enforcing that people dont use the old versioning of the spreadsheets

2709878
versioning	upgrade
is there some best practice here to deploy vba spreadsheets so if someone loads an old versioning it wont open or will ask you to upgrade

2709880
children	parent
the virtual tree viewer is helpful if there are lots of children per parent or if it expensive to compute the information needed for each child

cucumber	autotest
comment that row and autospec autotest and cucumber works ok

2710005
getter	setter
your best option is to break the api and introduce setter getter

2710017
opera	firefox
it appears in the right place in ie8 and opera but firefox seems to have a problem with it

2710163
hide	show
one option is to hide the .address i m guessing this is a drop-down list via css and show it inside the success callback from the ajax method

2710177
ant	maven
personally i would consider apiviz that you can call from build tools like ant or maven

2710180
inherited	properties
you can make a class that inherited control call setstyle in the constructor to make it double-buffered and user-painted then override the onpaint method to call e.graphics.drawstring and draw the text properties

2710187
x86	64bit
there is no 64bit version of xna thus you must target your assembly program to x86 based processor for windows

2710196
cos	sin
on an unit circle r 1 the x y coordinates of the points i 0..n is cos x sin x

2710196

what you need to be careful with is calling the superclass constructor which you can only do once and at the beginning of the subclassing constructor

2710284
google-chrome	firefox
im having problems with this function applying css using a text variable working with internet explorer but it works in firefox google-chrome

2710302
apache	nginx
assuming nginx is working okay you do have appropriate namevirtualhost directives set in apache so that it will map virtual hosts correctly

2710316
ant	maven
maven ant tasks use maven s repositories to provide dependency management and more to ant builds

2710316
ant	maven
ant ivy is another alternative to maven ant tasks

2710356
put	get
on the other hand if you feel comfortable writing your own extentions and taking the risk that drupal 7 could have one or more issues then go for it it s a tougher road but you d get a headstart if you put some effort into it and won t have to deal with converting later on

2710364
put	get
i get an error while validating saying that i should put outside of

2710381
ssl	https
the warning about requesting that your username and password be sent in an insecure manner likely means that you are not sending the data over ssl https which would be by webbrowser standards a secure connection

2710390

2710529
ubuntu	linux
check out the ubuntu linux troubleshooting section

2710531
directx	gdi
you re talking about using directx to write the compiler - but if you re compiling it to some bytecode then the compiler shouldn t care whether you ll end up using directx gdi opengl or something completely different

2710531
directx	gdi
when you have your instruction set you can easily write an interpreter for it using whatever you want to handle the graphical stuff directx opengl gdi sdl... - it s pretty much just one big switch statement with the opcodes implemented as the cases

2710536
google-chrome	firefox
however it doesn t appear to work properly in ie8 while it does work in google-chrome firefox

2710536
google-chrome	firefox

2710592
ubuntu	debian
just for the record i love ubuntu and their well debian s package management system

2710595
mouse	keyboard
it s rare that you would need to call either since its usually appropriate to let the user s keyboard mouse actions determine focus

2710601
getter	setter
there are some good guidelines for this particularly concerning getter and setter at the junit faq

2710624
client-side	server-side
for the server-side i used the built in .net functions to retrieve the regexes from the xml file and on the client-side used jquery s ajax request to get the regexes in javascript

2710630
innodb	myisam
for example using mysql will be fast under a myisam table but slow under an innodb

2710681

iboutlet	ibaction
you set up the interaction with the views using the target action pattern with iboutlet and ibaction see here for a complete guide

2710745
awt	swing
swing awt is a single threaded library so once a component is shown just changing it s appearance won t work correctly

2710763
width	height
here things are ordered first by width and then by height if widths are equal. if you are only using the ordering to find identical elements that s probably what you want

2710771
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this has been tested to work on all major browsers google-chrome safari firefox opera ie including ie6 7+8

2710777
width	height
first look at height arranging by shortest first if height are same look at width arranging by narrower first

2710784
perforce	cvs
that s a very different development model than perforce cvs subversion vss-- take a look at hginit for a tutorial on distributed version control before going this route it will really help

2710824
hide	show
which will show or hide elements depending on what you choose from the forms that are revealed

2710824
button	checkbox
the labels will be visible even if i did not yet click on the button that will make it visible but without the checkbox

2710824
button	checkbox
and when i click on that button that s the only time when the checkbox will appear on the left side of the labels

2710890
children	parent
the approach is easy simply include a reference to an instance of self called parent and a collection of children

2710890
children	parent
you can enforce this using the class constructor require the parent to be passed to the constructor and simply set parent to that value and then add this to the children collection on the parent class

2710892
put	get
to get this code to run before all other imports you can put the path managing code in a file of its own in your app s base directory python recognizes everything in that directory without any path modifications

2710897
implements	extends
when i try to use the home_loan_terms.thirty_year in my loanmanager class that does not extends or implements the loan class i get an error saying it cannot find symbol home_loan_terms. so i did not know if my loanmanager class needed to implements the two different loan classes

2710963
for-loop	arrays
looks like array.reverse has native code for reversing an arrays which sometimes doesn t apply and would fall back to using a simple for-loop

2710963
for-loop	arrays
in this test of reversing a 1 000 000 element arrays 1 000 times array.reverse is about 600ms whereas a for-loop is about 800ms

2710979
width	height
even if you did use a componentlistener to handle the componentresized event i m not sure you can come up with a reasonable algorithm to to calculate the exact width height of of a 4 line display

2711049
int	chars
since chars is size of 1 byte you will get the value you are expecting vs your pointer example which calculates how many int s are between the two address

2711121
post	get
and get post to check for the existence of the is_webmethod attribute before calling the method

2711216
nginx	lighttpd
according to this benchmark nginx is a little bit better than lighttpd for serving bigger static contents so nginx would be a good choice for static flv video contents

2711257
jquery	scriptaculous
i dont recall how to write it in scriptaculous but in jquery it would be

2711269
nsmutablestring	nsstring

override equals and gethashcode appropriately and you should be back in business

2711430
for-loop	arrays
i m dealing with a nested for-loop in which i will be setting a value in an arrays

2711460
atomic	interlocked
as far as i know boost only has limited support for atomic interlocked operations apparently only enough to support atomic manipulation of reference counts

2711479
post	get
you could perform a get instead of a post

2711492
google-chrome	firefox
of course in at least two of those cases firefox and google-chrome we can go look at the source

2711536
integer	unsigned
it will show as a positive integer of value of max unsigned integer - 4 value depends on computer architecture and compiler

2711543
integer	unsigned
you re right the signed integer is stored in 2 s complement form and the unsigned integer is stored in the unsigned binary representation

2711560
integer	unsigned
if the destination type is unsigned the resulting value is the least unsigned integer congruent to the source integer modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits used to represent the unsigned type

2711568
width	height
if you want to hide any one of the view you can make the view height and width as 0 0 so that the other view will fully occupy the screen

2711700
uninstall	upgrade
which brings us to another point you not only have to be able to install the application the first time but you need to make sure that a you provide a means to uninstall the application and b that you can neatly do an upgrade in place

2711734
hash	salt
instead stored the hash of a password better with a salt

2711772

2712315
innodb	myisam
myisam or innodb or another one

2712340
entity-relationship	diagram
and while doing that i felt that i should create the entity-relationship diagram first

2712346
changelistener	listeners
it s worth mentioning that changelistener has been deprecated since gwt 1.6 as have all listeners so sliderbar should probably be updated to use the new hotness changehandler but adding a changelistener will still work in the meantime

2712350
width	height
all blocks have known width 200px and unknown height

2712368
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship diagram suck as start - because they contain less information than the object diagram which includes a lot more information about methods on objects and inheritance trees - both elements the entity-relationship diagram will miss

2712374
entity-relationship	diagram
sometimes that s the class diagram first sometimes that s the entity-relationship diagram sometimes that s even the sequence diagram

2712392
button	checkbox
this was my previous question how to check if a checkbox radio button is checked in php

2712397
implements	modifiers
access modifiers shouldn t generally be used as a layer of security by the way - if this is a genuine trading system rather than just an example of the sort of separation you want then i d expect the security to be implements rather differently

2712451
agile	sprint
some other more agile approaches tend to postpone this to the last responsible moment and i have been coaching a couple of teams where the acceptance criteria gets refined over time also during the sprint

2712462
gentoo	linux
the dome projection system is constitued of two projector and a pc running a gentoo linux and kde with nvidia twinview system

2712469
entity-relationship	diagram
people with a database background do the entity-relationship diagram first and derive the class diagram from this this approach is frowned upon by oo purists

2712469
entity-relationship	diagram	entity-relationship	entities
once you have agreed on the entities at a high level proceed with class diagram and entity-relationship diagram in parallel directions - because the relationships are different in each

2712469
erd	diagram
if you are the only person working on them then start with the class diagram first and then the erd

2712500

my rss feed is not standard and simply has a thumbnail root property so my code probably won t be helpful to you

2712515
google-chrome	safari
i am testing this is google-chrome and safari and also the iphone simulator

2712576
jlist	jlabel
if possible don t use separate jlabel s but a jlist which will take care of layout and scrolling if necessary

2712610
for-loop	loops
since i asked my last question i figured out how to store my values from my form using the for-loop but every time i loops my values when i add one or more dynamic fields the second form field named meaning will not save the value entered also my dynamic form fields keep looping doubling tripling and so on the entered values into the database it all depends on how many form fields are added dynamically

2712635
richfaces	trinidad
when i view the source of application in browser i undrestand richfaces or trinidad or ..

2712646

2712661
std	ostream
i don t know if this is correct solution but i inherited from std ostream this way

2712661

2713048
post	get
have a look if you can access the data via which should unify get and post data

2713059
client-side	server-side
that also guarantees that guys with javascript switched off cannot post any obscenities client-side validation should always be backed up by server-side validation

2713066

you can hide all divs and then show the one you want.

2713646
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
you need to loops through the arrays using a for-loop until you find the item you re looking for

2713648
maven	m2e
with m2e there was the maven container which defines an export folder which was web-inf lib for me

2713648

2713690
actionscript	mxml
how can i add an mxml component as a child of the main application using actionscript

2713696
mouseleave	mouseenter
you should use mouseenter and mouseleave instead

2713729
profiling	benchmarking
only if the benchmarking shows that performance is too low should you optimise and then do so by following the guidance of your profiling

2713763
button	checkbox
it can be used with buttongroup as radio button and checkbox they are descendants of toggle button

2713793
folder	directory
just placing a dll in the folder will not work since the loader looks at the manifest for dependencies to satisfy which must reside in a particular place in the winsxs directory

2713798
hypersql	hsqldb
hypersql hsqldb is also popular

2713803
apache	lighttpd

2713896
google-chrome	safari
but it dosen t fully working with firefoxï¼œ google-chrome or safari

2713938
jtextpane	jeditorpane
i believe you need a jtextpane or jeditorpane for that

2713987
organization	naming
you can of course adopt one for any package you develop yourself but you might have to invasively edit any package you may adopt from third parties and the culturally alien naming convention will probably sap the changes of your own packages to be widely adopted outside of your organization

2713994
getter	setter
getter setter being a prime example of that.

2714036
hide	show
as i said in the initial posting i can t use the disabled attr or even the jquery show and hide functions as these do not fire until after all four datasets have been fetched and populated into the select s

2714041
post	get
however after the post i only get an empty textfield without values in the array from the previous post

2714045
integer	unsigned
if the sum exceeds the number of bits in the integer or unsigned then you will have an overflow if they are multiplied together

2714085
width	height
apparently this is hero bug in function surfacechanged switch width and height parameters

2714088
integer	fractions
if you need exact representation your code is about accounting and money where every fractions of a cent matters then you must indeed avoid floats in favor of other types that do guarantee exact representation of the values you need depending on your application for example just doing all accounting in terms of integer numbers of cents might suffice

2714100
actionscript	mxml
it explains the actionscript code behind the mxml components and it s important to be familiar with because if you implement your components incorrectly it can really slow down your application

2714124
groupbox	panel
my problem is that when the control generates a list longer than the height of it s parent container panel groupbox etc the bottom section of contextmenustrip is hidden

2714183
qstring	qchar
use the unicode method of the qchar object which you can get with the at method of a qstring if a qstring is what you have to start with

2714224
children	parent
usage a .net application passes through a hierarchyid value into the database and i want to be able to retrieve all if any children and parent of that node besides the root as it is filler

2714259
mouseover	mouseout
i want the rotation to pause on mouseover and resume on mouseout

2714261
prepare	execute

2714267
express	node.js
i m running node.js express jquery jquery ui and mousewheel.js for jquery

2714274
awt	swing

2714389
multiplying	add
yes multiplying two 3 bit numbers will result in either a 5 bit number or 6 bit number if there is a carry in the add

2714389
multiplying	add	multiplying	multiplication
just like decimal math in school you can start with the least significant bit on the lower operand and multiplying it against all the locations in the upper operand except with binary there are only two choices you multiplying by zero meaning you dont have to add to the result or you multiplying by one which means you just shift and add no actual multiplication is necessary like you would have in decimal

allocator	stl
ok best i got was to make loki s small object allocator compliant with the stl

2714402
rss	feed
anyway to begun because there is no rss feed available i m screen scraping a webpage hence it does a fetch then it goes through the webpage to scrap out all of the information that i m interested in and dumps that information into a sqlite database so that i can query the information at my leisure without doing repeat fetching from the website

2714412
hash	md5
md5 is the default hashing algorithm for the hash

2714412
hash	md5
i m not a c# programmer but it shouldn t be too hard to create an md5 hash to compare to your coldfusion result

2714415

uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
it looks like uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller just reset some of uiviewcontroller at some point

2714581
children	parent
alternatively since it looks like at least most of the data in an individual node has a fixed size you might create a database-like structure of fixed-size records and in each record record the record numbers of the parent children

2714622
daemons	launchd
it seems that the behavior is completely different because here your daemon.py is launchd in background as a daemons

2714625
rsa	aes
if you do use this one and have the last service pack installed then it can be needed to use explicitly microsoft enhanced rsa and aes cryptographic provider or microsoft enhanced rsa and aes cryptographic provider prototype as it s called on windows xp sp3 or prov_rsa_aes or ms_enh_rsa_aes_prov instead of default prov_rsa_full provider

2714625

the reference in the unit test class file will not show up for private and protected methods but it will show up for all public methods

2714950
filtering	grouping
with this schema queries for various filtering filtering by user user and not grouping user and grouping by type by date should be simpler

2714951

this is what happens when i create an nsprogressindicator and use nsstatusitem s -setview method to display it in the menubar area while i m performing an action

2714952
children	parent
at the moment rounded corners on the parent element will not apply to the children unless you specify it in your css

2714954
post	get
the basic principal here is the mvc site will expose apis that will allow users to post data from iphone and get data from sql database running behind mvc app

2714956

inherited	properties
one feature that has fascinated me is the implicit properties value inherited

2715057
integer	unsigned
if you can meet the conditions there s also uuid_short which is a 64bit integer representation of the uuid but it s got specific restrictions on how when it can be considered globally unique as it drops half of the string uuid s 128bits so it can squeeze into an bigint unsigned field

getter	setter
this could be made a little more generic by replacing m_value by using pure virtual protected setter and getter

2715202
iprincipal	iidentity
create an http module which then creates a classes that implements iprincipal and iidentity objects

2715202
iprincipal	iidentity
this is easier to implement than the membership providers since the two interfaces iprincipal and iidentity is quite thin

expr between min and max

2716470
int	chars
it s true that if you use an int or bigint as your primary key you can only have as many rows as the number of unique values in the data type of your primary key but you don t have to make your primary key an int you could make it a chars 100

2716485
put	get
marketmenubranchid should be mapped as well and hibernate will know how to get the id out of there and that is why you do not need to put id.marketid

2716731
cos	sin
y r sin long cos lat

2716767
width	height
you should devise some kind of mapping from the screen window which goes from 0 0 to width height to the complex plane which should have values in the neighborhood of -2-2i to 2+2i or so

2716767
int	double
a quick fix would be to divide the x-h and k-y expressions by 100 before passing them to renderpoint and changing the arguments of renderpoint from int to double

2716783
prepare	execute
second in order for the gpu to get to execute some command the cpu has to prepare a command description to pass down

2716809
width	height
you should start your attributes width and height with small letters width and height because that is a java convention which helps differentiate classes and attributes

2716840
put	get
make a simple function that just returns 0 get all of the save load stuff working to your satisfaction then put the slow bits back in

2716859
range	max	range	min	min	max
i have an nstextfield into which i need the user to enter a number between a max and min and it would be nice if i could detect when the nsnumberformatter fails that particular test so i can either display a nicer message the number is too large is not very helpful it needs to display the valid range or simply set the field automatically to the nearest valid value

collabnet	svn
i tried add this file path to c svn_repository making it c svn_repository var svn repos i also tried adding the path to c program files collabnet subversion server

2716933
keydown	mouseenter
this means when you hover it s starting the animation then immediately stopping it because when keydown was pressed it added a handler to do this on mouseenter

2716986
width	margin
the basic approach is your sidebar floats left but inside the main div and the #page-wrap has the width of your sidebar as it s left margin to move that far over

2717153
children	parent
because you tell your table to fill its parent and then set stretchable columns to all your layout forces its children to fill the required space

2717197
cpu	hyperthreading
if your cpu supports hyperthreading then at least in theory you can squeeze 2 threads per core and see what comes out of it

2717214
strlen	substr
after you check the string length with strlen use substr

2717216
hash	md5
so far i ve only been able to tap into more cores if i happen to need multiple hash of the same file say an md5 and a sha256 at the same time

2717378
post	get
parse the request text specifically the headers where you will see if it is a get or post and the parameters passed

2717389
post	get
post requests usually have less problems than get requests do when it comes to caches

2717419
hash	md5
i think you may be confusing an md5 hash with compression or encryption

2717419
hash	md5
md5 hash don t contain all the data just a probably unique representation of a thumbprint of the data

2717442
hash	md5
md5 has several ways for people to find collisions for a given hash

2717444
swt	swing
you could try embedding the crystal reports swing components inside your swt application using org.eclipse.swt.awt.swt_awt

2717463
hash	md5
note that while some people even trying to answer you re question think that md5 is insecure the reality is that it is still more than adequate for most purposes although i d recommend one of the more recent hash if you run paypal or control the launchpads for a fleet of nuclear weapons

2717468
uiview	subviews
use a uiview or any subclasses of uiview for any subviews within the mainviewcontroller

subtract	add
i need to get the current balance and when money is transferred from either checking or savings it should add it to checking and subtract it from savings

2717582
division	multiplication
at the moment i m not interested in multiplication and division but i might be in the future so bonus points for that

2717593
ssl	https
but since i have encryption the site using https ssl support the google map api stopped working

2717646
subtract	add
then you just have to add subtract from the least significant byte and handle carrying

2717684
hide	show
which as you can see makes use of explicit interface implementations to hide failuretask and instead show failurestate property

2717684
hide	show
the problem comes from the fact that i also want to define a stateschain that inherits both from istate and ihasstatelist and that also imples itask and ihastasklist implemented as explicit interfaces and i want it to also hide ihastasklist s tasks and only show ihasstatelist s states

2717759
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can then use the mouseenter and mouseleave events for hover effects or even create triggers based on that

2717761
jsf	seam
it appears that seam is not properly bound to any jsf lifecycle as i m getting no active application scope

2717787
inherited	properties
objects can have properties of their own and properties they inherited from their prototype object

2717787
inherited	properties
a for-in loop spec | mdn with or without a hasownproperty guard inside the loop to differentiate between own and inherited properties

2717787
inherited	properties
reflect.enumerate spec | mdn es2015+ which returns an iterator for the names of the enumerable properties of an object including ones it inherited

2717787
inherited	properties
for-in loops through the names of all of an object s properties including ones it inherited from its prototype whose names are strings leaving out any whose names are symbol s

2717787
inherited	properties
if we wanted the loop but ignoring inherited properties we can add a hasownproperty check

2717787
inherited	properties
so it doesn t include inherited properties properties marked non-enumerable or properties named with symbol s

2717787
inherited	properties
it returns an iterator that will iterate over the names of the string-named enumerable properties of the object including inherited ones skipping ones named with symbol or that aren t enumerable

2717787
inherited	properties
first it visits the own properties in the order defined by and then inherited properties unless they ve been hidden by own properties

2717787
inherited	properties
one is at the end because it s inherited and own properties come first

2717787
inherited	properties
since inherited properties are ignored we ll keep it simple

2717787
inherited	properties
it ignores inherited properties

2717861
for-loop	loops
also i need it to loops to however many rows that were retrieved from the query as 3 in the for-loop above

2717866
subclass	abstract-class
you cannot directly instantiate an instance of an abstract-class but must instead instantiate an instance of a fully implemented subclass

2717936
filesystems	xfs
note i m currently running linux with an xfs filesystems

2717936
filesystems	fat
the msdn link mdma provided further notes that fat filesystems is accurate for creates with 10 ms resolution but for access is only accurate to 2 seconds

2717958
hash	md5
it s similar with md5 except that the hash is computed via a complex procedure instead of just chopping off part of the data

2717960
hash	md5
therefore reversing a given md5 hash would result in an infinite number of possible plaintext values

2717968
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
first view tableview on the stack of a uinavigationcontroller that is a tab of uitabbarcontroller

2717968
portrait	landscape
when you make a selection on this view it pushes the uiscrollview onto the stack but because the tableview only supports portrait the uiscrollview comes in in portrait while the device is in landscape mode

2717969
typedef	struct
no you need to typedef your struct and you should pass the array to it

2717979
typedef	struct
typedef struct int a

2717982
post	get
in a web application it could be an extra post get parameter

2717986
width	height
i have a element that is generated by js and i need to get the height and width of it

2717986
width	height
how do i check to see if the video has received a dimension and if it hasn t wait till it has to get the height and width

2718016
typedef	struct
either stick the work struct in front of estructure or typedef it to some other type and use that

2718018
hash	md5
the md5 is a hash algorithm like f but much more complexer

2718030
int	chars
i have a string of hexadecimal chars which encode 8-bit signed int

2718049
hash	md5
incidentally the md5 sum of a plaintext is not necessarily safe because it contains less data or is lossy but because from an arbitrary plaintext it computes a sum-value within a fixed range for plaintexts 128 bits the md5 sum in fact contains more information than the plaintext... and therefore a number theoretically infinite of plaintext could all align to the same md5 hash

2718070
hash	md5
create the same md5 hash due to it

2718070
hash	md5
for md5 the size of the hash is 128 bits

2718070
hash	md5
however some hash algorithms like md5 have weaknesses that allow attackers to reverse it find a message with a given hash with significantly less effort compared to just brute force attempts

2718099
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
after more research i am thinking about using a hard coded salt key on both ends then sending an md5 hash of the base64 encoded image bytearray+salt to be matched on the server side

2718121
client-side	server-side
however this is all client-side so if you really need to validate the input that must be built into the submission target s server-side logic in the case of a form

2718132
int	double
at this point it doesn t matter if timeinsecs is a double or a float because the int division has already been performed

2718168
hash	md5
the main use of md5 and similar cryptographic hash codes is to encrypt passwords

2718168
hash	md5
obviously md5 is much more difficult to reverse even in this anything that will hash to the right value sense then a simplistic algorithm like take the last two digits

2718188
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i have a page with a flexigrid on it and it works on firefox google-chrome opera except ie

2718295
for-loop	loops
also note in the code above i have corrected loops index over-run on the for-loop

2718327
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
filesystems do not store time precisely and often not at millisecond resolution fat has a 2-second resolution for creation time and ntfs can delay updating the last access time by up to an hour

2718363
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
subclass the uiview and use touchesbegan and touchesmoved to determine where to move the view as its being dragged

2718399
cstdio	iostream
of course it s ridiculous to use cstdio over iostream

2718500
width	height
i used sizewithfont constrainedtosize linebreakmode to get the width and height of the text content and accordingly set the frame of my tableview cell

2718555
hash	md5
there are multiple inputs to the md5 algorithm that will despite being different inputs yield the same hash value as a result

2718555
hash	md5
this is indeed how people are able to break hash functions including md5 which is it turns out not a very good cryptographic hash function

2718555
hash	md5
all you need to do is take the md5 of those password and compare it with some hash and if they match then it is a pretty reasonable guess that it came from that password

2718555
hash	md5
you may also be interested in reading about one-to-one functions injective functions cryptographic hash functions md5 sha1 and don t hash secrets from the benlog security blog

2718621
stdout	stderr
i am however printing to stdout and stderr from java

2718718

this will brief you all the details about capturing and discarding stdout and stderr

2718748
min	max
where only min max coordinates are known for the boundingbox cube

2718748
min	max
static indices array of 12 triangles which can be defined by min max vertices of the cube

2718750
submit	submission
4 user submit a form and then browser starts to unload current page and load page with results of form submission

2718810
implements	extends
the key is that the myhandler class extends the defaulthandler class which implements the contenthandler interface and overrides the empty implementations of each callback method

2718835
filtering	grouping
you can create an object from each item containing it s index then grouping on the value and filtering out the grouping containing more than one object

2718841
error-handling	exception-handling
there are other advantages to exception-handling compared with conditionals exception-handling separate error-handling from other code

2718854
mp3	wav
creating an avi file is actually pretty easy - you basically just set a frame rate and dump in a bunch of bitmap files then add a wav or mp3 file or files for the audio and that s it

2718864
mvp	presenter
for ex in case of mvp not asp.net mvc architecture the presenter should always bind the model and view

2718884
hash	md5
the next part of the url is the hexadecimal md5 hash of the requested user s lowercased email address with all whitespace trimmed

2718891
sorting	filtering
but sorting and filtering wouldn t work

2719018
stdout	stderr
however i want to just redirect the stdout to some filehandle no stderr

2719024
folder	directory
as part of my mvc directory setup i place libraries outside the project in their own folder structure and add references to those libraries

2719035
jobs	cron
if you are running on a shared hosting server look for the possibility of setting up timed actions cron jobs

2719048
hash	md5
an attack is known against md5 which makes it possible for the attacker to create multiple documents with different contents but the same md5 hash

2719048
hash	md5
like md5 it is a hash function in which the output is not reconstructable from the input but given any output it is trivial to construct a document with a given crc-32 or crc-64 signature

2719048
put	get
worse you can put any text you like in such a document then get the crc you want just by adding junk at the end

2719127
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you should place the redirect inside the definition for example.com in the httpd.conf or equivalent instead of .htaccess

2719129
hash	md5
compute the md5 or sha1 hash

2719162
hash	md5
will be false when the url fails to load otherwise it will return the md5 hash of the contents

2719202
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
major upgrade which will uninstall the old versioning so you need to be aware of this

2719204
int	chars
with native types the compiler knows that when is called it should promote the chars to int and call rather than casting the int to chars for example

2719263
mp3	wav
as a former contributor to the jlayer mp3 library i m fairly sure that it doesn t do wav to mp3 - just mp3 playback and conversion to wav

2719283
folder	dir
after few days a source config dir has changed and i am wondering how to diff that folder in 2 projects to apply that changes in new project

2719351

2719418
spaces	delimiter
the difference is that with this solution spaces are accepted with spaces are treated as delimiter iirc

2719484
vsts	tfs
there are a lot of third party add-ins for vsts to enhance the tfs experience thankfully as raw tfs provides very basic and clumsy ui and you can use the api to write your own tools to query the tfs database too so you shouldn t have too much of a problem getting a dashboard thta you find useful

2719520
dreamweaver	aptana
aptana is actually what i replaced dreamweaver with since adobe bought macromedia i use it on windows and linux without trouble

2719567

2719705
rtp	rtsp
in general rtp rtsp should work pretty easily

2719772

2719838
google-chrome	firefox
this particular quirk is one part of a tax calculation that doesn t get sent to the browser in ie for pc and google-chrome firefox for the mac

2719978
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is when i try do the same from a httprequest in javascript on a web page i don t get a response with google-chrome or firefox it s fine in ie - rather i get a status of zero from the httprequest object

2719978
post	get

i have a dsl for which i intend to create a syntax highlighter for editors like vim gedit and netbeans

2720167
mouseover	mouseenter
this is only a guess but it could be to do with your use of mouseover instead of mouseenter

2720167
mouseover	mouseenter
try changing your mouseover event to mouseenter instead

2720167
setinterval	settimeout
i would also consider changing setinterval to settimeout as setinterval will set a timer to run a function recurring every 3 seconds here unnecessarily applying the .css again

2720173
persistent	transient
using the id of an entity is not a good idea because transient entities don t have an id yet and you still want a transient entity to be potentially equal to a persistent one

2720197
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this all is working fine in firefox only but not in other browsers like safari google-chrome and ie .given below is the code

2720563
getter	setter
use getter and setter method for each tab s click event

2720671
opencv	emgucv
another option and the one i would recommend is to abandon opencv and go with emgucv

2720671
opencv	emgucv
i have been playing with opencv for about a year and things got much easier when i switched to emgucv because emgucv works with .net so you can use a language like c# that does not come with all the c++ baggage of pointers header files and memory allocation problem

2720671
opencv	emgucv
this should be done any time you do anything with opencv even if you are using a wrapper like emgucv

2720865
jax-ws	jax-rs
you basically have two major options http and web services in that case consider using either jax-ws or jax-rs or rmi-iiop and ejbs in that case you ll have to use a java ee compliant server like glassfish

2720865
jar	war
which package archive should i use jar war

2720893
int	boolean
function test p1 int 7 p2 boolean true p3 uint 0xffff00 p4 number 55.5

2721568
x86	64bit
among the sha-3 candidates assuming an x86 processor in 64bit mode some of them achieve high speed more than 300 mb s on my 2.4 ghz intel core2 q6600 with a single core -- that s what i can get out of sha-1 too bmw shabal or skein

2721568
cpu	processors
when i put my seer cap i foresee that processors will keep on becoming faster than ram to the point that hashing cost will be dwarfed out by memory bandwidth the cpu will have clock cycles to spare while it waits for the data from the main ram

2721585
serializable	deserialization
if the orb implements local object optimization sometimes collocated objects then it will not open any sockets but it will perform serializable deserialization which is typically faster than marshalling

i ve just found out that getopt is not cross-platform in particular for freebsd and linux

2721958
g++	gcc	yacc	bison

2721970
google-chrome	firefox
i have the following ajax call which works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome but not ie

2721995
setinterval	settimeout
you should use setinterval instead of repeatedly calling settimeout

2722005
ati	nvidia
decisions about new versions of opengl took considerable time and a fair number of vendors seemed more concerned about backward compatibility than taking full advantage of every new trick as quickly as hardware vendors invented them and nvidia and ati are sufficiently competitive that they do invent them and quickly at that

2722047

2722165
int	chars
the range of a signed chars is usually -128 to 127 whereas the range of an int is far greater

2722169
int	chars
it s because you are using a signed chars and presumably an int

int	chars
the chars is overflowing when it reaches 130 it becomes 130 - 256 but the int does not overflow

2722199
portrait	landscape
if i call self interfaceorientation or uiapplication sharedapplication statusbarorientation in the view controller s viewwillappear then the 3rd tab s view controller reports 3 landscape but the first two view controllers report 1 portrait even though the status bar is clearly landscape

2722199
portrait	landscape
if i rotate the ipad to portrait and back to landscape then all 3 tabs views rotate correctly and the methods above return 3 as expected

2722209
versioning	upgrade
and the provided upgrade method would properly reload those settings whenever a new versioning of my program was created

2722209

verilog	vhdl
with non-trivial fpga asic design in verilog or vhdl there are often many many warnings

2722311
put	get
if you re creating a windows executable put the data into a binary resource in the executable instead of just encoding it into an array -- you can then use normal windows resource functions findresource loadresource etc. to get the data though this is a bit trickier to get working correctly than it initially seems like it should be

2722320
writetofile	nsdata
once all the operations are joined you can simply write the mutable data to a file using the writetofile convenience methods on the nsdata class

2722341
children	parent
but it seems if i get it right that you also are using the group by feature of ibatis so that a select returning n records with n1 distint idx fields result in the creation of n1 parent objects each one having several children objects with a total of n children objects created

2722365
folder	directory
if i submit the workspace directory it shows me the folder but if i then reload the page then it shows the no files in directory message

public	protected
the usual is thus public protected private in this order because it simplifies life for the readers

2722499
public	protected
when using metatemplate programming you may need to declare types first methods afterward so you end up with 2 series of public protected private

2722499
public	protected
when using the key idiom instead of friend you have a public section that is in fact dedicated to only a small portion of the users and is best isolated either at the bottom of the normal public section or after the protected section

union	distinct
two distinct variables not within a union always have distinct addresses so there is no logical scenario for both m_service and _blah2open sharing the same address in memory

base-class	derived-class
deleting a derived-class object through a base-class pointer when the base class does not have a virtual destructor leads to undefined behavior

2722882
ninject	spring.net
i used to use spring.net and want to switch to ninject 1.5 i have to use .net2 since some unlucky guy like me still needs to consider users working with win 2k

2722912
int	double
keep in mind when dealing with value types like int or double it will result in boxing of the keys values generic dictionaries don t impose boxing on value types

2722919
iprincipal	iidentity
also while fully implementing iprincipal and iidentity is trivial you could also simply derive from genericprincipal and genericidentity reducing the amount of code you need to maintain

2722923
lisp	scheme
in this fashion if cond and others would not be special form as they are in lisp scheme

2722923

maven	pom.xml
if you are using maven to build your project you just have to add the jar as a dependency in your pom.xml

2723025
verilog	vhdl
here is my perspective from the asic world 99 verilog 1 vhdl

2723031
cpython	pypy
and if you want to keep your current code you might want to look at cpython pypy which increases your perfomance sometimes upto 4x

2723044
vsto	add-in
the com add-in was written using vsto â it adds a custom ribbon tab with a number of options that i want to execute from a vba macro

2723059
hide	show
i have 3 divs that contain radio with labels and beneath each radio button i would like to show hide a form based on whether the radio is selected or not

2723072
lisp	scheme
in this fashion if cond and others would not be special form as they are in lisp scheme suggests to me tcl

2723073
jtextpane	jeditorpane
i was trying to do some simple text formatting using jeditorpane but then as knowledge grew i found jtextpane easier to implement and more robust

2723080
uitableview	nsindexpath
- void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

2723091
solaris	aix
on other unixes aix solaris hp-ux bash may not necessarily be present so bourne is the safer choice

2723159
hash	md5
after you have that string md5 hash it

2723246
versioning	upgrade
i have experience in 4d 2003 and 2004 but we haven t upgrade to the latest versioning because of the costs

2723246
versioning	upgrade
when a new versioning of 4d is released every single customer has to pay to upgrade their licenses

2723284
win64	windows
there are some new integer types in the windows api to support win64

2723309
folder	dir
if i do the same as above but check the in lib dir checkbox it gets added into the lib folder but contained within another lib folder

2723345
draggable	droppable
i have a simple application that users jquery-ui s draggable and droppable

2723355
post	get
like glob said you need to do a get instead of a post for example

2723356
inherited	properties
all sites inherited this list the iis metabase relies heavily on inherited properties

2723362
gridview	onclientclick
try binding the gridview during page_load or using the gridview s onitemcommand event rather than the button s onclientclick

2723396
maven	pom.xml
first you need to create a maven project a directory containing a pom.xml used to describe your project and following a given structure

2723396
maven	pom.xml
then cd in to the project directory and edit the pom.xml to declare the oauth repository maven has a central remote repository called central which is known by default but oauth is not available in central so you need to tell maven where to find it

2723397
super	extends
i came across pecs short for producer extends and consumer super while reading up on generics

2723433
post	get
problem is when there arn t any previous post while the link doesn t display i still get

2723471
inherited	properties
basically a derived class inherited from another class it gets all its methods events and properties and every type is polymorphic in .net since they all have object as their base class

2723491
memset	malloc
you could also call memset or bzero on the memory after you allocate it which would have the same result but then you would have to test the return value before zeroing the memory in case malloc failed

2723523
system.configuration	system.web
add a reference to system.web and system.configuration

2723538
super	extends
if you do both with the same collection you shouldn t use either extends or super

2723549
free	malloc
if you allocate dynamic memory with new you need to free it with delete just like using malloc free in c

2723567
width	height
firefox opens the modal window to the correct width of the object but with no height

2723598
free	malloc
when you employ stl using the new-operator and delete or malloc and free is rarely necessary

2723616
ant	maven
i usually find maven s dependency management a big time-wasting annoyance that i usually don t need so i do my build management with ant

2723622
try-catch	exception-handling
in the article using java db in desktop applications the address book demo have a method disconnect which have a try-catch block that catch and ignores the exception-handling

2723658
versioning	upgrade
i suspect that now you ve upgrade to .net 4 you are referencing system.data versioning 4.0.0.0

2723660
maven	m2e
and both the maven-eclipse-plugin and m2e the two alternatives for maven and eclipse integration support the wtp can get your project recognized as a dynamic project than can be run on a server

2723713
post	get
i also suggest that you use post instead of get when using http there is some example android code here and

2723713
ssl	https
lastly if you need security and you are using http simply add an ssl certificate to your server and you will then have https

2723733
filtering	grouping
where is evaluated before grouping ing and sum ming happens having evaluates on the result set after records are filtering and grouping

2723740
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in firefox safari opera google-chrome and on the iphone ipad i capture a keyup event on a text input box like this

2723740
keydown	keyup
on the droid however neither this keyup nor an equivalent keydown event fires until the user backspaces over every character in this

2723749
memcpy	strcpy
there are a bunch of functions in string.h which return the destination parameter memcpy strcpy strcat

2723805
folder	directory
ability to get all the files and folder in a folder and potentially also the entire directory tree

2723805
children	parent
tree traversal getting the parent all children etc

2723914
unix	bsd
you may still need to do a little os specific coding in java for this though as you ll probably not find the same system calls available in windows and unix linux bsd os x

2723955
g++	gcc
gcc and g++ are treating static inline a little differently

2723978
google-chrome	safari
however in webkit tried mac safari and google-chrome the right hand edge loses its little shadow entirely

2723994
pop-up	dialog
however this is not that useful because it halts the program and pop-up a dialog box until a user presses something

2724041
width	height
i m using the jquery ui button control but don t seem to be able to adjust the size width and height

2724088
versioning	upgrade
i know that if i upgrade to a pricier versioning of sql server i can get replication built in

2724103
radiobuttonlist	onclientclick
i ve noticed there is no onclientclick property for the radiobuttonlist in the asp.net control set

2724112
swt	swing
anything java and in desktop gui style is fine gwt swing swt

2724151
profiling	debugging
it uses the debugging and profiling api to capture the stack traces of the threads in a running .net application without the need to modify the application

2724197
int	double
i am confused because in this case we are downcasting from a bigger double to a smaller int but in case of classes we downcast from a smaller base class to a bigger derived class

2724213
int	double
the primitives int and double are not objects in c++ and are not related to each other in the way two objects in a class hierarchy are

2724218
int	double
no you do not downcast since double and int are not classes

2724233
put	get
i put that url in the edit box and get an error

2724234
int	double
int and double are both primitives and not classes so the concepts of classes don t apply to them

2724245
nhibernate	automapper
i am using automapper in my project along with nhibernate and asp.net mvc 2

2724323
getter	setter
you can even make the accessibilty of the setter and getter difference

2724323
getter	setter
if you do choose to use auto-properties be aware that you cannot access the underlying field nor can you supply an implementation for just one portion just the getter or just the setter

2724329
hide	show
so i had to show it first set scrollleft then hide it again

2724336
put	get
normally it s a great thing to put on a resume to get you a paying gig

2724358
width	height
you can see that i pass in the url as well as the height h and width w of the window

2724359
floating-point	integer
i know that modern computers have all a standard integer format but i have heard that they may not all use the ieee standard for floating-point integers

2724372
stdout	stderr
you need to redirect stdout first then stderr

2724405
udp	rtp
rtp typically uses udp which is inherently lossy

2724437
inherited	properties
it s a properties of uiscrollview from which uitableview inherited

2724465
ostringstream	std
std ostringstream is the standard way to do this in c++

2724465
ostringstream	std
i d say the real problem with the std ostringstream solution is not about efficiency

2724527
post	get
enable asp.net asmx web service for http post get requests

2724601
post	get
however if i post my editted data to the second action i get the following error

2724602
margin	height
with a fixed height footer like yours that is easy to fix using a bottom margin on the page body and some more absolute positioning for the footer

2724638
setcontentview	findviewbyid
then you can access any inflated views in your activity after calling setcontentview by using findviewbyid in conjunction with the automatically generated r.java

2724660
nsbutton	nspopupbutton
nspopupbutton nsbutton nscontrol

2724722
int	chars
so i ran this with chars int ci

2724722
int	chars
also why is the jump for chars so much larger then int and a structure that contains both an int and chars

2724734
width	height
i also tried using height inherit and width inherit instead of specifying a size

2724743
post	get
you can then use other command line options to get just the frames you want or do some other post processing like resizing or deinterlacing

2724792
onresume	onpause
if you aren t familiar with onpause onresume read up on the activity lifecycle

2724792
onresume	onpause
i don t think your cursor would persist across the onpause onresume since they re generally closed in onpause to avoid memory issues

2724821
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
premake can generate project files for visual studio monodevelop sharpdevelop xcode code blocks codelite and plain gnu make and it supports building c# c++ and c projects for tons of platforms from unix linux osx windows to crosscompiling for playstation 3 and xbox 360

2724951
strncmp	strlen	strncmp	strcmp	strlen	strcmp
you need to use strncmp rather than strcmp and set the comparison length equal to strlen search

2724980
width	height
i belive that what is going on is glteximage2d can sometime handle width and height that are not a power of 2 but can then scale the input image thus filter it

2724997
ffmpeg	libavformat
also you could interface directly to the ffmpeg libraries libavformat and libavcodec

2725000
boost	allocator
when you do care about allocator behaviour you should always use a special purpose allocator boost pool something you write yourself etc.

2725005
setcontentview	findviewbyid
at first i was about to post a stupider question as to why this is happening a quick test of playing with the setcontentview made me realize the cause of findviewbyid returning null i just do not know how to remedy this issue

2725062
post	get
sorry don t have time to recode it and post but that should just about get you started nicely

2725066
postgresql	mysql
i saw the same question posted but for postgresql and tried to adapt it to mysql but so far no success

2725088
int	double
during the instanciation of myclass i pass a big vector vector int and i find that the object is actually copied and not only the reference so it takes the double of the memory .

2725102
client-side	server-side
i tried both server-side and client-side redirect with the expected results

2725105
int	boolean
edit2 then again it is probably worth noting that while the boolean values themselves always convert to zero or one a number of functions especially from the c standard library return values that are basically boolean but represented as int s that are normally only required to be zero to indicate false or non-zero to indicate true

2725126
google-chrome	firefox
have two different browsers google-chrome and firefox that each have a different cookie and then visit the same captcha url and you will get two different images

2725128
min	max
as i recall early delphi 1 had a bug where the results of min and max were reversed

2725140
persistent	transient
it should be persistent the transient value because of your cascade type

2725140
persistent	transient
if you are actually trying to persistent the first element before you ve set the other transient element then you d expect this error

2725143
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
first of all you should use svcutil.exe not wsdl.exe unless you have no other choices

2725176
stdout	stderr
otherwise it will just run as a foreground process logging to stdout and stderr

2725177
boost	allocator
for small allocator boost has a very simple allocator i ve used called boost simple_segregated_storage

2725188
firefox	safari
in safari and firefox and friends the results are as i d expect

2725201
width	height
their width and height are explicitly set to 0

2725237
width	height
you can use different overflow values in css auto should cause a scrollbar to appear when text is bigger than the height width will allow or hidden to cut it off

2725245
stdout	stderr
2 1 is to redirect stderr to stdout as strace writes to stderr by default

2725283
screens	tablet
having a large-size tablet computer is also a significant departure from touch screens smart phones

2725287
dictionary	map
the new dictionary will map values to lists of values

2725296
rss	feed
i have a c# project that plays morse code for rss feed

2725309
fgets	fread
you use fread as well which is faster than fgets and which reads the file in chunks of a specific size that you can define

2725345
rss	feed
got an established libsyn rss feed got a new drupal website for the podcast

2725345
rss	feed
just want to use the mp3player modulee s flash player in a drupal page which feed the latest mp3 file from a libsyn rss feed

2725397
width	height
the height 437px and width 700px of the image is greater than the dimensions of your div

2725397
width	height
set an appropriate height and width for your div to allow for the image to be shown

2725416
width	height
since you re setting height and width to 100 the amount of the image you see will depend on the divs containing the yellow class

2725416
width	height
try changing the width and height on the status class and you will actually see your the bg image on yellow

2725426
restrict	shared
prior to 3.5 sp1 if you try to run an app from a network shared it will run with restrict permissions

2725470
google-chrome	firefox
if you use firefox or google-chrome as your browser then you could write a greasemonkey script that would change the page s appearance for each admin console

2725532
post	get
cocreateinstance clsid_createcapturegraph2 and post up the code you use in cocreateinstance and any hresult value you get returned

2725536
suppressfinalize	finalizer
and with reference to your unmanaged code note it s a finalizer that s typically implemented for that although dispose and suppressfinalize are typically called to free up the resources sooner.

2725620
gauge	progress
for large files you ll definitely want to provide some kind of progress gauge for end-users

2725642
aggregate-functions	sum
one way to do is to exploit the aggregate-functions usually sum and count help you the most in this situation along with mysql s if function

2725657
min	max
my first thought was a groupby id and then do some min and max with the arrival and departure but the 01 01 1753 value is messing aronud

2725683
google-chrome	firefox
you can probably achieve whatever it is you are wanting to do by using the firefox firebug plugin google-chrome s development tools or the firefox greasemonkey plugin

2725696
pow	sqrt
change pow r2 -1.5 to 1 r2 sqrt r2 to lower the cost of the computing r 1.5

2725701
x86	64bit
again assuming this is intel x86 if you have a 64bit cpu then build a 64bit executable if you re not already - the extra registers can make a noticeable difference around 30

2725707
uiview	calayer
on the iphone content is drawn into a calayer or into a uiview s backing calayer using quartz drawing calls or from a bitmapped image

2725712
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
apart from straightforward add subtract divide multiplying pow is the only heavyweight function i see in the loop body

2725717
openjpa	datanucleus
jpa compliant alternatives to hibernate include toplink essentials the ri in java ee 5 eclipselink which is also the ri of jpa 2.0 in java ee 6 openjpa datanucleus

2725738
mouse	keyboard
it does work when i connect keyboard mouse and monitor to the mini and work on it directly however it is a lot more convenient for me to run it through a vnc connection

2725769
mp3	wav
once i ve got this wav data it won t be too far of a stretch to convert it to an mp3 woo

2725796
folder	dir
you can use the dir command to get a list it is actually a structure array of the files in a given folder

2725815
libtiff	libpng	zlib	libtiff	zlib	libpng
i m trying to use a library named dcmtk which used some other external libraries zlib libtiff libpng libxml2 libiconv

2725895
jquery	livevalidation
let s say your page header includes menu livevalidation and jquery

2725957
webkit	gecko
and there is lixto its eclipse based and uses mozilla gecko as rendering engine unless they already changed it to webkit as they said they ll do years ago

2725993
content-length	content-type
if you can ensure that the http content-length and content-type headers are present in the upload request or in the multipart body when it s a multipart form-data request then it would be an easy job with help of randomaccessfile

2726006
centos	linux
even on the same platform i ve tried windows xp 7 and centos linux some work some don t.

2726053
width	height
if you reduce the size of height and or width then it works fine

2726055
next	except
it works except for just one problem that when i select or press one list item it seems that the selected item overlap the next one a little bit as i can see some pixels of the green background image is on the top of next item

2726057
hash	md5
so you can tell someone here is a file and here is its md5 hash

2726057
hash	md5
if the file has been corrupted during then the md5 hash will be a different value

2726057
hash	md5
in practice a hash function will always produce a value of the same size for instance md5 is will alway return 128bits no matter the size of the input

2726057
hash	md5
md5 sha0 and sha1 are all vulnerable to a hash collision attacks and should never be used for anything security related

2726105
hash	salt
i ve got the general approach concatenate my information user name product version a salt into a string and generate a sha1 hash from that then encrypt the hash with my private key

2726130
int	double
i have implemented an insertion sort in a double link list highest to lowest from a file of 10 000 int and output to file in reverse order

2726134
centos	linux
type following command to install tree command on rhel centos and fedora linux

2726134
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	linux	debian	mint
if you are using debian ubuntu mint linux type following command in your terminal

2726135
superclass	subclassing
the subclassing simply needs to call a constructor in the superclass

2726135
public	protected
if the superclass has a public or protected no-arg constructor this is called automatically otherwise you need to be explicit

2726138
subtract	add
note that i performed the query on an postgresql database - maybe the syntax differs on ms-sql-server maybe at the alias from one as o1 perhaps and maybe you cannot add subtract in that way

2726179
keydown	keyup
record the keydown and keyup events and do a diff on the timestamps of each

2726193
lisp	scheme
or my personal favorite use macros if your language supports it scheme and lisp

2726193
lisp	scheme
i think lisp scheme macros would solve many of these problems

2726199
keydown	keyup
you won t see keydown keyup events like you could if you trapped x events but it s probably easier especially if you re just running in a console or terminal

2726201
keydown	keyup
if your languages environment has interactive keyboard support that offers keydown and keyup events then you catch both events and time the difference between them

2726222
rss	feed
i m trying to build a firefox extension which can get rss feed and display them in a popup panel

2726246
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
webkit browsers google-chrome and safari and apparently firefox 3.6 now support css gradients

2726248
happy	alex
edit i had to install cabal alex and happy from source but after that everything did seem to work fine

2726253
awt	swing
it looks like all of the classes belong to your application so i am guessing you are working with awt or swing

2726263
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the sample code below displays as intended in google-chrome safari and firefox

2726276
actionlistener	focuslistener
i d use an actionlistener on the text field but a focuslistener should workâ just don t rely on the the order in which treeselectionlistener events arrive

2726334
margin	height
if javascript is an option you can calculate the height of your content box and set a top margin according to the formula you prefer

2726337
internationalization	translation
the django internationalization system will automatically insert the correct translation for you if you provide the translation files

2726374
int	chars
random_integer is an int you are comparing it to a bunch of chars from the ascii chars set - 1 as a chars literal is actually 49 in decimal

2726376
int	chars
1 does not mean int 1 rather it is chars 1 which translates ascii to int 49

2726377
pop-up	dialog
when you click the button a confirmation dialog is supposed to pop-up but it doesn t show in my webview

2726384
xlwt	xlutils
tutorial on xlrd xlwt and xlutils .

2726386
erd	diagram
i am trying to define db dependency for a web based application and was thinking that perhaps the hibernate mappings used in the application might be importable into some sort of tool to produce a visual erd diagram

2726388
folder	directory
another option is to create the folder blank on the repository directory and then checkout just that folder to where you want it

2726476
post	get
all of the form fields display correct but when i submit a post i get an error

2726479
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have been having some serious issues trying to get this web page i have been working on working correctly with ie7 firefox google-chrome safari ie8 all work fine

2726480
integer	unsigned
most machines actually store the 16-bit value in a 32-bit integer and that is handled with unsigned arithmetic

2726482
button	checkbox
the above sample code works now i need to create a grid with a column with checkbox so that i can click a couple of those checkbox and click delete button it should get all the id in which the checkbox are checked to and create a delete query and execute

2726503
pop-up	dialog
in order to handle a pop-up confirmation coming from a webpage in your webview you need to override the onjsconfirm method in webchromeclient to display the pop-up as an android alert dialog

2726513
setinterval	settimeout
i mean i ve seen shoutboxes that work surperb and doesn t seem to be using any setinterval or settimeout javascript functions to do this

2726527
pull	push
in other words rather than a pull model - where the client pull data from the server - it is a push model where the client provides the sink stream and the server writes into it

2726529
children	parent
you can put an iframe on the parent entity that shows all the children entities

2726529
post	get
this post should get you pointed in the right direction

2726565
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
please check it out first in firefox or google-chrome or safari because it all works fine in those browsers

2726627
put	get
though you could get creative and put a space between the number as in 7 .alert but people would probably hunt you down for it when they get stuck maintaining your code

2726644
memcpy	strcpy
some of the confusion with terminators would be mitigated if you used the usual c idiom for copying a string strcpy ptr hello n rather than memcpy

2726655
websphere	ibm
the default location for these is c program files ibm websphere mq tools jms samples and they include both pub sub and point-to-point examples

2726673
put	get
but in rails 3 everything s been changed around and no matter where i put that configuration line i get an undefined method or undefined object error

2726680
wav	riff
i used a memorystream and binarywriter to crib a wav file complete with the riff header and chunking

2726680
wav	riff
i also implemented a frequency property which re-generates the samples and uses the seek binarywriter trick to overlay the old data in the riff wav memorystream with the same number of samples but for a different frequency and again did the same thing for an amplitude property

2726684
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested with google-chrome 4.1.249.1064 45376 and firefox 3.6 on windows 7 ultimate and they both work fine

2726684
firefox	safari
as do both safari 4 and firefox 3.6 on osx 10.6.3

2726684
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
and here is the offending bit of code which works on google-chrome firefox and safari just fine

2726722
ord	chr
ps many answers including mine at one point used chr ord c + 2

2726722
ord	chr
to avoid the typeerror you could use chr ord c + 2 256

2726809
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
another situation that makes the choice easier is when you want to use aggregate-functions like sum min max etcetera and complex queries like in the financial system mentioned above then a relational database is probably more convenient then a nosql database since both are not possible on a nosql databse unless you use really a lot of inverted indexes

2726811
put	get
to put it another way suppose you have a shopping list of items you want to get

2726947
int	boolean
i guess its because the operator xor is defined for boolean and int

2726962
openssl	m2crypto
if you try this with a cert that you created with openssl command line tools for example the server.pem in tests directory sans the key and text by loading and saving it with m2crypto you should get identical files

2726983
webkit	gecko
gecko webkit and opera all wait until they encounter html that matches a css rule with a fontstack including the font-face font

qplaintextedit	qtextedit
the documents used by qplaintextedit use qplaintextlayout objects and qtextedit has something else that i cannot determine

however you won t be able to open the newly upgrade solution file in previous versioning of visual studio so back these up first if you want to retain them - though it may be possible to hack the .sln files to go back if really necessary

2728122
versioning	upgrade
personally i think you just need to bite the bullet and upgrade everything - it s not really practical for people to use different versioning for the same solutions

2728129
try-catch	exception-handling
i recently moved from netbeans to eclipse and i very much miss one great feature - whenever i use method which throws some kind of exception-handling netbeans alerted me and i needed to add try-catch and netbeans automatically generated exception-handling type for me

2728130
webmachine	nitrogen
erlang and nitrogen and webmachine

google-chrome	safari
with google-chrome and safari it remains black

x86	64bit
in a 64bit os an assembly built for any cpu or x64 will throw the same exception when trying to load an x86 library

2728694

i am toying with the idea of autogenerating source code and or dialogs for modifying messages that use the underlying typedef struct union

2730817
typedef	struct
by using the xml version i would only need to update add the typedef struct union only in one place and all the projects would be able to autogen the source and or dialogs

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
right now it is working only in ie but not in firefox google-chrome safari

2730839
pop-up	dialog
also in ie a dialog pop-up warning this page is accessing information that is not under its control...

2730846
ilist	icollection
or does elementat recognize that col also implements ilist although it s only declared as icollection

2730850
equals	gethashcode
you could also create a comparer that accepts function arguments for the equals and gethashcode methods

2730886
uiview	calayer
the general rule i follow with using calayer or uiview s is to use calayer objects when i don t need any user interaction

2730890
pop-up	dialog
there isn t a way to pop-up and open the file dialog any other way

2730938
post	get
i need to generate http get post delete and update from a c++ application

2730985
maven	pom.xml
it has a discovery mechanism that translates existing meta-data such as a maven pom.xml into a model that can be understood by buckminster

2731054
hash	md5
but when we save a new instance of the file from the db with today s date as the create modify on the file-system and then check the new hash versus the md5 stored in the db they do not match and therefor fail a duplicate check

2731095
width	height
it has a width equal to the distance between the points of intersection and a height equal to

2731098
hide	show
when the selection of the radio buttons change i would like to show hide the panel in the next table cell

2731098
hide	show
i would like to hide and show the panel dynamically

2731114
updatepanel	scriptmanager
use the ajax.asp.net library - then you add a scriptmanager item and an updatepanel

2731136
width	height
it keeps its portrait width and height but it is rotated

2731144
hide	show
do you have any server side logic based on which show and hide the panel

2731151
hide	show
from your code i can t see where you hide and show the panel

2731151
hide	show
if you simply want to show and hide the panel you can do it better with javascript by adding some code to the onclick event to set the panel s visibility css attribute

2731170
gtkmm	glibmm
how would i go about coding such a queue using the gtkmm glibmm library

2731171
metaphone	soundex
i know actually learned today about levenshtein distance soundex and metaphone algorithms but currently not having a solid idea to implement this to querying against database

2731175
late-binding	early-binding
in closure terminology python s closures are late-binding not early-binding .

2731175
late-binding	early-binding
fortunately it s fairly easy to make a late-binding closure into an early-binding closure

2731200
mouse	trackpad
you don t want to be doing too much dev because of the small screen though it was only really an issue for me because i got sick of the trackpad and didn t have a separate mouse but it s honestly pretty fast and easy to use for .net mvc development in visual studio

2731208
sorting	grouping
if i ve determined that a new grouping has started if the previous item started with a different letter than the current item and i am sorting alphabetically and grouping by letter then i inject the appropriate html markup into a literal control in the itemtemplate to create the visual grouping

2731211
libtiff	libpng	zlib	libtiff	zlib	libpng
so i need to build the support libraries zlib libtiff libpng libxml2 libiconv with multithreaded dll md multithreaded dll debug mdd run-time options

2731274
sorting	grouping
this has built in support for sorting and a kind of grouping whilst still offering the layout flexibility you get with a repeater

2731296
public	protected
the goal behind having public private protected methods is to encapsulate logic and make it easy to change parts of your code without having to worry about how one function or class interacts with another

2731306
post	get
your second question is easy get has a size limitation of 1-2 kilobytes on both the server and browser side so any kind of larger amounts of data you d have to send through post

2731321
delphi	oxygene
3 as jamiei suggest translate the c# or vb .net code to delphi prism is not difficult you can use the c# to oxygene tool or you can do it manually

2731338
post	get
server-side there s no reason to use the raw input unless you want to grab the entire post get data block in a single go

2731343
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works fine for me on google-chrome opera firefox .

2731350
for-loop	loops
this code accomplishes exactly the same thing as your original for-loop except it uses logical tests to determine whether or not it should continue to loops

2731379
google-chrome	firefox
i have an issue in ie6 but not ie 7 firefox or google-chrome

2731404
stdout	stderr
after you call fork you are not closing the standard streams stdin stdout stderr in the child process before your call to execve so they are still connected to rsh

2731404
daemons	systemd
the daemons convenience function exists in some unix systemd

2731404
daemons	systemd
the daemons function is for programs wishing to detach themselves from the controlling terminal and run in the background as systemd daemons

2731408
post	get
both are applied to a given url pattern security constraint can also be applied only to specific http methods get post ... so they are quite independent

2731449
width	height
the problem is that when a div is hidden it has no height or width

2731479
put	get
these things get a lot more obvious when you don t give different things the same name and also when you don t put classes in separate modules for their own sake

2731501
int	boolean
i seem to have an inordinate fondness for using boolean as int

2731506
java.util.date	simpledateformat
it depends entirely on the format of your string so i would use a simpledateformat to parse the string into a java.util.date

2731564
int	boolean
then there s setselection int position bool animate but the extra boolean on the end there doesn t appear to do anything

2731565
width	height
the user can include images in their markup and drag resize those images affecting the final width height attributes in the img tag

2731565
width	height
but one big problem is that i am now sending a possibly much larger image to the client only to have the browser resize the image into the requested width height attributes

2731565
width	height
so my solution is to pre-process my users markup content scanning all of the img tags and parsing out the height width src attributes

2731565
width	height
then set each img s src tag to a phpthumb request with the parsed height width passed into the thumbnails url

2731565
width	height
only img tags that need this processing will have an existing width height attributes with the double quotes and lower cased text but i suppose matching the text case insensitive would be better if tinymce changes

2731567
updatepanel	scriptmanager
solution would be either using ajax updatepanel and scriptmanager or removing

2731573
post	get
post vs get

2731659
int	chars
validates_length_of uses size method to find out length of the field and for the int it just gives you size of the variable in bytes which is probably 4 for first 11 chars and 8 for 12+

2731662
mouseleave	mouseenter
in your case add one action for mouseenter and one for mouseleave

2731673
mouse	keyboard
but instead of mouse if we simply use the arrow keys from keyboard the respective div id s are not showing

2731675
hash	md5
another option would be md5 which is a very strong hash practically secure but it is a 128-bit hash so you have the slight disadvantage of having to deal with 128-bit values

2731675
hash	md5
i would say md5 is overkill for these purposes-- as i say with a 64-bit hash you can deal fairly safely with in the order of a few million strings

2731675
hash	md5
sorry i should clarify -- md5 was designed as a secure hash it s just that it s since found not to be secure

2731678
cdr	cons
mccarthy s original lisp 1.5 programmer s manual did it with five functions car cdr cons eq and atom

2731742
int	double
first one is an int second is a string third is a double

2731742
int	double
now i know how to format the only problem i am having is parsing the string elements into their respected data types int string double

2731742
int	double
but that only separates each string into a new line and i couldn t for the life of me figure out how to have each line check if it s an int string or double

2731789
int	double
if you have lines with the format int string double you can do

2731824
google-chrome	safari
i have a rather strange bug which i can t make sense of that is apearing in webkit based browsers google-chrome and safari

2731834
implements	extends
like mindas suggested you could extends abstractfield to implements this

2731836
actualheight	actualwidth
i think that the actualwidth or actualheight properties are not settable only gettable

2731847
int	boolean
and function s are primitives in actionscript much as int s or boolean s so there is no meaningful way to extend them

2731921
hide	show
now depending upon what data is typed into the textboxes i need the table trs tds to show or hide

2731934
hash	md5
in cases where you need to be absolutely sure you d use a real hash algorithm like sha1 md5 etc

2731969
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in google-chrome and i am guessing other webkit browsers as well but there are weird selection issues in firefox so i m assuming its a non-standard practice that i should stay away from

2731976
folder	directory
i would like to be able to pass an xml file to an ant build script and have it create a folder structure mimicking the nodal structure of the xml using the build files parent directory as the root

2731979
public	protected
search bots won t be able to access to your protected pages while they ll access without problems to the public content as long as you don t explicitly disallow it on robots.txt

2731984
adplus	procdump
if you have a customer who is willing to work with you a bit it might shed some light on the situation to get a crash dump with adplus or maybe simpler with sysinternals procdump when the error message is showing

2731990
converter	multibinding	division	subtraction
if you wanted to incorporate both division and subtraction in the same binding you would need to either create a special converter or use a multibinding which would also require you to create a special multibindingconverter

2731998
prototypejs	mootools	extjs	mootools	extjs	prototypejs
jquery mootools dojo extjs prototypejs and many other libraries provide a wrapper around javascript to abstract away browser differences and provide an easier interface to work with

2732008
google-chrome	firefox
when i click on the image in firefox ie it works as expected but does not work in google-chrome ver

2732031
width	height
that will match any image tag and if the src width and height attributes are present their values will be stored in groups 1 2 and 3 respectively

2732037
division	multiplication
if you know that icf isn t going to cause anything to go out of range and if your hardware can perform 3 multiplication faster than a division

2732043
switching	screens
granted that adds two extra objects to the screens but for some reason they all stay smoothed and scaled that way where as before switching sources was going from smooth to jaggidy and un-readable

2732047
folder	directory
if you site supports user s uploading files and they are stored inside the site s directory say in a folder called uploads then you would want to exclude such a folder from the source control

2732105
range	min
range validity check o min last-first container.end -first

2732140
width	height
i have to do the double source assignment because it appears that many images are lacking in width height parameters in the places where the microsoft bitmap loader expects them to be

2732195
udp	tcp
the purpose of the application is to listen for a specific udp multicast and then to forward the data to any tcp clients connected to the server

2732276
eiffel	smalltalk
examples smalltalk eiffel ruby jade vb.net

2732288
super	self
it will work fine if you don t pass value to super namedinteger self .__init__

2732333
inherited	subclassing
as of python 2.6 the preferred way to extend numeric types is not to directly inherited from them but rather to register your class as a subclassing of the number abstract base class

2732351
for-loop	arrays
now imagine that you realize after writing the above for-loop in 5 different metods that you are constantly inserting in the middle of the arrays and that a std list would be much better suited for the job

2732369
versioning	upgrade
class libraries that have been upgrade from earlier versioning of asp.net and that use membership types that have been moved might fail to compile when used in an asp.net 4 project

2732415
vsto	add-in
if i use project output in my setup the vsto add-in installs fine the first time

2732483
integer	fractions
a fractran program is an ordered list of positive fractions together with an initial positive integer input n

2732483
integer	fractions
for the first fractions f in the list for which nf is an integer replace n by nf

2732483
integer	fractions
repeat this rule until no fractions in the list produces an integer when multiplied by n then halt

2732490
twig	smarty
webbiedave s answer is perfectly fine but in the long run you should really learn to use either a decent template language smarty twig or a php framework that has it s own templating

2732490
codeigniter	kohana
kohana and codeigniter are both pretty easy to get into

2732610
gridview	rowdatabound
in your page you ll have to override the gridview s rowdatabound event find the time and convert it using datetime s conversion methods

2732612
nginx	lighttpd
nginx with x-accel-redirect or lighttpd with x-sendfile headers

2732642
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have a uinavigationcontroller with a uiviewcontroller vc1 as the root view controller

2732646
innodb	myisam
if you re running an alter table...add index command on an innodb table not so sure about myisam then it will just run and run as it copies the whole darn table lock-stock-and-barrel first if it s in the middle of copy to temp table then it s pretty much unstoppable

2732659
getter	setter
i have an object that has a lot of attributes each one with it s getter and setter

2732723
preorder	postorder
this produces the elements in a single flattened list much like preorder and postorder do and is the usual definition of a breadth-first traversal

2732825
hide	show
how efficient usable would it be to hide the cursor and show a png instead

2732854
sorting	filtering
bindinglistcollectionview does not support filtering nor sorting

2732857
prepare	execute
some people suppose that there s some overhead because you re making an extra round-trip from the client to the rdbms -- one to prepare the query the second to pass parameters and execute the query

2732899
implements	extends
i recommend you to extends an abstracttablemodel and implements an void addrow yourobject row that fits you

2732982
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox

i m using the feed to create nodes from an rss feed

2733071
bellman-ford	dijkstra
bellman-ford + dijkstra shortest paths navigational systems

2733107
width	height
yes i know its a bad interface but you are only read a byte not the full width and height

2733131
rar	zip
since the files are all zip exe rar and so on the default handler isn t being applied and session state isn t available

2733178
nsmutablestring	nsstring
also you can just use nsstring to get a formatted string no need to use nsmutablestring or cast it.

2733292
sorting	filtering
read the section sorting and filtering here

2733295
hide	show
i d like to click a header link and have the block directly underneath hide or show with slidetoggle

2733360
noscript	meta
since meta isn t allowed in the body of a page and noscript isn t legal in the head section perhaps the bots are just giving up on a page where they hit bad html

2733365
factors	matrix
you should do an lu or cholesky decomposition of the matrix depending on if your matrix is hermitian positive definite or not and then do back substitution with the factors

2733479
awt	swing
i also remember that when i worked with awt and swing i had some problems with using float or double like using point2d.float or point2d.double

2733492
implements	extends
yui compressor - initially i thought i would extends the yui compressor to do this but found that it is implements as a bunch of regex s and not a parser

2733550
cpu	affinity
you can use the data in the proc filesystem to get cpu affinity info for running processes

2733579
int	boolean
all int types including boolean except long are stored as 4 byte int in the java memory model unless stored in an array

2733589
voip	sip
i m trying to build a voip application and would like to add a sip address name domain field to it

2733601
multiplication	modulo
hashes boil down to multiplication and modulo operations which means that you never want to use numbers with common factors if you can help it

2733640
factors	matrix
you can also write shaders etc that do more complicated math factors in multiple vectors and matrix and what-not but this is the basic idea.

2733686
rel	src
i ve also tried to add the src path as a rel attribute to the label but also without any success

2733710
webkit	gecko
for example if the browser was trident presto or gecko return null whereas if the browser is webkit return it s version number

2733728
put	get
of course the other method to accomplish this would be that when i make each cell i iterate over the events json and apply the appropriate html to the cell at the time but that means repetitively running over the entire json in order to get the event to put in the cell

2733732
folder	directory
i ve been playing around with trying to load the files into strings via the apache readfiletostring but i can t figure out how to load files from a specific folder within the webapp s content directory without hardcoding it in and having to worry about it breaking if i deploy to a different system in the future

2733736
agile	greenhopper
greenhopper - agile planning

2733745
migrate	upgrade
upgrade the .net apps to vs2010 strip out all the common header footer controls and migrate the styles to use the style sheets used in the cms

2733749
folder	directory
but i can t figure out how to load files from a specific folder within the webapp s content directory without hardcoding it in and having to worry about it breaking if i deploy to a different system in the future

2733754
redmine	trac
my recommendation would be redmine or trac

2733756
folder	directory
but when i create a new application and try to add it to additional library directory i go to the exact folder and it does not show up

2733782
hash	md5
generating a signature is pretty much the same process all over create a md5 hash object then you digest all the bytes of interest then you extract the hash value

2733782
hash	md5
private key encryption of an md5 hash and save your self from all key provisioning and master secret exchange problems see rsacryptoserviceprovider.signhash

2733811
folder	dir
i have the file nav.php in a folder named includes in a main dir called testsite

2733845
setinterval	settimeout
a coding mistake i ve seen more than once is code that uses setinterval settimeout and the handle gets overwritten and the interval persists unexpectedly

2733962
mouse	keyboard
java.awt.robot class is used to take the control of mouse and keyboard

2733962
mouse	keyboard
once you get the control you can do any type of operation related to mouse and keyboard through your java code

2734004
getter	setter
objects can have members object variables and properties members with setter and getter

2734047
setinterval	settimeout
note to others commenters even though settimeout setinterval http-request onload events xhr and ui events click focus etc. provide a crude impression of multi-threadedness - they are still all executed along a single timeline - one at a time - so even if we don t know their execution order beforehand there s no need to worry about external conditions changing during the execution of an event handler timed function or xhr callback.

2734057
ant	maven
there are plugins for maven and ant that can help integrate this additional source into your build

2734063
superclass	subclassing
thing is i have a user superclass and two subclassing privateuser and businessuser

2734063
getter	setter
each field has its getter and setter

2734067
post	get
yes you re right.you should get data in the controller then display it in the view.and what you describe in your question is exactly like the example in the cookbook .assume you have related then with post hasmany comment you can find the count using

2734084
post	put
i decided to put it out explicitly here because although his link does have the answer to my question the post itself does not

2734108
post	get
i found a blog post which advocates mapper.reset to get round the problem however the static nature of the mapper class means that it is only a matter of time before a collision and crash occur

2734128
int	double
unfortunately they only have overloads for 2 args for int long float and double arguments

2734153
apache	nginx
the only scenario where can think this might occur given that cant see why django would generate a 502 is that you are using mod_wsgi embedded mode with nginx front end proxy and the apache server child process is crashing

2734154
inherited	properties
the line-height properties is inherited from parent to child - so specifying a line-height on will affect all elements on the page except the ones that have their own line-height properties set and their descendants

2734158
union	distinct
unfortunately the list of disqualifying query elements for auto-parameterization is long for example forget about using distinct top union group by or etc. so you really cannot count on this for performance

2734158
sorting	filtering
if the literal values change based on user actions for example like filtering or sorting viewed data then the queries will not benefit from caching except occasionally when they accidentally match a recent query exactly

2734167
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval are examples or at least pseudo-examples of a host environment providing a way to do some concurrency even if it s not exactly concurrency

2734224
public	protected
what i ve done is created a class with only one protected int property and next i made a public method to set the int property to a given value

2734224
inherited	properties
the way i could think of doing this was to create a sub class to inherited said class and then create a method to get the int properties of the super class

2734224
getter	setter
p.p.s also i know it s a bad idea to expose the property instead of making it private and use public setter getter methods but i like it this way

2734241
subtraction	addition
furthermore it seems like you are only supplying one argument to your all your arithmetic methods addition subtraction etc although they require two

2734255
entities	entitymanager
3 to test its navigation properties properties that return other entities you first new an entitymanager our unit-of-work context-like container add or attach the entities to the em and off you go

2734255
entities	entitymanager
8 i can export an entitymanager s cache of test entities to file or a test project resource

2734285
superclass	subclassing
however one can generate subclassing of the type being processed or the superclass of the type being processed

2734378
hide	show
the way i have done it is in the function where i do an ajax post i show a dialog before the post and after the ajax post i hide it

2734399
width	height
width and or height of elements may grow or shrink by at most 1 pixel

2734456
maven	pom.xml
with maven it s just a case of opening the pom.xml file in the ide

2734456
maven	pom.xml
in tackling dependency issues maven makes any dependency tweaks explicit a change to your pom.xml overriding the dependency rather than implicit as is the case with manually managed jars in version control where the jars are simply present with nothing to support weather they are the correct dependency or not

2734543
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried in google-chrome and firefox

2734547
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome both show it normally and even in firebug when i add padding-top it doesn t work

2734555
submit	submission
if you really want your teeset survive until the next submit you must enable a long-running conversation before showing and disable after submission your form

i am developing a rich ipad app and i have two background images specifically designed for landscape and portrait

2734578
uitableview	nsindexpath
in the - uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath in do select on the indexpath as index only

2734642
hash	md5
the md5 hash for that is 0a74d5fb3da8648126ec106623761ac5 so you might store it at.

2734685
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i don t think any browser obeys clientaccesspolicy.xml or crossdomain.xml for xmlhttprequest

2734778
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview called activityview which contains two subviews activityindicator and canceloperationsbutton

2734788
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
you could go the c way and use malloc realloc but realloc will just allocate a new block copy the old stuff into the new stuff and free the old block sometimes anyway

2734860
drawrect	touchesmoved
basically in drawrect i will draw the line from touchesmoved as finger touches and i will call needsdisplayinrect for redraw

2734925
folder	directory
i have made a folder in joomla directory

2734941
equals	gethashcode
these structures make heavy use of gethashcode and equals

2734946
persistent	transient
it s no longer a detached entity but rather a transient one that just happens to have the same id as the persistent one and updated fields

2734946
persistent	transient
i could copy the fields from the transient entity to the persistent entity one by one but this doesn t work too well when it comes to relationships and i d have to handle version comparisons manually

2734949
equals	gethashcode
equals object and gethashcode

2734951
post	get
this is soley so that when people comment on a post users watching the post can get an email about it

2735045
switching	screens
in both these cases if you reduce the screens size say by switching to 800 by 600 resolution the button and every other screens element will appear proportionately larger

2735048
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
ie 6 ie 7 ie 8 firefox 3+ google-chrome and safari mac

2735052
getter	setter
you can add a property to a class using a getter and a setter in a simplistic case

2735057
int	double
create a separate entity sample with an int index and a double value scalar property

2735082
int	chars
if the field is a byte chars short int compute int f

2735097

the other way to do it might be to use the builtin functions globals issubclass and isinstance

2736129

int	chars
secondly the zero chars is called zero chars for a reason it is equal to int zero

2736499
int	chars
chars type in c++ is just a plain int type after all

2736499

2736505
hash	salt
biffabacon directly addressed my core question in his 2nd paragraph basically anything you can do to maximize the domain of the salt being used and therefore the hash passwords being generated is good but there s lots of tasty info in various comments on this question

comparing a precomputation attack against a hash username salt and a random salt let s say for example the attacker decides to create dictionaries for the most common 1000 usernames and say half a dozen different hash algs

2736697
hash	salt
so when the salt space is dramatically reduced like it is by using hash username precomputed attacks become much more feasible

2737414
for-loop	loops
or otherwise instead of using a for-loop for the rows just use a foreach loops on the rows in the table and add the rows one by one with datagridview.rows.add newrow

2737457
googletest	cppunit
googletest and cppunit seem to share somewhat the same syntax for invoking tests but as i suspect have too much differences in that syntax

2737457
googletest	gmock
i m almost sure you can t somehow automate it and this operation would require rethinking and recompositioning of your tests to follow the googletest semantics if you use something specialized to create your mocks then porting them to gmock would require even more effort simply because gmock s approach is not the obvious one and is actually complicated

2737497
inherited	properties
i normally make all of my .aspx pages inherited from a base page and on this page i set up properties for any data that i want to share

2737497

2737536
try-catch	exception-handling
you don t need to cover every block with try-catches because a try-catch can still catch unhandled exception-handling thrown in functions further down the call stack

2737612
subtract	add
a datetime is immutable but the add and subtract functions return new datetimes for you to use

2737638
hash	salt
the salt is some data which should be somewhat unique to each hash password instance

2737638
hash	salt
using the user name or hash thereof as a salt leverages user name uniqueness usually on a given system at a given time user names are unique

2737638
hash	salt
however this does not prevent time-wise sharing the attacker precomputes a hash dictionary with the salt corresponding to user bob and will regularly try to guess bob s password assuming that bob changes his password on a regular basis because this is mandated by his system administrator

2737640
int	boolean
is_milestone intend seems to be to compare the decimal value of the string 22 with the int 21 or 1 boolean result of 21 1 depending on the version

2737642
put	get
to get the space between the different boxes you have to put each textbox within a panel set the the and the

if this is the reason for considering the port then remember that gmock can work with other test frameworks - not just googletest

2737891
serializable	deserialization
i ve been working with xml serializable deserialization in .net and wanted a method where the serializable deserialization process would only be applied to certain parts of an xml fragment

this will make the list look dimmed and disable mouse inputs but it still doesn t disable keyboard input

2738204
websphere	ibm
i have one machine running a java web service on ibm websphere

2738205
integer	unsigned
which would be -1 in a two s complement 32-bit signed integer value or the highest value that can be stored in a 32-bit unsigned integer value

2738210
integer	unsigned
4294967295 is the analogous value for a 32-bit unsigned integer type

2738242
hash	salt
a pure hash isn t the best idea for the reasons given but better than nothing but i think it s an entirely different story if you do a hash of an application-wide salt + username

2738285
getter	setter
always use eclipse getter setter generators

2738343
accessor	properties
you will need to build your object in two steps and use the properties accessor

ubuntu	linux
platform development is ubuntu linux mit php 5.2.4-2ubuntu5.10

2738499
min	max
in c++0x numeric_limits will have everything marked with constexpr meaning you will be able to use min and max as compile-time constants

2738559
fileoutputstream	filewriter
usually better than filewriter already suggested is to use fileoutputstream which also like filewriter has an append parameter in one of its constructors and which unlike filewriter does not silently assume the default charset encoding slightly bad practice imo

2738576
min	max
as others already mentioned numeric_limit s min and max simply aren t integral constant expressions compile time constants

2738585
put	get
code splitting you put splits in your code allowing the browser to download just the code it needs to get started and download the rest when it s needed great for apps with very large amounts of client code

2738604
versioning	upgrade
as a rule of thumb increase the versioning number when you move or export the code when you swap or exchange or upgrade between locations when you make a demo and after each feature or milestone and each time when you do a full backup

2738624
versioning	upgrade
the problems were fixed in newer versioning of oracle but we do not have those versioning and since there is no immediate plan to upgrade we have to code around this

2738627
min	max
also your two comparisons operators should be or equal since the min max values are also valid

2738627
min	max
you could try catching the exception and returning false but at that point it likely would be much faster to do the min max testing yourself

2738634
pop-up	dialog
it looks simple yes i know but now the problem is when i send the invitation i get a new tab opened leaving the dialog in facebook terms because pop-up means another thing for them

2738656
post	get
basicly almost anything significant requires connection to website using get post or multipart post so webclient will be perfect

2738677
jboss	weblogic
i have an ejb deployed under jboss we re moving a project to it from weblogic i can get an ejbhome reference to the ejb via a jndi lookup

prng	random
you could instead seed the prng directly with mkstdgen keeping in mind that the same seed will result in the same random number sequence

2738839
pop-up	dialog
i have some pop-up dialog on my webpage in each of this dialog i have defined some click event with jquery

2738892
portrait	landscape
i would like to have a root level controller that appears to be a splitview but i would also like to allow the detail view to essentially take over the entire screen in both landscape and portrait orientation - and not as a modal view

2738916
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
if you need a pixel-perfect design which is a silly goal then definitely use pixels for the sizing of all elements - width height margin padding

by default gwt richtextarea is transparent against the body background etc this is true for firefox google-chrome and safari

2739047
min	max
simply load the value that you want to be the maximum into a cfdiv or a cfinput hidden field using binding then access that value in a javascript function that validates the min max values when you submit the form

2739052
min	max
i am very sure that the code you posted should return an evenly distributed random number between min inclusive and max exclusive

2739077
min	max
2- if you want to get max and min number for a given data type then use these definitions

2739136
background-color	transparency
check if the richtextarea component uses iframe element - it s body should have style background-color set to transparency

2739217
width	height
declare width and height as const unsigned ints

2739281
uitableview	reloaddata
when the data arrives you either reload the whole table with uitableview reloaddata or you insert new cells individually with uitableview insertrowsatindexpaths withrowanimation

2739282
post	get
this class was probably produced by a broken compiler. and get cant rid of them i think they come from some apache jars that i need to make http multipart post

2739306
post	get
in fact most of the user-accessible pages if they use sql calls at all are almost inevitably pages that use a get or post depending

2739322
public	protected
type method get_ should be public protected virtual or protected internal virtual

2739322

2739481
vsto	add-in
i found this microsoft white-paper on vsto for office 2007 add-in deployment very useful

2739481
vsto	add-in
specifically on the question of the manifest i found out the hard way that when the registry key for the add-in had the same name as the add-in itself for some mysterious reason during the build the manifest value was being silently replaced from the vsto manifest to the add-in manifest

2739521
put	get
this is probably precisely because the caller is guaranteed to know how many arguments it put on the stack while the called function might get it wrong

2739524
button	checkbox
in order for the submit button to be active ove checkbox minumum must be selected

2739538

as md5 would be unique for each entity and it represents the hash value

2739866
width	margin
setting up the paddings of both boxes margin and messing around with the width

2739926
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
but if you insist on using two divs what you want to do is remove the height width statements and apply margin 2px

2739944
put	get
typically if you want to measure the time spent in the inner loop you ll put the time get routines outside of the outer loop and then divide by the outer loop count

2739964
superclass	subclassing
or does the subclassing s constructor override the superclass

2739974
superclass	subclassing
the subclassing s constructor usually must provide all parameters to the superclass s constructor

2739974
superclass	subclassing
see my code to see how my subclassing constructors provide the parameters to the superclass constructors

2740016
init.d	pid
i modified this init.d script which uses a pid file instead of the program name

2740022
put	get
put a bit of actual complexity in this and thing get ugly really fast

2740074
post	get
i don t get any errors so i m not sure what else to post

2740105
folder	directory
i know that when i want a viewresult using the view or partialview methods the default view engine will search through the folder in the views directory associated with the controller if my controller is called register it will look in the register folder under views and also in the shared folder

2740112
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox

click on the title in the balloon the link should open in a new window work in ie and firefox but not in safari google-chrome and opera

2740112
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
one on the left created with dom function as shown in this question which works in all browsers and one in the balloon created with an html string this one don t work well in safari google-chrome and opera the link is followed after the new window open even with the return false

2740128
inherited	properties
i would like to set up a table-per-hierarchy inherited mapping for the base sub1 sub2 relationships but using the disciminator properties from the joined class as the discriminator

2740132
width	height
determine the aspect ratio of both height divided by width say so tall skinny rectangles have an aspect ratio 1

2740142
minimum	max
it s not quite as simple as multiplying by the max and then adding the minimum value of course

2740177
innodb	myisam
if you weren t to require innodb on the servers you d have to do some more coding to rollback changes on myisam tables

2740180
terminate	timeout
retry the attempt if it fails until the console application terminate or a reasonably short timeout period expires

2740186
free	malloc
if you are actually using c++ you should consider using new and instead of malloc and free or better yet use std vector instead of an array as neil pointed out

2740197
post	get
while this isn t directly addressing your question the standard way to eliminate duplicate form submissions with the refresh button is post redirect get

2740205
subtract	add
then i recursively subtract the first and add the last value

2740317
uiview	subviews
i have some a uiview with several user created subviews

2740341
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the error says that you re sending the message bytes to an instance of nscfstring which is a nsstring even though you declared it as a nsmutablestring because this is a dynamically typed language but the class types are not automatically converted if you try to cast it to something else

2740368
rpm	yum
i ve added a little groovy script in the maven build for my needs at the end to auto update a yum repository that hosts the builds but in your situation i d probably use the script before the rpm plugin is used to call make

2740374
fdt	swc
i ve made a library which i d like to compile to an swc file i ve tried to do this in fdt by choosing fdt as3 library as run settings but all i end up with is a 0kb .swc file

which will paint all the text red when the window width is less than its height

2740539
ati	nvidia
they also need to be tested on both nvidia and ati hardware to be sure they work properly

2740564
post	put
i have put the code for the postscontroller commentscontroller and post index.html.erb below and also my view code but will post more if needed

2740568
google-chrome	safari
in any browser other than safari or google-chrome i can tab into a set of radio buttons and select one using the arrow keys and the change event will fire

2740568
google-chrome	safari
in safari or google-chrome i can tab into a radio group and select a radio button with arrow keys but the change event never fires

2740597
jython	pypy
other versions of python jython ironpython pypy etc may not behave in the same way

2740633
mouseout	mouseleave
i had it working with mouseout but when i entered over a child element the mouseout triggered so i know i need to use mouseleave

2740633
mouseleave	mouseenter
it seems functions won t work when i use mouseenter and mouseleave but

2740633
mouseover	mouseout
they do work when i swap them to mouseover and mouseout

2740662
range	infinity
i have a code table where each row has an upper and lower range column and i need an entry that represents a range where the upper range is the maximum value an int can hold sort of like a hackish infinity

2740670
cos	sin
so you would need to figure out the quadrant of the transform which 90-degree section of the circle it s in and take the reciprocal of the sin which is the cosecant and the reciprocal of the cos which is the secant of a and c of the matrix

2740686
min	max
setup a table that has three columns typename max and min

2740686
min	max
you can find all the max min values here

2740711

the dealloc method in my custom object gets called the nsdata object is released its retaincount 1 just before

2740753
hide	show
i am using a bit of javascript to show hide sections of a site when a tab is clicked

2740792
int	chars
the author probably one prone to writing obfuscated code may have wanted to ensure that a string of minimum of 5 chars converted to hex was not an considered an int

2740835
clearance	devise
sorry for this stupid questions i know what i can easy use any nice auth-plugins authlogic clearance devise but i want to fully understand sessions

2740837
mongoengine	ming
ming represents an interesting middle ground between pymongo and mongoengine though i haven t had the opportunity to take it for a test drive

2740838
free	malloc
technically speaking free is used to remove memory allocated using malloc from the heap

2740844
post	get
if you authorized your application to access your twitter account when the application was set in read only access mode and you get the read-only application cannot post error after changing the application settings to be read and write access then you have to revoke access to the application on and then reauthorize it

2740871
pop-up	dialog
the pop-up works fine but when the user hits enter the alert closes as expected but the textarea listener receives the enter event from the alert and pops the dialog up again

2740932
casting	autoboxing
looks like you are writing an integer through autoboxing to the serial file and attempting to read two objects casting them to biginteger

2740966
equals	gethashcode
this is weird because i ve overloaded equals and gethashcode on both the base class and the superclass

2740987
post	get
this blog post seems to be reporting a similar error but i still don t fully understand what i need to configure to get this fixed and also i am hoping that there is a simpler solution than another third party library

2740992
realloc	malloc
they key situation in which you must use malloc is if the original code ever calls realloc

2741041
children	parent
right now i have a db class that deals with connection and escaping values etc a parent db query class that deals with the common queries and methods and all of the other classes thread upload session photo and ones thats aren t used post user etc are children of that

2741048
free	malloc
also you should call mpz_clear at most once for every mpz_init they re like malloc and free in this regard and for the same reasons

2741048
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
small numeric optimization you can update last_row_pos using an addition and subtraction rather than two subtractions a multiplication and division

2741052
free	malloc
the key point on this is that what is allocated with new must be free with delete and what is allocated with malloc must be free with free

2741052
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
so about the only time you need malloc is when you need to pass data off to some c code that might free or realloc it

2741104
disk	ram
you can try installing some of those ram disk utilities and keep your obj directory on the ram disk or even whole project directory

2741113
int	double
one way to do it is to downcast your floats or double to int at the last possible moment when you need to pass the values to a method call

2741161
datamapper	activerecord
basically there is four prominent data source architectural patterns from patterns of enterprise architecture table data gateway row data gateway activerecord and datamapper

2741177
put	get
originally it was used inside the page now i ve put it in a file on its own and does not work anymore so i m dividing it in parts because i fail to get the whole thing

2741217
margin	height
the height of the div will be the paragraph without the margin

2741217
margin	height
the height of the div will be the paragraph plus its margin

2741219
int	chars	int	boolean
i m not allowed to use global variables and i must assume 32-bit int 16-bit chars and 8-bit boolean

2741228
mongoengine	ming
both mongoengine and ming depend on pymongo - they just put some nice functionality on top of it

2741252
children	parent
now when it copies over any related children it can look up the new parent pk to set the fk on the new record

2741256
daemons	systemd
for more on multiprocess and multithread models in relation to apache embedded systemd such as mod_python and mod_wsgi and mod_wsgi daemons mode see

2741295
mouse	keyboard
input emulation fake keyboard or mouse signals can be generated in lieu of direct human interaction

2741347
udp	tcp
good network support udp tcp

2741353
folder	dir
i have used the dir command in microsoft access 2003 to loop through the files in folder a

2741353
folder	dir
the problem is that checking for the file existing in folder b also uses the dir function and this then resets or confuses the original one with the result that no further files are found in folder a

2741360
fadein	fadeout
i want to fadeout the first div in a collection and then fadein the next div

2741360
fadein	fadeout
when it got to the nth content it would start over fadeout the nth content and fadein the first content

2741374
division	modulo
you could adopt j s somewhat nonstandard convention of for division because it kinda looks like the division symbol and | for modulo

2741402
inherited	properties
both entities don t share a common superclass to implement some kind of inherited with the id properties

2741407
width	height
i ve got a flex app running at 100 width and 100 height

2741442
haskell	ocaml	haskell	scheme	ocaml	scheme	lisp	scheme
if you want to look at some powerful tools commonly used by academic language designers i suggest that you check out functional programming languages ml scheme lisp haskell ocaml scala clojure etc.

2741442
yacc	cup
tools off the shelf like yacc antlr flex and cup can make building your compiler easier like buying wood from a lumberyard to build your house is easier than going off into the woods and cutting down trees

2741444
int	boolean
the company i work for now uses a set naming convention for their c# variables such as isomename for int ssomename for string asomename for arrays bsomename for boolean dsomename for datetime and so on

2741476
many-to-one	one-to-many
if you name your new entity userclub you would need a one-to-many from user to userclub and from club to userclub and many-to-one from userclub to club and from userclub to user

2741506
jruby	mri
for example ruby have ruby mri interpreter jruby java .net ironruby etc

2741553
perl	tcl
thus c perl python ruby and tcl are born

2741553
haskell	scheme	lua	scheme
thus haskell lua ml pascal scala and scheme are born

2741553
lisp	scheme
for a counterexample i think scheme programs ran faster and used less memory than the lisp programs that preceded them mdash

2741565
webkit	gecko
en-us applewebkit 525.13 khtml like gecko version 3.1 safari 525.13 this regular expression would return webkit 525.13 webkit 525.13

2741573
inherited	properties
generally the way you do inherited in javascript is by assigning the child class s prototype properties to an instance of the parent object

2741573
inherited	subclassing
they re truly private not protected subclassing can t see them except by methods they inherited

2741589
concave	convex
if i run a convex hull algorithm on it it would not preserve the concave part of the polygon. unless i m mistaken

2741629
put	get
i can do a crude implementation where following every get i do a put

2741637
put	get
i want a centralized repo at each location as 1 i m new to git and do break my personal local repo by playing around and 2 some projects get put on hold so i want to be able to free up disk space by deleting them

2741691
put	get
simply put the convex hull is the shape you get if you put a rubber band around all of the vertices

2741693
for-loop	loops
i would also add that even if a declaration were allowed where you had it the variable would belong to the scope of the for-loop and so the variable would no longer be visible after loops out of the scope

2741755
post	get
1 this page does support post get i think it does

2741777
stdout	stderr
as a side effect you won t be able to see stdout and stderr without redirecting them to a log file.

2741784
strcpy	strcmp	strstr	strcpy	strstr	strcmp	strlen	strcpy	strlen	strcmp	strlen	strstr
functions allowed and should be included in the code string functions - strlen strcpy strcat strchr strcmp strstr

2741814
width	margin
imo this works better then using divs with the width style attribute especially when using it for dynamic resizing calculations the table will have a simpler dom which makes manipulation easier because corrections for padding and margin are not required

2741833
gitorious	gitosis
you can pay for a private github repository or roll out your own git repo on linux using gitorious or gitosis

2741833
pull	push
then the usb stick comes in and they pull push their changes

2741842
width	height
determine the height h s and width w s of the square you re placing

2741878
for-loop	arrays
if you don t do this then the variable basically gets passed in by reference and the index will exceed the bounds of the arrays at the very end of the for-loop which may happen long before the closure is ever executed

2741897
subtract	add
the way i think of it is like this a unit test establishes that the code does what you intended the code to do you wanted to add parameter a and b you in fact add them and don t subtract them functional tests test that all of the code works together to get a correct result so that what you intended the code to do in fact gets the right result in the system

2741898
int	chars
if the field is a byte chars short int compute int f

2741916
mouse	keyboard
i have solved this issue i used low level mouse hooks and low level keyboard hooks to implement the solution

2741949
hash	salt
the salt should definitely not be hash otherwise it s unusable

2741956
svcutil.exe	basichttpbinding
the solution to this was the simplest just change binding wshttpbinding to binding basichttpbinding in the service s web.config and the client s web.config or re-run svcutil.exe after changing the service s web.config

2741978
sorting	filtering
but i haven t found any that truly extend the control to the extent that you could have custom sorting with header images filtering by putting drop downs or textboxes in header columns on a column by column basis and custom paging one that doesn t return all records but just returns the ones requested for the given page

2742002
junit	jmock
i come from a java eclipse background and i fear that i am spoiled by how easy it is to get junit and jmock running in eclipse and have that gui with the bar and pass fail information pop up

2742003
width	height
it takes parameters for width height and bits per pixel and they are dwords 32-bit so do a search for 58 02 00 00 20 03 00 00 and 18 00 00 00

2742014
dictionary	map
now if you have arbitrary dynamic attributes that can change at runtime then a good way to accomplish that is with a map or dictionary type

2742024
udp	tcp
you can set key with tcp protocol and get with udp protocol

2742024
serializable	deserialization
support customized serializable and deserialization

2742031
put	get
i went ahead and put a bounty on this question so maybe i can actually get a good answer to this

2742064
filtering	grouping
uncheck grouping items by category and in the filtering box type doc

2742065
subtract	add
use paste special with operation add i guess subtract would work too

2742118
cpu	hyperthreading
unfortunately each mysql thread is bound to one cpu but i have 4 cores well 8 with hyperthreading

2742133
ivar	subclassing
at the moment i ve subclassing nsapplication and added an exitstatus ivar which i set in my app delegate when necessary then overridden -terminate so that it calls exit exitstatus

2742184
hash	salt
in the context of your other questions you should reference this code in both the code that you use to create a new user in order to log the initial password hash salt and format and in the onpasswordchanging so that you can check reject insert

2742207
subtract	add
add the volume of this prism to your total if the triangle runs ccw and subtract that volume if it runs clockwise

2742258
google-chrome	firefox
when i look at this published google docs document i see the latest version with firefox and google-chrome but an older version with ie8

2742259
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
of course this would only apply to explicit throwing of runtimeexception and not implicit ones like nullpointerexception

2742296
post	get
ideally get a call stack of the devenv.exe main thread with symbols loaded and post it here or even better attach to the connect bug

2742307
dygraphs	fusioncharts
devexpress componentone tel.. mschart fusioncharts jplot dygraphs ifragestics dotnetcharting amcharts are no goods.

2742319
google-chrome	firefox
this works in ie8 firefox and google-chrome but in ie6 7 the table is incorrectly stretched to fill the width of the page

2742370
post	get
i am just curious if i can get from where i am using the current_user methods across controllers to display in post index.html.erb to where i want to be

2742379
width	height
i would need to detect the original width and height of the input source video an h264 f4v

2742402
width	height
make an image of the same width as the uitextview make it the right height for your requirements and position it so that it covers the lower edge of the uitextview

2742429
hide	show
i m using jquery to show hide the table rows that do not have the search term as text within the tr but i d ideally like to take the additional step of taking the search term the entered value and matching any of those text terms in the remaining showing rows and adding say a yellow background to the word s

2742437
public	protected
yes a public ctor on an abstract class is meaningless and a bit misleading as it will behave as protected in that only derived classes may call it

2742446
public	protected
i d assume that the reason that the compiler doesn t complain is as simple that they just didn t spend time covering that since it really doesn t matter if it s public or protected

2742447
int	chars
given a string consisting of a single chars followed by a number one or two digits i would like to split it into a chars and an int

2742463
superclass	subclassing
in .net one can specify a mustoverride attribute to a method in a particular superclass to ensure that subclassing override that particular method

2742463
superclass	subclassing
essentially what i want is to push for subclassing to override a method in a superclass that itself has some logic that must be run-through

2742463
super	abstract
i dont want to use abstract methods or interfaces because i want some common functionality to be run in the super method but more-or-less produce a compiler warning error denoting that derivative classes should override a given method

2742473
agile	sprint
their v3 template looks pretty good but microsoft s agile template has some awesome reporting capabilities and their planning spreadsheets look very handy as well - i found that sprint planning using sfts was painful

2742484
hide	show
then simply build some basic javascript logic that when you chose building a as starting point and building c as destination you hide all polylines and show the a c line only

2742485
public	protected
the answers on that question come down to the same thing in the end it does not really matter if you declare it protected or public

2742487
google-chrome	firefox
i tried the following code in both google-chrome and a smil-enable firefox nightly but it has no effect

2742549
boost	stl
stl is preferable as i don t use boost for any other parts of the code though i wouldn t mind an example with it

2742611
debhelper	apt
to reproduce the builds its a good idea to have debhelper installed or let apt satisfy the dependencies automagically by using

2742616
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
no runtimeexception and its subclasses are unchecked-exception

2742616
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
the subclasses of runtimeexception are unchecked-exception classes

2742647
maven	pom.xml
now when you do a maven package or a maven install it will copy the version.properties file into the web-inf classes and do a search and replace to add the pom.xml version into the file

2742717
min	max
make the following substitutions for max and min

2742717
min	max
there s also another min farther down and a max near the beginning of the function so do the same with those

2742717
min	max
replacing the min s and max s really helped to reduce the time

2742747
folder	directory
in our cms we have a header folder inside the template directory

2742749
hash	salt
the text of their password must be concatenated with the salt and then this combined string may be hash and stored in the database in an nvarchar field

2742800
put	get
interestingly i m able to get this to work just fine on my local machine but when we put it on our main server which is a multi-node cassandra setup i get the behavior described above

2742834
width	height
if the textfield appears but the foreignobject element lacks a width and height attribute technically the browser that does that doesn t follow the svg spec since those attributes are required for the foreignobject to be visible inside the svg

2742857
width	height
if you move all attributes i.e modified width height and expiration to elements then customers can automatically map your product specification 1 1 to json or their internal object

2742863
gif	png
clear out the parts you want to be transparent and save it in a format that handles transparency such as png or gif

2742915
children	parent
please note that if the parent of t1 has any other children the above will remove all those children too

2743077
error-handling	exception-handling
2 the normal error-handling for new is to raise an exception-handling so checking the returned pointer is useless

2743252
tabcontrol	tabitem
i would like to create an animation which will slide the tabitem from the bottom of my window to the tabcontrol itself and add some fade in effect too

2743316
folder	directory
i have a commonly named .sqlite file contained within many unique user s home folder with file structure home user unique-ip-address folder file.sqlite i ve decided to move all of these .sqlite files to a tmpfs mount and have already done so maintaining the full directory structure so each .sqlite file is now in mnt tmpfs home user unique-ip-address folder file.sqlite

2743316
folder	dir
i would like to append the new .sqlite location used in dev shm to file.ini in their home folder after dir in the file.ini

2743332
opera	firefox
cause opera and firefox did not support non free codecs

2743334
post	get
effectively because you re specifying post the server is expecting all the parameters to be in the posted data not in get variables so it s not checking the url to retrieve the parameter

2743334
post	get
i d suggest using firebug in firefox to debug what s going on with this sort of request in the future but the main take-away is that if you re sending parameters as part of the url use get not post

2743355
execl	fork
to create a new child process in unix you must first call fork which clones the existing process and then within the child call execl or some related system call to replace child process with the program you actually want to run

2743366
uptime	reboot
the problem is that after one week uptime server is running out of memory and needs to be reboot there are quite many users and i cannot run debugger on this production server so i would need to simulate somehow use on my local pc

2743403
implements	sealed
you could expose the interface as public implements an internal sealed implementation of that class and use a factory approach to build instances of the desired interface

2743403
accessor	properties
you could also eliminate the set accessor in the interface and put them in the internal implementation to only expose the properties to the outside world

2743437
rsa	aes
the symmetric cipher aes uses a key length of 256 bits which is 32 bytes about 30 times less data to encrypt decrypt using rsa than the kilobyte of data you encrypt now

2743437
rsa	aes
so the 115 seconds will be reduced to 3-4 secs plus the encryption decryption time used for aes which is much faster than rsa

2743522
hide	show
when i put the show script into the page this function sottped working as did the show hide on the checkbox lower down in the page

2743535
qtreeview	qabstractitemview	qtreeview	qmodelindex	qmodelindex	qabstractitemview
you can find the qmodelindex of the item receiving the drop by giving the qdropevent pos parameter to the qabstractitemview indexat method of the qtreeview

2743541
subtract	add
i have seen a lot of info on how to subtract one datetime from the other and how to add years on to a datetime

2743565
ant	maven
mixing maven and ant in a way that disables the benefits of both

2743605
accessor	properties
we d like to have trivial java properties accessor using a single line syntax so they take up much much less space and are more readable in terms of seeing the set of accessor quickly

2743605
accessor	properties
in fact we d rather not have trivial accessor at all and instead just annotate the private member variables with properties or something and have the accessor generated for us since writing endless get and set code delivers no real benefit but that s a general java frustration and an aside as far as this question goes.

2743620
ant	maven
10 - mixing maven + ant

2743645
rss	feed
besides sending to an email address instantly daily weekly it allows you to create an rss feed out of it

2743647
toolbar	tabs
as you can see not only are the tabs exaggerated but the toolbar is too so is the toolbar on the bottom

2743654
ant	maven
10 mixing maven and ant in a way that disables the benefits of both

2743659
jrebel	hotswap
compilation within the ide and hotdeploy hotswap jrebel will also save you a lot of time

2743696
gmp	bigint
that will be much faster than the php implementation done in crypt_ even if they use bigint or other c large integer implementation like gmp

2743799
google-chrome	firefox
current google-chrome and firefox pre-releases support it and i have a feeling that the google-chrome frame will support it too in a future release which would mean that you can even use it in internet explorer and other browsers

2743802
button	checkbox
then if a user selects some or all of these checkbox then the selected record s can be updated only one field will be updated btw possibly by clicking a button

2743808
many-to-many	one-to-many
however many-to-many relationship in fact uses double one-to-many relationship

2743825
post	get
if you just have a single name across all checkboxes then the list of ids will be passed into a single post variable which you can get straight from request.post assuming you re submitting your form as a post which you should be

2743829
client-side	server-side
this library can be used both client-side and server-side

2743848

i have a project in that root directory i have a plugins folder which has a submodule called myplugin

2743878
debian	linux
you haven t told us what os you re on but the defaults on debian linux are

i am a javascript jquery prototype newcomer and i have a page that has a prototype function to get info from a database and put it into some input fields

2743911
hide	show
this was made before i came to work on this site and now i ve been asked to add a hide show div function

2743911
hide	show
i found this resource hide show div with prototype but i have no idea on how to implement it

2743919
fink	macports
neither macports nor fink are installed

2743940
min	max
you can have some limited control over the pool by specifying min max numbers of threads and some minor tweaks like that

2744050
postgresql	mysql
i want to know why relational database like mysql or postgresql doesn t good for twitter-like application

2744092
disk	ram
this error might indicate you re running out of ram but alternatively it could mean you re running out of swap disk space

2744101
hide	show
on my new customer page i have successfully implemented a jquery show hide toggle alongside a prototype script using jquery s .noconflict

2744104
onreadystatechange	onload
the other way you could go is to investigate the onload and onreadystatechange events provided by browsers

2744118
bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
this works fine when type is png or tiff but with jpeg or bmp it just produces a black square

2744124
versioning	upgrade
so i ve got two options - use regular expressions to filter the email which i m not that skilled at doing and would be more vulnerable to exploitation after i leave turn off register globals and then try to teach the staff what i m doing or try to get them to upgrade their versioning of php and mysql and or change web host

2744125
width	height
i m looking to create a flexible width height page layout with no window scrollbars

2744158
getter	setter
1 use the existing fund model as is ignoring the setter getter for fund amount

2744160
put	get
you re going to find it hard to get the results you want there unless you put a dummy order into the system for every currency on every day which could be easily done in the fill_calendar routine for testing

2744173
getter	setter
option 1 could confuse a person that reads the code and could tempt someone who doesn t understand your code fully to use those setter getter due to some misunderstanding

2744186
packets	multicast
the multicast address will be the receiver s address not sender s address in the packets

2744222
filesystems	ntfs
i am using djgpp compiler for dos in that i have to use windows.h which is a win32 api for conversion of system time to file time for ntfs file system.as windows.h is win32 api it is giving error windows.h-no such file or directory .so how to convert system time to file time 8 byte structure in ntfs filesystems for ntfs filesystems in dos

2744274
division	modulo
integer division of by can be done in php with casting while modulo uses the operator

2744284
xsl-fo	xslt
from your xml source you can use xslt to generate xhtml or xsl-fo but not both at the same time

2744287
post	get
third would be to call cfm with post request which can handle larger structs then get

2744289
firefox	safari
in firefox safari and ie8 automatically vertically align the text of it in the middle correctly

2744309
switching	screens
but if i start my application and switching to another application outlook before the my splash screens is shown the icon is not displayed in the windows task bar

2744319
int	chars
the array of long words looks like strings at first glance so it looks superficially like we re dealing with an int argc chars argv situation except the argv array is inline in the stack frame

2744329
folder	directory
depending on the type of the file you add it in a different folder under res directory

2744364
vb6	vba
a collection in vba and vb6 for that matter

2744384
width	height
in this case i do a uniform scale of the image to be less than or equal to the width and height of the outer jpanel

2744384
width	height
the maximum width and height is respected

2744384
width	height
there is likely some more width and height taken up by the border around the jpanel or something like that

2744410
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
if i replace oracle.dataaccess.client with the microsoft system.data.oracleclient it all works again but is not full of odp.net lovelyness

2744445
gif	png
i have a number of images png gif and jpg in my application resource bundle

2744445
gif	png
also a gif image gets copied nicely and works but this problem occurs for png image

2744452
super	self
never use super self.__class__ self

2744452
super	self
you call a.m method for b instance so self.__class__ is b and super self.__class__ self .m refers to the same method a.m so a.m calls itself instead of calling the method of base class

2744453
public	protected
another problem is that usernames aren t usually protected you can see them through apache s user directories anonymous ftp often allows the public directory to group things up by username etc

2744454
post	get
that way your application will be protected not just from post injections but get injections and cookie exploitations as well

2744493
ssl	https
you re specifying that the address is using ssl https so it would require a certificate for that purpose

2744504
inherited	properties
usually because objects can inherited methods and properties from other objects and in a relationship database there is no equivalent

2744537
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i build the uitabbarcontroller in the appdelegate where i also assign an instance of my uinavigationcontroller for each tab

2744571
virtualenv	yolk
activating the virtualenv doesn t change this because there s no yolk script in your virtualenv bin dir

2744571
virtualenv	yolk
this is why installing yolk into the virtualenv fixes the problem

2744571
virtualenv	yolk
because it adds a yolk script in your virtualenv bin dir that has the virtualenv s python in its shebang line

2744571
virtualenv	yolk
if you don t want to install yolk in each virtualenv you could also just copy the yolk script-wrapper from usr local bin or wherever it is into your virtualenv s bin dir and manually change the shebang line to point to your virtualenv s python

2744571
virtualenv	yolk
this won t work with a --no-site-packages virtualenv though because the script wrapper then won t be able to find the actual yolk packages it needs to import

2744571
virtualenv	yolk
if you want to use yolk within a --no-site-packages virtualenv really your only choice is to install it there

2744609
getter	setter
to figure out whats going wrong i set breakpoints for the clientid and siteid getter and setter in the linq to sql designer generated classes

2744616
firefox	safari
i did some testing with ibrowser and some versions work with firefox 2 and older but not firefox 3 others don t work with internet explorer or safari

2744687
metaclass	subclassing
the first thought was to subclassing the metaclass and put the other registry in

2744730
int	double
by generic i mean the type of list to create may be a list string list int or list double

2744783
min	max
you can find useful tips in the ibm powerpc compiler writerâ s guide isbn 0-9649654-0-2 though - there are a number of examples of branchless implementations of conditional sequences max min which might give you some ideas

2744839
width	height
i used a bg image for my popup window whose size is 500px width and 400px height

2744849
rss	feed
this article from msdn i found really helpful with creating an rss feed

2744857
post	get
i have seen many post about this problem but didn t get an answer

2744954
rss	feed
how to generate rss and atom feed

2744961
opera	google-chrome
i guess google-chrome opera will also support something like this

2744981
principalcontext	userprincipal
i am currently using principalcontext and userprincipal to return the users primary groupid

2745014
nunit	mspec
when i add the mspec machine.specifications assembly to the references both resharper and testdriven.net stop running the nunit tests and only run the mspec tests

2745028
google-chrome	firefox
internet explorer and firefox work fine for this but google-chrome always changes the cursor to the text cursor

2745045
uilabel	uibutton
i have 4 labels uilabel and 1 image uiimage and 3 buttons uibutton

2745072
min	max
so as you cannot use sum or avg you can use the min or max

2745097
pull	push
read more about git push and git pull on gitready.com the article i referred to first

2745099
pull	push
git push is used to add commits you have done on the local repository to a remote one - together with git pull it allows people to collaborate

2745120
postgresql	mysql
for example google uses bigtable rather than an rdbms the likes of mysql postgresql sqllite3 etc for faster read-write

2745131
calloc	malloc
ps to make your code more reliable don t forget to check if a malloc calloc failed

2745146
boost	stl
is there a more natural way to do so using existing algorithm in boost or stl

2745225
submit	submission
originally i was setting and clearing the disabled property on the specify occupation textbox then i found out that upon submission the form disabled fields are excluded from the submit and the required validator on the specify occupation textbox was being raised because the textbox was being blanked out

2745271
mvp	presenter
i m developing a application using mvp and i have a question about how inject my dependencis in my presenter class

2745290
int	double
you declare a struct and from then on it s a data type much like int or double

2745290
calloc	malloc
or by allocating memory for one with malloc or calloc

2745290
calloc	malloc
the other difference is that malloc returns memory with whatever used to be in it while calloc initializes everything to zero

2745290
calloc	malloc
no cast is required in c it is required in c++ but you usually wouldn t use malloc or calloc in c++ and the only thing it can do is cover up a possible mistake leaving out to be specific

2745292
punctuation	words
i m one of those who prefers words to punctuation -- it s one of the reasons i ve picked python over perl for example

2745310
integer	fractions
date times in excel are stored internally as numbers representing the number of days since year 1900 jan 0 plus a decimal part representing a fractions of 24 hours for the time so your date is coming through as an integer

2745332
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout
replace mouseover and mouseout with mouseenter and mouseleave

2745386
aggregate-functions	sum
for completeness having is like where but for the already aggregated grouped values such as max in this case or sum or count or any of the other aggregate-functions

2745400
goto	break
think of break in this case as a goto end_of_switch

2745459
opera	firefox
performance of the getcontext approach is 85-90 slower in firefox 11 and opera 11 and about 55 slower in chromium 18

2745466
width	height
the sdk allows changing the width of keys in a row as in thickbuttons but ideally i d like to be able to vary both the height and width of keys within a row and still have the keys occupy all the available space.

2745518
folder	dir
first i created a raw dir and then i added the folder with the audio files

2745542
x86	64bit
however since i cannot use their package with x64 perl on a rhel 5.4 x86_64 box and maintaining a seperate install of x86 perl just for this one package i have made an attempt to get this puppy working thanks to released 64bit .so s that accompany other driver packages for advantage

2745563
getter	setter
there is no real harm in exposing getter in the interface and if you want your implementation classes as immutable declare them as final and don t expose the setter

2745582
for-loop	loops
you can use a for-loop and break out of loops at the first successful choice

2745591
folder	directory
if you have moved your users directory to a drive that is not called c it will not work - a workaround is to copy the .android folder from e users username .android to e users username .android - then it should work

2745636
rss	feed
there s an rss feed i m tapping into that has the locale set as en-gb

2745661
jobs	cron
quartz is better in my opinion because you can even set it up so that it fires your jobs at fixed points in time like cron jobs eg

2745763
division	modulo
it will be slightly faster than the ops code because the modulo and the division is performed using the same instruction on the processor because the compiler can see that they are equivalent

2745779
folder	directory
the code you posted is going to look in your main directory the folder with the license system user_guide etc

2745823
post	get
so i set a variable in my main ruby file that s handling all my post and get requests and then use erb templates to actually show the pages

2745896
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
i tried using position relative with the width height and margin 0 auto

2745917
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox google-chrome opera

2745917
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the result in firefox google-chrome opera is what i d expect

2745949
getter	setter
you can try to create a wrapper property in the partial class extending the entity code that will create an instance of the jimsnapshot in getter and write the correct xml in setter

2746004
rss	feed
i ve got part of it working but the part where i m trying to bring in an rss feed of the category into the sidebar to show as recent posts

2746096
free	malloc
if you need to create an object that will outlive the process which created it you ll need to use malloc or new to get a block of memory from the heap and remember to free or delete it later

2746098
try-catch	exception-handling
so i have to wrap it in a try-catch to catch that specific exception-handling

2746104
mts	legacy
we have a legacy vb6 component that was com+ mts and is used by asp classic

2746153
jax-ws	jax-rs
if you need something more sophisticated you can use some webservice technology like jax-rs or jax-ws

2746217
width	height
i want a webpage with a variable height full width header height based on contents

2746230
versioning	upgrade
anyway i think i upgrade too soon because now embarcadero announced the 64 bit compiler so probably i will have to pay again a lot of money to upgrade to the next versioning of delphi in order to get that compiler

2746244
getter	setter
so all you need to do is to create the property with a public getter and setter

2746285
std	ostream
one great example is that your stream operator for your types is if you re doing it right refering to std ostream as the stream not cout

2746287
inherited	properties
i would like to implement a kind of hierarchy where any elements within an element with class admin will inherited properties set in the admin stylesheet and anything else inherited from the customer stylesheet

2746306
rss	feed
the way it works both systems have to have rss atom feed which represent the data or at least events on the data object at url xyz created .

2746335
versioning	upgrade
so i upgrade the wordpress to the latest versioning

2746351
width	height
a width and height

2746362
profiling	benchmarking
if you hit my blog via my profiling and contact me i will let you know when the tests are complete and you can use them as a benchmarking as to what exactly is expected from the default stack

2746431
ati	nvidia
in fact for a long time the only drivers you could get were not written by ati nvidia etc. but rather by hobbyists

2746509
symlink	realpath
if sympath is a symlink to realpath then

2746533
qtreewidget	qtablewidget
if you want to be able to group downloads under different categories you can use the qtreewidget which will also allow for multiple table cells per row like the qtablewidget

2746555
hide	show
i have a javascript where i need to hide and eventually show some text by clicking a button

2746565
button	checkbox
its working fine if i click the button it checks the checkbox

2746590
width	height
the data structure acts as a node in a doubly linked list with sorted insertion as well as containing the coordinates of the top-left corner and the width and height

2746590
width	height
the less straightforward case where the space to be removed can only be found within a column or row of boxes is only partially implemented - if one of the blocks to be removed is an exact fit for width ie column or height ie row then problems occur

2746597
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
the issue is that uinavigationcontroller ideally should be the direct subview of uiwindow

2746597
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
when you add uinavigationcontroller into another custom view of a uiwindow subview you need to take care of the position and size of this custom view by taking into account whether the status bar is shown or not in the uiwindow

2746667
hide	show
however you could use javascript to show a div on mouse over and hide it on mouse out

2746675
prepare	execute
so you can use modelattribute method to prepare the array this method will be execute before the requestmapping method

2746705
integer	unsigned
for example the method getbytes can convert variables of many different types into a byte array and the method touint16 returns a 16-bit unsigned integer converted from two bytes at a specified position in a byte array

2746743
for-loop	arrays
the function creates a closure so the variable you re passing in row is it s own copy scoped correctly for what you want here instead of the i being what it was at the end of the for-loop and your function getting the last element of that arrays

2746746
width	height
i suspect that you ve given the image elements width and height attributes because that s how they re represented in html

2746755
freemarker	velocity	freemarker	thymeleaf	velocity	thymeleaf
other candiates are 3rd party templating frameworks such as velocity freemarker and thymeleaf which can be configured as a view technology for spring mvc

2746755
freemarker	velocity
spring documentation has integration examples with velocity and freemarker

2746776
hash	md5
use an md5 hash of the contents of the file

2746780
fadein	fadeout
jquery offers fadein and fadeout functions

2746786
versioning	upgrade
seriously if that s the only way because an upgrade to the express versioning of sql server 2008 would probably be better than sticking with sql server 2000 at this point imho

2746789
octal	hex
you can use echo to emit specific bytes using hex or octal

2746799
freemarker	velocity
my previous answer was getting badly dated here. freemarker is at least as good as velocity

2746799
stateless	stateful
jsf like asp.net webforms attempts to create stateful component trees on top html markup and the stateless http protocol

2746895
xstream	jackson
the representations sent back and forth between server and client include xml using the xstream serialization library json using jackson xhtml java object serialization and as of yesterday kryo

2746895
int	boolean
we have a set of javabeans that have string float int long date boolean and list fields

2746903
free	malloc
dmalloc is a library that replaces malloc and free with extensive debugging versions capable of using page boundaries to detect memory overruns underruns filling allocated and free memory leak-checking and more

2746948
mouse	keyboard
you don t want to stop methods being invoked on the ui thread because the method invocation mechanism is the same as the one that allows things like mouse and keyboard events to work

2746962
accessor	properties
also make sure the generate accessor and generate objective-c 2.0 properties options are selected

2747017
cpython	ironpython
i would like to know how to use visual studio with cpython the official python.org python interpreter not ironpython

2747041
odt	opendocument	gnu	groff
it can read markdown and subsets of restructuredtext html and latex and it can write markdown restructuredtext html latex context pdf rtf docbook xml opendocument xml odt gnu texinfo mediawiki markup groff man pages and s5 html slide shows

2747041
textwrangler	bbedit
bbedit textwrangler

2747041
textwrangler	bbedit
bbedit and its free variant textwrangler for mac can syntax-highlight restructuredtext using this codeless language module

2747046
g++	gcc
use g++ to drive the linker not gcc

2747117
instances	transient
note that ifoo and bar are registered with the transient life style which means that the already-resolved instances has to be passed to bar - it can t be re-resolved

2747146
superclass	subclassing
i get a nullpointerexception calling a superclass method in subclassing inner class constructor.

2747162
jar	war
if you get a report of a missing class try unzipping your war file or looking in the exploded webapp directory of your app server and see if the necessary jar is there

2747182
superclass	subclassing
i know that the subclassing will call the superclass constructor before calling its own constructor but what if i have some code on the superclass that should only be executed after all the subclassing constructors have been called

2747191
post	get
to get the count of how many comment rows you have for all post you can use a nested select statement

2747239
hide	show
i posted the js since i also changed it to use jquery s show hide

2747242
folder	directory
you should put it in a new folder in the program files directory

2747246
x86	64bit
c program files x86 environment variable programfiles x86 for 32-bit applications on a 64bit version of windows

2747251
freemarker	velocity
i would recommend using freemarker or velocity

2747285
children	parent
and is there anything in the standard that specifies whether parent domains can access their children s databases

2747314
pull	push
dvcs users clone the dvcs repository pull changes from it and push changes back to it

2747344
pull	push
basically they re saying that if you re using git to access an svn repository don t share your git repository with anyone else via push pull

2747344
bazaar	git
the subversion folks have some dvcs capabilities on the roadmap probably spurred by the success of svk and the growing prevalence of git mercurial bazaar

2747362
firefox	safari
it works fine in firefox but safari displays only the inset shadow

2747381
charindex	substr
you can implement something like this by using the reverse function to make searching easier in which case you ll be parsing the string from left to right instead of right to left like i said above the patindex or charindex functions to find spaces and commas and the substr function to pull the address apart based on the positions found by patindex and charindex

2747386
put	get
however when i run it and put values 1 2 and 3 on it type is just a alias for int in this case and reverse it i get 2 1 3

2747395
maven	pom.xml
i want to use checkstyle in my maven based project so in my pom.xml i have add the dependency

2747403
post	get
to get to the bottom of this could you please post your code and the actual contents of the error message

2747422
hide	show
i m looking for a way to show hide an arbitrary richfaces component

2747422
hide	show
each row needs to have it s own independent show hide link such that when you click show details two things happen

2747422
hide	show
the show details link is re-rendered as hide details

2747422
client-side	server-side
i also don t want to have a server-side bean keep track of which detailcolumns are being displayed and subsequently re-render everything over ajax this should be purely client-side behavior

2747431
pop-up	dialog
i m using the jquery ui dialog for a modal pop-up dialog

2747431
google-chrome	firefox
it s working great in firefox google-chrome but terrible in ie6

2747435
int	double
particularly int for the digit and long if strictly double the size of the int for intermediate representations when adding and multiplying

2747457
post	get
go post a question pre-sales technical etc. up on and you ll usually get a clear and concise answer within a day

2747503
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
strip the time from mydate you will need to use nscalendar and nsdatecomponents

2747518
gridview	repeater	gridview	datalist	datalist	repeater
the gridview datalist and repeater get their respective databind methods from basedataboundcontrol basedatalist and repeater classes

2747621
width	height
in your regular master.css or css3.css file you would give it your width height rounded corners and drop shadow with styles

2747621
width	height
for that same div#page_container you may alter the width a bit height maybe some padding then give it a background-image to make it look like the drop shadow rounded-corner version

2747621
firefox	safari
likewise because you didn t hard code in the rounded corner graphics that every browser would see your firefox and safari users won t need hit the server with extra image calls

2747627
division	multiplication
for multiplication and division you need to adjust for the offset

2747651
rbm	autoencoder
that being said what does tend to make a big difference is pretraining the network weights either as an rbm or as an autoencoder

2747690
ubuntu	debian
for instance ubuntu is a debian derivative so debian is upstream for ubuntu

2747720
xunit.net	specflow
there is an example for specflow with xunit.net in the specflow-example repository

2747721
getter	setter
getter and setter are bad

2747721
getter	setter
briefly reading over the above article i find that getter and setter are bad oo design and should be avoided as they go against encapsulation and data hiding

2747746
getter	setter
getter or setter by themselves are not bad oo design

2747746
getter	setter
what is bad is coding practice which includes a getter and a setter for every single member automatically whether that getter setter is needed or not coupled with making members public which should not be public - because this basically exposes class s implementation to outside world violating the information hiding abstraction

2747751
maven	pom.xml
i want to use checkstyle in my maven based project so in my pom.xml i ve add the dependency ...

2747773
getter	setter
java-style getter and setter proliferation are symptoms of ignoring this advice

2747776
getter	setter
the way i read it the author argues that blindly putting getter and setter around fields is no better than just making the field public

2747776
getter	setter
i believe that the author argues that getter and setter should be placed sparsely and with care because the idea of oo is that objects should limit their exposure to what is needed only

2747801
rss	feed
i ve done something similiar with my rss feed but this sitemap refuses to work

2747873
gif	png
just press save and give it a name and that photoshop image will be saved into a transparent background png file which presents more colors and it s smaller than a gif file and is as good as a jpg

2747882
free	malloc
because of python s malloc frontend obmalloc and how it allocates smaller objects in blocks of its own and how process memory works on most operating systems this means your process will allocate more and not be able to free it

2747888
gif	png
i use this function to resize images but i end up with ugly creepy image with a black background if it s a transparent gif or png with alpha however it works perfectly for jpg and normal png

2747889
getter	setter
2 exposing data members with setter getter with no caution allows callers to ruin the class invariant very easily

2747889
getter	setter
unfortunately there are some frameworks which encourage sometimes require adding setter getter for everything

2747901
serializable	deserialization
they have a custom serializable and deserialization handler

2747918
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
otherwise perhaps you could load your dropdownlists via a sqldatasource or objectdatasource

nginx	lighttpd
one final note nginx and lighttpd use x-accel-redirect and x-lighttpd-send-file instead of x-sendfile

2748010
getter	setter
as drawnonward points out setting self.containerview is the same as calling self setcontainerview and if you re using synthesize to generate your getter and setter your setcontainerview method will look something like this

2748030
width	height
the problem is the image width is resize correctly but height is devided by 13 instead of 3.9 in my case

2748052
realloc	malloc
use realloc but you have to allocate the array with malloc first

2748054

put	get
because blockinglist is expecting to get 10.0 first and not 9.0 it will block on thread-1 until thread-2 finishes and calls put

2748392
xsl-fo	xslt
generating xsl-fo and xhtml from xslt is not necessarily an either-or choice

2748392
xsl-fo	xslt
generally it wouldn t be worth the hassle to have your xslt create xsl-fo and then convert into xhtml just generate xhtml directly unless you want to create both output formats pdf and xhtml with reduced effort

2748415
hide	show
the application has an option to show hide the excel sheet so you can look at it make any final changes and so forth

2748552
cvs	svn
everyone i work with has used svn cvs and vss shiver so this could be quite a large change

2748574
pop-up	dialog
moreover by breaking the direct dependency on input now if you were to port this code to something else later that didn t use a command line you could just drop in the new code to retrieve input whether that would be a dialog box in a gui application or a javascript pop-up in a web-based application etc.

if you don t set a width at all or a height for that matter than the div will not show unless there is something in it

2748712
width	height
around those divs i would have the container div with a defined width and height and overflow set to hidden

2748720
getter	setter
but best practice is to declare the attributes as private and access them via getter and setter

2748749
min	max
my approach was to use the max min functions 10 functions to sort 4 numbers no branches iirc

2748753
next	except
exiting at the first match is really easy instead of computing a full list comprehension then tossing away everything except the first item use next over a genexp

2748756
width	height
adding a width and height won t make the total page load faster since that depends on your network speed and the size of your page in bytes

2748760
ogre	irrlicht
i prefer irrlicht as a lighter easier-to-learn but less feature-complete api than ogre

2748789
google-chrome	firefox
javascript will run very different between internet explorer vs firefox vs google-chrome

2748799

2748801
agile	scrummaster
here s where the value of a scrummaster lean agile coach comes in

2748811

the comparators are essentially the same as your s x y function though if you really want this to be fast you shouldn t be using min and max because then you re doing twice the number of comparisons that are necessary

2748835
xslt	xquery
functx -- a library of useful xslt 2.0 and xquery functions

2748840

2749406
post	get
i need to use get and post at the same time

2749414
post	get

2749557
profiler	gprof
here s a quickie along with examples on how to use gprof which is the gnu profiler for c

2749563

yes you can use fseek to go a certain point in the file then fread to read it into a buffer or audiofilereadbytes

2750046
move	drag
i implemented the cctouchesbegan move ended methods to drag the ball around

2750087
httprequest	httpresponse
keep in mind that the convention is for view functions to take an httprequest object as their first parameter and to return a httpresponse object

2750087
httprequest	httpresponse
but if you really aren t interested in using httpresponse or httprequest objects perhaps you should just not call your methods views

2750103
mp3	wav
audiofilereadpacketdata and audiofilereadpackets shield you from the details of for instance how big a frame might be in bytes because you might be reading from a wav file which has a different structure to an mp3 file or your mp3 file uses a variable bit rate

2750158
ubuntu	debian
it allows you to deploy a minimal ubuntu or debian version of your choice into a chroot environment

the current problem i m having is a conceptual one i know that sending a put http message with an edited post to post 52 should update post with id 52 with the body contents of the http message

2750389
hide	show
the advantage is that you can use logging levels to indicate the importance of the information so that you can configure externally which levels to show hide in the output so that you don t get annoyed by the -after all- useless information how the output should look like include a timestamp thread id classname methodname etc and where the output should be written to the console a file an email etc and in case of for example files also how they should be created group by year month and or day

2750390
post	get
as part of a jquery function u use this ajax post statement to get some reaction from a server

2750461
accessor	properties
the jit compiler ensures that an automatic properties is just as efficient as a field it inlines the accessor method call

2750489
int	chars	int	double
the generic method will work well if the type can be known at compile-time or if it s one of only a finite set of types and you ll pick a type that was named at compile-time user will say one of int chars or double and you ll use the correct generic accordingly

2750492
glassfish	weblogic
but if you need a full java ee server and if this is an option i would use glassfish v3 in embedded mode instead of weblogic it will be much simpler

i configured mercurial on iis 7 and i am able tu push and pull without problems some test files

2750575
int	chars
newline chars could work in this case assuming that i don t have n in the name but i could have special chars in the data part so there s no way to know when it ends so i m putting an int value in the file before the data which has the size of the data

2750575
int	chars
i see 4 null chars in the file when i open it instead of seeing an int

2750575

2750843
x86	64bit
can t speak for ppc arm a4arm but x86 has the ability to operate on data as if it was 8bit 16bit or 32bit 64bit if an x86_64 in 64bit mode although i m not sure if the compiler would take advantage of those instructions

2750861

runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
the unchecked-exception classes are the class runtimeexception and its subclasses and the class error and its subclasses

2751255
integer	unsigned
it takes four byte values and put together into a 32 bit unsigned integer

2751280
superclass	subclassing

2751881
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the first huge advantage is that you wouldn t be choosing one client platform vs another -- just support modern cross-platform browsers like firefox or google s google-chrome and your customers will be able to pick whatever client platform s they prefer if you also carefully check your app on safari which has much rendering logic in common with google-chrome via the webkit framework your web app will then be usable on ipad too

2751881
disk	ram
oh and the computational resources needed to run the application such as ram cpu power disk space ... are cheaper in bulk on a server or small group of servers and thus shared among those clients which are active at a given time than spread out over many clients including many who won t happen to be active at any givem time

assuming we have a width x height bitmap picture this wrapper class should serve the purpose of allowing me to send to other methods classes itself instead of the original bitmap

2752531
16-bit	64bit
a word is the number of bits a cpu can handle at once 16-bit 32-bit 64bit etc and in your example stores the address or perhaps offset of the next block

2752536
width	height
this way you go from five parameters to two since you don t need to pass in the bitmap and each bitmap presumably knows its own width and height

2752537
16-bit	64bit
it may be as low as 2 bytes 16-bit or as high as 8 bytes 64bit

2752627
width	height
using fill_parent and wrap_content for the layoutparams width or height can give some useful results

2752627

2755019
getter	setter
and i synthesize a setter and getter in my view controller

2755019
getter	setter
i could just ditch the setter and access the frontleft variable directly but i was under the impression i should use setter and getter as much as possible and logically it seems like the setfrontleft method should work

2755019
getter	setter
why use a setter and getter at all if you are in the same class as those setter and getter

2755024
hide	show
are you using the jquery ui accordian or using the jquery accordian which is more or less a series of show and hide which is used more commonly i would think

2755024
hide	show
depending on how your jquery is set out if you are building the accordian using just the regular jquery library you should be able to add in a call back to the show or hide and stick the block on after that is if it removed the display block

2755033
firefox	safari
in safari and firefox all is well not terribly fast but not terribly slow

2755464
try-catch	exception-handling
secondly the try-catch block you ve specified is generic enough to deal with any exception-handling that derives from std exception-handling - so having the bulk of your program code within the try-catch block isn t a bad thing

2755464
try-catch	exception-handling
it s outside the scope of your try-catch so an exception-handling here would kill the program unexpectedly

2755464
try-catch	exception-handling
if you were to decide to wrap most of the program in that try-catch block but would still like to dynamically allocate the simplemidiout object you could make the memory management a bit easier by using an auto_ptr to manage the memory for you in the event of an exception-handling

ubuntu	debian
so there is etc lsb-release containing this information which comes from ubuntu s debian base-files package

2756799
debian-based	linux
and no arch linux is not debian-based

2756807
postgresql	mysql
in my cases postgresql was better than mysql mysql do not completely support unicode

2756908
subtract	add
assuming sun jvm you have to add your permgen space to xmx and then subtract around 150-200mb or so for the os s kernel stuff

2756913
width	height
there is no way you can get the box to extend to fit the content except for not setting the width and or height properties fixed

2756913
width	height
use min- width height and max- width height instead of width and or height

2756953
post	get
i also suggest to check glassfish hot code re-deployment on maven especially the post about compile on save and to try glassfish you may get better results

2756989
accessor	properties
if you re referring to properties such as those in c# then yes they can since the properties accessor are strictly syntactic sugar for accessor methods anyway

2756989
accessor	properties
update since php does not have properties in the sense of get set accessor then the answer to your question is no

centos	linux
however when running on a 64 bit linux machine centos 5.4 with openjdk 1.6.0-b09 i add one mapping and print out the size of the hashmap used by keymapper to verify the mapping got added verify size 1

2757043
put	get
i m confident the mapping isn t accidentally being removed since i ve commented out all calls to remove and i don t use clear or any other mutators just get and put

2757071
getter	setter
in the getter you would simply return a new list from the original property and in the setter you would reconstruct the original set as it does not have the notion of order

2757085
min	max
rad 5km min 450000 max 1000000

2757094
post	get
update on the wcf side you can get around the problem by implementing a customcredential and customtokenserializer ref last post at

2757120
freebsd	solaris
how you would do that depends on your os on solaris or freebsd i would create a zfs file system in a file and then rm the file while the application is running

if you re willing to put in the effort to get it running and keep it running the web notebook interface is amazing

2757387
put	get
now i don t know what your groups relationship is with your customer but its not unusual for customers to take a put request in - get working system out attitude in that they are enthusiastic when giving requirements but not so forthoming with time when it comes to testing the feature

2757408
javassist	cglib
to achieve this you can use other proxying mechanisms - cglib or javassist

2757425
implements	extends
you cannot access any attributes using the dynamic proxy because it implements the interface it does not extends the handler class

2757425
implements	extends
you cannot access any methods not declared in the interface using the dynamic proxy because it implements the interface it does not extends the handler class

2757769
facebook	fbconnect
i ve configured fbconnect and it uploads to the wall but what i want to do is take a screenshot and then upload the screenshot to facebook

2757783
implements	extends
both backend_crud_controller and frontend_crud_controller have the same functionality and thus they should extends another class named base_crud_controller the only difference comes from the backend frontend controllers which implements different mechanisms

2757787
single-quotes	double-quotes
my json string looks like well formed with all data i even tried having single-quotes and double-quotes escaped around the names of the json string

profiling	debugging
treat this profiling like you re debugging

2757925
post	get
i can try and post the complete code when i get home tonight if anyone is interested

2757943
super	abstract
if you want to prevent constraints checking what comes to my mind is that you can either accept naturally thrown exceptions as polygenelubricants suggested or create an abstract super class to all your data structures based on arrays

2757943
public	protected
it s not perfect but i guess that a protected method that does not check parameters is better than a public method that does not do it

2757984
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this worked in ie6-8 google-chrome 4-5 safari 4 opera 10 and firefox 3.x with no obvious nasty side-effects

2758073
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql are used by the open-source crowd

2758075
jboss	glassfish
they are lightweight because they implement only a few of the specifications at the heart of which is servlet and jsp the larger enterprise level applications jboss glassfish etc implement much more specifications on the server side

2758107
min	max
if you prefer to choose the lowest id you can use the min aggregate function in the sub query instead of max

2758142
metaphone	soundex
there are better versions of the algorithm out there that were designed as a replacement for soundex see double metaphone or a t-sql version of double metaphone that you can use as a scalar function

2758182
button	checkbox
when a user clicks the button delete selected users a simple validation takes place to make sure at least one checkbox is selected

innodb	myisam
before you worry about the differences between myisam or innodb you need to have your tables layed out properly and having proper indexes

2758375
fread	atof	fgets	fread
a more foolproof way is instead to read using fgets or fread and then if necessary parse the string using strok to thereafter convert the tokens to your desired type atof in your case

to the best of my knowledge i can t do this with an enum because i have several sets of codes each with common behavior that i want to inherited and i can t subclassing an enum

2758480
ninject	spring.net
however i very much doubt explicit code is required to call dispose with either ninject or spring.net as both of these should already be disposing instances they manage

rsa	aes
rsa will only allow me to decrypt 117 bytes or less so when i go to decrypt the aes key it throws an error

2758898
folder	directory
the solution that i found is to make content folder a virtual directory and remove mapping from its configuration

2758961
public	protected
if i don t see an access modifier public protected internal protected internal then i can assume it s private although i try to be explicit about access modifiers

2758963
set-intersection	set-union
however set utilities such as set-intersection set-union and a function which eliminates duplicates in a list and built-in functions union intersection and remove-duplicates are allowed

pull	push
this is why you usually git pull to update a working directory and use git push on bare repos

2759090
cvs	svn
fyi to setup a bare repo for use as something similar to a central cvs svn etc repo do the following on the remote

2759090
pull	push
now you have a bare repo to push pull into from that contains your master branch

2759098
filtering	grouping
if i filtering out all table-a records that relate to a particular record call it x in table-b the report no longer shows the record-x grouping header

filtering	grouping
for records in table-b that are not linked to any records in the filtering table-a the grouping header and footer for these records will not appear in the report

2759125
int	boolean
clearly there is some basic concept about int pointers and or boolean that i am missing

2759132
inherited	subclassing
otherwise your code can stop working if you introduce a new subclassing that uses multiple inherited

2759157
implements	extends
i can t tell you how to do this in prototype but i once implements something similar in dojo the trick was to extends the xhrget -method which was responsible for ajax-requests

2759157
hide	show
doing that i had my own methods that would start on the request and handle the done -event where i could show hide a loader

2759165
hide	show
where startloading and stoploading are callback functions that show hide your activity indicator

2759179
strtr	multibyte
i believe strtr is multibyte safe either way since str_replace is multibyte safe you could wrap it

2759203
serializable	deserialization
c++ does not have any native reflection system unlike c# or java which prevents for example this kind of automatic printing serializable or deserialization

2759203
serializable	deserialization
another example would be to use fusion.vector or fusion.map to store the attributes of the class and then expose this sequence to automatic print serializable deserialization methods

2759275
outputstream	inputstream
however i don t know how to redirect the outputstream to an inputstream because the setblob method needs an istream as the input parameter

2759297
aggregate-functions	sum
before you brought the two different date ranges into the mix you could use group by to group using the table id on table1 and the sum aggregate-functions to add up the rows returned

2759306
ubuntu	linux
but we just set up a dedicated server for our cm software on an ubuntu linux server named callisto

2759340
width	height
width and height will always be zero in such a case

2759340

in the terminal go to the root of your java project so the default package in your situation the parent directory of the folder pacc

2759507
factors	mean
having a recursive query set for each load could mean trouble maybe little maybe lots depending on usage and other factors

2759541
maven	pom.xml	maven-jar-plugin	pom.xml
note the reason i want such a pom.xml and not rely on regular dependency resolution is that i have created a tests jar using maven-jar-plugin test-jar and using that jar as a dependency causes maven to not use its transitive dependencies

2759561
google-chrome	firefox
i have a page which works fine in firefox and google-chrome

2759649
inherited	properties
there s also the hasownproperty function inherited from the object prototype which will tell you if the object has the properties directly and not via prototype inherited

2759675
pop-up	dialog
it stops scrolling when mouseover and also has a pop-up dialog on relevant text

2759698
google-chrome	firefox
you could try setting the disablenativespellchecker property to false - it should then be possible to see the native spell checker markings within the editor - however for me i couldn t get this to work in firefox only google-chrome

2759719
client-side	server-side
parameters like sorttype works only with client-side sorting and will be ignored with server-side sorting

2759740
pop-up	dialog
if you push the button twice and wait 3 seconds you will see you get 2 dialog popping up one over the other where the expected behavior would be the first one pop-up then once it s closed the second one will pop-up

2759780
int	chars	int	boolean
according to the spec simple types are int real boolean chars enumerated red yellow green blue tartan and subrange 1..100

2759813
matplotlib	scipy
whenever you use numpy scipy matplotlib install the enthought python distribution

2759820
google-chrome	safari
my site behaves properly in google-chrome but has a bug in safari

2759842
hash	md5
assuming that md5 is a secure hash function it turns out it is not secure but for the sake of the discussion let s suppose that it is secure then it should behave like a random oracle a mythical object which outputs uniformly random values under the sole constraint that it remembers its previous outputs and returns the same value again given the same input

2759845
integer	unsigned
i think of the one-bit integer which would be 0 or 1 if unsigned or just the signed bit if signed or the two bit integer which would be -2 1

2759858
cpu	processors	disk	ram
for the purposes of this project the host environment is ubuntu 10.4 resources available are 8 gig ram 500 gig disk space free and 4 cpu processors at 3.ghz

2759880
jlist	jtextpane
however after double clicking on the jlist element the text gets inserted but the caret is not appearing on the jtextpane

2759887
integer	unsigned
you should first convert the hash output to an unsigned integer then reduce it modulo m

2759937
inline	inlining
the inline keyword and associated quirks including implicit inlining and auto-inlining

2759941
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
if you try to copy a file greater than 2gb from another filesystems ntfs to fat fat32 which has a 2gb limit you may see this error

2759957
postgresql	mysql
mysql uses the auto_increment column option and also supports a pseudo data type serial to give it some cross-compatibility with postgresql

2759987
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
now i have added nslog statements to track if the view is actually showing and both viewwillappear and viewdidappear get called

2760096
free	malloc
if you want to ensure that the array d is no longer eating up memory while your code is running you can either convert the code in curly braces into a separate function or explicitly malloc and free the memory instead of using automatic storage

here is my new approach and wanted to see if anyone can provide feedback code review before i implement my suggestion

2760201
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am displaying the following html to my browser firefox works however google-chrome and safari are not

2760201
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
what is displayed below in firefox is working as intended but safari and google-chrome are displaying a blue question mark with a box around it

2760201
google-chrome	safari
the 1x1t.gif file exists in the same directory as the script and everything works in firefox- however safari and google-chrome display a blue question mark.

2760206
spaces	delimiter
it is very simple to restrict the input characters to but i would like to have it display with a delimiter between bytes so for example if the delimiter is a spaces and the user types 0011223344 i would like the line edit to display 00 11 22 33 44 now if the user presses the backspace key 3 times then i want it to display 00 11 22 3

2760206
spaces	delimiter
in essence i would like to have a validator which conforms to this regex but i don t want the user to ever have to type a spaces as delimiter

2760282
ilist	icollection	idictionary	ilist	idictionary	icollection
the client provides a rich interface providing wrappers for .net s generic ilist idictionary and icollection mapping to redis s rich server side data structures

2760285
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox safari google-chrome and opera all show no performance degradation when i use javascript to insert a lot of data into the dom but in ie it is very apparent

2760297
post	get
i ve read several post in the internet about that silverlight only supports get and post and that the most of the web browsers too

2760307
firefox	safari
i find that using firebug for firefox the web inspector for safari or the developer tools for msie 8 helps me diagnose issues like this

2760341
getter	setter
if an object of the class is going to be shared by multiple threads you need to syncronize the getter and setter to prevent data inconsistency

2760341
getter	setter
if your instance methods are more than mere set and get you must analyze the threat of threads waiting for a long running getter setter to finish

2760345
ubuntu	debian
you may find certutil in the libnss3-tools package debian ubuntu

2760362
post	get
when using the browser http stack only get ans post are supported

2760387
hide	show
the script gives me the possibility to sort the widgets hide show content and change the color of each widget also it saves everything in a cookie to remember the position and style

2760392
folder	directory
you can put all your jsp files under a jsp folder and then symlink that folder into your web-inf folder in the exploded deployment directory

2760426
webclient	httpwebrequest
i d rather use webclient because it requires less code than httpwebrequest httpwebresponse

2760441
for-loop	loops
now normally you have a for-loop to help you keep track of things but int this instance i m not appending items in a loops and i keep getting an error saying x in undefined

2760472
pop-up	dialog
i want to provide a pop-up dialog editor for this inargument which will present a form to input the values of all properties

2760478
versioning	upgrade
this is a known bug - please upgrade to the latest versioning of php

2760529
serializable	deserialization
so if serializable deserialization is all you need then you can probably use something else

2760582
range	max
the load is expected to be rather high up in the 100k users per day max range but will be seriously load balanced

2760601
put	get
i am not sure if this is the best place to put it but i wanted to see if i could at least get it working

2760612
integer	unsigned
the resulting unsigned integer type is

2760612
integer	unsigned
the correct reference is â 6.3.1.3 signed and unsigned integer conversion

2760656
hide	show
i can try and provide more detail if it s needed but my basic need is the ability to selectively hide show omit from the measure arrange process certain children of a custom panel

2760689
identifier	ambiguous
however access specifiers may resolve ambiguous identifier overload errors that would otherwise prevent compilation

2760735
groovy	gsp
i have observed the exploded war folder under webapps has gsp files but not the groovy files

2760756
google-chrome	firefox
further if i remove my dtd then it will work just fine in ie8 but still not what i expect in firefox google-chrome

2760766
width	height
keep the width and height the same to make things easy on yourself

2760792
versioning	upgrade
it s silly to upgrade to an out of date versioning

2760804
int	double

2760911
hash	md5
to form a md5 hash of the data aaa

2760926
hash	md5
you cannot decode an md5 hash as hashing is a process that is best thought of as one-way encoding that is to say what is hash cannot be de-hashed

2760939
hash	md5
md5 and other hash functions are one-way you can t reverse the process

2760971
hash	salt
john the ripper is commonly used to break passwords using a dictionary this is a very good method espeically if its a salt password hash

2760975
hash	md5
to add to everyone else s point md5 is a one-way hash

2760975
hash	md5
going from an md5 hash value to the hash input is nonsensical

2761027

when the user changes the combo box value i have to update the grid with children details of newly selected parent

2761067
google-chrome	firefox
here is a quick example that works in google-chrome firefox

2761444
ant	maven
writing an ant script is not hard and ivy gives you better dependency management than maven

2761510
superclass	subclassing
note that a superclass never knows about subclassing the only reason you can call the two method and have b s version run is because the function two was defined in the parent a class

2761512
wxpython	pyqt
i converted recently from wxpython to pyqt and im still facing alot of problems since im still noob in pyqt

2761514
cpu	processors
a processors might use this for a reset vector such that writing to it causes the cpu to reset

2761568
arraylist	treeset
if the dominate time is spent in treeset iteration rather than modifying it then copying the treeset to an array or arraylist only when altered and only iterating over this array arraylist could almost elminate the cost of treeset iteration

2761576
postgresql	mysql
sql conformance in the target areas oracle has funny -- wrong -- null handling mysql is all over the map postgresql wraps unquoted identifiers to lower case

2761578
min	max
aggregation functions vary by db provider but might include things like avg max min etc

2761614
memcpy	strcpy
try using strcpy or memcpy with the appropriate casts

2761623
avr	microcontroller
if i remember correctly in an avr microcontroller the register file is mapped into an address space of ram and register r0 is at the address 0x00

2761627
springboard	backgrounding
this is not a case of springboard itself burning cpu time in the backgrounding it s just how some of this processing looks when running instruments or similar tools against the device

2761639
folder	directory
so here we have a folder with an asp.net 2.0 application within a directory that contains a classic asp application

memcpy	strcpy
you ll need to use strcpy or memcpy or something like the non-standard but arguably less error prone strlcpy

2761664
versioning	upgrade
i agree with hlglm that you should upgrade to the latest versioning of access rather than 2003

2761703
for-loop	loops
you will need to rewrite your foreach loops to a regular for-loop be able to do that without creating a bigger mess though

2761748
cos	sin
sin theta cos theta obj.fixedpositions

2761748
cos	sin
sin theta cos theta obj.fixedpositions

2761753
std	ostream
note also that you need to qualify ostream as std ostream since you should not use using namespace std

2761795
google-chrome	firefox
i m testing in firefox and google-chrome both are doing the same thing

2761805
put	get
to get closer to your question i would tend to expect that you do not want to put your input handling in your window class

2761809
next	except
the important thing to know is exception specifications are deprecated in the next revision of c++ except for the no-throw specifier throw which is basically officially saying don t use them

2761853
int	double
int double and so on

2761860
udp	tcp
at that point you begin talking about writing a protocol which will run over tcp or udp so that one side can tell the other side ok send more data or wait my bandwidth limit has been temporarily hit

2761889
multiplying	transpose
i think you want to transpose the matrix before and after multiplying by the rotation

2762089
put	get
however the 4th and final query i know is wrong because there is no projectid to be gained from anywhere however i put it there to help understand what i am trying to get

2762096
cassini	iis
if your asp.net project is setup to use iis and not cassini during the upgrade to .net 4.0 process it ll automatically change the application pool that your site uses to the new asp.net v4.0 application pool

2762130
pull	push
if this isn t going to be just a single repo and you presumably are sharing the branches this will become a problem when you try to push pull as the remote branches will have the last known history

2762131
noexcept	throw
note that noexcept checks for an exception throw by a failing dynamic_cast and typeid applied to a null pointer which can only be done at runtime

2762152
google-chrome	firefox
this doesn t happen when setting opacity on firefox or google-chrome but does happen on ie7

2762294
post	get
i m following the instructions from this post but cannot get my methods recognized globally

2762296
superclass	subclassing
i don t understand your motivation for rejecting instances of subclassing given that by definition they support all the behavior the superclass supports

2762310
equals	gethashcode
from msdn documentation it seems as both gethashcode and equals haven t been overriden in bitmap

2762338
mouse	keyboard
but if you do it properly you can do some really cool stuff i for example changed the entire game library api that access video mouse keyboard audio... of my game in the middle of development.

2762360
noexcept	throw
there is some overlap in the functionality of noexcept and throw but they re really coming from opposite directions

2762360
noexcept	throw
the primary purpose of noexcept is optimization it allows encourages the compiler to optimize around the assumption that no exceptions will be throw

2762385
equals	gethashcode
i have not provided a demonstration that equals and gethashcode are useless in a bitmap

2762487

2762583
boost	stl
you can be sure it doesn t matter what order you include stl or boost headers

2762610
width	height
cache your width and height properties locally rather than accessing them from the size struct on each iteration

2762632
mouseover	mouseout
along with john rashh s answer you could also handle the mouseover and mouseout functions separately.

2762702
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql and sql server 2008 all have geo-spatial features either natively or via extensions which include spatial indexing and implementations of the haversine formula

2762721
jquery	scriptaculous
i am in the middle of the road whether to use jquery ui or scriptaculous for drag and drop

2762721
jquery	scriptaculous
i also kind of get the impression that scriptaculous drag and drop is better than jquery ui drag and drop based on the online demos

2762721
jquery	scriptaculous
scriptaculous or jquery ui

2762762
tabcontrol	tabitem
the constructor of which takes the tabitem and the tabcontrol

2762766

2762843
udp	tcp
so no do not replace tcp with something else udp

2762855
tabcontrol	tabitem
the xaml for your tabcontrol and tabitem would look something like this

2762864
pascal	delphi
fpc lazarus is very similar to delphi but it s a different dialect of object pascal and it would be a mistake to think they re equivalent

2762911
wordpress	joomla
frankly i have little knowledge about internet security and how modern cms such as wordpress joomla handle this

2762921
httpconnection	downloading
downloading the images into memory or a local cache using httpconnection or similar then use bitmapfactory.decodebytearray to convert the downloading images into bitmaps and assign them to imageviews using setimagedrawable to display them

domcontentloaded	onload
you d usually do dom manipulation in window onload or domcontentloaded event

2762946
google-chrome	firefox
a very hacky but a css only solution that works okay in ie google-chrome and firefox

2762981
google-chrome	safari
this occurs in both safari and google-chrome

2762981
google-chrome	safari
unfortunately i cannot find a documentation for setfillcolor the coming html5 standard uses a different approach and does not appear to define such a method so i can t check whether that s a webkit bug webkit being what both safari and google-chrome are using for rendering or a difference in what args setfillcolor wants

2763057
uitableview	uipickerview
i just struggled with this for about 24 hours and got it to work by following this tutorial and wherever he mentions his uitableview just think about your uipickerview and replace the appropriate info

2763135
getter	setter
they re just fancy terms for getter and setter

2763136

considering that since then eclipse is in the process of mirroring all its projects in git repositories egit based on jgit have made some progress and are part of the eclipse ecosystem and is on par with its mercurial counterpart

2763269
int	double
the actual definition also has the assembly name _fun even though it takes an int instead of a double and the linker will merrily use this when fun double is called

2763269
int	double
c++ on the other hand mangles the assembly names so you ll get something like _fun int for fun int and _fun double for fun double in order for overloading to work

2763299
put	get
now i want to know if i can get a copy of android 1.6 or higher and put it on this device

2763306
int	double
fun int has a different signature in c++ and exists as a unique symbol whereas a c compiler or linker depending on visibility would produce an error when you declare both fun int and fun double as c symbols

2763307
domxpath	domdocument
the server works with domdocument and domxpath to get the data the autocomplete plugin has built-in client side caching do ease load on the server

2763345

you can use post and get as any standard html forms

2763468
awt	swing
if you use swing i recommend working with the awt internal drag and drop system

2763470
ddms	adb
maybe the emulator is running so slow and the adb server or another component like ddms is a little desperate because seems it s waiting to the emulator to iniatialize the some home aplication

2763470
ddms	adb
so for that problem i run program and when the emulator is opened i go back to eclipse in ddms perspective and in the device tab y press a button restart adb server before the console shows me the message of emulator-5554 disconnected

2763484
freebsd	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	freebsd
if it s ubuntu 8.04 plus ubuntu 10.04 that is different from several linux distros plus osx plus freebsd

2763496
google-chrome	firefox
i cannot see that much difference between firefox and google-chrome apart from speed...

2763577
implements	extends
i also have a generic messagedispatcher that implements imessagedispatcher that my components probably will extends

2763606
int	chars
for storing ip v4 address you may use 32 bit unsigned int - chars is insufficient

2763614

i ve tried it on ie firefox opera and it works

2763622
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

2763691
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this code is working on firefox opera google-chrome and safari but not in ie6-ie7

2763699
for-loop	arrays
i was considering whether some approach using arrays of function pointers so that initialisation is done in a for-loop might be better

2763720
width	height
width then percentages would be the right way assuming that the height of the 3 boxes may vary

2763744
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
all the jquery works fine in firefox google-chrome and safari but on ie8 it gives me errors and the banner at the top doesn t work which uses the crossslide jquery plugin and as well the image rollovers don t work with the colour change

in fact i can set the master view controller see the new viewcontroller correctly in landscape mode rotate back to portrait and the viewcontroller used in the popover is still the old one

2763860
gridview	entitydatasource
because the rows will be displayed on a gridview asp.net with entitydatasource but the child rows must be displayed directly under his parent

2763889
rdf	owl
for knowledge representation look at rdf and owl and to a lesser degree conceptual graphs

2763953

google-chrome creates an entirely separate process for the flash and therefore smoother safari is quite lightweight therefore smoother at times

2763970
many-to-many	many-to-one
mapping for some many-to-one and many-to-many associations

2763972
hide	show
show hide them with javascript

2764001
int	double
unfortunately you can t use decimals in attribute values as the clr itself doesn t really know about system.decimal type - it s not a primitive type like int double etc

2764052
typedef	typename
since whatever result you obtain depends on the template parameter typedef typename is necessary

2764059
fancybox	thickbox
therefore i m ruling out the use of thickbox fancybox and jquery ui

2764089
int	boolean
when converting a bool to an int the int value is always 0 or 1 but when converting an int to a bool the boolean value is true for all int except 0

2764099
int	boolean
there are two types of int ... int int ... boolean bool

2764099
int	boolean
so boolean are explicitly considered as int in python 2.6 and 3

2764100
redmine	trac
btw i would suggest to use redmine instead of trac cause it s supports many projects etc

2764144
post	put
if the problem is that these jars are included in sonar analysis because they are located in src main resources then one obvious solution would be to put them somewhere else see the post scriptum

2764154
super	self
method 2 use object_setclass self theclassiwant in initwithcoder before calling initwithcoder on the super class

2764154
superclass	subclassing
this also works well but not all the subclassing are necessarily going to be the same size as the superclass so this could be very unsafe

2764159
addclass	removeclass
instead of css i recommend using addclass and removeclass respectively

2764161
int	boolean
in general with boolean you should assume that while false will always have an int value of 0 so long as you don t change it as above true could have any other value

2764168
width	height
i ve been able to only change the height of the linkbuttons but i cannot do that with the width because the text is dynamic

2764175
width	height
to overcome this issue all you need to do is to have the correct aspect ratio between width and height approximately 1 1.4142 see paper size - the international standard iso 216

2764201
maven	m2e
to do so either use the maven-eclipse-plugin to generate eclipse specific files from your maven project or use the m2e plugin to make eclipse able to deal with maven projects

2764201
maven	m2e
just in case if you decide to install m2e make sure to install the optional maven integration for wtp component from the the m2e extras update site

2764268
client-side	server-side
you cannot mix logic on server-side and client-side like that

you know the function will never throw in the circumstances called by the noexcept functions but again the compiler doesn t more useless warnings

2764374
int	chars	int	double
double x int y chars z func

2764374
int	chars	int	double
is just as valid as void func double x int y chars z

2764463
hide	show
my main container div can be refreshed so its content is being hide show

2764497
perforce	svn
even if it is not the most current presentation you still have a good features array in perforce and svn in this document

2764497
perforce	svn
it can be useful to read perforce branch naming and repository structure guidelines as its structure is a bit like the one in svn perforce uses the repository structure to represent branches as well as other directory structures

2764699
width	height
the header should always retain it s height and the navigation always it s width

2764699
width	height
edit 2 another thing the header has got a fixed height and the navigation a fixed width

2764699
width	height
the height of the navigation as well as the height and width of the content should fill the entire screen

2764719
width	height
each section have 100 width and height

maven	pom.xml
-- pom.xml -- run maven from here for a multi-modules build

with this size assign the width and height in the div section

2764865
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i need something that will work in ie6-9 firefox 3.5+ google-chrome and safari

2764883
post	get
you should check post redirect get webdesign pattern it may help you to know how to create a good navigation system on your webapp and how to handle the back

2764893
minimum	max	min	max
preg_replace can have multiple references so if you made you first reference something like where min max is your minimum maxium number of characters you re trying to match in the beginning that match would be 1 and the next set of parens would be 2 and so on

2764937
inherited	properties
through reflection the new keyword only hides the inherited properties if the signature matches

edit copied from answer i have to add get put post and delete services to my tapestry application

2765220
ubuntu	centos
like joachim sauer said your best bet is to do your development on ubuntu then do the final compilation on centos

2765220
ubuntu	centos
edit a virtual machine is the most straightforward way to build on centos but if you want to avoid the memory and cpu overhead of running a vm and don t care about differences between ubuntu s and centos s kernel then you can create a subdirectory containing a centos or fedora filesystem and chroot do that to do your builds

2765224
google-chrome	firefox
edit runs pretty fast in firefox and google-chrome of course

2765251

the daemons launchd itself in the background so the process you would be starting is the bash-process that runs the script which then exits when the daemons is launchd in the background

2771747
hash	md5
what you are doing is right but no sha md5 and others are one way hash only so you can t unhash them well theoretically you could by brute force

2771823
google-chrome	safari
if i use 1.3.2 or older the plugin won t work on google-chrome and safari

2772013
equals	gethashcode
the base object class implements equals and gethashcode

2772013
equals	gethashcode
it s best not override gethashcode for mutable objects and make 100 sure that objects that return true for equals return the same hash code.

2772014
hash	md5
it doesn t even matter much what algorithm is used - one could even use md5 or md4 and the passwords would be just as safe there is a slight difference because computing a sha-1 hash is slower

2772049
datarow	dataview
you need to use a datarowview instead of a datarow and access the sorted rows from the dataview

2772136
superclass	subclassing
so the superclass should be get wrapped with a subclassing

2772136

the reason i ask is mostly due to how google-chrome installation works once you click the accept and install button from firefox

2772239
google-chrome	firefox
firefox does not show any save or confirm dialogs after you click the install button on google-chrome install web page

2772239
google-chrome	firefox
or might it be due to having an old version of google-chrome already on the computer note the new version was still installed from firefox

for value-types the default implementation of equals and gethashcode uses reflection which is likely to result in poor performance

2772837
post	get
in c# i would use post and get to retrieve information from a server as such

2772875
google-chrome	firefox
this is the code i ve ended up with it works in google-chrome and firefox but not in ie 6 7.

2772877
rss	feed

install the official release of django or web2py

2772879
width	height

2772929
stdout	stderr
2 cgi - the webserver starts up an instance of the interpreter for each request and passes parameters to the interpreter via stdin the command line and environment variables stdout is sent to the client and stderr should be written to the error_log

2772931
postgresql	mysql
first be aware as others have commented that postgresql and mysql have different ideas on what is a schema

2772974
bitwise-and	modulo	division	modulo
note that as long as stride and steps are powers of 2 the scary-looking division and modulo in to_index can be optimised to a shift and a bitwise-and but only if the operands are unsigned - hence i suggest changing those types accordingly

2772975
perl	tcl
i worked a system with around a dozen engineers that used c++ java sql tcl c shell scripts and just a touch of perl

that i animate to show hide instead of the keyboard but the keyboard animates on top of all uiviews

2773226
udp	tcp
it has to do with the difference between tcp and udp

2773226
udp	tcp
since udp is asynchronous as opposed to synchronous like tcp to recieve data you are not creating a binding to another specific machine so for example if you were to try

2773226
udp	tcp
the udp socket does not know where the data is coming from so there can not be a unique mapping like tcp also unlike tcp the port you specify is your machine s port not a remote machine port

2773226
udp	tcp
another way to think of it when you create a udp socket it is like creating a tcp server socket

2773226
udp	tcp
so in a way you can think of a udp socket as kind of like a tcp server socket and that is why you have to bind it to a unique port

2773227
ienumerable	iqueryable
iqueryable and ienumerable extension methods

2773241
children	parent

in google-chrome firefox this will work as expected

2776370
post	get
misunderstood your question thought you meant multiple submit buttons in one form on one page but now i think you meant one form going to another confirmation form...in your didrecievedata delegate method you will need to store all the html you get and in your didfinishloading delegate method you will need to pull out any hidden field names values and then create a new request with them as your post data and the url being the action url of the form

2776385
post	get
update to clarify i am using a get because this is a cross site include and a post will not be accepted into the variable scope of the http included file

some host languages lisp and scheme being the main ones have powerful macros so building a dsl out of macros is more common in those languages

2778173
geany	notepad++
i haven t used it for static html development - i stick with notepad++ or geany linux for that kinda stuff

2778207
bash	subshell
the syntax is defining a variable in the bash subshell rather than using the variable in make

2778225
equals	toarray
everything else being equals calling toarray first will impart a greater performance hit than when calling it last

2778237
post	get
still only a little more complex than most dynamic pivots so if the hints above don t get you there and you still want me to take a stab at it i ll try to post some actual working code later

2778247
width	height
i have urls like width 200 height 200 and with several other optional arguments

2778247
width	height
url cyclops-depict smiles input_smiles width 200 height 200

2778247
width	height
caught an exception while rendering reverse for cyclops-depict with arguments and keyword arguments smiles u co height 200 width 200 not found

2778275
post	get
urlconf search does not include get or post parameters

2778289
typedef	struct
i have the following struct declaration and typedef in my code

2778332
memmove	malloc
i don t need these calls to malloc and memmove

2778367
fontfamily	font-size
sorry for that but i was wondering if it is possible that the second choice font we specify in html using font fontfamily can be of a different font-size

2778388
fontfamily	font-size
this related question changing body font-size based on fontfamily with jquery cites using this javascript font detection library in combination with jquery javascript library to achieve what you re looking for

2778395
ctime	strftime
or still with strftime you can emulate ctime s format but with b for current-locale month abbreviation a for current-locale weekday abbreviation and so on

2778405
accessor	ivar
to clarify the possible bug is this when inheriting from a base class a child can not access the parent s ivar if that child also happens to implement an unrelated accessor using synthesize before the ivar is accessed

2778467
sorting	grouping
by sorting strictly by the grouping id i get a result set as follows

2778507
snmp	mib
however such customization is not standardized and you cannot make snmp queries using standard mib browsers or so on

2778513
google-chrome	firefox
then it works well on firefox and ie 8 but not on google-chrome

2778537
recursive-descent	lalr
which means a language grammar ll 1 lalr recursive-descent the dragon book and generally a splitting migraine

2778538
superclass	subclassing
however i think it s generally a rather bad idea to access an instance variable of the superclass when you implement the methods the superclass you cannot assume anything about the instance variable because it might be tweaked in a worst manner possible by the subclassing

2778542
mockups	prototyping
the powerpoint prototyping toolkit provides a collection of shapes such as textboxes and dropdowns that assist in creating form mockups

2778563
fadein	fadeout
okay - both of the following are working well enough in most browsers but in ie whenever i even move the mouse slightly the div starts fading in and out - and also can build up a queue or a loop of the fadein fadeout events

2778690
folder	directory
if the user visits any other folder apart from public folder from the address bar he gets a directory listing of that folder

2778711
robocopy	xcopy
i have tried xcopy robocopy and synctoy 2.1 and i cannot get any of them to work

2778742
hide	show
i want to make scroll bar responsive along with hide show div

2778756
ironruby	ironpython
ironruby has been out for 4 weeks ironpython for 4 years

2778756
ironruby	ironpython
also i believe the ironruby team is smaller than the ironpython team

2778756
jruby	mri
unfortunately they currently only support mri yarv and jruby

2778756
jruby	mri
and i m pretty confident that it wouldn t be too hard to add ironruby support to netbeans it already supports jruby mri and yarv

2778795
vmware	virtualbox
virtual server can not virtualise 64 bits system so you need to switch to hyperv require windows server vmware or virtualbox can be used on client os

2778805
concave	convex
the points can create a concave or convex polygon in a single plane

2778913
google-chrome	firefox
i want to install gwt developer plugin for ie i already installed it on google-chrome and firefox without any problem

2778913
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade my ie to latest 8 versioning even installed google optimized versioning of ie8 but it couldn t help me

2778954
hash	salt
best to use a salt also - hashing and verification should be done at server - see secure hash and salt for php

2778998
post	get
at the moment the first line of the function gets the id field from the form - i need to change this to get the id field from the ajax post which references a hidden field in the form containing the necessary value instead

2779026
put	get
you can use the routelink helper to put a url on a link just to get it and see what it should look like - then compare that to your actual url in the ajax request

2779034
min	max
first of all do notice that your definition within 5 minutes of each other does not define a single solution and that your min +max 2 is not average but simply middle of min and max

2779034
min	max
and finally your decision to stick with min +max 2 will lead to instances where you might have a single row which is far toward max and min which could make the query miss any of the results and can happen usually all the locations with similar names are next to each other but it is not uncommon to have another location starting with the same name which is an isolated place far from the conglomerate of locations

2779037
jquery	curvycorners
check out curvycorners it s a jquery plugin that will look at your css and find any css3 properties for webkit -webkit-border-radius 10px

2779112
udp	tcp
the url you posted is an example that handles udp packets but http is based on tcp

2779133
put	get
i have one possible solution which i will put as an answer to this question but i get the feeling that there might be another better solution available

2779195
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
now for tostring gethashcode equals and gettype there s no way to avoid having them in the first place - but usually if there are methods you want to remove from a base type that suggests you shouldn t be inheriting from it in the first place

2779204
firefox	safari
firefox already has them as does safari 4 and maybe others . the second is that the timer happens at a set interval but if your handler is still running when that interval expires the second interval is completely skipped

2779204
setinterval	settimeout
whether that pulse timer uses setinterval or settimeout is a judgment call based on what you re seeing with your actual code

2779210
linefeed	delimiter	spaces	linefeed	spaces	delimiter
usually ignoring connection keep-alive very short first packet etc. the uri would be the second word on the first line of the first outgoing tcp packet defining words as spaces delimiter lines as cr linefeed delimiter

2779210
libpcap	wireshark
as wireshark is based on libpcap is open source and does a pretty good job of this you can start from looking there

2779231
rss	feed
i want to use project rome to create an rss feed using the code from the tutorial as base

2779321
int	chars	int	double
for primitive data types like int double but not chars you may also define the constant within the class definition within the header file

2779337
width	height
that might need a width and height as well

2779399
public	protected
where show button is a protected public boolean variable on server side code which will take the value true or false according to your condition of showing the button or not

2779420
mouse	keyboard
i ve heard that this is possible by using a hook but the only examples i can find are based on mouse keyboard events

2779458
jar	war
jar war archives

2779492
maven	pom.xml
background with maven you always have one project per pom.xml

2779527
maven-plugin	pom.xml
org.apache.maven.lifecycle.lifecycleexecutionexception failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins maven-resources-plugin 2.4.1 resources default-resources on project amundsen.web execution default-resources of goal org.apache.maven.plugins maven-resources-plugin 2.4.1 resources failed plugin org.apache.maven.plugins maven-resources-plugin 2.4.1 or one of its dependencies could not be resolved unable to get dependency information for org.apache.maven.plugins maven-resources-plugin maven-plugin 2.4.1 failed to process pom.xml for org.apache.maven.plugins maven-resources-plugin maven-plugin 2.4.1 non-resolvable parent pom.xml org.apache apache 6 for org.apache.maven maven-parent 13 failed to resolve pom.xml for org.apache apache 6 due to the repository system is offline and the requested artifact is not locally available at home waleed .m2 repository org apache apache 6 apache-6.pom

2779544
vsto	add-in
i have partially gotten a vsto add-in to work with outlook 2007 running from citrix xenapp5 togheter with res powerfuse

2779564
antlr	parser-generator
the rule engines have various rules and associated action just like you have rules in the grammars and you can associate actions with them in parser-generator tools like antlr

2779760
maven	pom.xml
more precisely maven is not able to resolve org.apache apache pom.xml 6 which is available in central though

2779760
maven	m2e
try to run maven on the command line it should work and allow to workaround the issue with m2e

2779834
int	chars
the int representation of the chars 1 is not 1 but 49 in ascii

2779866
int	chars
look up your favorite ascii table to know the int value that represents the chars 1 and you ll see it for yourself 1 is mapped to 49

2779871
free	malloc
testwebservice 740 0xa067b4e0 malloc error for object 0x20e5000 pointer being free was not allocated

2779892
serializable	deserialization
you can implement java.io.externalizable so that you are able to control what is serializable and expected in deserialization

2779901
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
are there any portability issues with non-blocking operations on sockets file descriptors over numerous operating systems linux freebsd solaris macosx windows

2779914
postgresql	mysql
mysql does not have this feature however postgresql does

2779918
implements	extends
the way to extends c++ is not to try to extends the language which will be extremely difficult and probably break as new base compiler releases implements new features but to write class libraries to support your problem domain

2779944
rar	zip
i want to compress a folder which contains images text files as well as few sub folders in zip rar tar format then give it for download to user

2779949
min	max
whats the mathematical formulae to calculate the min and max value of an integral type using your calculator

2779958
udp	tcp
second there are limits imposed by the architecture of udp and tcp

2779958
udp	tcp
basically udp and tcp are both limited to 2 16 listening sockets per machine ip address since a listening socket is defined by a fixed 32 bit ip address and a 16 bit port number

2779961
post	get
a simple datawithcontentsofurl appears sufficient to get what i need i don t even need to do a post

2779968
put	get
when running via a console application it works fine but once i put in a windows service i get the below exception

2779972
integer	unsigned	min	max
in case of a unsigned integer the max is simply 2 32-1 and the min 0

2779979
min	max
the min max value of an integer variable is derived from the amount of bits used usually to the power of 2 ie 2bits 4bits 8bits

2780016
width	height
but i don t know how else i can bind to the width and height of the page

2780020
serializable	deserialization
mainly the soap message part - the serializable and deserialization of soap message. my web service is in java but i need to invoke it using c++

2780060
folder	directory
images directory resides in the views folder

2780065
int	double
for the first call int is implicitly convertable to double so the input to the method is a double and it does an equality check between the two double s

2780065
int	double
however for the second call the int is not being cast to a double it s only being boxed

2780065
int	double
so it s returning false as the input is a boxed int not a boxed double

2780090
google-chrome	firefox
this works for firefox but not for google-chrome

2780104
width	height
whenever my application starts it reads a file and parse it containing some information that will fit some forms and i create them dynamically without specificating any height or width

2780144
post	get
another thing to keep an eye out for is missing get post variables you might have forgotten something or it maybe modified with javascript

2780144
google-chrome	firefox
another option is to use wireshark to capture the http reqeusts generated by google-chrome ie firefox

2780145
hash	md5
i use md5 hash for identifying files with unknown origin

2780177
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
essentially you want the web reference tools svcutil.exe or wsdl.exe respectively to identify that the result of the webservice is actually a well-known object type - much as it does for many of the core framework objects

2780193
cos	sin
likewise cos and sin may need to be swapped

2780220
google-chrome	firefox
under ie and firefox i can detect it through the mimetypes but the mime type doesn t seem registered in google-chrome

2780223
google-chrome	firefox
depending on the doctype you use this might be invalid html no at the end and google-chrome and firefox handle tag soups differently

2780234
hide	show
i have a main window and many user controls that i want to show hide depending on the user choice

2780273
width	height
the webview is set to wrap_content for the height and width and the zoomcontrols are enabled

2780277
ivar	subclassing
you need to subclassing uitableviewcell and add something like an nsarray of uiimage ivar to display in each cell or 4 uiimage ivars if this number is fixed

2780381
superclass	subclassing
if i call m.getclass i obtain mypackage.message1 so the subclassing and not the superclass

2780445
width	height
this works okay and displays the swf on the stage 500x375 for some reason - not sure why testskin.swf is a flex app with no defined width and height

2780445
width	height
i have seen examples online where people say these work for them but whenever i set width or height in any of these ways the loaded swf is simply not displayed at all

2780469
hash	md5
while you cannot unhash the md5 hash you can look it up in a rainbow table

2780469
hash	salt
a salt is often employed with hash passwords to make this attack more difficult often infeasible

2780511
wordpress	phpbb
i m a little afraid of using wordpress because of his connotation all made plus my website is 100 hand coded actually i use the phpbb but it s not what i want cause visitors have to go out of the website to go to the forum to see the news

2780518
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this does not work in firefox 3.6 ie 7 safari 5.1.7 or google-chrome 4.1

2780518
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
setting the page margin does have effect in ie 8 opera 10 google-chrome 21 and firefox 19

2780536
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
1 should i remember the initial angle and transform when touchesbegan is called and then every time touchesmoved is called apply a new transform to the view based on the current position of the finger something like

2780552
submit	submission
i ve got it set up to capture all the different submission that can happen as there are about 10 different submit buttons on the form and there are also 2 image buttons

2780567
versioning	upgrade
i ve had this before when i ve applied a service pack to the database engine but not selected to upgrade ssis and then it complains about mismatched versioning

2780608
ssl	https
yes gzip compression and keep-alive can be used with https ssl

2780608
ssl	https
this blog post has more information about tuning a web site for https ssl

2780651
client-side	server-side
you can t do that because php is server-side language and any loading is performing on client-side because server don t loads anything then loading script you must have in client-side language

2780669
folder	directory
2 manually create a en.lproj directory in the projects folder

2780677
hide	show
hide as a button to hide and show the like this

2780716
google-chrome	safari
i am trying to get it working and have successfully done so in safari and google-chrome

2780716
opera	firefox
but the exact same code will not work in firefox or opera

2780812
opera	firefox
and this works perfectly in firefox but opera tells f is undefined

2780920
min	max
if you are looking for the centre actually the centroid based on the interpretation applied by physicist rather than geometrists of the set of coordinate pairs then you should not be using min and max although you might consider bounding the search based on the min and max

2781031
post	get
note that this won t be enough protection in itself a malicious user can make arbitrary post requests almost as easily as arbitrary get requests

2781050
children	parent
this custom user control contains the parent so to speak other custom win form controls children controls

2781054
firefox	safari
indeed this work in firefox and safari but not in ie

2781054
firefox	safari
it works using firefox on windows and safari on mac

2781081
submit	submission
so you have to call modal with option persist true and on clicking the submit button close the modal and trigger form submission

2781086
int	double
in java we can assign a int to a double or a float

2781125
int	double
in java a double uses a 52 bit mantissa so will be able to represent a 32bit int without lost of data

2781126
int	double
there are two reasons that assigning an int to a double or a float might lose precision

2781157
getter	setter
this will automatically generate the code for a property with a getter a setter and let you tab between a couple of points to declare property name and type

2781161
int	double
basically you cannot lose precision when assigning an int to a double because double has 52 bits of precision which is enough to hold all int values

2781170
opera	firefox
etc... but then firefox arrived opera gained attention and now we

2781170
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
have firefox google-chrome opera and safarai as fully worthy alternatives

2781189
pascal	delphi
c++ pascal delphi and java all have static classes and those are what c# is based on

2781199
stretchblt	bitblt
try using createcompatiblebitmap rather than createbitmap - the two bitmaps need to be the same for bitblt stretchblt to work

2781206
width	height
i know the width height and center point of that rectangle

2781206
width	height
i don t know how to do that i only have the rectangle height width and center point and of course the angle i wish to find the point at

2781225
public	protected
i almost typed public protected private there but obviously protected doesn t make sense because there is no method inheritance of static classes

2781247
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works on ie7 8 firefox google-chrome but not safari

2781271
int	double
int to long float or double

2781271
int	double
conversion of an int or a long value to float or of a long value to double may result in loss of precision -- that is the result may lose some of the least significant bits of the value

2781271
floating-point	integer
in this case the resulting floating-point value will be a correctly rounded version of the integer value using ieee 754 round-to-nearest mode

2781282
goto	break
return is a control flow keyword just like goto break continue if else .

2781331
versioning	upgrade
the msi is allowed to have four parts specified for its versioning although it will only compare the first three which can cause confusion when trying a minor upgrade with updates only in the fourth part

2781355
portrait	landscape
if you check out that app in portrait mode there s a normal calculator and if you rotate to landscape mode there are additional buttons that appear to the left

2781355
portrait	landscape
the problem is the normal calculator view is 320px wide in portrait mode but actually shrinks to around 240px in landscape mode to fit the additional controls

2781355
portrait	landscape
i ve seen examples like the alternateviews sample app that have two different view controllers one for portrait and one for landscape but they don t seem to animate the transitions between the views nicely like the calc app does

2781373
put	get
i keep this example around to get me started just put the proper stuff in the proper files and edit it to match what you are doing

2781493
post	get
i ve tried using both post and get

2781507
post	get
i do not get a clickonce elevation prompt as described in scottgu s post on wpf 4

2781515
width	height
you can use the canonical form in polar coordinates for your problem where the width and height of a rectangle is w and h respectively

2781573
subclass	abstract-class
i have an abstract-class with a static method that returns either one concrete subclass

2781578
google-chrome	firefox
now in firefox and google-chrome the following code works fine

2781594
decoder	encoder
or base64coder - an open-source base64 encoder decoder in java

2781628
put	get
when i search by google maps on the gps coordinates 51.501563 -0.12534 then i get canon row in london but when i put this coordinates in the emulator geo fix -0.12534 51.501563 the the emulator shows in google maps on the emulator a different location a301 bridge

2781645
pylons	turbogears	django	turbogears
and usually a better choice than bare-bones web stuff is using a web framework like django turbogears pylons or one of the many others listed on for example the web frameworks page on wiki.python.org

2781677
ivar	subclassing
protected means the ivar is accessible to instances of the class and subclassing

2781686
google-chrome	safari
however i have also read that string concatention is only a problem for internet explorer and that browsers such as safari google-chrome which use webkit actually perform faster is using string concatention than array.join

2781700
dictionary	map
i loaded about 15 000 pages letters a b of a dictionary and submitted to google a text site map

2781786
ant	maven
i ve used ant in the past with great success but know others who swear by capistrano maven and others

2781795
antivirus	mcafee
if you re gonna use the mail services of redmine and you have an antivirus like mcafee make sure you told the antivirus to allow ruby send emails or you won t get the mail service working

2781816
int	chars
int chars and bool usually have different sizes

2781816
int	chars
where int chars bool i suppose

2781827
folder	directory
in order to be able to upload the image through the application other one of either servers and then display it on both servers i need a virtual directory on both servers that point to a third file server this is the acctdata directory shown below with a sub folder images

2781836
jsf	seam
i know that in seam we could write an xml file if my jsf page is named index.jsf - index.page.xml that we could add there

2781889
int	double
if you allocate an int a short and a double the compiler will generate the appropriate machine code

2781890
hide	show
you can try to use states like selected pressed or just set a boolean to your item check it in getview and show hide progress based on that

2781960
ubuntu	linux
if you have used winmerge for windows then you will find this as a great alternative to winmerge for ubuntu linux

2781963
put	get
i must say i ve tried this in a dev environment and i didn t find any problems but i don t want to put it on production until i get some feedback.

2781971
put	get
i made a text rtf using ms word but there s too much junk rtf codes in it for me to figure it out where to put the clvmgf and clvmrg to get this to work

2782056
next	except
everything works great except when i click on the next page my button click event doesn t fire

2782063
integer	unsigned
to convert a 32-bit string using the same technique you have to use an intermediate type that can represent a full 32-bit unsigned integer in a signed type for performing the subtraction

2782111
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works great on firefox and google-chrome but not on ie or safari pc .

2782159
post	get
however i could not get the expected behaviour of this property of the msbuild task to work as expected and recommend jeff winn s workaround and his post should be marked as the answer

my question is in regards to the intial run settings population size number of generations min max depth of trees min max depth of initial trees percentages to use for different reproduction operations etc.

2782457
nunit	mspec	nunit	mstest	mspec	mstest
vs2010 menu - resharper - options - tools - unit testing also shows the mspec unit testing provider but it doesn t show any details when i click on it as does mstest and nunit

2782463
versioning	upgrade
just because one team can upgrade to a new versioning of nunit does not mean that another team chooses not to as it is weeks of work

2782492
lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml	html5lib	html5lib	beautifulsoup
later the best recommendations are to use lxml html5lib or beautifulsoup 3.0.8

2782519
google-chrome	firefox
ie firefox and google-chrome all correctly set the cookie

2782532
firefox	safari
this includes a browser control that embeds ie safari or firefox depending on the current platform and generally behaves well on os x

width	height
so that i want to do is set that a minimum height width size for the image but also don t want the image size to be larger than a particular size

2782596
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
of course recent versions of firefox safari opera and google-chrome support border-radius which allows you to create rounded corners without using images

2782653
children	parent
it s easy to query trees but hard to query immediate children or parent and hard to insert or delete nodes

2782653
children	parent
it s easy to query trees easy to insert and delete and easy to query immediate parent or children if you add a pathlength column

2782669
hide	show
i think the way to go is to check if the value selected is equal to other and then show hide the input based on the value

2782695
width	height
widthxheight minimum values of width and height given aspect ratio preserved

2782745
std	ostream
if you really need to ensure that the output has been written you need to break your dependency on std cout and use another std ostream during tests

2782789
superclass	subclassing
i would like to extend an object override a method but call the overridden superclass method in the subclassing method

2782822
webkit	gecko
you could make such a service by using the relevant parts of an open source rendering engine such as webkit or gecko

2782852
implements	extends
the actual point to take away is that implements is always preferred over extends on any questionable cases

2782883
pthreads	fork
the area of contention is whether mutexes and semaphores can be used within named shared memory as we have done or if pthreads only allows them to be used when one process creates and mmaps the shared memory and then fork the second process

2782937
testng	easymock
i m attempting to write some unit tests using easymock and testng and have run into a question

2782960
free	malloc
then view a office document a few times and find the malloc objects that keep staying live even after the actual uiwebview has been free

2782989
calloc	malloc
however as a commenter points out reservation of contiguous memory is the behaviour of calls to malloc as long as the memory is not initialized such as by calloc or user code

2783060
sqldatasource	formview
i use a sqldatasource in combination with a formview

2783092
iprincipal	iidentity
in the managers you can use iidentity and iprincipal built in access control interfaces in .net to control access

2783113
width	margin
you may change the content width to what percentage you would like or auto and or set margin s

2783113
put	get
i just mixed mine up and put sender there when it should be in the order of sender receiver subject emailcontent date but you get the point im sure

2783115
hash	salt
simply hash the password with salt

2783115
hash	md5
you can use php s md5 or sha1 hash functions for this

2783140
crypt	hash
you can use a plain text file with a hash or crypt function

2783147
crypt	hash
i suggest you use the crypt function to store the password hash rather than storing plain passwords

2783177
allocator	stl
every stl container take an allocator as a parameter

2783206
stdout	stderr
all its standard io stdin stdout stderr operations will be redirected to the parent process through three streams getoutputstream getinputstream geterrorstream

2783242
children	parent
created two new methods in local copy of catalog block navigation.php to get the current parent category and its children

2783246
getter	setter
depending on how you actually access them objective c might actually use the setter and getter functions of that class anyway

2783246
accessor	properties
you can of course choose not define any accessor for a class variable because it is internal to the class or because you declare is as public but as objective c makes it easy to prototype them with properties and synthesize there does not seem much point

2783246
getter	setter
internal class variables do not need setter getter because any class method can access them directly

2783281
postgresql	mysql
from the doc it appears you can use cur numrows if you are using mysql postgresql or oracle

2783295
getter	setter
you can make the delegate property of your nsoperation atomic by not setting the nonatomic flag and synthesizing the getter and setter

2783310
ord	chr	int	chars
the chr ord x business gets the numeric value of the unicode chars which better fit in one byte for your application and the .join call is an idiom that converts a list of int back to an ordinary string

2783352
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
however monodevelop does appear to use the same project file format as visual studio and sharpdevelop so you could make an attempt at mixing ides

2783374
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i m trying to implement auto-rotation in my application that is basically uinavigationcontroller with lots of uiviewcontroller that get pushed onto it

2783374
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i ve copy-pasted this in my first uiviewcontroller that gets pushed into uinavigationcontroller

2783374
portrait	landscape
but after i click button and get into second view i remain stuck into that portrait or landscape whatever was active

2783393
children	parent
subsequent calls to relationships children or parent on one of the affected node s will automatically examine the relationshipsource to determine the children parent or all relationships

2783400
cassini	iis
in earlier versions of vs i was able to switch between iis and the internal web server cassini

2783456
pull	push
git seems like a great tool for handling forks of projects since you can pull and push from multiple repos - i m just not experienced with it enough to know the best way of doing this

2783473
stdout	stderr
basically it is a requirement to have at least 3 threads per sub-process if you want to manipulate and examine its stdin stdout and stderr

2783479
onclick	onchange
then only the onchange is fired and the onclick is ignored

2783488
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m developing a flash game using the default simplebutton object for my buttons and the hand cursor is working just fine on pc google-chrome and firefox and safari for mac but google-chrome on mac is not letting me swap the default cursor for the hand cursor

2783490
addclass	removeclass
the scrolling part works fine but seems to run asynchronously so removeclass happens after addclass but before the scrolling is finished

2783554
hash	salt
hash salt

2783554
hash	salt
they can be defeated by a using a random salt and b using a strong hashing algorithm bcrypt hash or sha2-family hash for example

2783577
width	height
id flamovie width 250 height 250

2783600
firefox	safari
i have a web page that is displays differently in firefox and safari ie testing yet to come

2783622
inherited	properties
a documenttype object has only one documentconfiguration but it is not a inherited it s only one by one and unique to separate properties

2783625
int	double
here s the thing sometimes on fixed-typed languages i restrict input on methods and functions to positive numbers by using the unsigned types like unsigned int or unsigned double etc

2783625
int	double
same goes for c c++ sqrt input is an int or a double

2783673
maven	pom.xml
maven is not able to resolve org.apache apache pom.xml 6 as it s working offline

2783696
filtering	grouping
ideally if i can just feed it a select statement and the xtragrid could render it then i could use the xtragrid very nice data minipulation features filtering grouping by etc

2783712
google-chrome	firefox
i want ie google-chrome to work like it works in firefox

2783737
post	get
but i can t succeed using restclient or other simple utilities firefox addons that get post data over an http server

2783747
hide	show
i realize you re not asking about jquery but you might consider using jquery to show hide your div for easier cross browser compatibility

2783762
google-chrome	firefox
testing it in ie6 7 and 8 firefox and google-chrome would be a good start i would say

2783782
googletest	gmock
i m using qt + googletest gmock without any issues

2783812
for-loop	arrays
i want to use each separate arrays in a for-loop

2783812
for-loop	arrays
this arrays is created by an multiple select in an for-loop

2783827
post	get
i can run get commands from windows just fine i just can t seem to post to couchdb

2783839
hide	show
i think it something to do with the show hide editor

2783839
hide	show
1. hide the editor by clicking show hide editor

2783854
webkit	gecko	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i d ensure that i ve tested it on a webkit browser such as google-chrome a gecko browser such as firefox and opera

2783870
intersect	contains
in the pairwise result selector i compute an anonymous type contains the value intersection 1 if the ray extending leftwards from pt intersect the segment and the value on 1 if the point is on the segment

2783946
post	get
and if each user has like a thousand post in the guestbook it will get really much to fetch for the system

2783965
hide	show
next the hide show methods simply add remove the display none style from the matched item

2783987
onclick	onchange
this doesn t the only different is the onclick which isn t firing when the onchange precedes it

2783992
versioning	upgrade
that said i would stronly recommend that you upgrade to the latest versioning of java

2784123
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i put logs in viewdidload which runs as does viewwillappear and outputs the correct count for the array

2784129
mdpi	hdpi
i d suggest using either mdpi hdpi or normal large for your resources - having both is overkill

2784157
multiplying	add
or a 1 a 2 b 3 ... - 0 strip remap your string to an array of the hashed values then truncate number cases if a number is encountered and the last character was a number multiplying the last number by ten and add the current value to it

2784173
versioning	upgrade
i m trying to do an upgrade and each time the windows installer is launching the installer of the older versioning

2784173
versioning	upgrade
and when i do the upgrade it is complaining about problems with reading the older versioning s msi file because its not in the same directory anymore

2784192
onmousedown	onmouseup
you can register events for onmousedown and onmouseup and compare the mouse position differences in each of these

2784298
free	malloc
why not just use regular malloc and free or new and delete

2784318
google-chrome	firefox
whenever i find ie is displaying my website weird different from google-chrome and firefox i try putting a zoom 1 in the css class for the part that is being displayed weird

2784346
versioning	upgrade
i have a situation where a user can install an older versioning of my software for the current user and then go ahead and upgrade to a newer versioning of my software for all users

2784350
post	get
correct assumption if you use post you have get in your call

2784356
actionscript	mxml
the syntax you re looking at mx method is a way to define properties in mxml instead of in actionscript

2784370
google-chrome	firefox
this was working fine in firefox but when i tried it in google-chrome i noticed that the session id being generated when the browser is redirected back to www.example2.com is a new session id

2784370
google-chrome	firefox
this now works fine again in firefox but the infinite loop is still occuring in google-chrome and internet explorer

2784421
prepare	execute
this reset the database connection allowing the prepare statement to execute without errors

2784453
hash	md5
the puzzle they used was reversing a one-way hash function like md5

2784455
google-chrome	firefox
if i use firefox or google-chrome the data in the input field is not recognized.

2784460
jboss	weblogic
one more enhancment we made is that we replaced weblogic with the open source jboss server

2784473
filtering	grouping
i have a filtering on the grouping to remove lines where grouping sums are zero

2784528
ivar	subclassing
my solution has been to subclassing uiview with a - id touchdelegate ivar and those methods above

2784571
comparator	comparable
there are two options with comparing items the comparable interface and the comparator interface

2784576
comparator	comparable
since date implements comparable it has a comparator method just like string does

2784576
int	boolean
the compare method must return an int so you couldn t directly return a boolean like you were planning to anyway

2784576
comparator	comparable
this is such a common idiom that there s a built-in method to generate a comparator for a class with a comparable key

2784613
put	get	post	put	post	get
this technique will really only work for get and redirects on put post delete are not generally recommended

2784626
button	right-align
which has 2 button side by side and it is right-align

2784629
children	parent
i have a parent child relationship in which the parent has a collection of children a set to be specific

2784629
children	parent
however when i update the parent and save again all the children are re-saved

2784629
children	parent
this behavior leads me to believe that the parent is losing its reference to the collection of children and therefore when persisting all the children are re-saved

2784636
punctuation	words
that being said you might be able to get a good enough solution by using regular expressions to look for words after a sentence-ending punctuation but you would have to add quite a few special cases

2784671
int	chars
if you really insist on c-style arrays where the elements are constrained to being a single type array of int array of chars etc you could use the ctypes module

2784682
ssl	https
i don t want to force the whole site to use https by turning on require ssl in iis

2784724
ati	nvidia
any solid ati or nvidia card nowadays supports the latest and greatest directx

2784742
lisp	scheme
could one say create a set of preprocessor macros that let someone write in something significantly lisp scheme like

2784747
comparator	comparable
classes that has a natural sort order a class number as an example should implement the comparable interface whilst classes that has no natural sort order a class chair as an example should be provided with a comparator or an anonymous comparator class

2784902
pop-up	dialog
personally i have some resentment for built-in pop-up and dialog boxes maybe because they block browser completely including other tabs

2784908
cpython	ironpython
i guess p4api is cpython extension so it does not work in ironpython

2784934
getter	setter
however now that c# gave the world properties it seems silly to use getter and setter methods instead

2784946
accessor	properties
stack overflows are one good reason to avoid doing a lot of work inside a properties accessor but if your code is otherwise readable and your intent easily communicable there s no hard and fast rule that says not to

2784974
getter	setter
getter and setter methods instead

2784974
getter	setter
properties exist in the language to express attribution of other entities - if somevalue is not logically a property of the type it belongs to then you should consider using getter setter methods instead

2785029
haskell	ocaml
over the last few years f# has evolved into one of microsoft s fully supported languages employing many ideas incubated in ocaml ml and haskell

2785035
width	height
one way that seems to work is subclass sublayout width height in your screen

2785045
comparator	comparable
if you do not provide a comparator then you can rely on the natural ordering of the contained element if they are of comparable typed

2785045
sortedmap	sortedset
take a look at the sortedset or sortedmap api signature for some example

2785079
put	get
if you just put a handle to the data in the queue the application that process the queue will make unnecessary work to get the data that the sender already has

2785122
versioning	upgrade
i haven t released any new versioning of the application while i try to figure out alternatives and i don t think having customers upgrade to os 4.0 is a solution

2785179
int	boolean
what is happening is that my boolean is either nil or no and then my int var 0

2785265
comparator	comparable
this requires your object to be comparable which means you need a comparator equals and hashcode implementation

2785286
many-to-many	one-to-many
split the many-to-many relationship into two one-to-many s

2785296
mp3	wav
for the part where you get the samples from wav or mp3 in .net code i use naudio at codeplex free usable in commercial apps no real documentation just sample code

2785301
width	height
so i d recommend inserting a new dom element as the image and then changing it s height and width should scale it down

2785366
firefox	safari
it s used on an internal utility so i m not sure if there is a cross-browser issue but it s great on ie 7 firefox 3.x and safari

2785434
qtableview	qstandarditemmodel
i m using qtableview and qstandarditemmodel to show some data

2785455
innodb	myisam
that s probably less than ideal as the myisam table will not respect your transactions if a transaction failed on innodb your changes made to myisam in that transaction will still appear

2785489
stringstream	fstream
you can either compile your app as non-unicode in the general project settings set character set to multi-byte or use the unicode alternatives to stringstream and fstream wstringstream wfstream

2785504
stringstream	fstream
use wstringstream and wfstream instead of stringstream and fstream

2785611
put	get
of course i would also have to put locks on the get and set methods to make the variables thread safe

2785619
mouse	keyboard
it s so bad that at 10 fps if i spam the mouse and keyboard for a few seconds not much happens then after i stop the game seems to play itself for the next 5 seconds as the events trickle in

2785622
width	height
the idea of my layout template is that i don t know the exact height and width of the very inner layoutpanel s because i may set certain panels sizes of the outer docklayoutpanels differently when instantiating this template

2785622
width	height
all i would like is to add a grid component to one of the inner most layoutpanels and have it size itself height and width to fit as normal gwt widgets do works perfectly with a gwt label for instance

2785681
put	get
i ve now put all night and tried to get my iphone program to perform as intended it has also succeed me sometimes but now i have pages with a problem i simplehen can not get resolved

2785699
width	height
if you want a background image to fit the size of the browser which i m guessing at but if you have a 100 height and width on your image that seems what you re after you could do something like this

2785707
post	get
you re sending data in post body but trying to access them in regular way with using action arguments like get

2785712
switching	accessory
i ve defined the header as uitablecellview so i could attach a uiswitch as an accessory view and it worked great but now i can t detect the changes made in the switching

2785800
folder	directory
cd to the directory php ext and look for a dom folder cd into that and type phpize then make make install that will install a dynamic extension for you which you can enable via extension .so in your php.ini

2785841
decoder	encoder
it doesn t waste any energy on eval decoder encodedprogramcode schemes which a lot of php obfuscators do these are encoder s not obfuscator s because any clod can find that call and execute the eval-decode himself and get the decoder code

2785850
google-chrome	firefox
tested on firefox and google-chrome

2785870
inherited	properties
imenuitem inherited from iextension which has two properties

2785872
children	parent
the problem i m having is that when i check the parent it does not update that view of the children if they are already expanded

2785872
children	parent
the dirty solution is to have the parent from the setter method post kvo notifications on behalf of all of its children

2785872
post	get
if a farther-down descendant has the property set to no then that object s ancestors values matter after all and that object will only get the notification if every one of its ancestors post it

2785969
int	chars
this function will successfully sort an array of int but not an array of chars

2785985
hide	show
usually if i just want to show hide a single row in a table or something then i ll just put on the single that i want to control rather than using a whole

2786067
helpers	actioncontroller
actually in rails 2 the default functionality of actioncontroller base was to include all helpers

2786067
helpers	actioncontroller
added that actioncontroller base now does helpers all instead of relying on the default applicationcontroller in rails to do it dhh

2786085
implements	extends
if this was java i would have made tag an abstract class or even an interface and have the different implementations img div etc. extends in the case of an abstract class or implements in the case of an interface

2786085
implements	extends
then your specific tags can implements the tag interface and extends abstracttag

2786102
restrict	shared
i m on a shared server with restrict disk space and i ve got a gz file that super expands into a huge file more than what i ve got

2786109
width	height
i ve made it slightly better by specifying a height and width for the parent div so that at least the space is already allocated minimal shifting around when it does load

2786111
post	get
use get method link to request information and post form button to modify it

2786122
qbwc	quickbooks
poking around options for integrating an online app with quickbooks i ve made a lot of headway with qbwc but it s fairly ugly

2786224
int	chars
change the field type from int to varchar or chars if # of digits is always the same

2786241
superclass	subclassing
it is generally speaking a bad idea for a superclass to know about its subclassing a principle which extends to construction. 1 if you need to decide at runtime what kind of object to create and you do create a fourth class to have just that job

2786241
superclass	subclassing
1 explaining why this is true is a subject hefty enough for a book 2 but the short answer is that it creates a dependency cycle between the subclassing which depends on its superclass by definition and the superclass which is being made to depend on its subclassing by a poor design decision

2786289
directx	directwrite
yes you can use directx 10 11 and directwrite using the d3dimage in wpf by creating your render target surface as shared and then creating a dx9 texture based on that shared texture handle to use in wpf

2786297
goto	break
workarounds include goto s and use of boolean variables to record whether an outer breakable block should also break neither is elegant but that s life

2786335
width	height
fix the height and width of the table so as to get the wrapped up data into the table.

2786348
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
finally orientation works fine in uitabbarcontroller while adding a separate uiviewcontroller

2786349
implements	extends
i m not familiar with the framework but it likely instantiates java.lang.object s which extends the desired interface or it instantiates some sort of behind the scenes framework class which was generated with an implements interface clause in the class definition

2786373
google-chrome	firefox
it shows empty space in ie8 where google map is placed it works fine in firefox and google-chrome

2786560
width	height
how do i control height and width of this loaded swf

2786571
ssl	https
i want to send request on https so do i need to install the ssl certificate as the steps are given for apple push notification

2786580
width	height
you can just change the width and height values but if you want to do it with code you can use jquery to make this even easier

2786646
fflush	gets
as the queue fills up with messages indexing gets fflush to disk and above a threshold you ll see a performance hit which may be significant

2786646
put	get
in this scenario the connect and the first get or put call uses fail if quiescing set and subsequent get or put operations do not

2786646
put	get
this causes the qmgr to wait for the entire set of get put calls to complete but then the next connect or get put uses fail if quiescing so the qmgr has a chance to shut down if necessary

2786806
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
works fine for firefox google-chrome opera epiphany ect but not internet explorer

2786837
powermockito	jmockit
mostly likely you would have to use some of remapper testing frameworks such as powermockito or jmockit to manipulate the classloader manipulation in jvm

2786869
width	height
you can give the table fixed width and if you add a new column you can give this one also a fixed width or height

2786943
lisp	scheme
in many scheme lisp dialects when an error occurs a recursive repl is popped up .

2786943
lisp	scheme
one can execute scheme lisp code at the frame where the error occured and go up down the stack

2786959
min	max
you really need very efficient branchless min and max implementations for this since that is effectively what this code boils down to - a sequence of min and max operations 13 of each in total

2786959
min	max
note that this implementation lends itself easily to vectorization simd - most simd isas have vector min max instructions and also to gpu implementations cuda - being branchless there are no problems with warp divergence etc

2786966
post	get
also the blog post of marekdec how to get maven archetype to generate empty directories fails for me

2786975
singleton	facade
decorator facade singleton chain of commands etc

2786978
dlsym	dlopen
then the same program uses dlopen dlsym to load a function from myplugin.so dynamic library that in turn has dependencies to mylib.so

2786991
internationalization	translation
use the django internationalization to manage translation strings throughout

2787000
single-quotes	double-quotes
the simplest fix is to avoid single-quotes and use double quotes with the double-quotes in the json document escaped

2787005
put	get
but as soon as i put it inside a function when i alert i get undefined

2787065
quicksort	heapsort
space and time complexity of algorithms for example why is a quicksort sometimes the best solution and sometimes heapsort

2787114
maven	pom.xml
as far as i m concerned it should use the same directories as the package goal which are in my case inherited from the maven super pom.xml

2787152
punctuation	words
numbers are not words and punctuation ain t either

2787199
r-tree	quadtree
i believe instead of r-tree a point quadtree would be more effective for your need

2787199
r-tree	quadtree
spatial index demos provides some demos for a list of possible data structures including r-tree and point quadtree

2787205
vb.net	vb6
richard grier s visual basic programmer s guide to serial communications is a good book that covers vb6 and vb.net it s available from his website about 40 us plus shipping

2787269
put	get	post	put	post	get
mainly because the http verb get post put delete head connect options trace all the ones for webdav ... is something that the client tells the server at the start of the connection

2787339
uilabel	uibutton
in a project i change a uilabel s text with settext a uibutton s color and after that do a time consuming calculation followed by an animation

2787391
updatepanel	scriptmanager
because if your button is in an updatepanel and if you are trying to add this startup script on a partial-postback you should register it by using scriptmanager

2787433
magento	oscommerce
if you are going for an off the-shelf package you re going to need to use php - this then gives you a range of packages including magento oscommerce yuck and so on

2787491
typedef	typename
i added the typename and also the typedef but i still have the error

2787574
width	height
site www.google.come width 100 height 80 capwidth 800 capheight 600

2787575
width	height

2789962
google-chrome	safari
here s a table that shows that h264 video os only supported by google-chrome and safari

2789962

if the browser coughs it up and doesn t want to play it remember to check it with google-chrome or safari then you can just convert the file using one of the free encoders on the net

2789977
for-loop	loops
you can think of a run loops to be an event processing for-loop associated to a thread

2790034
ienumerable	ilist
you should consider returning ilist or even ienumerable rather than list for your collection-returning methods

2790036
put	get
i ve found that you can put a search query into the box and that acts like a filter but there s no way to get it into it s own tab and it s also a pain flicking back and forth between that and the full logcat view

2790156
colorbox	nyromodal
most people liked colorbox but i personally liked nyromodal

2790315
wordpress	joomla
any web based publishing platforms wordpress joomla etc... that generate syndication feeds with this xml vocabulary

2790318

you just open a fileconnection to the .doc file open a httpconnection to the web server and read from the inputstream of fileconnection then write that to the outputstream of the httpconnection

2790334
hide	show
little more debugging and found that when the browser ressizes and the carousel is already visible its reload function is called to adjust its position so to help myself in the hide show div scenario i ended up calling the carousel api s reload function after the wrapping div becomes visible

2790335
portrait	landscape
fundamentally i want to know if the user is browsing in portrait mode or landscape mode

2790363

another thought - if you are talking about newspaper-style columns where the content flows from the bottom of one column to the top of the next use a datalist control instead of a repeater

jquery	scriptaculous
i used prototype and scriptaculous for a website of mine only to find out that it s quite hard to find plugins that are readily available for jquery

2790459
jquery	scriptaculous
i ve been curious for some time if it s possible to port jquery into tapestry instead of prototype -- as in completely removing prototype and scriptaculous -- i realize it kind of defeats the purpose of the already bundled prototype but i wanted other opinions on the matter

2790518
x86	64bit
intentionally forcing x86 mode when you ve got a nice 64bit server is something you d want to avoid if you can

2790628
mako	genshi
the good ones that i can remember right now are mako genshi jinja and cheetah

2790667
createfile	deviceiocontrol
some years ago it was no ip helper dll at all and to receive the information which displays ipconfig.exe one has to use createfile and deviceiocontrol to give such informations from tcp tdi driver see constants like l device tcp and ioctl_tcp_query_information_ex in tcpioctl.h

2790694
width	margin
remove the float declaration on the content div and it will stretch to fit the parent width remove the margin on that same div because it s unnecessary and is causing the chrome issue

2790694
width	height
if you are strict about your semantics or the top div is of varying width then you could generate a javascript solution where you set the height of content to the height of top + the viewport height - top on load and when the browser is resized

2790721
hash	salt
what it does is repeatedly hash the user password along with the salt

2790721

2790796
postgresql	mysql
it seems to be mysql and postgresql

2790801
int	chars
for if there were a way to do it and your regular expression had a finite memory of k different states for some int k an expression with k opening parentheses followed by k closing parentheses though a valid regular expression would have been unable to be recognized by that machine -- a contradiction notice that in formal languages our assumption is that text processing occurs one chars at a time from left to right which is the same for applied regular expressions

2790810
children	parent
this is used to make sure that all children are examined before a parent is examined in a later stage of the algorithm

2790862

2790945
git-merge	git-rebase
you would then use git-merge or git-rebase to get them into your local branch

2790973
post	get
just note the hash is not collision proof but is suitable to know the difference between get and post

2790978
getter	setter
my end goal was to be able to set a delegate for property setter and getter in the called class

2790978
getter	setter
so i put setter and getter methods in that class and then i want the calling class to set the delegate argument and then invoke

2791045
screens	hdpi
the problem is that i get severe banding on hdpi devices like the nexus one and droid since the gradient goes from the top of the screens to the very bottom

2791056
google-chrome	firefox
the only way that firefox and google-chrome will display page that you specified in the errordocument 401 directive is if you click cancel button

2791070
rss	feed
i ve really only used them for toy things here and there with the only thing i ve used longer than a week or two being one amalgamated and filtered rss feed that i ve plugged into google reader which has worked great but if it goes out for a while i wouldn t notice

a nice touch is to let a user go on the app and record all post get requests and use them as a replay set for typical user interactions

2791184
onchange	onfocus
to get the div to disappear when you first type something instead of when the field is checked you ll also need onchange and or onfocus event handlers for the fields

2791227
int	boolean
you should use int and boolean if you re using the nullable constraint

2791387
dictionary	map
for example if you want to index your data using a string like a dictionary lookup then the map will perform better

2791388
min	max
the aggregate methods don t provide rolling max min count average etc - they provide a single value when the original stream completes

2791442
post	get
there is also a post about how to get fx cop to potentially look for the dynamic keyword although it s not perfect

2791448
goto	break
it avoids the goto abuses the while 0 break combination for that

2791457
width	height
so if you wanted to place this container as a background image i realize this isn t quite what you want to do you could place a 100 width and height canvas in the tag of the canvas

2791460
width	height
note i had problems setting the height with the width using the style key

2791470

2793436
fseek	ftell	fseek	getline	ftell	getline
have a look at getline ftell and fseek

2793468
uilabel	uibutton
uilabel objects aren t generally meant to be interactive and placing a uibutton as a subview to the label just because you can do it doesn t sound at all like it s following the apple hig for iphone

in firefox the event is transitionend in opera otransitionend and in webkit it is webkittransitionend

2794206
mousemove	mousedown
lostfocus is only triggered when a user taps on another control as mentioned there are no hover events as the mouse metaphor does not work here as this is a touch-based environment - the best way to deal with control behaviour is to imagine using your finger to interact with the control - this may allow to design a behaviour which works the way you want then see how this would work practically a touch on the screen starts a click so there is no mousemove without a mousedown too

2794208

2795351
getter	setter
the underlying data structure would not effect the exposed getter setter api so it s not about how a user interfaces with the objects

2795372
int	chars	int	double
where i talk about int the same reasoning works for double double chars chars c

2795380
express	node.js
i m learning node.js express haml.js and liking it

2795390
firefox	safari
this onchange attempt is close but misbehaves with respect to browser back then forward on safari 4.0.5 and firefox 3.6.3 so ultimately i wouldn t recommend it

2795395
cpu	processors
i am working with a modern cpu running windows 7 64-bit on an intel core i7 870 processors

2795404
tinyurl	bit.ly
implementing service something similar with tinyurl or bit.ly i m would like to expose service as api i m using java and jersey as restfull service implementation

2795420
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu linux when you watch a flash video it gets saved temporarily in the tmp as flv files while the video buffers

2795506
implements	extends
but to get your goal you must provide a custom messagesource notice implements instead of extends

2795509
subtract	addition
addition of half what was subtract will always put it into positive again

2795536
implements	extends
you can extends this such that plugins implements one or more from a set of common interfaces

2795557
skip-lists	tree
i know that i â œshouldâ use finger tree to get splay tree functionality in a functional language and that i should do something with laziness to get skip-lists functionality etc

2795557
skip-lists	tree
my plan is to turn this into a skip-lists and then use a similar structure discriminated union of a record for the tree structures i want to implement

2795563
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
plugin firefox opera safari etc

2795565
curry	first-class
stuff to do with first-class functions pattern matching and curry need not be especially slow

2795573
nsoperationqueue	nsblockoperation	nsoperation	nsblockoperation
to achieve this express it as either an nsoperation object you create a subclass of nsoperation and instantiate it or a block or both then add it to either an nsoperationqueue nsoperation including nsblockoperation or a dispatch queue bare block

2795580
int	double
now function2 happens to be specialized but for int long and double

2795584
int	double
if you don t need particularly high precision just use scaled int multiply the double by some power of ten convert it to an int dropping the remaining decimal digits and send the long

2795605
for-loop	arrays
i had a for-loop printing the arrays at the same index every time

2795614
post	put
i ve read through some of the so post and they all seem to be about specific aspects of this but i haven t been able to put them together in my head

2795644
int	double
if a platform with 64-bit int s afaik on current 64-bit platforms int is actually 32-bit but long is 64 appears and it has double that s also 64-bit then some int values would be not representable as double values

2795665
portrait	landscape
2 start landscape end portrait ui appears fine

2795665
portrait	landscape
4 start portrait end landscape the root list button remains in the detail view right side of the split view

you can post the state information to the web server and provide on the same web server per http get the same information from the server

2795711
vim	notepad++
i m switching from notepad++ to vim as main text editor

2795725
tostring	string.format
tostring i almost dislike that every object has it but it turns out i dislike everything using it like string.format does

2795725
int	chars
i rather have things that accepts a certain type like int floats text chars only

2795733
hash	md5
a story wouldn t require it but having an md5 hash on each file would be a nice feature for flagging duplicates

2795753
ubuntu	linux	debian-based	ubuntu	debian-based	linux
on ubuntu and other debian-based linux distros it s simply

2795754
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
and then there s ecmascript the standardised language that grew out of early netscape work on javascript and which is the basis for mozilla s modernised javascript ie s jscript and the implementations in opera v8 google-chrome and squirrelfish safari not to mention flash s actionscript

2795783
cpython	ironpython
i have the following cpython code which i now try to run in ironpython

2795794
int	double
for this reason since a double takes up 64-bits most people will use a double when converting from a 32-bit int to a double

2795807
django	web2py
i made a small in-house web app completely in django and then afterwards completely in web2py

2795807
django	web2py
i prefer web2py because there are more conveniences built into the environment than offered by django but web2py is much newer than django and hindsight always makes it easier make new implementations better

2795811
my.cnf	mysql.sock
while installing php i haven t specified --with-mysql-socket parameter and it looks like php tried to use a tmp mysql.sock default one which obviously was not specified in my.cnf

2795863
google-chrome	firefox
whenever i click one of these headings and it s description displays everything in the wrapper for the page shifts to the left about 7 pixels in firefox it does the same thing is google-chrome however i have not measured the amout but i am sure it is irrelevant

2795863
width	margin
i assume this is occuring because when the slidedown occurs it is somehow changing the width of everything and the margin 0 auto

2795863
post	put
here is what my code looks like i put it on jsfiddle to make it easier to view feel free to edit it there if you like or post what needs to be fixed here

2795885
mongoid	mongomapper
no you don t have to fetch all the guestbook entries if you fetch a user this is the mongo query for and mongomapper shouldn t work so much differently for myself i m using mongoid

2795906
serializable	deserialization
deserialization is the reverse of serializable

2795906
serializable	deserialization
for example java serializable is opaque - the data is not used for purposes other than for deserialization

2795918
int	chars
the format string to read an array of four chars then a unsigned int would be 4si

2795918
int	chars
i is the chars for unsigned int

2795926
bibtex	latex
you ll probably need to do this anyway to escape some of the characters that bibtex latex can t handle

2795985
put	get
it s obvious two versions of the activity that should only get called once are being put on the activity stack

2796082
folder	directory
one of the things is a possibility to open an archive as a folder staying in the directory tree and being able to drag and drop files from the archive to folder in the tree sidebar etc

2796097
width	height
the use of a width or height declaration is required to make the effect work in explorer windows and opera

2796105
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works perfectly on safari firefox and opera on mac os and firefox and google-chrome on windows

2796108
int	chars
adding int will keep looping as long as i enter numbers i tried chars but that didnt work

2796182
post	put
to match your example i don t like jame s post so i put an image on my site like this

2796203
put	get
i would guess that once you get that in there before long you ll find lots of other great things to put in there too

2796217
codeigniter	cakephp
i have used some php frameworks such as cakephp and codeigniter to be frank they just work on either lamp or wamp but i am not sure how they approached such a elegant solution

2796221
didselectrowatindexpath	viewwillappear
instead of viewwillappear use the tableview delegate method didselectrowatindexpath and the same deselectrowatindexpath you were using

2796222
modifiers	sealed
local modifiers â abstract â â final â â sealed â â implicit â â lazy â

2796242
int	chars
the strtol library function will convert a string representation of a number to its equivalent int value and will also set a pointer to the first chars that does not match a valid number

2796266
postgresql	mysql
returning is supported by oracle and postgresql but not by mysql

2796287
superclass	subclassing
how would i get the path to the rb file of that subclassing from the superclass

2796314
cakephp	kohana	codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	kohana
kohana codeigniter cakephp and zend should be enough to kick-start a google-a-thon

2796322
post	get
i ve been testing this upload script and it looks really good but i just can t get it to post values that i have extracted from inputs

2796336
google-chrome	firefox
their demo page looks great but when i integrate their sample code into mvc the script no longer works in ie and firefox but it seems to work just fine under google-chrome

2796356
superclass	subclassing
after performing the class-specific deallocation the subclassing method should incorporate superclass versions of dealloc through a message to super

2796363
width	height
edit i would like to add that for this to work correctly you have to set the width or height to 0px depending on if it s an horizontal or a vertical layout

2796383
pull	push
i would use the built in push pull methods

2796395
mouse	keyboard
whatever measures you take all an attacker needs to do is to execute your software in a virtual machine that records all access to keyboard mouse and screen

2796475
cos	sin
since we want to be able to deal with very small delta_angle and very large radius we ll expand sin and cos and use this only when angular velocity is close to zero

2796503
width	height
you also see that you can specify the width and height over there

2796509
pull	push
keep in mind that you do not push ui updates to a web browser the web browser needs to pull or request the update

2796525
mathml	mathjax
of course it would be very easy for google to implement viewing of latex and mathml math simply by using mathjax on their servers

2796552
hide	show
the whole thing was basically one page with javascript used to hide and show content in such a way that it looked like you were switching pages

2796567
fseek	fread
you can t use fseek but fread should work just fine

2796597
subtract	add
i also would need to have some instruction on how to add subtract plugins modules components and etc

2796601
min	max
later on i ll access these objects sequentially from max key to min key

2796653
google-chrome	firefox
iam not sure but i think my browser google-chrome firefox - ubuntu is not allowing to store an cookie inside an iframe

2796703
getter	setter
you could skip trivial getter and setter but often those methods are non-trivial a common case is the lazy load pattern

2796707
portrait	landscape
similarly in landscape mode if i scroll the table past the top of the third section and then rotate to portrait when i come back to landscape the scroll position is always set such that the first row of the third section is at the top of the list

2796728
getter	setter
the getter and setter generally do not make sense inside a private classes because you can access the instance variables anyways

2796738
public	protected
first of all i would say to treat inner public protected internal classes the same way you would treat any other outer class

2796739
folder	directory
i have had limited success with restarting the program in that the files in the db folder are added and removed but unfortunately new folder in the views directory are not shown

2796762
post	get
method post doesn t get cookies or what

2796836
post	get
using post over https is better than using get and http

2796837
rss	feed
in my flex 4 app i access an rss feed i m using as a dummy

2796837
rss	feed
it works okay when i run it from flash builder 4 but if i export the project and upload it i get the following error when it tries to load the rss feed

2796841
post	get
all the above is quite easy to implement if the printer is network connected now if the printer is usb or ppi connected you need to get your hands into the hp snmp proxy agent you can find a great post here

2796936
nscoding	nscopying
this is a simple subclass not implementing nscoding or nscopying that will hold on to all the precision you give it

2796941
maven	buildr
a build in buildr is twice as fast as maven

2796941
maven	buildr
this is due mostly to the design of buildr which is lightweight compared with that of maven

2796966
range	max	range	min	min	max
when range has a min and max variables

2796970
min	max
if so does it return an object which actually has these min and max members

2796993
min	max
if stakx s answer is not sufficient you may want to look into min and max variables

2797028
post	put
in ajax validation when the user focus out the item it directly post the data to server validates it and then you put the ui and do validation on submit too

2797040
mp3	wav
you re not actually performing any conversion from mp3 into wav in your example

2797121
hide	show
if you only want to display 15 you should look for a javascript solution to hide the others and only show the active ones

2797130
jsf	wicket
jsf 2.0 and wicket 1.4 are first class candidates they just work with jpa 2.0 and provides support for the bean validation api jsr 303 which is in my opinion a very important part of the question

2797130
jsf	wicket
i d go for jsf 2.0 or wicket

2797178
put	get
you will also find that doing formatted i o may interfere with what you are trying to do so you should be using the get put and read write member functions instead

2797182
jar	war
in the java world i d specify interfaces in an jar myapp-api.jar the implementation in a separate jar myapp-impl.jar and package these along with other resources in the application war myapp.war

2797218
postgresql	mysql
number of sql queries is relative you must remember that to bring same results mysql and postgresql has their own implementations just to give an example mysql dont implement the full ps sql

2797223
onchange	onfocus
this can be accomplished with javascript events such as onchange and onfocus

2797251
implements	extends
i haven t really released this project yet but it s a t4-based repository system that extends linq to sql and implements a bunch of batch operations delete update create csv etc.

2797315
gif	png
first i use fileinfo for 100 known matches gif jpeg png because i do want to rely on fingerprint detection for certain files

2797341
twig	dwoo
however for your communication between controller and view i would recommend using a template parser such as dwoo or twig i don t like the one that comes with ci

2797362
mouseleave	mouseenter
currently it s saying find elements with that class bind this hover function to those now it doesn t matter that you re changing the class because the function s already bound to that element s mouseenter and mouseleave jquery events...even if it s class changes which is unrelated

2797379
width	margin
the is a trick to center relative possitionet elements in css margin 0 auto but you have to define a width

2797458
sudo	nohup
sudo nohup nice command

2797458
sudo	nohup
nohup nice sudo command

2797515

ceil	floor
just take floor or ceil of the result in order to make the number integral

2797610
firefox	safari
on safari and firefox everything looks good

2797736
jar	manifest.mf
manifest.mf file in jar file shows

2797750
x86	64bit
in one project we have a dependency on a legacy system and its .net assembly which is delivered as a x86 and they do not provide a any cpu and or 64bit one

2797750
x86	64bit
now the project itself juggles with lots of data and we hit the limitations we have with a forced x86 on the whole project due to that one assembly if we used 64bit any cpu it would raise a badimageformatexception once that x86 is loaded on a 64bit machine

2797768
umbraco	dotnetnuke
perhaps you should look at dotnetnuke or umbraco or sense net those are big ones

2797774
redmine	trac
i am considering moving from svn and trac to git and redmine

2797775
rss	feed
if you need an alternate feed to test with you can use the flex show s rss

2797794
put	get
it s possible to get bar compiled by using other means to put foo into its classpath but that won t work when running the application

2797824
serializable	deserialization
correction the xmlserializer does appear to work without these on deserialization but it always adds them on serializable so something s fishy if they re missing.

2797825
uitableview	nsindexpath
- void tableview uitableview tableview commiteditingstyle uitableviewcelleditingstyle editingstyle forrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

2797835
migrate	upgrade
as far as the compilation errors you re getting you will need to migrate your application target to be a universal application using the upgrade current target for ipad menu option

2797869
subtraction	addition
secondly i have also made the algorithm work with an offset that uses the natural bit position values and thus removed some of the addition and subtraction operations my original used until the successful return statement

2797880
redmine	gitorious
i built a system last year which used gitorious and redmine

2797880
redmine	gitorious
you can integrate git directly with redmine no problems there but i would strongly suggest you have a look at gitorious as well as the tool to control your repositories and follow their events

2797880
redmine	gitorious
integrating gitorious and redmine is pretty simple

2797880
redmine	gitorious
they are saved in the file system hashed when you use gitorious so linking those repositories to redmine would be a bit complex otherwise

2797880
redmine	gitorious
of course you need to have the git service running on the server where you production repositories are those that you link to redmine do your automated tests etc but this is also solved with gitorious

2797880
redmine	gitorious
it s already slightly outdated since both gitorious and redmine have developed a lot but i could make it available if you want to read it

2797880
pull	push
when you pull changes to your master branch from some other repository it s easier to handle the merging this way - and you won t accidentally push something you didn t mean to

2797889
internationalization	localization
sure this is called localization or as apple calls it internationalization

2797896
serializable	deserialization
classes that require special handling during the serializable and deserialization process must implement special methods with these exact signatures

2797950
strtol	atoi
this is almost as simple to use as atoi but also provides roughly the same level of detail in reporting errors as strtol

2797990
googletest	gmock
gmock claims to be almost as portable as googletest and frankly i don t see why you wouldn t use it

2798010
for-loop	loops
you also need to change your for-loop to loops over the range a to z instead of over the a to z

2798012
put	get
the reason i say this is a partial answer is that i put a bunch of sqlite3 functionality in my helper class file but when i call that from another class i get out of memory errors or library routine called out of sequence errors

2798081
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine both in firefox or google-chrome

2798099
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
probably 1 is for icmp 6 is for tcp and 17 is for udp

2798116
put	get
i ve also put print statements at certain places in the japanese part of the code to see if i can get any clues but all the print statements are printing each time so i can t work out if it is looping at a certain place

2798141
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested my site in ie7 google-chrome and firefox and they work fine but ie8 is having some layout issues

2798153
ironruby	ironpython
there s multiple implementations of programming languages like ruby python c c++ haskell basic and javascript because people wanted to integrate them with java jruby jython or .net ironruby ironpython or plainly wanted to write their own compilers and interpreters for learning

2798158
bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
i am using least significant bit algorithm and could do it successfully with bmp files but it does not work with jpeg png or tiff files

2798161
content-disposition	content-type
what i do is generate the report directly to the response stream after setting the content-type of the response to application pdf and setting a content-disposition header to either if i want to hint to the browser that it should offer a download or if i want to hint to the browser to show it in the brower s ui

2798175
tesseract	tessnet2
or look at the tessnet2 tesseract .net library most of the free open source ocrs use the tesseract engine

2798202
public	protected
those languages use some identifiers like public private protected to try to do the jobs of header files

2798203
public	protected
if you re using php5 5.3.2 with phpunit you can test your private and protected methods by using reflection to set them to be public prior to running your tests

2798215
treeview	tabcontrol
but i cannot find any way to hide the tabcontrol buttons since i already have a treeview for selecting items

2798242
struts	wicket	jsf	wicket
spring mvc has lots of competitors struts 1 and 2 jsf wicket flex etc. so it s not always the first choice for web mvc

2798260
serializable	deserialization
i m not sure about serializable deserialization from within a jar file but

2798261
public	protected
they use some identifiers like public private protected to do the jobs of header files

2798261
public	protected
i think you re wrong there c++ for instance still has public private and protected but it s common to split the implementation from the interface with a header file although that doesn t go for function-templates

2798272
versioning	upgrade
i was using the latest released versioning and have since upgrade to 5.0.375.29 beta but the behavior is the same in both versioning

2798296
getter	setter
you will need a backing field for both the getter and setter you can t have a partially automatic property

2798298
getter	setter
you would have to do things the old fashioned way define backing field and implement the getter and setter logic yourself

2798310
width	height
i have a flash files with symbols i need to export as png images for some reason the exported images have different width and height than indicated in the flash file

2798310
width	height
after checking i found out that the new dimensions don t even keep the original ratio between height and width

2798348
touchescancelled	touchesended
the event methods touchesended and touchescancelled are only fired when the event is cancelled or the finger lifted

2798354
versioning	upgrade
so if you re still using jsf 2.0 2.1 you d best upgrade to at least that versioning

2798388
integer	unsigned
a word is a 16-bit unsigned integer which can store the values 0..65535

2798413
free	malloc
i need to answer a basic question from inside my c program compiled by gcc for linux how much of process heap is currently in use allocated by malloc and how much resides if free heap blocks

2798446
spaces	delimiter
cut only allows single-character delimiter like a single spaces and there are certainly gazillion other ways to split the line

2798448
firefox	safari
it seems that firefox and safari delete the tcp connection from their list of opened connections when they see the multicast connection close

2798466
deb	dmg
it is good to integrate with platform specific deployment systems like rpm or deb on linux dmg on os x or msi under windows

2798469
implements	extends
the problem is that the base functionality is extremely complex to implements 1 000s of lines in 5 layers of base classes and therefore i do not wish for component writers to implements the interfaces themselves but rather to extends my base classes where all the boiler plate code is already written

2798512
rss	feed
you ll have to use one of the other methods or -- if you can -- get the rss feed producer to output utf-8

2798560
public	protected
an inner class doesn t respect the rules of public protected or private

2798584
cvs	svn
clients for cvs svn git and others are almost universally available for windows

2798600
width	height
in fancybox s case it ignores width and height for image elements which makes it useless

2798610
post	get
i am successfully logging in i have checked the response from my post request but then when i try to perform a get request on the my shows page i am re-directed to the login page

2798617
inline	inlining
for example the compiler takes into account the size of the function being inline and the amount of inlining that has already been done in the current function

2798648
stateless	stateful
i have singleton userfactory stateless could be its method createsession generating stateful usersession bean by manual lookup

2798696
subtraction	addition
one does an addition on a subtraction and the last one will instantiate the two and simply print the resulted addition and subtraction

2798700
put	get
there is definitely content in the message collection as if i remove editorfor and put in response.write on the content property of the message class i get the content field for 3 message objects on the page which is exactly as expected

2798748
firefox	safari
i see several apps in the ipad app store which utilize tabs one such example is the atomic web browser which provides a tabbed browsing experience like safari on the mac or firefox

2798803
folder	directory
whatever happens i m going ot have to store the directory reference in a file in the settings folder

2798846
children	parent
instead of putting the buttons into a toolbar you might just make them children views of a parent uiview

2798859
mouse	keyboard
the ui threads job is to take input from the users hands through a keyboard or mouse act upon it and produce output in the form of pixels in response

2798892
int	double
also long is slightly better than double for int with 63 bits compared to 53 bits of precision assuming positive numbers

2798895
multiplying	add
obviously i could multiplying the page number by the number of results per page and add the result number but i imagine there is a better way within the query

2798916
stateless	stateful
you must not inject a stateful session bean into a stateless object such as stateless

2798931
google-chrome	safari
the html5 player loads fine in safari and google-chrome but it doesn t allow me to seek and safari even says it s a live broadcast

2798949
firefox	safari
however this works in safari firefox ie8 but not ie7

2798964
children	parent
moreover there are cases where you can check the pointer value in a parent function and avoid the checking in its children

2798995
valgrind	callgrind
i am using valgrind callgrind to profile a program on gtk

2798998
pycrypto	crypto++
i m trying to encrypt http requests using crypto++ and decrypt them with pycrypto on the app engine server end

2798998
pycrypto	crypto++
crypto++ pycrypto with google app engine

2798998
pycrypto	crypto++
i have discovered that the ciphertext resulting from encrypting in c with crypto++ is not the same as the ciphertext from encrypting in python with pycrypto

2799003
mktime	strtotime
first convert it to a timestamp strtotime mktime whatever

i used pdf2ps then ps2pdf on the above to strip lzw so that the reportlab and pypdf libraries would recognize it

2799135
post	get
i don t want to post all my code to stack overflow because they implicitly get licensed under creative commons if i do that

2799142
rtos	ecos	freertos	ecos
many other rtos designed for micro controllers similarly do not support an mmu such as ecos and freertos

2799142
rtos	qnx
of rtos s that do support an mmu qnx is probably amongst the most robust and mature while still maintaining high performance

2799146
ubuntu	linux
luaeclipse 1.3 beta definitely does work with eclipse 3.5 on linux at least on my ubuntu box

2799146
kate	gedit	kate	scite
note also that if you do not want an ide but merely an editor you may use kate gedit scite and many other programmer s editors available for linux

2799146
vim	emacs
not to mention vim and emacs

2799147
qmainwindow	qapplication
in runner run which is now running in it s own thread construct a qapplication and an instantiation of your qmainwindow derivative

2799166
oncreate	onstart
then when your activity starts you ll have access to the bundle where yo usaved your previous state it s the parameter of the oncreate onstart methods

2799183
titlebar	window
if you set the background color of a textured window a distinction that isn t really all that visible in snow leopard that color will be applied to the titlebar as well

2799183
titlebar	window
i would recommend though not having a real titlebar setting your window to have no titlebar and using and putting your own buttons in the titlebar

2799190
sequence	permutation
the idea behind my algorithm is that any permutation can be expressed as a unique sequence of swap commands

2799220
preferenceactivity	listpreference
now i want to use them in a listpreference for a preferenceactivity defined by an xml file

2799233
jboss	glassfish
there are many frameworks which i ve heard spring hibernate persistence ejb jsp servlet jsf jboss glassfish ant etc etc etc etc

2799325
ant	maven
ant maven

2799346
qapplication	qobject	qthread	qobject	qthread	qapplication
maybe you can try to store pointer to the main thread qthread object and call qobject movetothread to move your gui objects to the main thread instead of moving qapplication into another thread

2799425
r-tree	quadtree
the best practice for the geolocation domain is to use a geohash quadtree r-tree or similar data structure r-tree are the most generic but it sounds like you re querying point data so that may not matter

2799427
union	distinct
the set-like operators union distinct except etc. work using gethashcode by default afaik so it seems reasonable to assume they re using a hash-table internally making these operations o n as well in general

2799435
joystick	keyboard	mouse	joystick	mouse	keyboard
and several engines force me to work with the event style ie input comes from keyboard mouse and joystick interruptions and a timer interrupts and calls update step i dislike it but i had to learn.

2799470
rss	feed
it seems that you have two problems aggregating multiple rss feed and then displaying them in a list

2799483
opera	firefox
most have some sort of developer tool too firebug in firefox dragonfly in opera etc

2799489
cos	sin
the result is that we could just ask to weapon to be at position cos angle radius sin angle radius

2799507
google-chrome	firefox
but debugging tools like the built in one in google-chrome or firebug for firefox are good tools for debugging your javascript code and shows lists of the errors occurring

2799520
squash	branch
make small commits in a private branch then squash them in a git rebase -i

2799522
hash	md5
perform a cryptographic hash on that sha md5 etc and covert the hash to a hexadecimal representation eg ce7f181a44a4a5b7e43fe2b9a0b1f0c1

2799524
hash	md5
however in similar cases i have encountered i usually pick a larger password size which also happens to be the size of the hex representation of a popular hash function md5

2799543
union	distinct
distinct groupby join and i believe also the set-aggregation methods union intersect and except use hashing so they should be close to o n instead of o nâ²

2799546
ilist	icollection
i know that for some collections like collections that implement icollection or ilist there are special codepaths that are used however the actual implementation is not guaranteed to do anything special

2799629
fgets	fgetc
then you can either skip a whole line with fgets but it is unsafe because you will need to estimate the length of the line a priori otherwise use fgetc

2799727
post	get
if you want to just do basic http you can use the webclient class to get and post data

2799727
webclient	httpwebrequest
if your server operations are very simple or are already implemented as rest http i would stick with that and use webclient or httpwebrequest

2799753
x86	64bit
x86 doesn t support higher precision than 80 bits but if you really need more than 64bit for a fp algorithm most likely you should check your numerics instead of solving the problem with brute force

2799765
multiplying	transpose
orthonormal matrices have the property that you get the identity matrix when you multiplying by the transpose

2799813
firefox	safari
i have this basic javascript code window.resizeto 1000 800 set to run when the page loads and it works perfectly in firefox but not in safari

2799822
plink	prompt
next i tried to just use plink to connect by plink -p #### ssh inthom.com and i am then prompt for my username and next password

2799844

the code below gets the first input value being search from the search box at the top of the page and then puts that value into all the spans even for buttons that have different values eg send

2799904
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
as a comparison the latest nightly build at the time of this writing of firefox scores 97 100 the version of google-chrome that i m using 5.0.375.29 beta scores 100 100 and safari scores the same

2799976
mouseover	mouseout
the problem is that the mouseout event doesn t see the same wait that the mouseover event did

2800075
hide	show
you can hide columns where you don t need the timestamp to show

2800134
children	parent
save the result to an array and append as element of the current parent array using children as key

2800140
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
in either the viewwillappear or viewdidappear i d suggest viewwillappear function set the text value of the uitextfield to...nil i think...or just an empty string.

2800149
uipangesturerecognizer	uiswipegesturerecognizer
for your particular case use uiswipegesturerecognizer or uipangesturerecognizer

2800162
rss	feed
i m using a php script to read an rss feed in my flex 4 app

2800162
put	get
the script works when i put the url of the feed in the actual script but i can t get it to work when i try to send the url as a parameter from a httpservice in flex

2800195
required	placeholder
standards compliant html required a href attribute but if you re planning to handle the request with javascript then # serves as a reasonable placeholder

2800216
subtract	add
ruby s date class allows you to add subtract days from a particular date

2800240
put	get
put that code as an assembly with public interface to get the functionalities

2800312
ubuntu	linux
that said it is reasonable to install a copy of virtualbox and setup an image of ubuntu in it for verifying that your code compiles and runs under linux

2800313
vxworks	rtos
however here are couple things to keep in mind for a rtos not just vxworks

2800344

2800363
google-chrome	firefox
specifically how can i fix the google-chrome ie versions to look more like firefox

2800363
google-chrome	firefox
if one or two columns are empty then google-chrome displays the page just like firefox

2800416
children	parent
i would expect that having objects of the same time as children should not be a problem but that the problem is that the children reference the parent object and hence you get a circular reference

2800425
super	extends
on using super and extends

2800425
super	extends
from effective java 2nd edition producer extends consumer super

2800425

when i zooming the qgraphicsitem the qgraphicsview shows scroll bar instead of enlarging itself

2800464
post	get
heres a great blog post to get you going

2800533
teamcity	nant
you could use nant to send email but teamcity is more appropriate as it can provide a centralized place for notifications including emails

2800553
umask	chmod
you should definitely read a lot of linux basics unix linux beginners guide to file and directory permissions umask chmod read write execute

2800565
onmouseover	onmousedown	onmouseover	onclick	onclick	onmousedown
my question is to get onmouseover onmouseout onmousedown onclick on a table row

2800565
button	checkbox
onclick --- first column checkbox radio button should be set and background color should change

2800565
onmouseover	onclick
onclick -- setting the background color permenantly..eventhough i do onmouseover on different rows

2800565
button	checkbox
first column i.e radio button or checkbox is not set

2800577
ironruby	ironpython
they vary from functional programming f# to adhoc admin scripting powershell along with c# vb.net and the dynamic languages supported by the .net framework ironpython and ironruby

2800577
ironruby	ironpython
5 .net supports ironpython and ironruby and maybe still supports jsharp

2800591
free	malloc
to create an array of a non-constant size known at compile time you need to dynamically allocate space for it using malloc and correspondingly deallocate it using free when it is no longer required

2800594
alloca	malloc
if you need a run-time sized array you have to either allocate it manually with malloc or use some non-standard compiler-specific approach like alloca function

2800598
alloca	malloc
however with earlier versions of c you are stuck calling functions to dynamically allocate memory alloca 3 or malloc 3

2800651
x86	64bit
yes it is safe as long as they aren t platform-sized integers 32-bit for x86 platform and 64bit for x64-platforms in which case you d use an intptr

2800655
google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome firefox

2800660
int	double
this was a remainder of the 16bit days when int was 2 bytes and long was double word - 4 bytes

2800662
google-chrome	firefox
the weird thing now is - its working in google-chrome and firefox but not in ie

2800687
mongoid	mongomapper
i think both mongomapper and mongoid took their ideas about this from datamapper

2800741
x86	64bit
generally how to go about making your own 32-bit 64bit operating system or good resources that mention useful information about going about writing your own operating system for x86 computers

2800744
draggable	droppable
the error happens when i use droppable draggable

2800779
width	height
if you alter the entire memory block you will probably overwrite the values indicating image width and height as well

2800794
rss	feed
replace the t in your rss feed with a space and obviously change the date format string as well

2800794
rss	feed
your rss feed has padded digits where as your format string does not

2800794
rss	feed
strip off the timezone info from the rss feed and parse this manually

2800935
google-chrome	firefox
this is the best i could come up with only tested in firefox and google-chrome thou

2800940
hide	show
probably the best way is to put a label behind it and when you want to make the textbox disabled hide it and show the label in its place

2800944
titlebar	window
set controlbox to false gets rid of the titlebar and top-left window menu

2800948
int	chars
so every chars is in fact an int

2800948
int	chars
you add another int to it and then because you specify c in printf you force it to consider it a chars

2800961
jsf	seam
i my case it are jsf pages utilizing seam and richfaces

2800982
put	get
if i put in the original credentials i get back a response about invalid request sent it s a valid http request -- 200 -- the remote server just doesn t like one of the headers

2800982
post	get
the second is to the redirect url with a method of get nothing from the post field and no credentials

2800982
put	get
ideally i don t want the user to have to put in their credentials a second time in this dialog box but i ll take what i can get if i can just get the final url

2801007
for-loop	arrays
news_comments is a 3 diemensional arrays from mysqli_fetch_assoc returned from a function elsewhere for some reason my for-loop returns the total of the arrays sets such as 0 2 etc until it reaches the max amount from the counted news_comments var which is a return function of limit 10

2801007
for-loop	arrays
my problem is if i add any text html icons inside the for-loop it prints it in this case 11 times even though only arrays sets 1 and 2 have data inside them

2801032
hide	show
i wonder what is the best practice to avoid blinking because applying display none breaks incapsulation rule - i know what jquery does with hide show and use it

2801048
comparator	comparable
your elements must be comparable or use a comparator that compares the objects in the array

2801063
comparator	comparable
you may need to implement comparable or provide a custom comparator or neither if your type is a primitive already defines its own natural ordering

2801132
octal	decimal	octal	hex
alternatively you can place your cursor on the unprintable character and hit ga it will show the decimal hex octal code of that character then you can substitute it with

2801147
vb.net	vb6
i would suggest an upgrade path from vb6 - vb.net

2801167
ant	maven

un fortunately your code works on other database postgresql mysql sql server don t have first class support for boolean so your expression after of then won t result to boolean type hence will not work in sql server

2801182
easymock	jmock	easymock	powermockito	mockito	jmock	mockito	easymock	jmock	powermockito
easymock + powermockito alternatives mockito jmock for mocking

mouseover	mouseout
assuming you have javascripe code using mouseover mouseout or hover

2801326
filewriter	printwriter
in particular you should look at filewriter and or printwriter

2801349
post	get
this might seem more obvious for new users because forms is much more complicated to pass values than asp.net websites with post get querystring

2801456
put	get
set error reporting to all and you will get info about any undefined variables too for example put this on top of your script

2801458

i know the way width 128px height 128px but are i can do it by write a parameter on image like param 128px then he set width and height 128px

2801609
onclick	onchange
i tried with onchange onclick function but it didn t worked

2801618
int	boolean
well the problem is that int2 is used store signed two-byte int regardless of how you use it and hibernate doesn t have any knowledge of your logic to translate the value into a boolean at the java level

2801634
width	height
if you need to set the w h to the same in images with ratio different than 1 1 you ll need to use some javascript to retrieve the height or the width and give the same value to the other argument using js

2801666
dlsym	dlopen
with mscv this would mean going down the road of using loadlibrary getprocaddress etc. while on linux i would have to use dlopen and dlsym

2801673
svnkit	subclipse
hard to say since you don t even mention which plugin you re using but if i remember well i was using subclipse with the svnkit client adapter successfully on ubuntu 9.10 i use subclipse with the javahl jni library again on ubuntu 10.04

2801686
ceil	floor
the other posibility is to ceil instead of floor in that case you wont skip 15 frames but 14 frames

2801725
entity-relationship	diagram
please don t recommend visio because my team already evaluated it and everyone disliked it as either a uml or entity-relationship diagram tool

2801757
int	boolean
the result has to be a boolean 0 1 int value which i need to return as a result of the function

2801776
post	get
the getjson does a get request and doesn t post variables to the url but instead adds them to the querystring

2801790
post	get
since json seems a lot popular and handy i went to www.json.org and discovered a jsonrequest object which seems to able one to send post get request asynchronously but i can t get it work

2801792
entity-relationship	diagram
it can also do database diagram though these are uml-flavour rather than classic entity-relationship

2801821
submit	submission
yes events resolve before default functionality so the event runs and then the button submit the form firing the submit event and then actually submission the data

2801847
cells	tablecell
whenever that tablecell is initialized i draw the properties of the cells on the cells itself

2801872
hex	binary

have a look at the crossbrowser framework raphaã l js svg vml this video shows it doing drag drop touch-events try out the actual demo here

2802042
interpolation	splines
other than that you option would be to use some kind of splines interpolation

2802151

yes thatâ s the same path we used to get a list of articles if you issue a get to it it responds with a list and if you do a post to it it adds a new article to the collection

2802179
post	put
the problem is if i want to make a post or put request

2802204

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this problem occurs in firefox and google-chrome but safari is fine

2802298
prepare	execute
php s pdo allows multiple querys to be execute at once either via the query method or as a prepare statement

2802314
firefox	safari
i ve seen instances where code that works in firefox safari fails in ie because ie seems to load the dom more slowly

2802326
getter	setter
abstractentity defines the id field getter setter

2802334
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout
when you re using jquery make sure you re using mouseenter and mouseleave instead of mouseover and mouseout in these cases

2802334
mouseover	mouseout
mouseover and mouseout fire even when entering a child element

2802334
mouseleave	mouseenter
if you have code to hide things you wouldn t want it to run in a menu at that point you want it to run when you leave the completely and consider a child as still being inside...that s what mouseenter and mouseleave do

2802334
mouseleave	mouseenter
there s also a shortcut for this called .hover which uses the mouseenter and mouseleave events like this

i am looking for a list of all javascript event handlers such as onload onsubmit ect... and the corresponding html tags that they can be applied to

2802379
qabstractitemmodel	qtreewidgetitem	qtreewidget	qabstractitemmodel	qtreewidget	qtreeview	qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel	qtreeview	qtreewidgetitem
looks like you will have to forgo using qtreewidget and qtreewidgetitem and go with qtreeview and qabstractitemmodel

2802379
qmodelindex	qabstractitemmodel
qabstractitemmodel has a call flags qmodelindex index where you would return the appropriate value for your column

2802412
int	double
using round t will make it be the most fair and try to drop the frame int that is closest to the ideal drop frame double while keeping the full precision timer next_skip

2802441
pull	push
make db1 as publisher db2 as subscriber and go for pull or push based subscription

2802453
post	get
and you should not specify an image file as the url for an ajax get post request in the first place

2802467
comparator	comparable
you need to have a comparator or make the keys comparable objects

2802630
apache	nginx
this method works on nginx as well as apache which is an added bonus

2802645

coalesce	isnull
i ve tried the using coalesce and isnull to no avail

2802724
aggregate-functions	coalesce	aggregate-functions	sum	sum	coalesce	coalesce	isnull

there are integrated development environments like eclipse netbeans kdevelop anjuta

2802793
put	get
your code seems to work but you are not doing anything with the returned value put method call fact or fact 5 inside of a system.out.println and see what you get

2802797
cvs	svn
i agree with karthikeyan that eclipse has a more feature rich environment plus it can incorporate other plugins such as cvs svn mysql etc

2802848
post	get
as result right after client will get all html from server the event onload take place that triggers form submit and post all data to defined postbackurl

2803098
freemarker	velocity	jsf	stripes
if you don t go for jsf then facelets has not much benefit for you and you could just continue with legacy jsp probably with a 3rd party templating framework on top like freemarker or velocity and or a 3rd party mvc framework like spring mvc struts2 or stripes

2803116
dictionary	map
i m trying to map a dictionary to an sql database with nhibernate the generated mapping looks ok to me but the class property as shown below is giving me problems

versioning	upgrade
but my problem is that i need to create upgrade scripts which can upgrade from versioning 1 to versioning 2 to versioning 3 to etc.

2803180
versioning	upgrade
to do this i ll be using adox with delphi to read the catalogues for every schema versioning in the database then use this to write the sql statements that will need to upgrade these schema s to their next versioning

2803188
octal	binary
newer versions of javascript -- specifically ecmascript 6 -- have added support for binary prefix 0b and octal prefix 0o numeric literals

2803188
google-chrome	firefox
this feature is already available in firefox and google-chrome

2803188

2803219
google-chrome	firefox
my guess is ie is rendering the padding margins differently than google-chrome firefox which is usually the issue with layout bugs

2803240
put	get
since it s only in tfs build that the output of all the projects get put in one directory i was able to make a special case for the build server by looking at the computername environment variable

jar	manifest.mf
myapplet.jar the applet s jar contains a manifest.mf including a classpath attribute listing all the required jars

2803415
post	get
if you are always displaying a blank pdf for them to fill in you can get away with just adding a button which post back to the server

2803493
button	checkbox
you could put both a radio button and a checkbox in the template then use a binding expression in the visible property that ensures only one of them is visible based on the source object being bound

2803514
tinyioc	castle
depending on the container your factory may have to know the name of the parameter tinyioc and castle afaik or it may had to be last in the list of constructor dependencies ymmv depending on containers which isn t great but it saves creating a lot of child containers in quick succession and the gc thrashing that will follow and you still get di for all your other dependencies

2803529
button	checkbox
i have an mfc ctoolbar dockable to a cframewnd containing a checkbox and a button

2803534

httpservletrequest to get the message the client sent to me and parse it from json most likely to a map and httpservletresponse to put my message to the client

2803583
superclass	subclassing
for every method of the superclass i create an analogous method in the subclassing

2803654
hash	md5
you dont really need to hide them...what you should do is have an extra key such as a secret that one is hidden and is only present in the signature of the call which can be an md5 hash or sha or whatever without that secret key people wont be able to just make calls since the signatures created by the server and the offender wont match since they dont know the secret key used.

2803693
jboss	weblogic
is anyone able to point me to some online docs where this behaviour is explained for weblogic jboss etc.

to hide the x set but this will get rid of min max as well

2804001
plm	glm
i am familiar with using glm for logit and probit and plm for panel data but am not sure how to combine the two

2804001
plm	glm
for instance you could use plm to do fixed effects or you could create a matrix with the appropriate dummy variables and then run that through glm

2804009
int	chars
in practice endian-ness is important in c if you perhaps via something you call reinterpret a chars as an int or vice-versa or define a protocol in which an int is represented using a sequence of chars

2804009
int	chars
if you re only dealing with arrays of chars or only dealing with arrays of int it s irrelevant because endianness is a property of int and other types bigger than chars

2804023
width	height
then i setup a css rule to limit the height and or width of any iframe that exists in the facebook-like div

2804055

2804179
pop-up	dialog
jquery also for a pop-up has in the ui library a dialog widget

2804198
folder	directory
the problem is the implementation used to get this name is flawed it a assumes the home directory contains the string wwwroot and b assumes the folder name is the same as the application name

2804200
gridview	sqldatasource
it uses gridview bound to sqldatasource that query filtered views

2804212
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m seeing the expected behaviour in firefox but not in safari or google-chrome

2804212
google-chrome	safari
note that safari seems to give varied results in the same manner as google-chrome which makes sense

2804212
google-chrome	safari
you may have to refresh a couple of times to see google-chrome and safari fail on everything

2804254
x86	64bit
you have a mismatch in your solution where you are mixing x86 with x64 the incorrect format message refers to trying to load a 64bit dll from a 32 bit executable or vice versa

2804297
google-chrome	firefox
it should work in firefox and google-chrome

2804311
django	web2py
anything django does web2py does better

2804311
django	web2py
this is because web2py was made long after django and has learned from django s mistakes though it makes all new mistakes

2804311
django	web2py
i have found that the django documentation is applicable to web2py for the most part

2804311
django	web2py
in web2py you just do form.element no such thing in django

2804311
django	web2py
biggest drawback of web2py is its age and smaller code base...this is not unreasonable though considering django is like the first python web framework to implement rails style rad ideas and is like twice the age of web2py

2804339
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
if the clientaccesspolicy.xml is either not found the web request returns a 404 status code returned with an unexpected mime-type is not valid xml or has an invalid root node then the silverlight runtime will issue a request for a for the flash policy file with a name of crossdomain.xml at the root of the requested target domain using the http protocol

2804498
accessor	properties
more advisable would be to make it a properties with a public get accessor keeping the set private

2804554
gendarme	fxcop
i routinely run gendarme and fxcop on my code and neither of those tools identify what i ve described

2804586

there are two types of timers in javascript settimeout and setinterval

2804798
getter	setter
that implicitly declares the getter and setter for the condition property

2804818
x86	64bit
ideally i would host a wcf service to house this dll but in a 64bit os one cannot force the service to run as x86

2804830
gridview	detailsview
i am creating a gridview detailsview page

2804870

i ve tried copying the entire program dir to a different folder - now both the program and ms-access read the wrong values

2804984
put	get
i d put the message into a database table along with some information about who should get it and then a cron job would actually do the sending

2804994
hide	show
one way you can do that is to add an onclickclick function to each tab head that sets the visibility style of the buttons you re trying to show hide

2805188
folder	directory
in one of this virtual directory i need to have the browse folder disable and in the other one i need to have it enable

2805188
folder	directory
i thinks this problem is related that both virtual directory points to the same folder in the os but with the iis6 i had this same configuration with out a problem

2805213
tinymce	freetextbox
there are lots of choices when it comes to wysiwyg ckeditor freetextbox tinymce but i don t hear a lot about so-like techniques

2805318
google-chrome	firefox
which looks like this in google-chrome firefox

2805326
uitableview	reloaddata
when i call reloaddata to change update the data in the uitableview the header gets reloaded too

2805393
google-chrome	safari
the problem seems to only occur on safari and google-chrome but if i refresh the page i get it to work correctly - weird

2805393
google-chrome	safari
in safari and google-chrome the thumbnail holder will not display

2805393

2805410
subtract	add
in the site code you would need to keep track of what number you were currently on and then subtract one and requery to get the previous or add one and requery to get next

2805436
pascal	qbasic
c c++ 3.0 pascal 7.0 qbasic powerbasic and com debug programs were based on this architecture and could do any better than what assembler allowed

2805470
vxworks	rtos
while i think you are being far to specific in requesting patterns for rtos vxworks patterns i have used specifically with vxworks are the facade and adapter patterns

2805478
slideup	slidedown
have a function called after the slideup use a timer to wait 100ms then call the slidedown

2805550
for-loop	arrays
you need to create an object arrays of the same size as parameterinfo and build it in the for-loop

2805595
voip	sip
as my project to do over this summer i would like to create a program that answers a skype call using the skype api and allows a user to connect to another voip provider through sip and make calls by dialling through the client callers skype application

2805604
pull	push
advantage of allowing you to pull or push instead of just updating from one central source

2805677
serializable	deserialization
i have a little problem implementing some serializable deserialization logic

2805677
serializable	deserialization
my current solution is that each handler gets the serializable string and is itself responsible for deserialization

2805698
int	chars
when i get a string of chars instead of an int the program loops indefinitely

2805715
udp	tcp
but a service has unrestricted access to use tcp and udp sockets

2805761
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
without using flash you are bound to a new html5 technique which is supported in firefox 3.5+ safari 4+ google-chrome 3+ and opera 10+

2805768
udp	tcp
i build a tcp and a udp listener on that port

2805793
getter	setter
one potential danger i see with using the entities to drive the xml could couple xml consumers to the database layout if you have getter and setter for all database columns

2805803
getter	setter
but one thing is it is not changing getter setter names which have been generated based on previous name

2805816
cos	sin
ideally your set is computed symbolically and left in terms of sin theta cos theta for non rational points which should be fine since you seem to be using mathematica

2805821
udp	tcp
yes tcp and udp traffic can affect each other since they are both ip traffic

2805821
udp	tcp
tcp may tend to reduce its transmission rate at the sender due to congestion control if packets are being dropped while udp will tend to just drop packets

2805835
getter	setter
yes in galileo the rename dialog has an option for changing the setter and getter of a field - see here

2805856
post	get
i was able to get the text from my server but not the images and i have not figured out how to post things to my server.am i in the right track here or should i start using xml

2805953
getter	setter
there is no real necessity for getter and setter to have the same name as the internal field

2805953
getter	setter
part of the point of having getter and setter is to protect the rest of the code from changes that are internal to the class like renaming

2805981
portrait	landscape
when the app is launched in portrait and rotated to landscape the app does as expected

2806005
interbase	firebird
i have never accessed firebird but from what i can gather it is just like interbase

2806012
outputstream	inputstream
has an inputstream and an outputstream that a host application can obtain

2806030
emacs	textmate
of course i heard there s also emacs on os x if that s your sex-appeal or textmate

2806056
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
as i said this is what the default of implementation of uitableviewcontroller s viewwillappear does so if you are using uitableviewcontroller and not seeing this behaviour you should check that you are calling the super implementation in your class own viewdidappear

2806056
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
as ben rightly points out in the comments uitableviewcontroller actually does this in viewwillappear not viewdidappear - this is the correct timing

2806069
hide	show
i want my panel to fit the frame when i show hide fields

2806110
rss	feed
i am trying to add a rss feed of gas prices based on location to my application

i have an abstract superclass and two subclassing

2806116
width	height
try setting the height and width of the element you re targeting with swfobject in css

2806118
puts	gets
if i only gets my data from the webservice once puts this in several objects.

2806177
superclass	subclassing
if it makes sense for anything to call performtransform is should be in the superclass as a virtual method and overridden in the subclassing

2806177
superclass	subclassing
so the superclass defines the flow from an abstract viewpoint and the subclassing implement them appropriately

2806177
superclass	subclassing
in your case the simplest options are to either just leave performtransform empty in the superclass or implement it as an empty method in the subclassing that doesn t require it when you mix this approach with a short comment you get a more maintainable system imo

2806180
viewdidload	viewwillappear
there s nothing in my eventstableviewcontroller about reloading the table as far as i can see--i haven t implemented viewwillappear or viewdidload or any of those

2806184
g++	gcc
use gcc and g++ while you re still learning these languages a big enough task for now

2806241
nextuntil	slidetoggle
tr.header nextuntil .header slidetoggle fast function

2806261
ant	maven
use ant which has an exec task or maven which has an exec plugin

2806274
qiodevice	qnetworkaccessmanager
i think that qnetworkaccessmanager is trying to read from the qiodevice until it gets a -1 from read at which point it assumes there is no more data and closes the request

2806274
qiodevice	qnetworkaccessmanager
this seems to be incompatible with the way that the post method of qnetworkaccessmanager expects a qiodevice to behave

2806274
qnetworkreply	qnetworkaccessmanager
the finished qnetworkreply signal from qnetworkaccessmanager triggers my postfinished qnetworkreply method

2806290
int	boolean
generally the main thread signals the worker thread to exit using an event object or a simply an int or boolean value

2806301
minimum	max
configuring a connection pool on the application and setting your site to consume it makes easy to the fine tune the connection pool parameters like minimum connections to keep open max idle time and so on

2806313
google-chrome	firefox
we only get the error message in google-chrome and firefox

2806365
put	get
i know each instance has a good amount of storage space and you don t have to pay for put get only the inbound transfer

2806403
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
in java 8 there is a new date and time api in the package java.time which is much more powerful and useful than the old java.util.date and java.util.calendar classes

2806446
objectdatasource	detailsview
the standard way to do it would be to have the selected item of the griview be a control parameter to the objectdatasource you have wired up to the detailsview

2806462
hide	show
i need show hide some fields of my

2806506
vbscript	autoit
vbscript isn t very good at dealing with gui functions at least it is not even remotely close to something like autoit

2806537
int	chars
that is i want a string type such that at s i will find a unsigned 32-bit int or a single byte would be enough actually containing the length of the string in bytes or in chars which is half the number of bytes followed by the unicode representation of the string

2806552
qprogressbar	qthread
i d guess i need a qthread object but i ve been looking through the qprogressbar documentation but it doesn t bring up the topic of threading

2806568
updatepanel	scriptmanager
note make sure to use scriptmanager not clientscript also for the second parameter use gettype on the updatepanel

2806591
qprogressbar	qthread
you can create a sub-class of qthread that emits a signal progresschanged which you connect to the qprogressbar

2806619
children	parent
setting a container to be positioned relatively makes absolutely positioned children elements position themselves relative to the parent

2806622
groupbox	panel
i have a panel that contains a groupbox some checkboxes and textboxes

2806626
textblock	itemscontrol
therefore your control is approximately an itemscontrol in terms of visual xaml it s an itemscontrol with a wrappanel style layout and very simple textblock for the item template

2806698
next	except
for the next step we ll use the getreferencetorawdata to get a pointer to the tpoint record hidden in the v tvalue you know the one we pretend we know nothing about - except the fact it s a record

2806728
google-chrome	firefox
it appears that the framework doesn t expose it as an event but i ve seen other applications like google-chrome and firefox which allow you to bring up a right-click context menu for a menu item

2806734
implements	extends
this can be achieved easily by using a simple table model class which extends the defaulttablemodel and a cell renderer and editor class which implements the tablecellrenderer and tablecelleditor interfaces respectively

2806794
des	aes
mcrypt does support several algorithms like aes tripel des

2806801
unsigned	short
i can use unsigned short to store it

2806801
unsigned	short
if i decided to not use short but just 10 bits packed into an array of unsigned int

2806806
dictionary	map
i have tried a memory map representation arrays dictionary and strings to represent that structure in memory but these always crash because of the memory limit

2806856
pull	push
i have a .net 3.5 compact framework project that uses rda for moving data between its mobile device s local sqlce database and a remote mssql-2008 server it uses rda push and pull

2806885
ienumerable	ilist
but frankly your o structure sucks you should build the list of items as an ienumerable or ilist or something not

2806890
unsigned	short
i can use unsigned short to store it

2806890
unsigned	short
yes you can use unsigned short assuming sizeof unsigned short char_bits 10

2806890
unsigned	short
if sizeof unsigned int sizeof unsigned short then probably not

2806890
unsigned	short
if i decided to not use short but just 10 bits packed into an array of unsigned int

2806901
innodb	myisam
myisam doesn t support transactions but innodb does

2807002

i haven t looked at the previous post because i think you need to get this into the mvc way first

2807114
uitableview	nsindexpath
- void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

2807140
nsmutablestring	nsstring
not all api s retain as the original nsstring may change in some way - one api may receive an nsstring reference but it s actually an nsmutablestring for exapmle

2807190
put	get
my initial thought was to create a windows service to pull the data...but then i couldnt decide how i was going to put a virtual card together and get it to print

2807239

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
my answer is actually embedded in my question i posted here uinavigationcontroller crash because of pushing and poping uiviewcontroller

2807340
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uinavigationcontroller crash because of pushing and poping uiviewcontroller

2807374
subobject	downcast
in this case if you try to downcast the this pointer of type for example to the type the compiler has no idea how to adjust the address because it doesn t know to which of the 2 subobject present in your newdriver object that pointer is supposed to point to

2807397
children	parent
note i don t want the children to only appear on their parent page they must be present all the time

2807474
rss	feed
for a bit of a roundabout solution a service like github offers an rss feed of commits and then you can use an rss to email service like feed my inbox

2807523
width	height
yes it s possible to dynamically resize it if width height is part of your application params that generates the embed code

2807550
submit	submission
rather than submission a change when dropdown a is changed then refreshing dropdown b s choices what you can do is submit a s value at the time when dropdown b is opened and process it in the server logic that determine s b s choices

2807601
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsview	qgraphicsitem	qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
also much of the functionality of qgraphicsitem like editing as you indicated depends on event handling in qgraphicsscene and qgraphicsview to work

2807637
glassfish	geronimo	jboss	geronimo	jboss	glassfish
open source implementations of the ejb spec would be glassfish from sun geronimo from apache jboss from jboss.org the open source version not the red hat one or openejb running under tomcat

2807717
haskell	ocaml
the program works fine and fast in haskell even when using foldl and not foldl but stack overflows in ocaml and f#

2807717
haskell	ocaml
your haskell is using lazy lists but your ocaml f# is using strict lists so your programs are incomparable

2807736
hide	show
in our case we set to disable by default so that any time we open static block it does not clean the code only if we choose by clicking show hide editor

2807740
autocomplete	multi-select
for how i m sending the band-ids with autocomplete see this related question django modelform validate custom autocomplete for m2m instead of ugly multi-select

2807745
int	double
i would advise you to stay away from double if the input might be bigger than 2 53 after which not all int can be exactly represented as double

2807752
stdout	stderr
naturally you could write a variation of this function to combine stdout and stderr and to discard the result code

2807798
unsigned	short
what i know about unsigned numerics unsigned short int and longs that it contains positive numbers only but the following simple program successfully assigned a negative number to an unsigned int

2807809
integer	unsigned
you need to use u to print an unsigned integer

2807815
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari

2807815
google-chrome	safari
for google-chrome and safari if you just do like above the forever iframe wonâ t work at all

2807817
integer	unsigned
because unsigned int value that is stored in sum is treated like signed decimal integer in printf i

2807848
kde	gnome
i know that for gnome and i believe kde hitting it pulls up the shutdown dialog and thus is captured by the window manager and not passed on

2807857
mouse	keyboard
you see all kinds of user input be it via keyboard or mouse or whatever io device is passed to your application through windows in the form of messages

2807870
int	double
the complexity of this code is one sqrt one double multiplication one cast dbl- int and one comparison

2807889
min	max
eliminate nulls by using min and max values

2807891
jsfl	fla
you can use jsfl to script the flash ide and tell it to compile an fla to a swf

2807910
superclass	subclassing
classb needs nodeb types but i can t cast from the subclassing to the superclass

2808015
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
on my site 1 everything looks great in firefox google-chrome safari all the same - but ie7 it s all out of whack

2808045
mp3	wav
according to this guy you have to import the music loop as a wav and have the flash ide itself compress to mp3

2808165
shadowing	named
as greg mentions in your example you re creating a new local variable called named that is shadowing your parameter

2808202
public	protected
public void btn_click event or dropdown_selectedindexchanged event the cursor points to protected void page_load only

2808217
versioning	upgrade
extending this logic we can auto-increment the ignored fourth versioning field with every build but prevent upgrade when the first three are the same

2808275
maven	pom.xml
yes maven uses a pom.xml file to describe a project s medata and extend maven s behavior which also known as the project object model pom.xml file

2808275
ant	maven
why doesn t maven use scripts for this kind of job i don t see xml has any advantage here which is why i don t like ant

2808275
maven	buildr
now nothing forces you to use maven if you don t like it and feel free to use gradle or gant or buildr if the size of their communities is not a concern

2808275
maven	pom.xml
just in case note that maven 3 offers polyglot support see this post and this one but as i said writing a pom.xml in groovy yaml etc doesn t only have advantages validation

2808279
pull	push
for the sake of simplicity and interoperating with a less-capable system svn it is recommended that all git svn users clone fetch and dcommit directly from the svn server and avoid all git clone pull merge push operations between git repositories and branches

2808284
int	boolean
for instance an interface could define a function called foo which takes an int and returns a boolean

2808303
maven	pom.xml
maven uses xml for pom.xml files because xml is a good choice for describing things .

2808303
maven	pom.xml
it would make no sense to express maven pom.xml files in some kind of scripting language because they are not scripts in any recognizable sense

2808353
gdal	ogr
i ll only add that i use gdal ogr when simplicity and speed is wanted in conversions

2808353
gdal	ogr
when all you want to do is jam a bunch of shapefiles together or convert a large series of rasters to a common projection gdal ogr is faster to startup and run as it doesn t need to load the whole arcobjects com library to access one or two functions

udp	tcp
this will increase the connection overhead by 2 packets and a few bits per packet however you will still gain from udp s speed for the rest of the session when compared to tcp

2808522
arp	udp	arp	tcp	udp	tcp
however using tcp or udp as a transport layer still leaves you open to other attacks such as sniffing and man in the middle attacks using arp spoofing or dns cache poising

2808522
spoofing	traffic
another problem is if both the attacker and the gamers are on the same local lan such as a wireless network or another broadcast network then you are able to receive traffic regardless of the source dest address and only then does spoofing a three way handshake become possible and an hmac can t help

2808524
mouse	keyboard
if you want to do it as a user operating the mouse and keyboard then your question belongs on a different web site even though blindy answered that question for you

hide	show
btw here s a tip for doing hide show on lots of elements by id

what isn t clear from your post is any mapping between the xsd components and the particular resource data you have in rdf or schema thereof such as rdfs or owl or both

2808982
xslt	xquery
if you d rather not write any java code at all to do this you could write some xslt or xquery to transform your rdf xml directly into the required xml but this sounds like it will be more work than the aforementioned option given what you ve got already

put	get	accessor	properties
if i instead put the trimming responsibility in my business objects such as with set accessor of my c# properties i should get the same net results however the trim will be operating on all values assigned to my business objects properties not just the ones that come from the inconsistent database

2810149
accessor	properties
would it make sense to have a set accessor for a phonenumber properties on a business object accept a unformatted or formatted string and then attempt to format it as required or should this responsibility be pushed to the presentation and data access layers leaving the domain layer more strict in the type of data that it will accept

2810152

pascal	delphi
i have seen solutions made in pascal for dos in such layer of abstraction that with little effort it was moved directly to delphi for windows without touching application logic

2813234
itunes	iphoto
if you re just looking to say manipulate itunes or iphoto remotely i would recommend implementing a server-side service that exposes only the functionality your iphone client actually needs

2813306
superclass	subclassing
i cannot have another embedded property in the subclassing since this would duplicate data that is already present in the superclass and would also break the java model

hide	show
enough so that my spinner which set to hide when stopped never actually show up

2813405

2813634
maven	pom.xml
for example the maven release plugin updates the version information in the pom.xml and checks the changes into version control

2813634
maven	pom.xml
try searching for the specific task you are trying to accomplish maven plugin version number update rather than the more generic modify pom.xml

2813645
firefox	safari
and now it works in ie firefox and safari

2813662
int	chars
whereas chars just means chars a or b could mean chars or bool or int or some other type

2813692
int	chars
let s say we have 2 functions which takes a chars and returns it s int representation and that adds 32 to it s argument

margin	border-color
if you don t want a colored border on browsers that don t support border-color transparent i m looking at you ie you can just add an additional pixel to margin or padding

2813760
onclick	onmousedown
so onmousedown replaces the link and when onclick appears shortly after the onmousedown the link is pointing already to somewhere else than the original direction

2813776
x86	64bit
addressing modes for 32-bit address size on 32-bit or 64bit x86 processors can be summarized by this formula

2813776
x86	64bit
addressing modes for 64bit code on 64bit x86 processors can be summarized by these formulas

2813790
mockups	balsamiq

they populate themselves via a get to the url and store update via post to the url

2813816
post	get
i saw another post with this error but i couldn t figure out how to get it right

2813827
versioning	upgrade
yes you could use a different name or you could use the same name and do an upgrade delete and replace on the first time the user uses a new versioning

2813827
versioning	upgrade
having some code that checks versioning at app start lets you put any data upgrade stuff in one place

2813827
versioning	upgrade
if the most-recent versioning is lower than the running app versioning run your upgrade and bump the versioning

2813888
hash	salt
make sure to salt your hash

2813961
hash	md5
truth is sha-512 or md5 or some very weak hash once rainbow tables are precomputed doesn t make any difference

2813961
hash	salt
note that even if you understand fully how hash salt and rainbow tables relate and hence understand why the wikipedia article states a salt is often employed with hash passwords to make this attack more difficult often infeasible. there s a very high probability that your co-workers don t

2813974
put	get
if i put an alert textstatus in the complete function i get true but not before that function returns undefined

we have many ubuntu and debian systems and were unware of wandisco s update site initially

2814051
client-side	server-side
another thing i like to do is to use the same php validation functions for both server-side and client-side validation as in sending an ajax request to a script containing the same php function to keep the amount of cross-language code duplication to a minimum

2814114
ienumerable	ilist
- all the way from repositories to business model or not at all and expose only solid ilist and ienumerable from repositories and deal with more specific queries inside business model but have more finer grained methods for data retrieval within repositories

2814120
flip	slide
you can just present a modal view controller when you first launch using the flip transition instead of the default slide

2814243
hash	md5
if hashing is enabled x xy will be appended to the path where xy are the first two letters of the md5 hash of the filename

2814257
int	chars
this is the signature for the isdigit function it indicates that it will accept an int value or something that can be cast to int like a chars and will return an int

2814259
int	chars
actually it s int i don t know whether this is for compatibilty reasons or whatnot but the most common usage is for chars

2814283
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mouseenter	mousemove	mousedown	mousedown	mouseenter	mouseup	mousedown	mouseup	mouseenter
if you can leverage the same backend services perhaps when a drag begins mousedown + mousemove you could send a chunk of xaml up to a service to store cache the content and when a drag ends on the other application mouseenter + mouseup over the drop target you could call that service to pull down the cached content

2814299
feof	fread
restructure your loop to use the return value of fread and check against feof only if fread fails

2814371
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
some browsers have their own implmentation like -moz-border-radius for firefox and -webkit-border-radius for safari and google-chrome

2814388
hash	salt
if you simply want to massively reduce the effectiveness of dictionary attacks use a salt in addition to password hash

type inference is an application of what is called the unification algorithm

2814555
maven	m2e
i have dependancies installed local on my machine .m2 repository blah blah blah and m2e is not recognizing them as there - i think m2e is using its own maven instance

2814568
int	boolean
this basically just says that any method anywhere that returns a boolean and takes a single parameter of type int is an instance of this delegate

2814568
int	boolean
govisitmyfriends doesn t care which method you give it as long as the method is shaped just like the definition of notifyfriendsdelegate it has to return boolean and accept one parameter of type int

2814569
ubuntu	linux
he has a different machine which is running linux ubuntu as host and it also reports 0

i have my parent object which contains an icollection of children objects

2814713
getter	setter
or can anyone think of another way to genericize getter setter creation

2814718
jscrollpane	jviewport
to do this the first contained component the one that is the child to jviewport passed into the jscrollpane constructor or set as the viewportview needs to implement javax.swing.scrollable

2814779
vtk	itk
my suspicion is that there is some failed dynamic linking of a dependency which are qt vtk and itk all built with mingw

2814818
ocl	uml
for that you can easily use the javadoc description for the return value or if you want to be more precise you can use the ocl language part of uml stack to describe the postcondition

2814843
directx	gdi
the problem of doing a capture from an external application is that the 3d application loses it s vsync and creates a shaggy difficult to use 3d application 3d app is only presented on a small part of the screen the rest being gdi directx

2814843
directx	gdi
depending on the technology used opengl directx gdi it hooks the vsync and does its capture with glreadpixels ... without perturbing it

2814898
post	get
some of the web service calls need to be get rather than post but passing parameters

2814898
post	get
i m looking at the urllib2 docs and it looks like it decides by itself wether to use post or get based on if you pass params or not but maybe someone knows how to make it transform the params dictionary into a get request

2814911
ubuntu	debian
for debian ubuntu the package is empty-expect

2814912
post	get
sometimes it may help switching off allowautoredirect and setting both login post and page get requests the same user agent

2814935
crossover	mutation
talking from my limited experience if you decide to simplify the problem and use a fixed way to implement crossover selection and just play with population size and mutation rate implemented in a given way trying to come up with general results you ll soon realize that too many variables are still into play because at the end of the day the number of generations after which statistically you will get a decent result whatever way you wanna define decent still obviously depend primarily on the problem you re solving and consequently on the genome size representing the same problem in different ways will obviously lead to different results in terms of effect of given ga parameters

2814958
stdout	fflush
you need to fflush stdout using sys.stdout.flush every time you want to write the updates

2814968
postgresql	mysql
i recently switched my database from mysql to postgresql

2814983
hide	show
the showbars is not used to show or hide the status bar but rather to show and hide the navigation bar items

2814986
profiling	benchmarking
an example of benchmarking the performance of live you can try is by profiling a fragment of code that uses live to bind a click handler to an element and also profiling another fragment of code that uses click to bind to that same element

2815012
min	max
i want to select distinct col1 with max col3 and min col2

2815076
mp3	wav
my architecture basically comes down to this - a short 15-20 second wav mp3 other clip as the input output is plaintext

2815130
entity-relationship	diagram
never shall an entity-relationship diagram get anywhere near the preciseness accuracy and completeness of a database design formally written out in d

2815145
free	malloc
classic malloc free is pretty fast and can be made safe if you have sufficient constraints on object creation and lifetime which you may be able to enforce in your language

2815156
width	height
what makes this work even better is the height and width binding on the panel- what this says is make this panel the same size as my parent window. that means that when i resize the window the wrappanel adjusts its size accordingly resulting in a better layout for the items

2815170
udp	tcp
with somewhat insecure if the data payloads were not sensitive you could use an integrity only cipher with tcp tls udp dtls to reduce processing overhead and latency at the client and server

2815221
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
i realize the users will have to uninstall the current versioning to get the upgrade but it s not clear how to get the updated versioning into the market so that the current users will find it

2815229
disk	ram
for example ya never know when malloc 10 may cause the vm to page something out now your 10 bytes of ram have an unknown disk i o component -- oops

2815244
fadein	fadeout
this doesn t work but changing fadein to fadeout makes it work

2815281
mri	rubinius
when installing on ruby mri and rubinius the c extension and only the c extension will be used

2815349
packets	pcap
the goal of pcap is to transparently receive a copy of every packets in the system

2815420
int	double
start at index 1 and you ll double it logarithmically many times until you get something large enough then logarithmically many more steps to find your int or rule it out

2815434
put	get
i was able to get a script that allows me to put each individual on one row

2815439
hide	show
the only way i can think to do it is to store a flag in the element s data when you call show or hide but i was wondering if there was another way

2815441
width	height
in other words no buttons just a clean div that s the same height and width no scrolling if there s only one image

2815453
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the menu works perfectly in firefox google-chrome opera and epiphany

2815458
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i ve tested the above with office 11 2003 and office 12 2007 and it seems to work well in firefox safari google-chrome and opera

2815487
opera	firefox
here is what it looks like in opera and firefox in linux

2815501
getter	setter
that looks like fine setter getter to me

2815505
getter	setter
unfortunately java doesn t have a more compact way of defining getter and setter like a lot of other languages do

2815505
getter	setter
a thought-provoking if a bit extreme article on this is available here why getter and setter methods are evil

2815506
getter	setter
you could also use groovy which automatically generates the getter setter

2815507
getter	setter
just to correct your current design assuming you do want getter and setter i would change it to

2815517
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the ads load fine every time when visiting the site via google-chrome ie or safari but sometimes don t load at all in firefox - hence it is a client side issue which leads me to believe its something up with the javascript

2815521
getter	setter
since that s the whole point of using getter setter

2815521
getter	setter
it s more important that you understand why you re using getter setter

2815526
min	max
you might one day want to enforce a min and max on codigo or make sure it is in fixed set of values you could do that in the setcodigo method without any client code knowing about it

2815531
stateless	stateful
for developing web applications flex has the convenience of being stateful whereas html is stateless

2815555
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
fast clicking on ie has slower response than firefox google-chrome and safari

2815583
children	parent
parent class has no awareness of its children

2815597
distance	polygons
if you base the voronoi polygons on your key trees and cluster the neighbouring trees into those polygons that would partition your search space by proximity finding the enclosing polygons for a given non-key point is fast but ultimately you re going to get down to computing key to non-key distance by pythagoras or trig and comparing them

2815601
getter	setter
also setter is not always needed although getter is almost needed always

2815629
trie	tree
for me the only one reason to use visitor pattern is when i need to perform double dispatch on graph-like data structure like tree trie

2815635
debian	linux
i ve installed the development version of crunchbang a linux distro based off debian

2815643
int	double
also note that when measuring the size of an array it is less error-prone to divide by the size of the first element so that if the type of abc changes from int to double the results are still valid

2815723
getter	setter
like jon said you need to have a strong reason to need getter setter

2815742
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
hope is on the way however - html5 includes an improvement to this situation called cross-document messaging that is supported in firefox 3 safari 4 google-chrome 2 opera 9.2 and even ie.

2815757
width	height
ok so to add a static toolbar like object that has a width which is 100 of the page and a height of say 25px you would do this

2815776
ostringstream	std
you can use the std ostringstream class to convert the number to a string

2815791
hide	show
then jquery will be able to show and hide as desired

2815818
punctuation	words
your ways works well if the words are all separated by strings but that is rarely the case in most usage scenarios as you would normally have to deal with newlines punctuation etc

2815860
hash	salt
i ve read a number of so questions on this topic but grokking the applied practice of storing a salt hash of a password eludes me

2815860
postgresql	mysql
a database postgresql mysql sql server oracle

2815860
hash	salt
store the password hash with random salt in the db one column

2815860
hash	salt
but it is storing the password hash with a random salt in single db column that i need to understand better with practical application

2815860
hash	salt
i have theory on this and as i type i might be grokking the concept given a random salt of 128 bytes and a password of 8 bytes foobar12 it could be programmatically possible to remove the part of the hash that was the salt by hashing a random 128 byte salt and getting the substring of the original hash that is the hash password

2815864
projectile	angle
update thinking about it and trying stuff has led me to the conclusion that it has something to do with when the direction being in radians is below 0 and the current projectile angle is above 0

2815873
fadein	fadeout
but i want that if the same is present then it should not fadein fadeout

2815887
uiview	subviews
i added a uitableview as a subviews to a custom uiview class i m working on

2815898
firefox	safari
i manage a website called shareden.com and it looks the right way in mozilla firefox and it s totally completely discombobulated in safari

2815912
firefox	safari
on desktop browsers ie8 firefox safari it works just fine

2815944
ocl	uml
i mean uml and ocl are only semi-formal languages their syntax is well-defined but their semantics is only partially formalized many aspects are just described in natural language in the standard document specifications

2815944
ocl	uml
therefore if you are building a critical system and you need to prove the correctness of the system then uml ocl may fall short but for many other kinds of systems the kind of formality that uml ocl can provide is good enough

2815951
jobs	cron
look for a host with a cpanel which is a useful graphic interface for managing things like dns packages and cron jobs

2815954
distance	pdist
in matlab you can use pdist to get a list of all unique pairwise distance

2815981
google-chrome	firefox
t return data in ie but does in firefox and google-chrome

2815989
put	get
i didn t have to put a backslash in front of the parentheses to get them to group

2816002
hash	salt
the user is authenticated with a salt hash not the unsalted password or the random salt by itself

2816002
hash	salt
the salt hash and the salt but not the actual password are both stored in the database you can store them in a single column if you like but you will have to separate them again before use

2816002
hash	salt
in order to recover the salt hash from the user so that you can compare it to the stored salt hash you need the salt from the database and the password provided by the user

2816002
hash	salt
the salt hash is created like this

2816002
hash	salt
should two users accidentally choose the same password the salt hash will still be different for both user accounts

2816016
firefox	safari
i have also found this only works in ie verified not working in firefox and safari

2816028
children	parent
children always extends their parent

2816042
hash	salt
concatenate the salt with the hash password in some way before storing it

2816053
int	boolean
this method wants to taken in in addition to the jxlistofkeyvaluepairs instance a that defines which data type to convert the values to assume that only boolean int and float are possible

2816058
hash	salt
you could also store salt and hash in the same column using a separator

2816060
stdout	fflush
my guess is that on mac os x the n causes stdout to be fflush while this is not so on windows

2816064
sorting	grouping
you can switch between ksort and krsort to switch the orders but basically you are making an array that is keyed by the number in sorting that array by that number and then traversing each grouping of records that have a specific value

2816065
stdout	fflush
you need to fflush stdout after your call to printf

2816067
hash	salt
it matches it by computing the hash of the password the user entered with the same salt which it reads from the database at the same time as the hash

2816122
division	modulo
the modulo gives you the remainder of an integer division

2816181
super	extends
if you make only a private constructor no class can extends your class because it can t call the super constructor

2816222
hash	salt
the single-column solution is just like the multi-column solution except that it combines the salt and the hash together into a single column

2816222
hash	salt
the checking code still has to know how to break that single value down into the salt and hash

2816222
hash	salt
this has been how salt passwords have typically worked - for example the unix etc shadow format stores an algorithm identifier salt and hash together in a single field

2816252
multiplying	multiplication
actually multiplying a string and an integer is a syntactic error since the multiplication of incompatible types such as a string and an integer is not defined in c

2816311
profiling	benchmarking
just write the most readable code you can and then benchmarking profiling your app - that will be a much better way to get good performance than trying to second guess this sort of thing

2816376
inherited	properties
if you inherited a properties you inherited it name type and all

2816376
inherited	properties
if you want you can write another properties with a different name and call the inherited properties from it you still have to implement the original properties

2816700
post	get
many had a query regarding the same and had missed the type in .ajax but even if i mention the type as post the request will be of type get

2816739
cvs	svn
weâ ve migrated from cvs on aix to svn on linux via cvs2svn

2816759
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
on .net framework 2.0 autoresetevent and manualresetevent inherit from eventwaithandle

2816759
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
on the other hand both manualresetevent and autoresetevent do not support naming and provide a single constructor that receives the initialstate

2816835
converter	multibinding
use either multibinding or converter if complex operation is there

2816843
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in firefox ie8 google-chrome and opera i get scrollbars for the content div when i resize the page to a size where both divs can t fit in as a whole

2816871
put	get
i am able to get the number of items but i now need to separate the sections with 0 zero items in them and put them at the bottom of the list of table titles

2816903
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
i have written what i hope is a lightweight alternative to using the manualresetevent and autoresetevent classes in c# .net

2816926
cvs	svn
first you have to be aware of that svn is different from cvs

2816926
cvs	svn
the first things is svn is changeset based whereas cvs is file based

2816936
post	get
this would be simple if all i had to do was get the most recent post based on post created_on value however if a post contains replies i need to factor this into the equation

2816936
post	get
if a post has a more recent reply i want to get the replies created_on value but also get the post post_id and subject

2816940
free	malloc
.net javascript are my bread and butter. obviously the need to free memory that you malloc is critical in c

2816940
free	malloc
but as programs grow and structs deepen keeping track of what s been malloc d where and what s appropriate to free gets harder and harder

2816951
getter	setter
i m using the __get and __set magic methods in order to intercept external calls to some private attributes without the need of writing a setter and a getter for each attribute

2816959
apache	nginx
i have a chat application xmpp muc that is going to be served by apache we might change to nginx later but right now it s not easily done

2816961
getter	setter
my intention is -- since all calculations are in parent class they cannot be done per nested instance because it would make code more complicated -- make the setter only available to parent class and getter public

2816968
getter	setter
you can use a public setter and a private getter in case you need to access the variable in its own class

2817043
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i m not sure how to explain it without a picture so here s a comparison of google-chrome opera firefox

2817043
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
so you can sorta see how in google-chrome the background image is in one non-repeating piece whereas in opera firefox the image has oddly been broken up and placed slightly differently

2817043
opera	firefox
i m confident this is due to an error on my part but i ve had no luck at all figuring out why the image is being mangled in opera and firefox

2817117
width	height
your h1 needs a width and height otherwise display block is a little pointless imho

2817187
google-chrome	firefox
just took a look in google-chrome and firefox and they re both displaying the same as your error pic

2817187
opera	firefox
take a look here html5 browser support checklist seems that firefox and opera don t support all html5 attribute yet so invariably there will be some weird problems

2817203
ant	maven
this script checksout all my projects and subprojects and i ve just got used to using maven didn t really use much of an ant before and i know ant can be used with maven so my question is how

2817239
button	checkbox
the checkbox are mutually exclusive and i would like to get the selected checkbox value on the click of a button

2817283
free	strdup
eventually you ll have to free the memory allocated by strdup

2817295
getter	setter
override the getter and the setter

post	get
you can solve this by incrementing a variable each time you call .post when you get data back you decrement and check if all post have returned and if so you do what you want to do

2817352
ubuntu	debian
i m used to debian and it s derivatives ubuntu and so on and thus to debian packages aka

2817356
post	get
get the most recent post the most recent reply to a post then get the most recent one of them

2817477
hash	salt
there is no need to encrypt a salt and hash password

2817477
hash	salt
when the password is salt and hash with a good algorithm encrypting it will not improve the security

2817556
bazaar	git
it was originally implemented in the bazaar vcs and also added to git as an option

2817603
width	font-size
for example in this case don t set the width of the surrounding element in pixels but in em s so that it is relative to the font-size

2817672
put	get
your probably in the wrong place if your asking how to bypass a system put in place to get people to buy software

2817680
mouse	keyboard
i m trying to write some code that discards all keyboard and mouse events when enabled on mac osx 10.6

2817680
mouse	keyboard
this approach works very well while the event tap is active - i can hammer on the keyboard and mouse as much as i want and no events make it through the system

2817687
ant	maven
i m really not a big fan of this approach either use ant or maven but not a bastard mix but you can use an external build.xml with the maven antrun plugin

2817719
treemap	linkedhashmap
some map implementations such as linkedhashmap and treemap do guarantee a certain order but hashmap does not

2817729
dlsym	dlopen
on linux it would be easier for you to link to shared library and use symlinks to correct version - imo it s much easier than using dlopen + dlsym

2817753
int	double
i d guess you should either double check where these values come from or make sure they are int

2817786
udp	tcp
if you re going to send files over the lan then udp is the way to go because tcp s overhead is a waste in that case

2817786
udp	tcp
tcp provides rate limiting to avoid too many lost packets whereas with udp the application has to sort that out by itself

2817816
fast-forward	merge
if you do your work on branches and merge them on master for commit without fast-forward you can reference the commit parent and it commits all changes back to cvs

2817818
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works great in firefox but not in ie google-chrome or safari

2817830
hash	salt
but if i were making a regular ol web app i would just go with salt hash

2817830
hash	salt
the only situation in which encrypting the salt hash is useful is if attackers can get their hands on the encrypted values but not the key

2817874
hex	binary
your first problem is that the keys in perl are hex and you need to convert them into binary

2818023
rdf	owl
rdfs + owl is a combination used to define rdf schemata and ontologies

2818026
unsigned	short
if i understand your question correctly the short answer is yes every single byte will contain a value between 0 and 255 unsigned that is

likewise using haxe s accessor that are indeed very different from as3 s you can also use aop for properties

2818175
mouseout	mouseleave
this is different behavior than that of the mouseout event which is dispatched each time the mouseleave the area of any child object of the display object container even if the mouse remains over another child object of the display object container

i have a datalist that contains a gridview inside its itemtemplate

2818262
gmail	hotmail
i have to write regular expression for gmail hotmail

http-get	http-post
however wsdl.exe can generate proxy classes to communicate with an xml web service using either the http-get protocol or http-post protocol

2818335
post	get
note post should be used to send data get to receive data

2818355
children	parent
we have a situation where table a is a parent table and there are probably a dozen or so tables that are children of a

2818359
uiview	subviews
uiactionsheet is a subviews of uiview and therefore you could use the tag property

2818375
lan	localhost
i am running a subversion service on my localhost i want users on the lan to be able to access this repository without being prompted for username and password

2818387
implements	extends

2818414
pull	push
that way no problem during pull push

2818424
x86	mips
i would like the solution to be portable across mips ppc and x86 all 32 bits architecture using gcc as the compiler

2818470
getter	setter
getter are always called before setter during control initialization

2818479
int	double
currently only supports int double datetime bool and string

2818492
public	protected
if so make extractpagedata protected abstract and call it from a public method on the base see this so question and answer

2818598
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i would approach the design slightly differently and design code the xhtml css for opera firefox safari etc first and then see how it displays in ie

2818743
dictionary	map
you could have a single function filterbytype that takes 2 arguments the list of pets and the filtering type and then just define a dictionary to map input strings to the type object or class that you mean to filter by

2818747
updatepanel	scriptmanager
if you were using updatepanel which doesn t seem the case from response.write you would use the similar scriptmanager method

2818811
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouse	keyboard	mouseup	mousedown
it will accept mouse input and report mousedown mousemove and mouseup correctly but for whatever reason it won t accept keyboard input

2818855
portrait	landscape
i have designed application to work for both the orientation portrait landscape

2818855
portrait	landscape
now i wanted to achieve auto screen rotation portrait to landscape and landscape to portrait according to the device movement some thing like iphone

2818872
folder	directory
no the application directory holding the config folder is d servers htdocs myapp app

2818872
folder	directory
note i m not actually sure where the global vendors folder should be when you have a setup where the cake and application directory are split from each other but you definitely have to be in your application directory when running commands and not the myapp directory you re using.

2818876
debian	linux
my windows machine is running windows 7 and my linux machine is running debian

2818933
folder	directory
note i would install plugins in a shared dropin folder and synchronized that directory as well

2818942
folder	directory
in the dropbox folder i have a projects folder this is where i would put my eclipse start up directory

2818942
folder	directory
secondly i would move your install directory for eclipse into the dropbox folder

2818995
put	get
you might get away from this if you put the images into a list which would allow it to be more dynamic

2819024
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari also have it i believe

2819068
int	chars
you re receiving 65533 because that s the int used for the unicode replacement chars used when a value can t be represented as a real unicode chars

2819126
post	get
i hope you don t have a web app and have a get or post variable called ssn with the actual value in it

2819133
cvs	svn
instead of checkout update the project under the workspace dir i d like to specify a dir as you can do for svn changing the local module directory conf that will match the cvs tree structure

2819256
button	checkbox
if you click on the label you may for instance check or uncheck a checkbox radio button

2819274
udp	tcp
depending on the operation requested by the client i use make tcp or udp request

2819274
udp	tcp
on the servers-side on the other hand i would like to listen both for udp and tcp connections on the same port

2819274
udp	tcp
i have extended this code sample by creating new threads for each tcp udp request

2819274
udp	tcp
this works correctly if i use tcp only but it fails when i attempt to make udp bindings

2819277
fullscreen	minimized	pop-up	dialog
something triggers a program to pop-up a dialog window in the background while a fullscreen app is focused causing the fullscreen app to minimized

2819341
src	attr
i have tried the attr src and other methods but to no avail

2819372
hide	show
a value of block means show and a value of none means hide

2819471
qpushbutton	qwidget
from yours qt tutorial because this class inherits from qwidget the new class is a widget and may be a top-level window or a child widget like the qpushbutton in the previous chapter

2819498
post	get
but in order to get the cart data to paypal i used hidden post elements and paypal did the rest

2819531
children	parent
for example starting from the node new york i d like to be able to find parent like the new york state the usa etc and children like manhattan bronx etc

2819535
free	malloc
i allocated new memory using malloc and when i m trying to free it i always receive the error incompatible pointer type

2819552
udp	tcp
afaik you should be able to listen for both tcp connections and udp messages on the same port

2819568
textarea	textbox
so i ve modified it a little to make it even better can update in multiple textbox textarea at once

2819577
free	malloc
store pointers received from malloc in non-const pointer variables so that you can pass them to free

2819583
allocator	stl	boost	allocator	boost	stl
i think you could pre-allocate and mlock a sufficiently large memory pool on startup and then use regular stl containers with memory pool allocator boost of fsba or your own

2819588
firefox	safari
it works in safari and firefox

2819591
ssl	https
https and i should just have to send the auth tls or auth ssl commands to the ftp server

2819621
zoo	xts
it was my understanding that whenever i have a function that takes zoo i can pass it an xts and it should just work but clearly that is not the case here

2819633
put	get
get some data and put it in session

2819654
int	chars
if you agree with that calling insert int int chars makes no sense since the two first arguments are supposed to be a buffer sizes

2819689
jobs	cron
are they using cron jobs or do they have something custom done

2819689
jobs	cron
can anyone guide me on how i can accomplish something similar to that basically i just want my script to add or remove cron jobs scheduled task

2819755
versioning	upgrade
you should recommend to any users you have that still have this beta versioning to upgrade

wxpython	textctrl
now i ve developed a gui version of my app using wxpython and i d like to display all the logging output to a custom control â a multi-line textctrl

2819799
jobs	cron
i believe vbulletin fakes cron jobs

2819799
jobs	cron
if however no users visit the website none of the cron jobs will execute the method is 100 reliant on page views

2819799
jobs	cron
also to prevent delayed page rendering on users who execute the cron jobs they are executed after the page has been rendered

2819806
put	get
i want to put the mvc2 app into azure once i get this working

2819824
post	put
if you want to ensure that post only arrive from your own form you could put a one-time token on the form in a hidden field to validate

2819834
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome ie and firefox i only ever see a notification from one of the onbeforeunload handlers even when i say it s okay to go ahead and leave

i have been using session s to post which logged in user is inputting what and have tried to get my brain to think about the reverse action

2819852

some of you may be aware of the problem with jquery plugins such thickbox lightbox fancybox etc. where some users consider the back button to be broken

2820014

if i run this with the java app it doesn t work whenever the mouse is over the java gui it has keyboard focus - if i swap some standard x gui widget xeyes in place of the java gui it works like a charm

2820069
cgpoint	cgsize	cgpoint	cgrect	cgsize	cgrect
uikit uses the core graphics structs cgpoint cgsize and cgrect

2820093
jobs	cron
if you don t have the exec function enabled you have to rely on manually setting at least one cron job via some interface and then managing individual jobs in your script

2820114
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox 3+ safari 4+ google-chrome 1+ and some newer versions of opera support this effect

2820114
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3.1+ safari 4+ and google-chrome support this

2820158
int	double
if you cast the double to an int long it will chop off any decimal component effectively giving you a floor or round-down of the double

2820196
installation	upgrade
for what i have read a major upgrade removes the previous installation and replaces all the files

2820326
zoo	xts
and i am wondering if you think that zoo and xts are identical

2820326
zoo	xts
they are not -- xts extends zoo in useful ways at the prices of limiting the index types to actual time or date objects rather than arbitrary indices as for zoo

2820326
zoo	xts
now dynlm is written by achim zeileis who is one of the authors of zoo as i don t see why you can t keep your data in xts but then pass to zoo via as.zoo foo when calling the dynlm functions

2820329
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
some browsers such as firefox google-chrome safari opera and ie10+ can handle base64 natively

2820345
width	height
you cannot have px in the width and height attributes only a number

2820352
implements	extends
create a class which extends thread or implements runnable and run it

2820371
int	chars
this function returns an int that is -1 is the end of the stream has been reached or can be cast to a chars otherwise

2820410
nsinvocationoperation	nsblockoperation
usage of applescript inside a nsinvocationoperation or nsblockoperation

2820433
zoo	xts
the simple answer is that zoo and xts are not completely interchangeable although sometimes they are

2820449
clearinterval	settimeout	setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout
you can do so by using the returned value of the settimeout setinterval function and passing that value to the cleartimeout clearinterval function - as described in other answers here

2820449
clearinterval	settimeout	setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout
from w3.org tr 2009 wd-html5-20090212 no.html a draft but w3schools and explain it almost the same way - settimeout and setinterval return a long and cleartimeout clearinterval accept a long to find and cancel

2820483
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
these of course only work on browsers where a console object is defined such as ie 8 safari google-chrome and firefox with firebug installed

2820502
put	get
i can get the drag drop bit to work i now need to put the final positions into a serialized array

2820502
put	get
i have done this to see if i can get the col id s into an alert and i can but where do i put

2820538
getter	setter
the reason this can happen is because a val is constant and as such it can be emulated by only a getter and no setter

2820555
vsts	tfs
workitems are part of vsts there is no any concept for workitems in other source control systems the microsft tfs

2820572
google-chrome	safari
in internet explorer the html is interpreted whereas mozilla google-chrome and safari leave it uninterpreted

2820581
inherited	properties
it is important to use the hasownproperty method to determine whether the object has the specified properties as a direct properties and not inherited from the object s prototype chain

2820602
mouseleave	mouseenter
jquery 1.4.1 makes hover map to mouseenter mouseleave so you would do

2820630
superclass	subclassing
i know that a direct subclassing in a different package can access the superclass protected members

2820630
inherited	subclassing
i thought any subclassing can access its inherited protected members

2820630
superclass	subclassing
sorry novice mistake subclassing can access an indirect superclass protected members

2820631
min	max
the above code is a blanket code for all non-specialized types and they will indeed return the same value for both min and max

2820633
temp	tmp
when you download .flv files with flash they are in your tmp folder or whatever your crazy os uses for temp data

2820633
post	get
this makes it so you can t have some easy to forge get post request to download the file you actually have to simulate a protocol interaction which most children can t do

2820633
mp3	flv
you let the flash player make the request for the token then the next request for a mp3 flv file can be intercepted and then dropped

2820647
submit	submission
the problem is that i have added a search button on the same page using a usercontrol the search submit button triggers the comment form submission validation

2820650
google-chrome	firefox
i m testing it in google-chrome and firefox if i do an alert userselection within the function or an alert findselection

2820690
put	get
you can use the stacktrace class to get the name of the current function or if you put the code in a function then step down a level and get the calling function

2820717
width	height
bitmap doprintscreen int x int y int width int height

2820740
width	height
it would be easy for a user to accidentally swap x and y or width and height

2820742
min	max
you need to define two methods min tree and max tree then span tree t is defined as max t - min t

2820742
min	max
span itself shouldn t be recursive but you can make min and max recursive if you want

2820742
min	max
note that min and max doesn t have to be their own methods

2820765
hide	show
however this doesn t really work as when a couple of the radio buttons are on the same page the correct show hide behaviour seems to be messed up

2820777
width	height
the x y associate with width height so as to define a rectangle

2820783

2820795
width	height
as soon as i try to scroll around the image jumps to 0 0 and everything works as normal except the touches are offset by half the width and height of the background image

2820797
width	height
inline elements like span label etc. are displayed so that their height and width are calculated by the browser based on their content

2820797
width	height
if you want to control height and width you have to change those elements blocks

2820799
put	get
this is something you get for free if you put your stack of components into a vbox or box with direction vertical

2820802
width	height
also if you need to grab the same screen area repeatedly it s easier to save one variable a rectangle than four x y width and height

2820814
google-chrome	firefox
it works really well in at least firefox and saf but in google-chrome it never gets past the .each

2820853
postgresql	mysql
this query works just fine using mysql as the database but we d like to move towards postgresql

2820896
width	height
some times you have separated x y width height

2820903
stdout	stderr
use to redirect stderr to stdout

2820903
stdout	stderr
backticks only capture output to stdout and will miss output to stderr

2820935
maven	m2e
if you wonder m2e uses embedded maven 3 maven embedder 3.0.0.200912160759

2820935
maven	m2e
and i think that configuring m2e to not use maven embedder but the version you use on the cli would also solve the problem and this is my suggestion

2821000
int	double
this scores are double even if many users actually sort by int for instance unix times

2821000
int	double
so my idea was to check if a double could be casted into an int without lost of data and then using the function to turn the int into a string if this is true

2821000
int	double
in my reasoning the double casting above converts the double into a long and then back into an int

2821003
button	checkbox
for example there is a checkbox but there isn t even a simple button take a look at this screenshot

2821042
post	put
not sure the post i linked weren t very clue on where to put that code

2821042

when the user changes blurs from the tinymce control we want to ensure that the textarea textbox gets updated properly

with windows i can set that variable but i had no luck setting it in linux tried in suse and ubuntu

2821102

if you re ever going to prepare a screenshot or mockups for a proposal or design document use balsamiq

2821105
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
without making any changes whatsoever my website works perfect in firefox safari google-chrome and opera

2821106
put	get
get a good computer quad-6 core 16gb ram install a windows server there add hyper-v and then put anything but domain controller file server in hyper-v instances

2821125
mockups	balsamiq
i feel that napkee is worth it because it allows users to export their creativity from mockups balsamiq that is and work with them interactively

2821171
capitalize	capitalization
it s probably better to capitalize but capitalization alone wouldn t solve the problem because sometimes occurrence can be the first word in a sentence for example

2821182
google-chrome	firefox
it works on google-chrome and firefox but not in internet explorer

2821206
int	double
if you converted your double to a fixed point value you still get decimal precision and converting to a string is as easy as with int with the addition of a single shift function

2821206
int	double
doing the conversion from double to int is natively supported by many fpu units so that should be lightning fast

2821210
google-chrome	firefox
malformed json the other reason why this might work in firefox and other browsers but not google-chrome is the jquery parse function tries to use the native window.json.parse data function over new function return + data if native json parsing is available in that browser

2821210
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome s parsing may be more strict than firefox is at having things like trailing commas as specified by the standard at as stated in danilo celic s answer

2821238
folder	directory
there is an adf folder created like so inside the ear along with the war file and standard meta-inf directory is this adf directory

error cs1667 attribute obsolete is not valid on properties or event accessor

2821362
haskell	ocaml
a closer approximation might be pattern matching in languages like haskell f# and ocaml but i still can t quite find a way to make it look the way you re hinting

2821365
getter	setter
there are no public properties in a mfmailcomposeviewcontroller besides the delegate and it only seems to have setter methods and no getter

2821374

if you want to do 3d stuff blender free open-source 3ds max pricey maya pricey

2821376

note that a later blog post from the same blogger - - expanded quite on the limitations and how you can get around them somewhat

2821409
inherited	properties
a possible fix to this is that you can add user defined macros to a properties sheet and inherited the properties sheet

2821422
.htaccess	httpd.conf
then i would scrape a list of those aspx urls and do a list of 301 redirects in your .htaccess or httpd.conf

2821463
opera	google-chrome
it works fine on ie6 7 8 google-chrome opera sluggish

2821471
uitabbarcontroller	uiwindow
while it s technically possible to add the uitabbarcontroller s view as a subview of something other than the uiwindow you ll find that it presents more challenges than you might expect

2821471
uitabbarcontroller	uiwindow
for example since uitabbarcontroller assumes that its view s parent is the full screen uiwindow it will offset its frame by 20 pixels to accommodate the status bar

2821471
uitabbarcontroller	uiwindow
so my recommendation to you is to come up with a design in which your uitabbarcontroller s view is a subview of the uiwindow if possible

2821485
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
a class that is inherited with the private keyword will similarly make all publicly accessible members in the superclass private in the subclassing

2821667
mouse	keyboard
it needs to remain running and have access the desktop that the uac dialog windows open on and interact with that desktop using keyboard and mouse events

2821667
pop-up	dialog
imagine you are running a vnc program and a uac window pop-up you want your vnc program to still be able to control the desktop with the uac window in it so that the user can move the mouse and click the ok button on the uac dialog

2823315
dictionary	map
so i have a dictionary with almost 100 000 key values pairs and the majority of the keys map to the same values

2823315
dictionary	map
what i want to do is to reverse the dictionary so that each value in mydict is going to be a key at the reverse_dict and is going to map to a list of all the mydict.keys that used to map to that value at the mydict

2823345
inherited	properties
so i ve reverted back to using the standard viewdata dictionary with a static vewdatakeys class to avoid magic strings for all my generic properties and then using custom poco objects that don t inherited from anything as my presentation models

2823359
nsmatrix	nscell
nsmatrix grouping nscell instances

inherited	properties
the objective is to make every element that has class bananaclass inherited the properties of bananatrans without editing the html or using javascript

2823389

2823607
hide	show
then based on that value you can decide which box to show hide

2823622
implements	extends
it might be an idea to implements some sort of server side caching of your rescaled images if they re likely to be repeatedly hit but i don t think this need extends as far as explicit pre-rendering

2823630
google-chrome	firefox
i have found that it works perfectly in google-chrome but absolutely none of the css is beign applied in firefox or ie

2823657
post	get
wsdl - while you can enable wsdl by turning on metadata publishing wsdl support is intended for soap-based services not pure http get post

client-side	server-side
i d be happy to point out how to best integrate your server-side data with your client-side map highlighting but would need more info

width	margin
margin is outside and isn t part of the width

2823881
primes	modulus
the first number is the primes modulus p

2823922
maven	cargo
for deployment to your local machine and to production use the maven cargo plugin

2823979
width	margin
the css width of an element does not include padding borders or margin

2823980
wxpython	pyqt
i personally prefer pyopengl and you can use wxpython or pyqt to create your rendering context

2824031
int	chars
dynamic languages all have this chars even though many go further than python in type laxity confusing strings and numbers and different kinds of numbers while python distinguishes strings from int from floating-point numbers for example -- python is quite type-picky .

2824051
bash	zsh
i wanted to achieve the same as asked here saving current directory to bash history but within zsh shell

2824071
xlib	xcb
i first encountered z notation when i read that xcb a replacement for the original xlib api in x11 was proven correct with z-notation

2824073
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i tested it in ie8 firefox opera safari google-chrome current versions

2824161
folder	directory
both glob and scandir simply return all the files in the folder and i m afraid that won t be a good idea for a huge directory

2824195
ant	maven
both ides can be used with ant or if you want something different and i have heard more powerful you could check out maven

2824233
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
works well in google-chrome firefox safari opera but not this baby

2824339

2824455
int	chars
i want to accept either all int or all chars

2824510
g++	gcc
the only real change i ve made from the original source is casting the line in question to a char which my compiler gcc g++ specifically if it s a c c++ issue but gcc also wouldn t compile with the uncast statement insisted upon but i assume this is the source of the leak

2824524
realloc	malloc
in this case i would suggest not using malloc realloc and other similar c memory management in a c++ program unless absolutely necessary and unavoidable

2824540
haskell	scheme
in most functional languages like scheme and haskell passing functions around as arguments is along with recursion the meat-and-potatoes of programming rather than something with an occasional use

2824578
jar	war
i know that it s not windows search but i have long used agent ransack for this it is very quick and searches through all the various java archive formats jar war ear as well as zip

2824610
int	chars
this does include things java.util.date which and countless many other types but is probably the best that you can do if you also want to allow int and chars

2824610
int	chars
nonetheless do keep in mind that int chars string are all object so in fact a bunch of those mixed together is a list of one type object

2824654
accessor	properties
in python and other languages supporting a properties -like construct that s not the case -- you can always replace a data member with a properties which calls accessor methods transparently the api does not change nor does client code

2824654
accessor	properties
so in python and other languages with properties -like constructs i believe .net languages are like that at source-code level though not necessarily at bytecode level you may as well leave your data public when it s part of the api and no accessor are currently needed you can always add accessor methods to later implementation releases if need be and not break the api

2824669
jobs	cron
another thing is that i dont want the admins to ban the cron jobs because they are using too much bandwidth and cpu more than what is allocated in my web hosting package

2824688
ant	maven
i wrote my own ant build file from scratch no maven here and i ve got several targets

2824703

2824773
hide	show
and b. hide the show li ul only when another one is hovered not itself

2824807
hide	show
here is the code to solve this issue this will hide show the ul which comes inside the current li

2824872
google-chrome	firefox
firefox plug in and google-chrome plug in

2824952
boost	stl
for example i d like to have one database for the standard c libraries one for system libraries that might be used by either c or c++ programs sockets networking comes to mind one for the standard c++ libs stl boost and then other databases for various third party libraries such as qt or glib

vb6	vba
i accept c# vb6 vba suggestions too

2825051
versioning	upgrade
i especially do not want to be tied into user level controls that are from a third party and regularly changing dll names during upgrade - the major versioning is encoded there and i am not sure i will not replace them at all so i rather go with my own slim objects

2825107
put	get
i have no experience on lower level programming like how to get the entry point and put the entire code of the target procedure into a tmemorystream while scanning for the 5 nop s

2825162
interbase	firebird
delphi supports firebird interbase database out of the box afaik and php libraries exist for it

2825285
free	malloc
at the end of the code buffer would be pointing to null because that s what you tested for to get out the while loop and hence when you call free you re not calling it on the original pointer you malloc d you re calling it on nothing

2825325
folder	dir
from the assets folder copy them at runtime in the application dir

2825377
post	get

int	chars
however when it comes to output i ve got to convert the int back into 4 ascii chars

2825464

post	get
to get the post data i always use

2825484
post	get
when using foreach to iterate over an object i get the following error fatal error objects used as arrays in post pre increment decrement must return values by reference...

2825545
int	chars
chars are 16 bit so you have to encode them into eight bit values to pack them in an int

2825545
int	chars
you can use the encoding class to convert between chars and bytes and the bitconverter class to convert between bytes and int

2825593

2825656
draggable	droppable
right now your code makes #move1 and #move2 draggable but nothing droppable

it has sorting grouping and paging

2825704
exif	xmp
write access to the exif iptc and xmp

2825743
hide	show
i could not add or remove fields so i had to include all fields then hide show each field as needed

2825752
mouse	keyboard
when this happens the most reliable way to return focus is by sending a mouse event to click on a text field directly above the list then send a tab keyboard event to shift the focus onto the list

2825795
nunit	mstest
while technically we don t call this a unit test but an integration test as oded explained you can do this by using a unit testing framework such as mstest part of visual studio 2008 2010 professional or one of the free available unit testing frameworks such as nunit

2825959
int	double
this won t compile with the two template functions you have provided as there is no matching function for call to minimum double int

2826007
16-bit	64bit
edit its also worth noting that if the values in y are 16-bit in size then you can do 2 of these and operations per operation 4 if you have 64bit registers

2826007
put	get
put into 1 32-bit and you get 0xfffc0003

2826071
post	get
if you accept parameters from outside from a get or post parameter be sure to use escapeshellarg on the arguments for security reasons

2826192
mktime	strtotime
you re probably better using mktime instead of strtotime since you can explicitly state which parts are the month and year and then just pass 1 as the day

2826280
hide	show
i want to show and hide some div s when the video reaches a certain point

2826280

2826310
post	get
to get updated data in the view use post redirect get pattern or modelstate.clear

2826331
int	double
you can modify the method if there are spaces between the letters but if you use int float double or as the types this method won t scale at all

2826367
iboutlet	ibaction
you should subclass uiviewcontroller in order to hook up iboutlet and ibaction

2826438
for-loop	loops
if you want to remove something from inside a loops you need to revert to a regular iterator loops not the enhanced for-loop above

2826447
put	get
i have the following code that works when i hard code the variables in the queries but when i take them out and put them as variables i get mysql errors below is the script

search specifying subscript and superscript characters for the subscript and superscript

2827059
filtering	grouping
unfortunately though adding in the distinct-values around the set of people in the grouping to filtering out duplicate names seems to stop xqsharp from finding the join

2827091
post	put
just to put this to bed im going to post what my solution was

2827140
cvs	svn
i don t know if this is possible with viewcvs but i know it s possible with websvn though that would require you to convert from cvs to svn

2827153
uiview	calayer
for example i tried creating subclassing calayer to which i added a separate shadow layer as a sublayer but then that would be drawn on top of whatever was draw in the drawrect method of the uiview that had the main layer as backing layer

2827254
textview	imageview
assign id s to the imageview and textview elements in this layout

2827254
textview	imageview
the fourth argument is an array of strings representing the keys for each piece of data in the map you created earlier and the fifth argument is an array of int id s of the imageview and textview elements in your layout in corresponding order to the string array in the previous argument

2827285
width	height
note you may need to give it a width and height which shouldn t be a problem if they re all thumbnails

2827299
g++	gcc
i have a small program that i can compile with gcc and icc without any difficulties but i would also like the code to work with g++ and icpc

2827305
stringbuilder	stringtokenizer
also if you do not need regular expressions consider using stringtokenizer and stringbuilder

2827319
googletest	gmock
we have already chosen googletest so using gmock would be nice

2827324
put	get
the error that you get seems to be because we are trying to put id s instead of objects we should do this instead

2827324
put	get
after we get the year objects then we put it inside the association

2827336
weka	orange
a lot of open source toolkits implement association rules such as orange and weka

2827344
width	height
width and measured height

2827344
width	height
width and height or sometimes drawing

2827344
width	height
width and drawing height

2827344
width	height
the measured width and height

2827344
width	height
width and height can be obtained by

2827357
put	get
you get undefined references because the declaration and the definition are not matching if you put extern c which prevents name mangling from happening but in this case this is happening only in your header files

2827378
equals	compareto
finally if noone is your case just roll your own compareto method it should return -1 0 or 1 if the the calling object is less equals to or greater than the passed one

2827390
outputstream	inputstream
basically you just need to get the inputstream from the fileitem object and write it to any outputstream to your taste using the usual java io way

2827407
width	height
the value of height and width variables are defined in page_load function

2827439
width	height
make sure the variables width and height in your code behind page are declared with the protected keyword

2827479
put	get
this way the last used get put value will be first in map.values

2827513
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
fiddly stuff and this is one case where i d recommend using malloc free realloc rather than c++ memory management

2827519
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this works on ie7 ie8 opera google-chrome and firefox

2827519

collabnet	svn
i use subversion collabnet and tortise svn

2827565
wordpress	joomla
i want to create a pluggable environment much like that of joomla wordpress as since php generally doesn t have to be compiled first i see this is the reason why all this is possible easy

2827586
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i found a particle simulatior that benchmarks the difference between true html5 canvas handling in google-chrome safari and firefox vs explorercanvas in ie

2827596
super	extends
also pecs principle producer extends consumer super

2827604
ienumerable	iqueryable
the first returns an ienumerable iqueryable object with a single element

2827616
super	extends
super in generics is the opposite of extends

2827616
superclass	subclassing
instead of saying the comparable s generic type has to be a subclassing of t it is saying it has to be a superclass of t

2827616
super	implements
without the super signature sortedlist would not be able accept the type of java.sql.date because it doesn t implements a comparable of itself but rather of a super class of itself

2827620
lua	scheme
the first one is a program in scheme the second one is the same program but in lua

2827623
for-loop	loops
i am setting the attributes from a for-loop which loops through a list of values

2827647
super	implements
it means that the type t must implements comparable of t or one of its super classes

2827647
implements	extends
for example if a extends b if you want to use a must implements or or in fact just comparable

2827670
richfaces	tomahawk
our site runs on jsf tomahawk richfaces on a tomcat server

2827675
getter	setter
you can either call notifypropertychanged for the property name when you set showfullname or you can modify the name property to have a private setter and update it explicitly calling notifypropertychanged as part of the name property setter rather than having the getter evaluate a function

2827794
sorting	filtering
it also has great eclipse integration and a variety of filtering and sorting options to let you achieve your preferred signal-to-noise ratio

2827796
ienumerable	iqueryable
in any case were the second query rewritten to return an ienumerable iqueryable with one customer object instead of a single customer object the two statements would be functionally identical

2827801
prepare	execute
i dont know much about stored procedures and i am wondering how much if any performance increase stored procedures have over parameter binding as in parameter binding we prepare the query only once and just execute it later in the program for diferent set of values of variables

2827809
post	get
i am wanting to pass something like the following to my view from my controller via get not post

2827831
ready	each
add javascript to each individual view that will add the class when the dom is ready

2827842
ssl	https
this is not possible with tomcat.the https connector will accept ssl connection only

2827883
hash	hmac
in ssl hash functions are used mostly for integrity not confidentiality through the hmac construction

2827883
hash	hmac
hmac is a construction which turns a hash function such as sha-1 into a mac

2827883
hash	hmac
the output of hmac when used with a given hash function h has the same size than the output of h

2827995
kde	gnome
for example you could create a shortcut in windows gnome kde that launches the program with --gui_mode or use a mechanism like austin suggested in an nix os

2828034
jquery	scriptaculous
i prefer prototypejs scriptaculous and jquery

2828071
versioning	upgrade
but as soon as a failover occurs and r2 becomes the principal the r2 will upgrade the database to versioning 661 the r2 database versioning

2828071
versioning	upgrade
mirroring between different versioning is often used to upgrade servers with minimal impact on production

2828074
wifstream	wofstream
google code has only one search result for wofstream and two - for wifstream

2828093
min	max
if i change the min to max it returns the highest and only startdate 20100505

2828118
width	height
i ve tryied many ways of hiding the menu display none visibility hidden width 0 height 0 jquery hide jquery fadeout.

2828183
children	parent
we then do a linq to sql query to select all the menu entries that don t have a parent and call getmenuxml to output the xml for a single menu record i.e that record and its children for those entries

2828225
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox and ie but google-chrome seems to ignore the css selector

2828288
rss	feed
a good example would be aggregating rss feed from multiple servers and then displaying them in a webpage

2828314
rss	feed
i have only recently gotten into php and mysql and i want to take an rss feed turn it into an array take only the description part of the xml explode it and insert it into a table on a mysql base

2828407
webclient	httpwebrequest
is there any solution beyond normal c# solutions like webclient download or httpwebrequest httpwebresponse

2828466
hide	show
you might need to hide all but the first image for the first animation then show them and activate cycle-plugin

2828538
rss	feed
as long as the rss feed is valid xml you can use php s xml parser to do this

2828626
ant	maven
the simplest solution will be to just use libraries from the project or a maven ivy repository and ignore the libraries in your global ant folder

2828631
sorting	grouping
using a built in function and sorting it by registration within the grouping

2828694
onchange	onkeyup
you will need to use onkeyup and onchange for this

2828694
onchange	onkeyup
the onchange will prevent context-menu pasting and the onkeyup will fire for every keystroke

2828719
gridview	repeater
not sure if that would work or not that would go walk controls with oftype might be a better choice on the type but that seems like a good starting choice looking at repeater and gridview and then set those to predictable so i d get static for all my normal things outside of repeating controls but not have to deal with static inside things like gridview repeater etc

2828719
required	placeholder
i don t see any way to mark the content placeholder such that it opts out of being included in child id s - setting the id of the placeholder to empty blank doesn t work as it s a required attribute

2828763
ironruby	ironpython
it s also used when embedding dynamic languages such as ironpython ironruby to allow loading types defined in external source files and accessing them more directly in c#

2828776
draggable	droppable
user drags a draggable li to a droppable li

2828784
ethernet	wireless

2828817
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tested this in firefox safari google-chrome etc

2828876
jobs	cron
our jobs utilize a database table that store the cron triggers and other job information and then lock the entry for a job so that none of the other servers can execute it

2828878
typedef	struct
typedef struct _d3dmatrix

2828902
junit	testng
if you are not too particular about using junit then you can use testng framework

2828911
maven	pom.xml
the following pom.xml just works for me with maven 2.2.1

2828914
opera	firefox
tested with firefox 3.6 and opera 10.10

2828925
mouse	keyboard
when the application is opened it will disable the keyboard and mouse so if you hit any keys it does nothing and you can not move the mouse

2828941
junit	testng
if you don t want to set up static initializers for one time initialization and are not particular about using junit take a look at testng

2828941
junit	testng
for the testng equivalent of junit 4 s before and after you can use beforemethod and aftermethod respectively

2829024
next	except
there is also the opposite behavior the entire exercise is on one page except the hrule in endexerciseenv which is flushed to the next page

2829058
cassini	iis
are you using cassini the built in visual studio debugger or attaching to an iis process

2829141
int	double
following a number with this symbol means that it will treat the number as a double instead of trying to guess what exact variable type to use it would likely have treated the 0 as a int without this

2829166
getter	setter
it does create more code and could introduce more complexity in the dto than if you had for example contructor arguments and or setter getter

2829180
hide	show
tip try to hide or show with jquery in ready handler for example so that jquery remembers their initial display settings

2829219
jstl	taglib
it s a view technology providing a textbased template to put html css js code in and facilities to interact with backend java code with help of taglib jstl and so on and el expression language the things

2829281
youtube	vimeo
i would also appreciate you review my regular expressions for youtube redtube and vimeo

2829283
cpu	affinity
as an experiment you might try setting the cpu affinity on each thread such that each is bound to an individual cpu

2829330
portrait	landscape
initially the popover is displayed in portrait and upon rotation to landscape it disappears as expected

2829330
portrait	landscape
when rotated back to portrait and the popover is caused to be presented again the tableview is shown in landscape mode inside the popover

2829337
int	double
use int long float or double or the non-namespace-qualified symbols of corresponding names as the first argument to take advantage of unboxed primitive arithmetic appropriate for your argument types

2829342
rsa	aes
i m then encrypting this random aes key with a rsa public key

2829360

internationalization	localization
in a tutorial on setting up internationalization and localization kohana 2.4 i18n internationalization and localization library the author says

2829432
range	minimum
note i am splitting a range of numbers range is expressed in a string and then creating the integer values that represent the range s minimum and maximum

2829445
rsa	aes
rsa is used for authentication and key exchange of a symmetric session key eg aes which is then used for the body of the communication

2829487
jpgraph	fusioncharts	client-side	server-side
personally i use the server-side jpgraph for most of my charting work and fusioncharts commercial for flash-based client-side charting although i m looking at openflashcharts at the moment

2829491
onchange	onblur
i thought that i would use the onchange event but this seems to be interpreted as the onblur event on ie

2829498
jqplot	flot
i ve also used jqplot but i find flot more performant with large datasets

2829535
post	get
you can use wpdb- query to run just about any sql statement on the database so you can definitely get a list of all post by multiple authors it just takes more work

2829597
firefox	safari
i m better about getting things to look good in ie8 firefox and safari but ie7 still throws curve balls at me.

2829604
width	height
when handling the onresize event i ve made sure that the width and height of the containing are updated to the correct size and then tried calling both setupgrid and draw on the plot object but with no effect

2829628
client-side	server-side
as a personal project i m making an ajax chatroom application using xml as a server-side storage and json for client-side processing

2829631
firefox	safari
i tried out the code and sure enough firefox won t run the applet called by javascript without a doprivileged call but safari will at least on mac osx

2829640
firefox	safari
here s something that you can use and just replace safari with firefox

2829666
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
an effective way is to use a combination of onkeydown and onpaste which will work in ie firefox google-chrome and safari

2829666
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i have read that domattrmodified is supported by opera and safari not sure about firefox so you could use that in combination with ie s onpropertychange untested

2829682
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
further a quick test around the latest versions of firefox opera google-chrome and safari plus ie9 platform preview shows that they all do what html5 specifies

2829708
post	get
you certainly can t do stuff like the above in one line but it s a fully-fledged http library that wraps up get post requests and the rest

2829746
public	protected
i m going for something else - the issue of public protected private may not be solved specifically by this but i think it lends itself much better to maintenance then a lot of nested internal classes

2829874
folder	directory
for instance i suppose i have a directory that contains the following folder

2829900
google-chrome	firefox
it says invalid argument it works fine in firefox and google-chrome

2829965
union	distinct
suggested does not double count as union implies a distinct if a row exists in one half of the union ignore it in the other

2829984
queue	fifo
if your problem provides a reason to choose one node over another you might consider using a priority queue instead of a stack for depth-first or a fifo for breadth-first

2830028
spaces	delimiter
note i like spaces as a record delimiter but i d have no issue changing it for one easier to use

2830119
portrait	landscape
but i m hearing sometimes that you write the form for different form factors different screen size different orientation portrait landscape ..

2830166
hide	show
in your example setter would appear in the little-white-down-arrow s menu with a checkmark allowing you to quickly show hide all methods tagged with an category setter annotation in their javadoc comment block

2830217
width	height
window.open mywindow width 400 height 200

2830225
spaces	delimiter
this would mean that your delimiter is comma rather than spaces but it would handle all the escaping and unescaping for you

2830235
int	double
to avoid the inexactness of floating point values you can use a double int calculation which is more accurate at least on x86 x64 platforms

2830252
hide	show
hide the lowest-level items that have already been show on the first page then make subsequent items visible until they no longer fit on the page

2830252

tested under the last versions of firefox and google-chrome under fedora and firefox opera ie and google-chrome under xp

2830407
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
create uitabbarcontroller general alloc-init stuff and push it to uinavigationcontroller

2830419
versioning	upgrade
a 64-bit os doesn t have this problem as it has much more virtual space you don t even have to upgrade to a 64-bit versioning of java to take advantage of this

2830492
button	checkbox
you also needs to create some system which makes it possible for button checkbox etc to tell the rest of your code that they were clicked

2830517
children	parent
in this situation i might need to execute some operation on the parent view and all its children

2830547
richfaces	icefaces
richfaces icefaces jmaki

2830547
glassfish	weblogic
oracle has two at the moment - glassfish and weblogic

2830561
outputstream	inputstream
another idea i ve been playing with is reading chunks of data from the inputstream and writing them to the outputstream of the datahandler

2830615
cpu	processors
similarly if you assume that the interfering job only uses 25 of one processors s time you might see one of your threads and the interferer on the same cpu

2830650
google-chrome	firefox
the following code works fine in google-chrome and firefox but not ie

2830695
set	bag
in this case sample from an ordered nsset remove nsnumber objects as you pull them out of the bag and decrement myentitycount for the purposes of picking a random nsnumber object from the set

2830714
touchesbegan	touchesended
in the scrollviewcontroller implementation i have customized all of the standard methods that should do this touchesshouldbegin... touchesbegan ... touchesended ... and so on

2830714
uiview	subviews
as an alternative i ve tried putting a uiview as the top subviews and then tried passing the touches to the now underlying scrollview

2830741
children	parent
the child entity is added to the children collection on the parent entity and linqtosql or linqtoenityframework should handle the foreign key for you

2830750
move	drag
i m using html function to move data between the dialog and the page but it would be cool to have the drag and drop effect

2830762
hide	show
this will hide or show the text-field

2830766
draggable	droppable
make the content of the jquery ui dialog draggable and the place where you want to drop it droppable

2830822
jquery	scriptaculous
scriptaculous or jquery etc

2830829
put	get
i m not exactly sure what you re trying to do but i am sure that whatever it is can be achieved by adding a class to whatever you re trying to get to stay put and not modifying its css or hiding it

2830837
jar	war
i am trying to remove a file from a dependency jar that i am including in my war file in maven

2830837
jar	war
i am deploying the war to jboss 5.1 and the jar in question contains a persistence.xml file that i don t want

2830899
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt
due to the design of pbkdf2 it would be very difficult to guess a hash generated with one salt even if you knew the hash that was generated by the same passphrase for a different salt

2830923
width	height
you can get height width pretty easily using

2830958
hide	show
then use the onclick event of the control which will determine whether other controls are made visible to show hide controls as you wish

2830972
mouseout	mouseleave
you don t have to check where the mouse is as the mouseout event will be triggered when the mouseleave the element

2830981
put	get
the best you re going to get is the showbreak option which will put a fixed string in front of each wrapped line i use

2830986
x86	64bit
if you are running a 64bit version of windows the directories will start with c program files x86

2830997

ubuntu	linux
i have ported a piece of c++ code that works out of core from linux ubuntu to windows vista and i realized that it works about 50times slower on vs2008

2831044
vtune	shark
if you re writing for a modern desktop os or oses enlist the help of a profiling tool valgrind shark codeanalyst vtune etc -- it may give you details you never even knew you could look for such as cache misses branch mispredicts etc

2831055
next	document.write
this is to be consistent cross-browser it needs to make sure that document.write sticks the tag it s generating in before the next script block runs so the result looks like this

2831079
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i m using the datatables jquery plugin and am having issues with the first and previous pagination links displaying correctly in ie and safari firefox and opera work

2831098
multiplying	add
you need to add high a second time because otherwise you d need to multiplying by the value ulong.maxvalue + 1 and that s a lot of annoying casting and parentheses.

2831099
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu uses the debian package format .deb

2831121
mouse	keyboard
the least bad solution i ve found so far is to run the tests in a vmware session and control the mouse keyboard trough the vmware sdk

2831226
google-chrome	firefox
i have not found any such command line argument for firefox nor google-chrome

2831237
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox you can use the view-source uri scheme by prefixing your urls with view-source as in the following example

2831249
for-loop	loops
they basically just turned a for-loop into a while loops

2831250
for-loop	loops
with the exception that it leaves i available for user after loops completes it s not scoped to just the for-loop

2831296
superclass	subclassing
so think from the client code perspective you are exposing superclass details just to get the subclassing instance

2831298
error-handling	exception-handling
3 note that throwing an exception-handling does still require error-handling as would the other proposed solutions

2831360
queue	fifo
a queue is a fifo fifo

2831387
boost	stl
so with the stl and a little help from boost bind

2831408
goto	break
so it would act as infinite loop requiring a jump statement to leave break goto throw or return

2831457
put	get
if the speed of loading them into an nsdictionary from file is a concern and check the profiler to be sure you can always put them into an instance variable which you can release when you get a memory warning

2831458
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
just to add another couple of dimensions to the problem remember that filenames are utf-16 and you may encounter non ntfs or fat filesystems that may be case sensitive

2831462
lan	intranet
there are plenty of statistics analytics providers for internet deployed software google analytics but i m looking for an analytics tool to integrate into a lan intranet based web application

2831479
put	get	post	put	post	get
you simply derive from the restresource class and handle whichever restful verbs you desire get put post delete with a method of the same name prefixed with handle_

2831521
superclass	subclassing
they allow a subclassing constructor to explicitly specify the newly created object s immediately enclosing instance with respect to the direct superclass â 8.1.3

2831524
post	get
looking at the database structure i can t see an easy straight-forward query to simply get the latest revision of the latest post

2831524
post	get
i can t figure out how to reliably filter different revisions of the same post drafts attachments and pages out of this mess and just get the latest revision of the latest post

2831542
sudo	passwd
for example if i was asking for a passwd i would want the input to be hidden as if i were running the sudo bash command

2831542
sudo	passwd
now when you use the sudo command it asks for the passwd and you can t see the text you type

2831567
inherited	subclassing
because outerinnerchild extends outer.inner it inherited wealth just like normal subclassing semantics

2831589
move	drag
i figured out a possible simple method of moving a control in a drag move style.

2831589
onmousedown	mouseup
use the onmousedown event to set a boolean in my case ismoving to true and the mouseup event to set it to false

2831656
datarow	dataview
i can get this to work with a dataview as the data source for the control but i want to use a list collection of datarow objects which is not not working for me

2831672
dictionary	map
i have a list of values and i want to put them in a dictionary that would map each value to it s index

dictionary	map
for lists containing 1000 elements the dictionary zip version is the fastest the generator and the list comprehension versions are virtually identical and they are 1.5 times slower and the functional map reversed is considerably slower

2831672
dictionary	map
python -mtimeit -s t range int 1e3 d dictionary map reversed enumerate t

2831674
serializable	deserialization
it also includes classes that can be utilized directly for amf serializable and deserialization

2831674
serializable	deserialization
we use it extensively in our application as an http amf server for random amf serializable deserialization rtmp server and in the past we implemented a plain amf over tcp socket server using fluorine which is no longer necessary this was pre-rtmp support

2831676
google-chrome	firefox
i have noticed in firefox and google-chrome haven t checked others that i can view the gif once and then if i reload the page the cached gif is not animated at all

gif	png
i know when the browser can t display the content inline it will force a download anyway but these are png and gif images which display in the browser fine otherwise

2831766
google-chrome	firefox
if i comment out the entire image case it firefox and google-chrome both display the ascii but not the image

2831766
google-chrome	firefox
i thought setting the content type would allow firefox and google-chrome to show the actual image and also allow the location to be used as an src

2831794
postgresql	mysql
not sure about mysql but in postgresql you could do something like for a table named posts with at least the columns id and php_timestamp

2831824
firefox	safari
i m using an html manifest to cache the page and its behavior works fine in mobile safari and firefox in offline mode.

put	get
and remember that to get the best qualification always send the bank the customer s street address and zip and put values in the order number description and po fields

2831978
switching	screens
what surprises me is that when i switching display mode to 16 bit 1920x1200x16 either through my graphics settings beforehand or by using changedisplaysettings i get a massively improved screens grab time between 1ms and 2ms which cannot be explained by the factor of two reduction in bit-depth

2832011
oodbms	db4o
imo the one you mention db4o is easily head and shoulders the best oodbms out there

2832041
for-loop	loops
you should use a while loops instead of a for-loop to do this

2832056

only double-quotes count not single-quotes

2832375
onmouseover	onmouseup	onmouseover	onmousedown	onmousedown	onmouseup
i haven t got time to look at it in detail or test it but at first glance you should be able to change the onmouseover onmouseout events to onmousedown and onmouseup events and it looks like it ll all still work

2832410
onmouseover	onclick
a little hacky but the absolutely easiest way to do this is to just bind the onmouseover event handler directly to onclick and the clear onmouseover so that the handler is only fired by the onclick

2832415
min	max
or in your case simply don t draw ticks at the min max position

2832415

the landscape is detected but the screenrect show width 768 and height 1024 i m in an ipad device

2832500
mktime	strtotime
if strtotime can t handle your date time format correctly 4 00pm will probably work but not at 4pm you ll need to use string-functions substr to parse correct your format and retrieve your timestamp through another function mktime

2832502
profiling	debugging

i wonder in which type of variable should i put the array of bytes i get and how can i convert from one to another

2833206
config	ini
i don t know if the syntax in this zend config ini file is correct in particular for routes chaining

the jersey project is the reference implementation of jax-rs and among other neat features comes with a very easy to use serializable deserialization approach

2834058
preferenceactivity	preferencescreen
to me preferencescreen preferenceactivity seems perfect for the task but the intention behind these classes seem to be configuring an actual application

2834085
dictionary	map
i know that we can map normal classes as components but couldn t figure out how to map dictionary as dynamic-components using fluent automapping

2834128
width	height
now lets say the width and height of the rectangle is set to 100

2834128
width	height
is there any way i can see what will be the size of the string both length and height if it has to be shown in 100px width rectangle

2834128
width	height
i mean the height can be increased but not width so that i can use the correct height of the string to make it appear in full in that rectangle

2834165
hash	md5
my solution is usually a hash md5 sha1 ... of the image contents

2834196

would get the value with the name username that you passed via post

2834200
post	get
post redirect get pattern

i work with flashdevelop and the flex_sdk_4.0.0.14159 the big adobe one with air 140mo

2834473
many-to-many	one-to-many
the only way to represent physically a logical many-to-many relation between a and b is thus to introduce a third junction table ab with two one-to-many relationships a - ab - b where the primary key of ab is formed from the two foreign keys values that are primary keys in a and b

2834477
google-chrome	firefox
firefox extensions run javascript with high privilege google-chrome and have full access to the browser

2834494
rtos	ecos	rtos	qnx	freertos	ecos	qnx	ecos	vxworks	ecos	vxworks	qnx	vxworks	freertos	vxworks	rtos
also you d learn a lot more about embedded systems by not initially targeting linux but using an rtos or real-time kernel such as freertos qnx vxworks ecos uc os-ii or iii for example or just programming bare metal without an os or executive at all

2834519
settings.bundle	info.plist
now every time i change the bundle version in my info.plist i also have to change the version in the root.strings in the settings.bundle

2834586
client-side	server-side
you re adding http header from the server-side and then trying to post form from the client-side

2834593

you could get fancy with the value you put into context_info like the table name or spid etc

2834598
width	height
i have experienced problems controlling height and width of elements or inline text elements in general where the content may give you unwanted trouble even when content is empty

2834627
innodb	myisam
by default mysql created myisam engine tables which does not support transactions or foreign keys you need to explicitly force transactional innodb engine while creating a table

2834633
put	get
of course if you make get queries to the server and rely on uritemplating you ll still have to either put up with or leave away the help page

2834655
pthreads	usleep
most of the pthreads primitives introduce a barrier as do several system calls such as usleep

2834679
inherited	properties
we also iterate inherited properties not what we wanted

2834686

my initial thought was to simply md5 hash the executable store the hash file in source control and be done with it but i ve come up against a problem which i can t even parse

2834705
urllib	httplib
libraries urllib urllib2 or httplib

2834712

with standard jpa the traditional approach would be to add another getter setter pair which adapt the problematic property and perform conversion when accessed

2834795
ienumerable	ienumerator
it basically allows you to quickly return ienumerable and ienumerator objects without explicitly coding them

2834825
ilist	icollection
removed redundant interfaces as ilist inherits icollection and icollection inherits ienumerable.

2834922
unsigned	short	int	chars
however it makes sense only if it will be used to round to integral datatypes like chars short int long long long int and it s unsigned counterparts

2834930
hash	salt
good oss try to hide the actual passwords as best they can and in addition they salt the passwords by inserting a few random characters into the password hash and of course saving the salt

2834930
post	get
if you broke into my facebook account you d be able to post things as allegedly coming from me and other than that you d get no information that isn t already easily accessible

for example if a parseconfiguration method is called by the superclass then it may be that the actual parseconfiguration method used is one in a subclassing of directoryacquirer

2834995
for-loop	loops
changing len inside loops will not help since range for i variable is determined before the for-loop started and cannot be changed on run time

2835008
strcpy	strncpy
you must use strcpy or strncpy to do that

2835033
ready	each
i am trying to get ready for more developers to come in and work so i need each person to be able to setup his own machine for development which means potentially copying this database

2835046
sorting	filtering
sorting and filtering

2835052
mouseevent	mouselistener
use the mouselistener s mousepressed mouseevent callback to determine whether a given shape has been clicked on

2835071
children	parent
caveat this is not really the same thing as group by the group operator of the relational algebra produces tables that contains columns whose value is itself a table - a table holding all the direct children of some parent and it is quite likely that your particular dbms doesn t support it in which case you re left pretty much abandoned by your dbms and with no other option than to code all the freaking shit by this i mean the recursion in particular yourself

2835092
int	chars
the order as shown must be chars int chars

2835116
post	get
i m using the prg pattern pragmatically i m using the same dto for my post get actions

2835180
pop-up	dialog
but it looks like what you re trying to do is get the file picker dialog to pop-up

2835185
portrait	landscape
i want to support landscape and portrait orientations but i m having a problem with resizing when the orientation changes

2835188
devise	cancan
so my real problem was with devise or actually my devise configuration and not with cancan at all

jstl	taglib
first jsp is just a view technology which provides a template to write html css js in and offers facilities to interact with backend java code using taglib like jstl and expression language those things

2835344
width	height
the way i do this is to give it a minheight and minwidth but no height or width properties

2835348
boost	stl
out of that comes relatively simple and small libraries compare the size of say stl or boost to foundation

2835354
post	get
you should really add some sort of data cleansing you should never take raw post get data and insert it directly into a query

2835387
put	get
if you put v vs.90 you will get the 3.5 because its using visual studio 9 look at the link below

2835426
sorting	grouping
now let s override sorting on grouping project managers let s make project manager 2 come before 1 and project manager 1 come after project manager 2

2835439
post	get
here s a bit of code that will probably get you the post titles by author

2835442
boost	stl
the c++ stl has a nice complex-class and boost also has to offer some nice options

2835476
exponent	twos-complement
if you used a twos-complement representation for the exponent a small positive number with a negative exponent would look like a very large integer because the second msb would be set

2835520
for-loop	arrays
second you re trying to use menu as a one-based arrays in the for-loop

2835544
stretchblt	bitblt
you seem to be roughly on the right track if you use stretchblt in place of the bitblt you re using now

2835587
x86	64bit
note i am using 64bit os hence the x86

2835622
post	get
hey guys i have a system where there is one form for each friend you have and i used to have an ajax post function for each form but i want to save code and was wondering if it was possible to get multiple forms to work with just one post function

2835694
webchromeclient	webviewclient
at first glance there are too many differences webviewclient webchromeclient

2835695
post	get
guirgis it is lame to post an interview question guess you didn t get the job -

2835711
post	get
you should probably use an http client library to do your post and get the response

2835711
post	get
they have some examples so it shouldn t be too hard for you to use that to do your post get the result and then use documentbuilder to build up a dom and get what you want out of it

2835751
hash	md5
i have this example where i want to name a file based on it s md5 hash

2835761
integer	unsigned
you can use the suffix ull which is the standard c99 and c++0x way to specify an unsigned long long integer literal and a long long is at least 64 bits

2835775
tortoisegit	svn
at work we use svn on windows but want to migrate to git as soon as the tools have fully matured not just tortoisegit but also something akin the really nice visual studio integration provided by visualsvn

2835779
post	get
this will get the page to refresh the post values in your request.form object

2835781
fdf	xdp
2. adding a submit button to the pdf itself using livecycle with some sort of js click event to save the fdf xfdf xdp xml data either to the database or to a flat file on the server

2835875
operands	scalar
the simplest way would be just to create an operands struct that contains a double for the scalar and a vector object for the vector

2835875
operands	scalar
you can set isvector_ to true if it is a vector operands and false if it is a scalar operands

2835875
operands	scalar
other options include inheritance creating scalar and vector types derived from an operands base type or something like boost variant but for something simple like this a composition struct like the operands shown above is probably the easiest way to do it

2835911
portrait	landscape
i got the landscape mode working but on the textview is still being put to the top of the iphone to compensate for the keyboard in portrait mode

2835911
hide	show
below is the code for this methods i will just let see the code for show since the hide code will be the reverse

2835926
x86	mips
arguments i still think it s more fun writing x86 assembly than mips for example - the latter is just plain tedious

2836017
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
self navigationcontroller pushviewcontroller vartesting animated yes

2836025
folder	directory
i notice that our bin folder for 1.0.3 has a wrapper.exe in it that calls a wrapper.conf file in our 1.0.3 conf directory

2836073
intersect	contains
that way your rectangles can implement a contains lines can do intersect or graphics paths you can account for some hit padding etc

2836140
equals	gethashcode
thanks to the code here to get me through the equals and gethashcode errors

2836154
prerequisites	uninstaller
i have thought about creating an prerequisites command line to detect the old version and uninstaller but i would like to avoid having to write something like that where it only gets run once

2836185
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in my experience extjs ria layouts work beautifully on firefox google-chrome and opera but not nearly as well on ie8

2836185
actionscript	mxml
with fb you can write mxml and or actionscript classes

2836222
vim	emacs
i ve tried using vim and emacs but since i don t manage the server frequently enough i never quite get the hang of it and end up forgetting the commands

2836305
memcached	ncache
say instead of ncache memcached etc

2836316
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
each of the columns used in a group by query needs to be specifically called out ie don t do as you need to use them in some sort of aggregate-functions min max sum avg count etc or be part of the group by clause

2836339
put	get
in code above i need to get the type of items on t variable to put into of my generic list

2836362
mouse	keyboard
when a form is displayed modally no input keyboard or mouse click can occur except to objects on the modal form

2836373
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
but it makes sense if they are not inherited a subclassing might require other attributes or contradict attributes from a superclass

2836373
inherited	properties
if you need inherited and don t want to look at super classes it might make more sense to use a class function or class properties or even a tag interface declares no methods instead

2836441
goto	break
the problem is solved when you remove continue break or goto

2836474
pop-up	dialog
i m wondering how i could make this into a pop-up dialog

2836486
mdpi	hdpi
density ldpi mdpi hdpi

2836511
implements	extends	pop-up	dialog
you could extends dialog then use gridbaglayout to implements gui like that actually jframe also works you just need to specify some setting like default close operations and stuff if you use dialog set setmodel to true to block other gui just like a pop-up window

this works on firefox google-chrome safari and ie8

2836785
typedef	struct
if you want to use x as a name by itself without the struct preceding it you have to use a typedef

2836785
typedef	struct
in c++ however the first without the typedef has roughly the same effect as the second both define x so you can use it by itself without struct preceding it

2836787
post	get
you would take the html and add it as a parameter to your ajax call remember to use post as the request method so you don t get size limitation problems.

2836788
lxml	beautifulsoup
if after then it doesn t matter any more that some of the html was done via javascript -- you can just use popular parsers like lxml or beautifulsoup to handle the html you have

in this instance you really wouldn t need to use an open tail -f system call because the nature of the js setinterval method the python script will be called over and over again until the js clearinterval method is called

2837002
post	get
you should disable register globals so that the session post get request cookie variables do not interfere

2837031
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
use uiviewcontroller and when you need additional navigation push a uinavigationcontroller on the stack it ll solve your problem for any use case

width	height
i also tried setting the width of the button in code but i can t seem to determine the new height button.getheight returns 0

2837105
inherited	subclassing
this i can t answer but i did trace it to the fact that no examplegroups get registered which in turn is due the fact that the inherited callback in examplegroupmethods does not get called when rspec dynamically creates a new subclassing of activesupport testcase this happens in examplegroupmethods#subclass

2837162
jar	war
krusader file manager from kde - it allows to investigate jar ear or war file but unfortunatelly doesn t work well with nested jars files

post	get
we have several form action methods that have separate get and post methods decorated with acceptverbs httpverbs.get or httpverbs.post respectively

2837601

whilst experimenting floats only really work well when they have a width set so i d use a parent div with a min and max width set and add width 50 to the child divs

2837624
filesystems	fat
if you need to work between the two os s create a small fat partition that way you can see your work from both os as windows can t see ext3 or ext4 filesystems that linux uses

2837669

i think the best way to do it is to get the getter or setter method convert it to a delegate and work with the delegate there is no faster way

2837918
puts	gets
i have another process running on a server which gets wavs from this bucket converts to mp3 using lame and puts them into another bucket

qcombobox	qstackedwidget
on digging further it turns out that two of the parent controls qparentwindow and qstackedwidget have style sheets that qcombobox is inheriting

2838147
directwrite	direct2d
the windowsâ api code pack for microsoftâ .net framework has managed libraries that allow access to direct2d and directwrite

2838147
directwrite	direct2d
now i m not sure if i understand correctly but are you just looking at some way of using direct2d and directwrite from c# or does it have to be com or p invoke

.htaccess	httpd.conf
in your httpd.conf file you must enable .htaccess overriding with allowoverride for the directory where the .htaccess is or parent thereof

2838388
textview	imageview
instead of an imageadapter returning imageview from getview you would need a tyleradapter returning a linearlayout or relativelayout for each cell with the layout containing your imageview and textview caption

2838388
listview	gridview
here is a free excerpt from one of books that illustrates stuff like this albeit in the context of a listview instead of a gridview

2838403
restructuredtext	asciidoc
docbook and restructuredtext are definitely the two largest competitors but asciidoc is another similar markup language that is readable regardless of the markup

2838403
restructuredtext	asciidoc
i m more familiar with and therefore a larger proponent of restructuredtext personally but asciidoc is just another option out there

2838450
portrait	landscape
the problem is when i set animation to no the whole view shifts 20px to the right it is always in landscape mode as if there is a status bar but in portrait mode

2838453
inherited	properties
i suspect the problem is that self.view is of type uiview since it s inherited from uiviewcontroller not pdfview so the compiler doesn t recognize that there s a url properties on it

2838572
abstract-class	superclass
change the chain of superclass that your abstract-class extends or make an incompatible change in those classes or

2838573
vbscript	jscript
if you want create a com which can be accessible from vbscript jscript or from old classic asp you have to implement idispatch

2838573
vb6	vba
if you use your com in vb6 or vba with createobject progidname that you will be use late bound

2838573
vb6	vba
it is very important to understand that to make com accessible from vb6 vba ect

2838573
vb6	vba
for understanding the type library play a role of client marshaling dll so it helps a client software like vb6 vba to send correctly data as a parameters to your com

2838586
nsbutton	nsmatrix
you may find an nsmatrix of nsbuttoncells easier to work with and unlike a c array of nsbutton you can create one in ib

2838594
width	height
note that holding explicit width and height keys may not necessarily be much help performance-wise as clojure vectors keep a count of their members as do many other clojure collections

2838611
easyhook	detours
easyhook picks up where detours left off

2838621
easyhook	detours
here is a c# example of hooking idirect3ddevice9 objects via dll injection and function hooking using easyhook like detours

fancybox	colorbox
look at the demos for fancybox and colorbox

2838830
thin	unicorn	passenger	unicorn	passenger	thin

getter setter or by direct field

2838845
getter	setter
there is nothing incorrect about standardizing your properties in getter setter

2838854
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
so that means i have a single uinavigationcontroller that manages a uiviewcontroller

2838870
jruby	rubinius
i can see needing to keep the old ruby around for legacy code that isn t worth updating or having a preference for an alternative ruby jruby rubinius etc. -- but it truly baffles me why so many people are still starting new projects in the slower obsolete ruby 1.8.x line

2838876
versioning	upgrade
install a stable versioning or upgrade

2838877
children	parent
suppose i want to search an infinite binary tree of strings where all the left children are the parent string plus a and the right children are the parent plus bb

i ve created a new aspx page and dropped a linqdatasource and a formview control onto it

2838908
hide	show
i am successfully using the following code to hide and show elements based on if a user is logged in or not but can t seem to find out how to only show these links to the actual user who created them...not any user that is logged in

2838914
width	height
the element has to be inside a container element whose dimensions effective width and height should be same as the element container a simple javascript can do that trick and it should have position relative .make this container position itself as it s child would have been.that s it

2838920
x86	64bit
i d like to have a 32 bit wix installer that will work on both platforms but i d like it to install to program files rather than program files x86 on 64bit operating systems

2838954
width	height
but if you just mean height and width then you can also add these elements to the dynamically generate style

2838963
disk	ram
hitting the filesystem may only hit ram cache but it has the potential to hit the disk

2838963
disk	ram
any time you hit the disk you re looking at at least an order of magnitude of slowness compared to straight ram access

2838972
post	get
rather than post my code and play where s wally or waldo depending on where you re from i thought it would be more useful to get some good strategies that can be applied in this and similar situations

2838991
post	get	submit	submission
when submission a form you can only submit it as get or post request

2838999
accessor	properties
in these cases especially when building tests a dynamic type can be used which would then allow properties accessor to be called and logged accordingly by the proxy object in a dynamic fashion without having to hardcode properties within a test-only class

2839001
width	height
i m trying to create a resized image from a bitmap set a new height width and a new resolution and save it to png

2839001

both work okay schmokay but a does not allow me to set a new width height on creation but it does allow me to preserve values with and b does not allow me to preseve values

2839001
width	height
basically i m looking for a way to contruct a new bitmap with both something like and set the width height at the same time width height are read-only properties once it s created

2839001
width	height
i know the new pixel width height needed based on the resolution values i ll pass in with .setresolution xdpi ydpi to preserve physical dimensions so that s not the problem

i learned how to use the comparable but i m having difficulty with the comparator

2839150
comparator	comparable
when to use comparable vs comparator

2839452
hash	md5
you are not misunderstanding md5 hashing md5 will always produce the same hash given the same input

2839480
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
if you don t like to have a tab bar in your application and wish to switch between different uinavigationcontroller instances or any uiviewcontroller for that matter you can do something like this

2839480
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i didn t take into consideration that you should correctly handle the methods viewwillappear viewdidappear and so on

2839504
restrict	shared
how can i restrict the exported functions of a shared library to those i want a .def file equivalent

2839514
getter	setter
property decorates a function and replaces it with an object that has getter setter and deleter functions which are also decorators

2839525
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i m trying to render a font using the css property font-face in firefox google-chrome and opera it works fine but within internet explorer is just does not want to display correctly and reverts back to another standard font

2839553

i have seen a few examples of how to create rss feed using asp.net mvc either by creating an action or through an httphandler

2839554
restrict	shared
how can i restrict the exported functions of a shared library to those i want a .def file equivalent

2839555
free	malloc
the closest equivalent are the malloc and free functions if you ignore the constructors destructors and type safety

2839572
free	malloc
not directly an exact replica but compatible equivalents are malloc and free

2839579
dlsym	dlopen
so instead of making up some dodgy schemes you can just pass the names of the library and function from server to client and client will get function address using dlopen + dlsym

2839590
free	malloc
use malloc free functions

2839672
width	height
note that all the columns in a row will have same height and all rows in a column will have same width

i want to show news on my main page using rss feed

2839754
wan	lan
i m across winforms currently but want to write an app that users will have a lan wan between them and database

2839766
jboss	glassfish
i wouldn t recommend using jboss glassfish etc for your scenario - the overhead far outweighs the only benefit - no additional setup involved

2839806
free	malloc
as all the other answers say the most common way to allocate and release dynamic memory is calling malloc and free

2839806
free	malloc
the point is the api doesn t require the client to use malloc and free

2839854
google-chrome	firefox
i m perhaps a bit optimistic in hoping google-chrome or an extension or firefox has a console command letting me alter the if-modified-since header then send the request

2839904
google-chrome	firefox
the comment inside the conditional comment was fine for firefox and ie but it made google-chrome execute the code inside the conditional comment

2839905
textview	imageview
that listview contains imageview and two textview aka first and last names

2839938
try-catch	exception-handling

2839946
rss	feed
good and full implementation of rss feed in asp.net mvc

2840022

however in most cases it is better to pay the price of duplication in ram or disk image than the price of dependency on extra modules

2840023
width	height
use width and height attributes to set them in css

2840032
formpanel	gridpanel
i have extjs viewport panel that contain center panel that contain tablpanel in which i have added gridpanel in one tab on this i have put add person button in tbar of that will add a new tab of a formpanel in its reset button i am not able to access form to reset it

basically everything you have to do is to change doctrine s propel s driver name so in config databaes.yml set postgresql instead of mysql and you re done

2840098
post	get
they call it post redirect get pattern

2840104
ant	maven
so if you want to do this in one build the easiest way would be indeed to use the maven antrun plugin and to implement the loop and the processing logic with ant tasks

2840105
post	put
no matter what i put in the body text area and post it i keep getting required back

2840108
pull	push
you could maybe find an s3 bridge to run in fuse or an s3- dav bridge that you could possibly mount as a filesystem and then tell hg to push and pull data from that virtual filesystem but otherwise you would need a dedicated ec2 instance to actually serve the data you could launch it on demand but the latency on that is pretty bad as you probably well know

2840109
post	get
to prevent users from resubmitting forms by using the back button or refreshing the page you need to follow a design pattern called post redirect get

2840131
disk	ram
a this point in my program i am reading a feature from disk processing it and writing it back because well i don t have enough ram to open all 50 million features at once

2840153
outputstream	inputstream
just write the obtained inputstream to an outputstream of any flavor fileoutputstream the usual java io way

2840166
mockups	prototyping
if one of the overall goals of prototyping is to investigate and explore different technology choices these can be done in isolation of ui mockups and in a more abstract fashion pure technology investigation rather than geared at delivering the exact needs of a prototype which can be changing massively

2840207
button	checkbox
then u user can change his selection and push the save button id btnsaveuserintersts and i am trying to save in the hidden textbox all the values of the checkbox that was choosen

int	boolean
maybe this piece of code works fine and returns true but you treat that value as int boolean true can be displayed as 1

2840436
post	get
also if you go the mvc way make sure you have enough time to learn it since you are going to go a little bit more low level gonna have to learn more of the little details like the actual difference between post get and all that stuff that is pretty much completely hidden in webforms

2840442
profiler	visualvm
the memory profiler of visualvm might also help if you need to go at a lower level

2840468
persistent	transient
for transient updates about what your task is doing in the middle of x x done starting y etc you could think of a specialized log-handler that for example interprets such streams of updates by taking the first word as a subtask-identifier incrementally building up and displaying somewhere the composite message about the current subtask recognizing when the subtask identifier changes that the previous subtask is finished or taking an explicit subtask finished message and only writing persistent log entries on subtask-finished events

2840477

xna	slimdx
i use slimdx for c# graphics programming and i prefer it to xna

2840704
addition	multiplication
what i would like to do is skip the multiplication with any missing values the 10th and 11th position from my above example and then after the addition divide by the number of elements that were multiplied 11 from the above example

2840726
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
if you don t want to have to write your own parser to build the abstract syntax tree you could look at using the parsers from either sharpdevelop or monodevelop both of which are open source

i am surprised these have not been mentioned but instead of using bare-bones rather manual process with json.org s little package gson and jackson are much more convenient to use

2840873
gson	jackson
and at least jackson allows binding to such things too perhaps gson as well not sure jsonnode map list if you really want these instead of real objects

2840879
rank	max	min	rank	min	max
with this structure given the rank of an element even min max you can access delete it in o log n time

2840952
addition	multiplication
it will start the next multiplication while it s doing the addition see

2840964
gif	png
alternatively you can write your own image generating utility at server site in .net php like an http handler and pass text to it and it would return gif png by using the graphics library and rendering image on the fly for you

2840973
free	malloc
1 with c++ you do need to be careful when you use malloc free and new delete side-by-side in the same program

2840973
free	malloc
this is possible and permissible but everything that was allocated with malloc must be free with free and not with delete

2840973
free	malloc
in c++ new delete should be preferred over malloc free where possible

2840979
calloc	malloc
if that s the case perhaps he simply prefers calloc over malloc

2841009
range	minimum
a range of quantities can be used by specifing a minimum value immediately followed by a comma immediately followed by a maximum value

vim	emacs
they prefer to use vim and emacs to do their programming

2841113
vim	emacs
if i m not mistaken vim and emacs are just text editors similar to notepad but with syntax highlighting

2841144
vim	emacs
alternatively you can use stand-alone gui designers for example glade for gtk+ and qt designer for qt to design guis and use them from application written in vim or emacs or anything else

2841161
free	malloc
the c way is indeed using malloc free and if you need dynamic memory there s very little else you can do but use them or a few siblings of malloc

2841162
prepare	bindvalue
i think you should use prepare statements which pdo provides and call the bindvalue of

2841240

that s fast enough that i can almost believe a really fast new machine might at least come close to finishing in a minute and yes i checked what happened when i used shifts instead of multiplication division -- it was slower

2841398
free	malloc
it is not secure to use malloc because it s not possible to write a large scale application and ensure every malloc is free in an efficient manner

2841422

2841445
min	max
if your need for sorting doesn t extend beyond managing the min and max of your data another structure for you to look at might be an interval heap which has the advantage of o 1 lookup of both min and max if you need to peek at values though deletemin and deletemax are still o log n

2841467
min	max
the benefit of a min-max heap however is that the current min and max objects can be read in o 1 time a search tree requires o log n just to read the min or max object unless you have the cached pointers as i mentioned above

2841480
updatepanel	scriptmanager
if your using a javascript trick to get around ie 6 s lack of png transparency you need to register your script with the scriptmanager to run when the updatepanel refreshes

2841484
width	height
but that only works for the width not for the height

2841494
width	height
labels are inline elements by default so setting the width and height does nothing

glut	sdl
if you re building a simple demo of a rendering mechanism glut is way better than sdl it takes care of a lot of the details that sdl would otherwise require

2842963
glut	sdl
however if you re developing a serious application sdl is more likely to be the tool you need to use as glut abstracts more than a real application would normally want to

tinyint	boolean	int	boolean
then you run into the problem of different databases types sqlite for instance has only one int type while mysql has at least 5 tinyint smallint mediumint int bigint not counting aliases such as int bool boolean and serial and float types - which would be even harder to implement due to the variable precision argument

2843624

inherited	subclassing
you can inherited from a class to create a subclassing then you will have a is-a relationship

2844252
disk	ram
caches exist for various scenarios on the cpu to improve access time of the ram in web browsers to improve access time of web resources â and in this case as a folder of precompiled assemblies on disk to improve accessing dlls which otherwise would have to be compiled

suppose stackoverflow.com wanted to have an rss feed per each tag

2844260
rss	feed
tag aspnet to return appropriate rss feed

2844311
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i think your ideal solution is to not use .htaccess files at all but set those rules in httpd.conf

2844329
mouseover	mouseout
in javascript this behaviour can only be handled by listening to the mouseover and mouseout dom events as you did in your second example

2844340
retaincount	dealloc
so that when you release the array it will send release message to all objects in the array and the retaincount of all objects will become 0 and they will be dealloc

2844363
google-chrome	firefox
i copied and tried your code on firefox 3.6.3 and google-chrome 5.0.375.29

2844377
salt	md5
md5 or sha1 with site specific salt - which is quite an obligation today

2844390

2844402
cos	sin	cos	sqrt	sin	sqrt
in your case think about an algorithm to do sin cos tan or sqrt

2844517
button	checkbox
i am successfully creating the binding but when i change the source property s value from false to true i have a button that toggles it the checkbox s checked property does not reflect that change

2844520
superclass	subclassing
this is the most common and normal approach where the subclassing accepts and directly implements its state-dependence on the superclass -- it s very straightforward and linear

2844526
cos	sin
the same goes for sin cos tan log10 and so on

2844552
daemon	cron
this was the result of the daemon process disappearing before the mysql could store the record so i abandoned using the daemon and setup a cron instead

2844560
autocomplete	omnicomplete
there are some syntax definitions and omnicomplete plugins for actionscript that work pretty well -- not full autocomplete like you ll find in many graphical ides but enough to make vim a very good option for flash and flex development

2844586
vb.net	vb6
i can t use dotnet because i will not have to install a framework on a computer in which i will use my application and i know vb.net so i decide to vb6 i am open for other openions

2844609
google-chrome	safari
i ve devised a little coming soon page for my site which locally on a wamp setup is working flawlessly - in capable browsers google-chrome and safari the page looks fine and has a nice little css3 transition effect upon hover

2844609
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
after uploading to my hosting the site still looks fine and works fine in google-chrome and safari but for some reason in firefox the font-face declarations don t seem to have worked and in ie the layout is slightly different

2844616
gridview	objectdatasource
a gridview bound to an objectdatasource with selectmethod and updatemethod defined

i have many years to use old pascal nowadays i use delphi and i think you are using your c variable wrongly

2844673
vb6	vba
alternative ide for vb6 and vba

2844717
decltype	auto
the decltype keyword for deducing data-type from expression or an auto variable

2844735
getter	setter
whenever i define a new property in my test code and ask vs to generate that method stub for me it generates both a getter and a setter

2844765
cpu	processors
as you may have noticed over the past few years processors aren t getting any faster but the number of cpu cores per system is increasing

2844793
vb.net	vb6
try this assuming vb6 since you didn t tag it as vb.net

2844796
macvim	textmate	vim	textmate
by the way i also installed macvim on my macbook pro however i never used vim for latexing because i find textmate and its latex bundle is much superior than macvim you ll definately like it

2844802
mbunit	nunit
it s still useful in case you use one of a number of different unit testing frameworks nunit mbunit xunit csunit etc

2844812
udp	tcp	udp	rtp
you can try to pass transport header in a response to describe request and state there that your server only supports rtp avp tcp transport and the client should know that udp is unsupported

2844827
unsigned	short
what i m doing is taking an unsigned short containing 12 bits aligned high like this

2844931
post	get
you ll need to post some code to get a definitive answer but i would guess that one of your float values is unset

2845073
width	height
currently colorbox just resizes my images down to the size of the available height width

2845082
hex	binary
then i ll save the number he enters in a string because he could enter any kind of number hex binary base-5..

2845088
int	double
you need to use an int typed variable for array element access and need to cast the string explicitly into double

2845117
getter	setter
in enterprise java you have bean classes that are purely member variables with getter and setter but no business logic

2845117
getter	setter
a more concrete example might be a simple class with getter and setter for filename file size description and assorted other metadata

2845121
int	double
you can now construct and add different instantiations of vector3 such as with int s and double s

2845152
getter	setter
you can of course implement classes with just getter and setter but even synthesized properties have mild business logic for atomicity and memory management

2845159
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i created an example using toggle as suggested by galen and it works on google-chrome firefox and safari

2845224
post	get
you can t overload controller actions though as raj said you can differentiate them by allowing them to respond to different requests get post etc

2845233
fadein	fadeout
i have the following html div which does not work using fadein fadeout in ie

2845254
int	chars
also assuming sizeof int 4 your strings must not be greater than 4 chars as you have now and 1 of those needs to be a null termination

2845258
int	chars
you are allocating sizeof int bytes of memory for your strings which is most likely 4 your input strings read by scanf must not be longer than 3 chars

2845275
int	chars
strtol will parse the string stopping at the first chars that cannot be considered part of an int

2845275
int	chars
my reasoning is that if p is not set to the end of the string the 0 chars then there is a non-integer chars in the string s meaning s is not a correct int

2845275
strtol	strtod
see too the description of strtol s sister functions strtod strtoul etc.

2845298
rss	feed
iâ m parsing a twitter rss feed and i just need to show tweets so i don t need mgtwitterengine

2845329
int	chars
printf is a function declared in and it returns an int which is the number of chars outputted

2845346
awt	swing
currently i m aware that swing should not be used with awt so i can t use bufferstrategy and whatnot i already have some code written in awt that i don t want to rewrite in swing

2845346
awt	swing
unlike swing awt doesn t seem to have the same built-in double buffering capability

2845362
umask	chmod
upon file upload use php tochange the permissions with the chmod function or change the umask associated with the php process so that the file gets the correct permissions in the first place

2845366
chown	sudo	chown	chmod
use sudo chmod and sudo chown on the directory that contains the file you want to access then check to make sure the permissions where changed with the ls -rl command

2845366
chown	chmod
also if you are still unclear about the specifics of how chmod and chown work check out this link and this link

2845384
postgresql	mysql
assume the following table structure should work in sqlite postgresql mysql

2845392
public	protected
either make them both protected or both public

2845407
post	get
i can t use a collectionviewsource because the entity collection s bindinglistcollectionview does not support sorting for some goddamned reason note i ve seen the blog post with the dirty hack to get around this so please don t answer with that kthx

2845463
folder	directory
looking at the cvs directory in the checkout folder also reveals nothing suspicious

2845473
post	get
you can t send application json directly -- it has to be a parameter of a get post request

2845488
versioning	upgrade
we were running into this issue with some code running under .net framework 3.5 and using sybase.data.aseclient.dll versioning 1.1.510.0 when we upgrade our production server from 12.5 to 15

2845488
min	max
i don t have admin access but i believe they were set to min 2048 and max 4096 on the dev and test servers but both min and max set to 4096 on the production server

2845550
hide	show	slideup	slidedown
summary show hide the tr animate the divs within with slideup slidedown

2845561
int	double
there isn t a generic number type for example your first number is a double while the second is an int

2845570
put	get
i would like to know how can i get certain inputs and put them in more than one row in the cell array ..

2845571

put a try catch around the everything in startrecognition and echo any exceptions that get thrown

2845599
httpresponse	request
i have an httpresponse object for a web request i just made

2845618
inherited	properties
they re useful when you want to specify a set of common methods and properties that all classes that implement inherited from them have exposed behaviors that all should provide

2845663
irrlicht	ogre3d
there is also some rendering engines that you can use that will do a lot of nice things for you like ogre3d and irrlicht but if you cant understand the principles behind them like shadows illumination... i recomend you to try in opengl first learn it and then use some engine to get the work done for you

2845723
ubuntu	linux
the setup 1.8ghz core 2 duo 2gb ram linux 2.6.32-21-generic x86_64 ubuntu 10.04

2845795
google-chrome	firefox
you can see a working demo here works in google-chrome firefox and ie8

2845811
int	chars
while vec3i is for 3 channels int and vec3b is for 3 channels unsigned chars

2845828
mouseout	mouseleave
just switching your events to mouseleave instead of mouseout and mousenter instead of hover will fix the issue for your markup like this

2845828
mouseleave	mouseenter
.hover executes on mouseenter and mouseleave the first and second function you provide respectively so it s calling the fadein already overlapping a bit already

2845828
mouseout	mouseenter
the mouseout however fires even when entering a child mouseenter which .hover uses won t

2845833
serializable	deserialization
java serializable deserialization has significant performance overheads

2845971
coalesce	isnull
if that is actually the case then fine use coalesce instead of isnull and convert nulls to zeroes

2845972
terminate	timeout
for cases in which there s a risk of deadlock safethread terminate can accept a timeout parameter

2845972
terminate	timeout
if the timeout expires it calls thread terminate thus killing intrusively the thread

2845974
nsurl	nsstring
i have a bunch of files either nsstring s or nsurl s it doesn t matter

2846012
put	get	post	put	post	get
and yes because design documents are really just documents with special powers you can run you get post put delete methods on them

2846049
width	margin
as if that s not enough you can also set printer margins tab size etc in where i set the displayed tab width to 4 and print margin column to 120 or more

2846108
executable	upx
you could consider using an executable packer like upx this will reduce the executable size but will have an impact on performance

2846152
automake	autotools
while the gnu autotools automake autoconf etc. have traditionally been used there are a lot of problems with these tools and they have an incredibly steep learning curve

2846184
hide	show
i may even combine the show and hide functions using settimeout in the show function to trigger the hide function since i don t expect to use a show without a hide

2846203
google-chrome	safari
my problem lies in the fact that these divs either aren t being generated or just don t show up in ie safari and google-chrome

2846203
opera	firefox
in firefox and opera they do work

2846206
n-gram	words
if i decided that i wanted to take the 5 or 6 preceding words into account when predicting the next words then i would need 5-6 tables and an exponentially increase in space per n-gram

2846218
getter	setter
edit to clarify if i were to use the following pattern where should i declare string_key so that i could use it in both the setter and the getter method

2846219
hash	md5
a second optimisation would be to use an md5 crc32 or similar hash of the phrase as the key

2846271
pull	push
you can use xmlreader which uses a pull method to read the xml similar to sax s push method but a little easier to code against

2846286
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
using gcc on mac and vc++ 2008 on windows i managed to get it running on safari and firefox on mac os x and firefox and google-chrome on windows but not on google-chrome on mac os x

2846288
innodb	myisam
you may want to consider converting over to myisam tables as innodb tables have problems and restrictions

2846321
put	get
are there any python functions similiar to get put and opt in java for json

2846327
atomic	compare-and-swap
one option is to memory map mmap your file as shared then do atomic memory operations like compare-and-swap on the pointer

2846331
getter	setter
you could just mark the property as private using the properties pane in the edmx designer under the code generation option it has getter and setter options that you can change from public to private

2846344
getattr	setattr
pass the desired attribute as a string and use getattr and setattr

2846350
stdout	stderr
you can however override the stderr and stdout files with custom classes with write etc methods to allow your own logging systems

2846377
getter	setter
for example if you were to create a getter and setter function for assigning the object like

2846414
google-chrome	firefox
modern browsers are able to tell you if there is an error in your scripts and point out the line the problem occurs on firefox and google-chrome are good at this

2846418
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can use jquery s mouseenter and mouseleave events

2846419
put	get
i m not 100 sure about buttons but textblock controls that are inside datatemplate s do not get put into the ui automation tree

2846463
hash	salt
it s simple but it does hash encryption with salt uses email instead of usernames and has two separate kinds of users with an admin as well

2846478
valgrind	memcheck
learn to use valgrind specifically memcheck

2846501
atoi	atof
in these days i m playing with the c functions of atol atof and atoi from a blog post i find a tutorial and applied

2846501
atoi	atof
there is atof which returns the float value of the string and atoi which returns integer value

2846520
atof	strtod	strtol	atof	strtol	strtod
you can use strtol and strtod which are far superior than atol and atof because they allow you to test whether the conversion succeeded

2846545
int	double
now runtime i know key1 is int and key2 is double

2846551
width	height
then from there you would want to wrap your text within and possibly have it scroll or however you want to handle it by checking the text height and width to find where to wrap the text.

2846562
g++	gcc
i m using gcc g++ so adding the -mp option when generating dependencies works great for me until i get to the link stage with my .a file.

2846570
int	double
what you can do is the use the constructors for double and int that take string arguements

2846572
int	double
you can t linguistically cast a string a reference type to an int or a double a primitive numeric type

2846572
int	double
it s possible that you may never need to convert from string to int double in the first place or at least do it before you put them into the map

2846574
atoi	atof
that s not what the atol atoi and atof functions are for - they re for converting the subset of strings that represent numbers in base 10 into the corresponding long int or float value if possible

2846574
int	chars
note that if you want to do this with strings of arbitrary length you ll need to work with a big int library like gmp or openssl s bignum - the longest type in standard c long long cannot be mapped one-to-one onto the set of c strings that include strings longer than 8 chars because its guaranteed range includes only 18 446 744 073 709 551 615 unique values

2846591
komodo	notepad++
i tried notepad++ pyscript and komodo edit but all of these requires a hotkey to invoke the code completion dialog

2846609
oursql	mysql-python
install the mysql-python module or the oursql module along with the django-oursql connector

2846691
integer	unsigned
if the dw prefix in dwindex is accurate then it sounds like a dword which is a 32-bit unsigned integer

2846691
integer	unsigned
it seems unlikely that your c++ program requires a signed integer on a 32-bit platform and an unsigned one on a 64-bit one though not impossible of course

2846697
put	get
the main thread starts all subthreads does a get on the queue to wait until one of them has done a put then emits the results and terminates which takes down any subthreads that might still be running since they re daemon threads

2846724
rss	feed
i normally view rss feed in google reader

2846726
onchange	onblur
because you are adding the test function to onkeypress so every key press onchange so every time it changes and onblur whenever you move to another field

2846737
hash	salt
the hash is the same only if you have the same salt value

2846765
inherited	properties
not sure about the event but there is a designmode bool properties on a windows form probably inherited from control that returns true if the form is open in the designer

2846789
public	protected
that way c can use b s public methods but not get access to the protected ones

2846841
nsoperation	nsinvocationoperation
the nsinvocationoperation class is a concrete subclass of nsoperation that implements a non-concurrent operation

2846854
public	protected
since this will make it it public within the first assembly you might want to add protected to enforce encapsulation

2846892
versioning	upgrade
but the rubygems developers don t make their bugfixes available separately the only way to get a bugfix is to upgrade to a new versioning with potentially different behavior

2846892
ubuntu	debian
either use rubygems for everything in which case it is best to install rubygems from source instead of using the debian package or use apt for everything in which case you might be interested in debgem a service by the phusion guys makers of ruby enterprise edition and phusion passenger which provides debian and ubuntu packages for pretty much all gems

2846935
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
problem login is not working in firefox and google-chrome but it does in safari

2846935
google-chrome	firefox
the strange thing is that for 3 people with three different systems firefox and google-chrome don t work

2846962
mouse	keyboard
but this works perfect on mouse click but client want that if user navigate the by keyboard arrow keys then in same should be happen

2846990
cout	cin
which means cout date cannot earlier then cin date

2846999
min	max
if it is the datepicker from jquery ui you can give it min and max date as arguments like this

2847032
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i ve created a tiny test case that exhibits the same problem a custom root uiviewcontroller which creates and displays a uitabbarcontroller programmatically which has two tabs 1 plain uiviewcontroller and 2 uinavigationcontroller created programmatically with a single plain uiviewcontroller content view

2847035
ubuntu	linux
first off i m on ubuntu linux if that matters

2847099
google-chrome	safari
i have just learned how to use the sqlite database for local storage in a webkit web browser google-chrome or apple safari using the javascript api

2847100
put	get
do notice i put the filltext loader inside the main function you should move this outside so it doesn t get repeatedly called if you use this code

2847112
qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel
i m trying to use a qtreeview for the first time with qabstractitemmodel and instantly have a problem

2847147
inherited	subclassing
now i know i could use the table per subclassing strategy from hibernate to create a mapping with inherited

2847156
google-chrome	firefox
same results in firefox ie6 and google-chrome

2847170
google-chrome	safari
but i get blank pages in google-chrome safari

2847170
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i was having issues with loading it not because of my document.write yes i know its nasty but because skype was hogging port 80 but only for safari and google-chrome because i had been using firefox ie before skype started

2847176
client-side	server-side
this is a question regarding rendering of javascript code which will be executed on the client-side from server-side code

2847176
client-side	server-side
this is prescribing the client-side onclick event on the server-side

2847176
client-side	server-side
what server-side sees as an event is not necessarily the same process on the client-side

2847176
client-side	server-side
what happens on client-side and on server-side during an event could be completely irrelevant and decoupled

2847190
mouseover	mouseout
the javascript to handle the mouseover and mouseout events

2847270
post	get
anything that deletes or updates content should be done on a post not get request

2847271
put	get
i am not sure whether this will put the line at the place you want but the idea is to get the editpoint and then use it to insert the line

2847335
qtcore	qtgui
you need to check you include directories and add path_to_qt_headers qtcore path_to_qt_headers qtgui and directories for other modules you are using

2847392
hash	salt
you should hash and salt your passwords but that s not exactly encryption.

2847425
put	get
on the production server - when you deploy your application if your server does not have asp.net ajax 1.0 extensions installed you will need to put the systen.web.exntesions.dll in your dll which you can easily get it from

2847434
post	get
read about get and post in here and here

2847434
post	get
if you want to use javascript i suggest you to use framework like jquery and any and post or get the data using ajax way it s better

2847439
width	height
for so many time i have encountered problems with managing image having abnormally long height or width

2847439
width	height
if i fixed their width and if the height of the image is very long then also it will mess up the overall website

2847439
width	height
if i fixed their height and if the width of the image is very long then also it will mess up the overall website

2847439
width	height
let say user decides to upload image 1 height 32 width

2847456
width	height
if i fixed their width and if the height of the image is very long then also it will mess up the overall website

2847456
width	height
if i fixed their height and if the width of the image is very long then also it will mess up the overall website

2847456
width	height
calculate the x-y ratio of the image compare it to the x-y ratio of the space you want to put it in use that to make a decision about scaling it while maintaining aspect ratio to the width of the space or the height of the space

2847462
width	height
so why don t you use some image library to scale the image on either height or width and keep ratio

2847463
portrait	landscape
what you have is simply a standard table displayed in portrait orientation but your are holding the phone in landscape mode

2847466
implements	extends
clickablelistadapter extends baseadapter and implements the necessary methods

2847472
put	get
you ll want to get a build that works with the oldest version of tcl you re supporting simply compiling in stubbed mode â i think that s default anyway â against the oldest tcl version you want to support should be fine and then put that in a directory as a full install of the package that you have on your code s auto_path

2847490
int	chars
the only place where it can change the meaning of the code is when auto was used together with the implicit int rule if not type is specified - it s an int in which case the second line in my example used to have c2 of type int and now it s of type chars

2847495
folder	directory
so by altering the shadow copied directory list you can load from any folder without locking your assemblies

2847502
sendkeys	findwindow
just launch the app using system.diagnostics.process then use findwindow to find the application setforegroundwindow to make it the active app then use sendkeys to send keypresses and sendinput for mouse clicks

2847517
simplecursoradapter	autocompletetextview
i use autocompletetextview with simplecursoradapter to get data from sqlite

2847535
vim	emacs	vim	textmate	emacs	textmate
i am looking for something like textmate s fuzzy search on command-t fuzzyfinder in vim or ido in emacs

2847556
min	max
in .net 4.0 there s sortedset - it looks like that would do what you want and it has min and max properties

2847598
ftp	telnet
when the ftp is in the locked state i am still able to telnet the ftp service but login do not work

2847643
width	height
instead you should resize the width to 1000 and the height to 1000 32

2847763
textview	imageview
the rows themselves exist out of an icon and a text thus an imageview and a textview

2847763
textview	imageview
i have seen examples extending a cursoradapter but again i don t have a cursor i don t want to do calls to a db i want to re-utilize my array with data and obviously the arrayadapter itself so that the data will be represented decently on screen i.e with my imageview and textview layout

2847818
nunit	mstest
in mstest and nunit

2847888
junit	jmock
when using jmock with junit 4 you can avoid some boilerplate code by taking advantage of the jmock test runner

2847923
children	parent
the parent process accept the connection then pcntl_fork the process to have children to handle connection

2847938
int	double

keydown	keyup
this is quite anoying and doesn t happen if you click on the dropdownlist and uses keyup or keydown or if you uses another browser than ie

2848294
mouseleave	mouseenter
the reason what you currently have doesn t work is that it binds the event handler to the elements the elements only had to match the selector you used when you found them for binding once that happens the .hover mouseenter and mouseleave event handlers are bound on that element

2848438
pascal	delphi
end pascal delphi

webkit	gecko
only thing i can think of is the difference between msie and gecko webkit is that empty or hidden divs take up space in msie i think

2848792
ant	maven
the mvn ant task page discusses using a macro to invoke the maven commandline

2848853
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
generally i would target and test ie 8 7 firefox and safari or google-chrome

2848853
opera	firefox
you might want to throw in opera as well though my experience has been that if you get firefox you generally have already gotten it to work for opera

2848888
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction is roughly 3 times as slow as for normal int s

2848888
division	multiplication
multiplication and division is a lot slower over an order of magnitude

int	chars
replace all those new ed stringbuffers with chars arrays that are allocated in the constructor and never again using int indices to keep track of what s in them

2849064
post	get
so to answer your question no you can t directly get the javascript to call a php server-side function but you can post to a php page which will then in turn carry out whatever function you like

2849093
versioning	upgrade
there is a side-effect to this problem which is that there seems to be no way to upgrade the versioning of jbosscache within jboss appserver due to those same shared low-level libraries

2849131
fpdf	fpdi
yes fpdf + fpdi worked for me

2849131
fpdf	fpdi

2849148
hide	show
i know how to show and hide elements using jquery and css and have figured out i can count the divs using

2849180
hide	show
use the .addclass and .removeclass - just put a class on the first page div that show and all the others that hide and swap them hiding one with current visibility by adding the hide class and removing the show class and the inverse for the new page you wish to show by adding removing css classes

2849187
serializable	deserialization
this latter method might add some overhead on the serializable side however and you will also need to convert these dicts to sets upon deserialization either by subclassing json.jsondecoder or doing it yourself in an extra step

2849195
draggable	droppable
i am using the jquery plugins draggable and droppable and

2849211

2849437
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this happens in ie6 7 8 as well as firefox safari and google-chrome which leads me to believe the problem is peculiar to how cufon has been implemented on this site

2849468
maven	pom.xml
ok i fixed my problem by forcing maven to put the hbm.xml files into the target classes package name folder so at the end my pom.xml looks like this

2849509

it provides serializable deserialization with corba marshalling see classes ace_inputcdr and ace_outputcdr

2849631
jquery	curvycorners
you could put jquery curvycorners to use to do it all out of the box instead

2849634
put	get
deployment of said tons of dlls can get problematic i sometimes use ilmerge to alleviate this and the above problems but let s put that aside for now

2849650
cpu	processors
if the cpu usage history is maxed out on one graph you have underutilized processors and could consider threading

2849661

in other case you could download your sources on free like sourceforge www svn cvs server and used them with mac windows linux

2849671
hide	show
worth noting that a message is show for the free download version when the file manager is displayed a license key is required to hide the message however the message is not really intrusive no popups or anything

hindi	french
i have installed the french fonts and hindi fonts for ubuntu

2849827
hindi	french
i then made a sample application and added appropriate translations in hindi and french

2849866
mef	prism
the only thing you won t get by using exclusively mef is the pub sub communication technology in prism called eventaggregator but this can be easily substituted by using eventaggregator itself it is standalone.

2849866
mef	prism
there are also quite a few people using a mix of mef and prism so you might check that out as well

2849932
bazaar	git
another issue with logs in files is that they only make sense for linear working - once you re developing with multiple branches in the way that distributed source tools like git mercurial bazaar encourage having the log in the source file itself only serves to create merge conflicts almost all of the time

2849936
int	chars
you can consider using chars instead of int

2850033
implements	extends
your custom adapter has to implements the filterable interface override getfilter and return an instance of a class which extends filter in getfilter

the free versioning is sufficient for most needs and if you re willing to upgrade to the paid versioning 35 for a single install 97 for infinite you get reporting and a number of additional fields

2850147
pull	push
if you only want to push pull from the local storage use the adb pull and push commands to get the files from the phone onto your computer and then mess with them locally

2850149
apache	nginx
installing passenger either with apache or with nginx is by far less work than finding the answer to this issue

2850154
width	height
if you don t have exif data and your images are scanned faxed documents then i think you re only solution is to check the height and width of the image and rotate based on that

2850154
width	height
documents are most likely to be in portrait format taller than they are wide so if the height is greater than the width then do don t have to do anything

2850154
width	height
if the height is less than the width then rotate through 90 degrees

2850172
ant	maven
there is always the possibility to run ant inside maven

2850172
ant	maven
ant is much more powerful than maven in many respects but maven excels in dependency management and ease of deployment

2850172
ant	maven
so if you need the power of ant inside maven use the maven antrun plugin

stdout	stderr
to see errors route stderr to stdout using

2850232
ostringstream	std
write it to a std ostringstream and hash the str result

2850255

this works really well in firefox google-chrome and even ie 7.0 but when i try it with more than 50 images in ie 8.0 the performance is incredible slow

2850291
ant	maven
i would go with either an integrated ant solution using maven-antrun-plugin or a custom java class using the maven exec plugin here

2850324

hide	show
animations show hide for example require less code in jquery than yui

2850610
multiplying	multiplication

2850628
folder	directory
if the resources are not setup in the child directory as an application in iis it should appear as a normal folder

2850628
folder	directory
if you setup 2 websites on iis and map the physical folder to your images on both as virtual directory you should have access to them as normal folder when you open either in visual studio

2850671
filesystems	ntfs
everything i read said it was designed for ms office but that it should work with any file as long as the filesystems is ntfs at least that s my understanding

2850682
postgresql	mysql
i have used oracle postgresql and mysql with asp.net in addition to sql server

2850700
submit	submission

i ve explored the options of monkeybars wxruby fxruby shoes etc

2850733
uiview	subviews
to achieve smooth switching i am using two movieplayerviewcontrollers each a subviews of uiview object in appcontroller

2850733
uiview	subviews
following is the movieplayerviewcontroller init code -- basically it allocs and inits two movieplayerviewcontroller objects and adds them as subviews to the default and alternate uiview objects from appcontroller

2850734
subclass	abstract-class
when stuff like that happens all the sudden the caller is tightly coupled to the concrete subclass and not just the interface where interface can mean a java interface abstract-class or even some other non-final class

2850768

2850953
post	get
rob ashton s post on selecting master pages at runtime should get you started

2850960
factors	matrix
if you are dealing with jpeg image compression image blocks + dct + quantization + huffman coding the compressor has freedom to use its own quatization matrix - or rather a family of matrix one for each quality factors

2850960
factors	matrix
i believe the standard suggests some typical matrix eg including a scaling factors for different qualities

2850969
post	get
register globals basically allows a user to create a global variable simply by passing in a parameter to a get or post

2851111
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in ie8 firefox google-chrome

2851154
width	height
depending on the height and width of your textboxes your mileage may vary

2851191
integer	unsigned
when you mix a signed and an unsigned integer in a sub- expression the unsigned arithmetic wins the calculations are performed in unsigned domain

2851191
integer	unsigned
in fact in practice most or at least half of integer variables in c c++ the program should have unsigned types

2851216
client-side	server-side
ssl in asynchronous mode etc for both client-side and server-side

2851226
min	max
now cos ang-omega is a very nicely behaved function in terms of monotonicity and you only need to consider it in the interval min ang1 ang2 max ang1 ang2

2851238
stateless	stateful
generally speaking stateless web applications will have less overhead per thread than stateful ones

2851248
uilabel	uitextview
now i had to go to uitextview because uilabel is not aligning text vertically to the top

2851273
ssms	sqlcmd
another solution is to use sqlcmd variables which ssms recognizes when properly configured

2851333
folder	directory
i was using the template name as declared in the xml file instead of using the directory in the template folder templates directoryname

2851365
rss	feed
i m trying to parse a rss feed that looks like this for the attribute date

2851367
stdout	stderr
the 2 1 part will redirect stderr to stdout output which would normally be dropped

2851386
codeigniter	cakephp
and since mvc such as cakephp and codeigniter is all classes that can t be good

2851449
implements	extends
i cannot extends thread nor can i implements runnable since testcase already has a method void run

2851449
implements	extends
i am extends seleniumtestcase and trying to make it implements runnable

2851455
vim	emacs
emacs and vim are ides--integrated development environments which means they assemble a variety of programs related to writing programs into one place

2851498
ironruby	ironpython
out of the box visual studio doesn t contain ironpython or ironruby

2851498
cpython	ironpython
finally you can use the ironpython tools mentioned above to edit your code and use cpython to run it - you don t get debugger support but most everything else should work just fine

2851542
subtract	add
iterate through each character in your string until you hit the end and based off of what the character is and which range it s in 0 to 9 a to f a to f you ll need to subtract the value of the bottom character in it s range and add any appropriate amount

2851542
subtract	add
if you see an a you ll need to subtract off a and add 0x0a

2851597

the carry flag is used to do multi-part arithmetic where the result of one addition or subtraction needs to affect the next higher part

2851680
rss	feed
i saw this article pop-up in my msdn rss feed and after reading through it and the sourced article here i began to wonder about the solution

2851682
stdout	stderr
that will cause the shell to spit out a command not found error on stderr and no output on stdout which you redirect to a file and ends up with 0 length

2851695
vb.net	vb6
i ve created a mapi wrapper in vb6 and compiled it as an activex.exe so i can use it in my vb.net project

2851696
width	height
the rectangle class has the attributes height width and x y

2851696
width	height
the x and y values are encapsulated in a point object and the height and width are encapsulated in a dimension object the rectangle being a composite of a point its top-left location and a dimension width and height

2851696
width	height
i though it would be pretty simple on the basis of having the rectangles x y width and height values to define the css rect attribute in terms of top right bottom left but i ve become hopelessly confused- i ve been googling for a while and i can t seem to find any documentation as to what the trbl values actually are or what they represent

2851696
width	height
for example should i be thinking in terms of co-ordinates in which case surely i can describe the rectangle as a css rect using the rectangles x position for top x position + width for right the rectangles height + y for bottom and its y position for left.

2851696
width	height
i define a rectangle using x y width and height

2851696
width	height
iii change x y width or height and recalculate in terms of trbl and goto ii

2851702
setinterval	settimeout
it s not a solution but if you really want to just add-on to the existing function you ll most likely use setinterval or settimeout to call a modified version of your existing function every x seconds

2851723
versioning	upgrade
now that the full versioning is out we ve upgrade to flash builder 4 premium and i no longer see this problem

2851725
spaces	delimiter
i used this one and applied the first commenter s edit to allow for the spaces character as a delimiter

2851759
pop-up	dialog
i am using both jquery ui dialog and jquery ui autocomplete both have the same erroneous behavior when they pop-up the position is always 0 0

2851782
put	get
here they go get the data and put it in a global variable and then use whileprintingrecords to either display the data or in your case use it in the suppress formula

2851812
rss	feed
you could find many examples of self-made python blogs on google appengine that generate rss 2.0 feed using pyrss2gen

2851860
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox i can usee firebug in google-chrome i can use the css console

2851935
ant	maven
as an alternative you can use ant or maven script to copy jars where you want

2851937
portrait	landscape
every subsequent launch behaves as i would expect - that is there are calls to shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation made both with landscape and portrait arguments

2851964
bash	zsh
integrating the output into the prompt is still shell specific escape or quote the for both bash and zsh and set prompt_subst for zsh

2851966
stdout	stderr
use the -u command line switch to force python 2 to treat stdin stdout and stderr as binary unbuffered streams

2851976

gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
i use php to upload the image files and i check if the file being uploaded is a png jpg bmp or gif

2851980
int	double
if at all possible i d advise changing the double you re using as a key to some int type instead

2852100
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
it seems like maybe the answer is to use svcutil.exe instead of wsdl.exe

2852113
typemock	mspec	mspec	mstest	mstest	typemock
not any one framework we ve hit on mspec nuint mstest rhinomocks typemock etc -- we re just talking generally

2852141
width	height
it should autocrop to the current width height of the graphic symbol if you have the symbol selected

2852143
uiview	uiwindow
uiwindow can have uiview they can have uiview by themselves

2852151
pop-up	dialog
because jquery dialog copies your pop-up -div inside its own containing div the checkboxes loose the function you bound to the click-event

2852204
postgresql	mysql
the information_schema database is part of the ansi 2003 specification so you could use that across any db vendor that supports it mysql postgresql sqlite mssql 2k5+

2852207
equals	gethashcode
second you probably shouldn t use vals.gethashcode in your gethashcode override on the comparer as this will lead you to getting different hash codes for objects that would evaluate to true for your equals override

2852237
hide	show
or try to use setonscrolllistener to check scroll status and hide show the bars

2852248
ant	maven
now when i do my ant build it appears that it is getting its list of jars to include in the final build from maven

2852277
bottle	flask
you should probably check out flask or bottle two nice python microframeworks

2852290
post	get
turns out they way i was calling .load was causing it to do a post instead of a get which meant it bypassed the cache

2852302
public	protected
i would say it does not matter what type of a method it is public private protected you take proper precautions whenever that is needed without looking at the visibility keyword

2852314
vim	emacs
i m currently trying emacs coming from vim

2852327
junit	testng
on top of that i believe many .net unit test frameworks implement the same or similar features to their java counterparts junit and testng which support parametrized tests

2852332
children	parent
as an example i want this parent item page to redirect to it s children page

2852336
setinterval	settimeout
if so just use setinterval instead of settimeout

2852362
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
this avoids problems when going from case-sensitive to case-insensitive filesystems and vice versa

2852389
terminate	timeout
it s likely hanging on which blocks the calling thread until the thread whose join method is called terminate â either normally or through an unhandled exception â or until the optional timeout occurs

2852405
udp	tcp
you should be able to send tcp or udp traffic out with your data to each of your clients particularly if bandwidth needs are small

2852457
mouseup	mousedown
you ll probably want to add an addition check that the time between the mousedown and mouseup is less than 500 milliseconds say and that the mouse hasn t moved more than a pixel or two between the events

2852468
width	height
then the data would start with a couple of well-defined structures namely this and this specifying the colour depth number of bits per pixel more or less the number of colours the width the height and the compression of the bitmap

2852472
macbook	bootcamp
i ve tested this on other hardware upgraded my gma x3100 drivers using a macbook with bootcamp to the latest ones but i can t reproduce it on any other machine and i m at a loss about what s wrong here

2852480
put	get
one thing nice about the pics is that many of them come in dip packages so you can put them on a plastic breadboard and get started with them right away

2852480
i2c	spi
for example digikey sells the pic24fj16ga002 16k flash 4k ram i2c spi uart and parallel port in a 28-pin dip package for 3.64

2852481
icefaces	openfaces
ajax support many 3rd-party libraries myfaces icefaces openfaces anotherprefixfaces... have strong ajax support and it works pretty well

2 implement two sliders one horizontal for partâ s width and one vertical for partâ s height

2852554
mouseleave	mouseenter
one when you mouseenter the other when you mouseleave

2852567
ssl	https
if you ll set up the ssl on tomcat and send your data over https then the encryption will be done for you

2852601
post	get
if i post the data as such i get errors such as

2852614
profiler	yourkit
i used a java profiler yourkit and i can see my running serversocket listen thread and it never sleeps and it s always running

2852660
implements	extends
or the example shows you how to easily extends rowtablemodel by implements a couple of methods

2852664
jsf	wicket
i would advise you to try wicket it is very easy to learn much easier than jsf and it let s you re-use many existing components as well

2852680
setinterval	clearinterval
finally add buttons that call setinterval and clearinterval as needed as in toggleslideshow

2852697
min	max
the basis of levels is that you adjust the max min and midpoints of the brightness levels

2852699
width	height
slide creates a placeholder the size of your object and then slides into the frame of view while blind adjusts the height or width of your element until it expands to the correct size while overflow is set to hidden

2852791
hide	show
the first is a simple js function to hide show divs and change the active state of a tab

2852791
hide	show
this is the js that show hide divs and changes the active state on some tabs

2852840
fseek	ftell	fseek	fread	ftell	fread
ftell fseek and fread all operate on bytes not on characters

2852926
rss	feed
for #2 you will have to create an rss feed thru a generic handler .ashx file and link the icon to it

2852926
rss	feed
or you can use a free service such as addthis.com which allows your users to post your article to twitter facebook google rss feed and other mediums

2852951
quicksort	heapsort
i think the fastest solution can be a heapsort or quicksort and after go through the array and find the duplicates

2853038
prepare	execute
so instead of using a deadly execute i can use a safer prepare statement to insert an id into my queue table which the background script will catch in the next 30 seconds

2853057
width	height
if the width height all is well

2853057
width	height
however if height width then the 3d mesh is sized too small

2853057
width	height
the only thing that fixed this was if height width change the updirection on the perspective camera from 0 1 0 to 1 0 0 and apply a 90 rotate transform

2853085
pop-up	dialog
essentially if you want to pop-up a dialog you can do it with a javascript function on the client side the aspx pages code behind is behind executed on the server which means visually you can t reall do much at all unless you want your host to see it and noone else

2853160
button	checkbox
this works great for selects radio button and checkbox

2853169
width	height
note that you don t need to set width auto or height auto this is implied

2853299
rss	feed
if the blog you are interested in has an rss feed you can connect to this and use xslt to transform this to html and use css to style that

2853305
width	height
in your case multiplying the ratio by height width without changing the fov should suffice

2853363
client-side	server-side
i d rather do the validation client-side as there s quite a bit of server-side validation that happens to deal with writing form values to a database

2853389
inherited	subclassing
inherited can change the behavior of a method in a subclassing

2853428
hide	show
hide details don t show this message again check for solutions online run program cancel

2853431
cout	cin
overloading cin cout

2853432
google-chrome	safari
in ie google-chrome safari etc. the with of the flash element is a consistent 412px

2853432
width	height
setting a width in the css for the .sifr-flash element causes it to remain the proper 412px wide but the text doesn t wrap at all--it just cuts off at the right edge and the height of the flash element remains one line high

2853487
getter	setter
i think it should be possible to create an annotation processor to synthesize a builder for an immutable class much like project lombok does with setter and getter

2853488
folder	directory
my web application requires functionality where end users can upload content that can be later downloaded or viewed by others the problem with current scheme is if i create such folder as part of your web project under webapps every time i do deploy your web application .war the content of that directory will be lost or overridden

2853504
getter	setter
because you used the automatic getter setter a hidden backing field is used for the property ic

2853584
int	double
one bit of trickiness there is the data binding engine is actually internally converting between double and int for you as slider.value is a double

2853602
hide	show
this works fine in windowsxp my window is underneath all windows and when i press the show desktop option the window show and all other normal windows are hide

2853663
post	put
simply put i wouldn t manage this in the fashion demonstrated by your original post

2853664
google-chrome	safari
the testing environment would be xp ie6 ff3.6 xp ie7 google-chrome xp ie8 safari macosx safari ff3.6 google-chrome ubuntu ff3.6 google-chrome

2853688
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
since cross-platform differences in browsers using the same engine google-chrome safari should be neglible you could get away with virtualizing 3 ie6 ie7 ie8 and adding safari google-chrome firefox and opera versions to one of those virtal machines

2853724
client-side	server-side
ideally i d like to do this server-side php but recognize that actual character width stuff is far more likely to be feasible client-side js jquery

2853739
dictionary	map
passing keyword arguments into dictionary though it works beautifully in a lot of scenarios can only initialize a map if the keys are valid python identifiers

2853743
google-chrome	firefox
try using something like the firebug plugin for firefox or the developer tools in google-chrome to look at the request being sent out

2853766
put	get
because the call was a get and in my routes i had a update_xxxxxx put

2853766
put	get
i just had to put the update_xxxx get and the problem was solved

2853783
versioning	upgrade
consider the common need to upgrade the libraries jar1-v1.0.jar and jar2-v1.0.jar to their versioning v1.1

2853810
post	put
if s required on the server and it s on a form that post you could put the time into a hidden field then on post you could extract the value and calculate the difference

2853859
bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs
support for git bazaar subversion cvs and darcs is planned

2853901
serializable	deserialization
this handles the deserialization case but in the serializable case the cached value is killed and must be recomputed

2853922
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
note this approach worked for some webcontrols dropdownlistfor but not all of them checkbox

2853934
folder	directory
the directory and files lists are all always relative to root - they are the basename of the files folder they don t have a in them or on windows

2853944
profiler	yourkit
i used a java profiler yourkit and i can see my running serversocket listen thread and it never sleeps and it s always running

2853966
ssl	https
the most important is that you use public key of the bank to send a piece of information to the bank because in every ssl https connection server send to client it s public key packed as a certificate

2853986
superclass	subclassing
however when i save it afterwards rails will run only the superclass validators not the ones i defined in the subclassing

2853990
inherited	properties
perhaps you could inherited base your own implemented openfiledialog using the system.io namespace objects such as directoryinfo for instance which will allow you to get the browsed folder files with the getfiles method then filter yourself through linq to display the files with no extension only with the fileinfo.extension properties

2853990
implements	sealed
since the openfiledialog is sealed you may use it as a nested type and implements your own methods using this nested type

2853995
x86	64bit
if even more performance is needed a just in time compiler from vm byte code to native instructions exists for 32-bit x86 and is in beta release for 64bit

2854027
opera	safari
i ll throw out there that mobile safari and opera mobile have support

2854028
google-chrome	firefox
in windows everything looks great regardless of whether it s firefox google-chrome or ie

2854029
width	height
or use and width height attributes

2854041
subclass	abstract-class
i know that the typical case is to subclass one of the servlet abstract-class rather than implement this interface directly but it should still be possible to do this

2854109
getter	setter
note that this example has the appropriate instance variables name cost etc and a getter setter pair for the name variable

2854109
getter	setter
you d want to add more getter setter pairs for the other instance variables

2854109
getter	setter
once you have all your getter setter you can instantiate a unit by doing this

2854120
tapestry	struts	tapestry	wicket	struts	wicket	jsf	tapestry	jsf	wicket
there are a plethora of java web frameworks that you can put on top of that eg struts 2 wicket tapestry jsf

2854145
put	get
so city needs the id for the state name so i would get the state name put it into the state type then call this function to get the id for that state so my city insert will also include the id for the foreign key

2854150
getter	setter
i would suggest you take a look at glazedlists which will work for any domain model object that follows java beans conventions getter setter

2854161
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the windows browsers and mac safari too in my testing just throw out the ascent value as incorrect whereas firefox and opera on the mac accept it

2854176
post	get
i want to send using post method the selected categories category via mootools ajax so that if i dump the _post variable in the server i will get something like

2854186
japplet	jdialog
since all swing top-level containers namely jframe jdialog and japplet implement the rootpanecontainer interface this means that you can gain access to their root pane in a general way no need to check if this is a jframe or jdialog ....

2854235
createelement	domdocument
basically domdocument obj- createelement obj- appendchild

2854293
min	max
-- find the row with the max qty and min date

2854354
children	parent
for the above diagram that you are conflicted on your error occurs when you read a parent node before reading any leaf children nodes to the left

2854399
listview	gridview
now those post were usually about listview gridview in combination with scrollview but still to me it seems that the best solution redesign the screen to avoid that

2854439
savefiledialog	folderbrowserdialog
alternatively instead of using folderbrowserdialog to choose a folder use savefiledialog to select the actual file instead

2854498
lisp	scheme
the lambda keyword in any lisp before scheme is certainly pretentious and after scheme there s room too to say it is

2854640
post	get
the hidden field does get added to my form as i can see with firebug but it s just not being sent with the post data

2854642
getter	setter
for xml serialization to work with properties you need to have both getter and setter for the properties

2854643
google-chrome	firefox
i ve been working on sending text to an input element in google-chrome and i noticed that unlike in ie or firefox calling .focus does not put the cursor in the text area

2854727
min	max
i am using link text for implementing slider in my application but it throws exception when the min and max values are equal

2854733
post	put
see the requiring all possible namespaces blog post by john lawrence aspden for a description of what you might put in user.clj to pull in all of contrib something i don t do personally though i do have a use clojure.contrib.repl-utils in there

2854745
google-chrome	safari
webkits google-chrome 6 and safari 4 is doing also well

2854750
button	checkbox
i need to hide the button which is in user control when a checkbox in aspx is clikced

2854750
button	checkbox
i want to hide the button when the checkbox is checked

2854778
kde	gnome
i don t know about kde but in gnome you can check open with terminal to ensure that the program is launched from a new terminal session with the same environment you d get from .bashrc

2854808
cassini	iis
i m debugging this web site through vs2010 so i ve set-it-up to use iis instead of cassini and when i put a break point in the application_start function it is never hit so the routes are never registered

2854866
matplotlib	scipy
i m having some issues with my first attempts at using matplotlib and scipy to make some scatter plots of my data too many variables trying to see many things at once

2854866
matplotlib	scipy
i m using fink installed python26 with corresponding packages for scipy matplotlib etc

2854872
googletest	cppunit
it seems that you can use googletest from another framework cppunit in your case

2854950
mvp	presenter
unlike the presenter in mvp a

2854961
min	max
this program to calculate sum min and max of the sum of array elements

2855005
min	max
the problem is that you are initialising min and max to min_max 0 0 before assigning any values to min_max so their content is actually undefined

2855027
folder	directory
if it s not find it inside your app s resources folder then copy it into the documents directory using

2855028
min	max
will print the only value of i not min or max

2855149
portrait	landscape
how i rotate video in my iphone landscape to portrait and vice versa

2855165
jsf	seam
dan allen has a great 2 part post that covers how you can speed up your seam apps if you are using jsf

2855259
daemons	systemd
i am not a mainframe expert but i assume you connect not to mvs but to the uss unix systemd services which run either ftp or ssh daemons

2855282
daemons	systemd
if your systemd is configured to hand mail to a local daemons the daemons may be dead or misconfigured

2855282
daemons	systemd
the local mail daemons shouldn t ever die or at least it should be resurrected immediately by the systemd

2855311
jquery	scriptaculous
cakephp 1.3 does have some helpers that work with prototype scriptaculous mootools mootools-more and jquery jquery ui but i don t think that alone they are enough of a reason for choosing a javascript framework

2855314
post	get
here and here â s are some good post why you get the dialog even when you register the unhandledexceptionevent

2855318
accessor	properties
use the array style properties accessor

2855331
youtube	vimeo
from what i understand you want the player to allow the user to jump to parts of the audio video that haven t buffered yet something like what vimeo youtube players do

2855331
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine with both audio and video elements and i ve confirmed this behaviour in both google-chrome and firefox

2855332
xslt	xquery
not just xslt but xquery java sax+dom whatever.

2855344
jboss	weblogic
our application runs succesfully on tomcat websphere and weblogic and as part of it uses jboss cache version 3.1.0.g

2855380
inherited	subclassing
the static part of a class can not be inherited or overridden by subclassing

2855394
versioning	upgrade
i have recently tried to upgrade to versioning 10 of the reporting libraries microsoft.reportviewer.webforms and microsoft.reportviewer.common and for some reason this does not work anymore

2855420
subtraction	addition
some instructions may use the carry flag with as some additional implicit operand or result without having a connection with addition subtraction

2855420
subtraction	addition
after a subtraction processors vary in which condition the carry flag is set i.e some do it in the same way as after the addition of an inversed second operand the other set it to the negation of that

2855426
hide	show
my plan was to create forms on demand cache them and use a simple hide show strategy

2855432
pdfbox	apache-poi	pdfbox	jpedal	apache-poi	jpedal
developing in anything that runs on the jvm you would probably do best using apache-poi for ms office document parsing and pdfbox jpedal or pdf clown for parsing .pdfs

2855443
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
i also tried this in ie8 safari google-chrome and opera with no problems

2855467
post	get
but dint find the difference between post and get and i also want to know what is the use of type contenttype and datatype

2855476
post	get
as a rule of thumb use get to retrieve data and post to update it

2855507
folder	directory
this allows me to keep my includes in a subdirectory of the main site directory which is good for organisation and it can be used on the projects where i do not have access to folder outside the web root

2855610
post	get
one additional word of warning when choosing between get and post is to realise that get will be cached by browsers like ie rather than being called every time whereas post when data is included will not be cached

2855613
uploadify	swfupload
i would use swfupload or uploadify

2855649
ant	cruisecontrol
i have a problem with cruisecontrol where an ant scripts executes a bat file that doesn t give me the prompt back

2855717
int	double
it will return double and you can cast it to int

2855720
int	double
this is a double but you can cast it to an int if you want

2855735
ocaml	sml
i seem to remember being able to do this in sml and ocaml and furthermore isn t this a pretty standard thing to do when creating an abstract datatype

2855769
firefox	safari
the usual recommendations for a web development and debugging web browser are firefox firebug or safari web inspector

2855783
sorting	grouping
may definitely need some improvements in light of the large number of grouping sorting going on

2855805
fadein	hide	hide	show
i ve got a polaroid gallery in the header with only 5 100x100 images in it test preloading has no effect on performance and my gallery will show or hide them fadein fade-out after a period of time

2855805
google-chrome	firefox
almost forgot to mention it firefox and google-chrome perform pretty good

2855818
free	malloc
for basic leak detection you just need to hook into low level memory allocation routines by patching malloc free

2855823
free	malloc
for instance they replace every call to malloc and free with their own functions which allows them to follow every allocation

2855841
width	height
place it in an html file with an img tag then resize it to width 160 but do not set the height setting and are on firefox you will see an ugly black line under the image

2855841
ubuntu	linux
note i m using ff 3.6.3 on ubuntu linux 8.04 lts if that matters.

2855841
width	height
note i don t want to set height because then the image would look funny when all i want to do is change the width so that fits nicely in a column of amazon products

2855850
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

2855858
opera	google-chrome
i do it because only opera and google-chrome smooth resize large images to tiny sizes

2855955
try-catch	exception-handling
each exception-handling is caught only when inside a try-catch block

2855994
put	get	post	put	post	get
of course due to web browser support only get and post requests have really been adopted because post does all that put does it s just not designed for idempotent requests

2855998
onresize	onload
in order to do that during the onload event i attach some js function to the onresize window event

2856000
uiview	subviews
create a custom uiview subclass containing say three uilabel elements as subviews

2856009
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox not ok

2856055
maven	pom.xml
now we have resource processing with maven and there are some additional maven tasks defined in our pom.xml when building the webapp

2856082
maven	pom.xml
to read in a maven pom.xml and get the model

2856147
multiplying	add
if you want to accelerate the movement of the image depending on the measurement of the accelerometer multiplying some pixel constant for the axis measurement and add it to the x and y of the frame of the image

2856156
int	chars
second taking chars int arguments initialized by initialization list

2856160
superclass	subclassing
no the superclass has no way of telling the name type of a subclassing

2856170
inherited	properties
add 3 navigational properties to object all linking to one of the inherited entities options accessories and standaard_equipment

2856175
range	minimum
the range denoted by max-min should be the minimum possible value

2856225
boost	stl
you will have access to mfc owl stl boost whatever

2856225
getter	setter
in your example your getter should be declared const and your setter should have their arguments passed in as const and const -reference for the arrays

2856252
processors	hyperthreading
on a single processors with hyperthreading two virtual processors then the answer becomes maybe

2856319
children	parent
i d propose to rewrite the trienode struct and accessing methods to use indices instead of pointers for the parent and children fields

2856319
serializable	deserialization
serializable and deserialization would then just mean to save load the nsdata object endianess issues aside

2856356
jobs	cron
i want to make such system which will be storing one telnet connection per switch and every script web interface cron jobs etc. will have access to it

2856356
jobs	cron
but this option is interesting because interface is using only by couple of operators and cron jobs

2856409
preorder	inorder	preorder	postorder	postorder	inorder
i have a red black tree and the basic operations insert delete traversing inorder postorder and preorder etc

2856465
children	parent
for instance if the cookie was specified in a subdirectory you may not be able to delete it from either the parent or children directories or both

2856501
folder	directory
for raw files you should consider creating a raw folder inside res directory and then call getresources .openrawresource resourcename from your activity

2856502
google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome and ie but not on firefox

2856561
ubuntu	linux
for instance on my system ubuntu linux with sun jvm 1.6.0_20 as packaged by ubuntu the default policy file is in etc java-6-sun security java.security and contains among others the following lines

2856573
onfocus	onblur
i m trying to write unobtrusive default placeholder text in input actually relatively placed label over input which hides on onfocus and stays hidden if input isn t empty on onblur but i don t want to use jquery because this is the only javascript used on page - therefore using jquery seems a bit over the top

2856591
onfocus	onblur
you will need to manually attach the onfocus and onblur events having got a handle on the input with getelementbyid

2856593
octree	quadtree
both things achievable if you use some kind of space partition such as octree or quadtree

2856593
octree	quadtree
quadtree is better for big open spaces and octree is better for in-door spaces with many levels

2856614
versioning	upgrade
we made such upgrade from vs2008 to vs2010 without the tfs migration so it s still in 2008 versioning

2856618
setinterval	settimeout
there is no substitute for setinterval settimeout - these are the only ways of timing events in browser based ecmascript

2856618
setinterval	settimeout
by the way do not use a literal as the first argument to settimeout setinterval use a function reference

2856628
rsa	aes
in practice when encrypting some data which may be larger than the maximum rsa input size hybrid encryption is used what is rsa-encrypted is a random symmetric key a bunch of 16 uniformly random bytes and that key is used to symmetrically encrypt with aes the actual data

free	malloc
don t forget to release everything and free malloc d memory when you re done

2856713
vsto	add-in
i am using vsto to create an excel add-in

2856822
width	height
i have a set width and height image lets say height 160px

2856846
min	max
this value refers to the minimal max - min distance which can be achived using the elements that are predecessors successors of current element in the sequence

2856846
min	max
and we want those elements to be the best in terms of max - min distance

2856850
post	get
upd if you want to post the form then get the response as a json object and do another ajax call

2856850
post	get
you will be able to post your form using an ajax call then get the response and run some js when it will return

2856876
serializable	deserialization
accessing a database directly always means composing query strings often sending them to a db server sometimes even over the network db lookup serializable of the results sending back deserialization and traversing the fetched results

2856880
outputstream	inputstream
if you re using implementations of inputstream and outputstream they work on a byte-by-byte level so you should end up with a binary-equal output

2856901
hide	show
by using media print rules in the css you can tell the browser to hide the page that the user is seeing in the browser by including it in a big div and adding a display none to the print rule and show the hidden div

2856901
hide	show
the nice thing of this solution is that you can play with both divs via javascript for example you could add buttons to show hide the print div etc

2856907
crypt	salt
it also means that pre-crypted dictionaries for attacks have to be much larger since they have to crypt every possible password with every possible salt

2856972
cassini	iis
we ve been running vs2008 configured on our local pcs to use iis instead of the default server cassini

2856996
pull	push
i push my working copy and pull this data on a production machine

2857004
implements	extends
may be you create your own testcase which extends from dbtestcase and implements getdataset method

2857009
folder	directory
i am studying a websites code and have the entire directory structure in my local root folder

2857062
move	drag
i m trying to let users visually move around component placeholders inside a tinymce editor however i can only seem to get drag and drop working with divs in internet explorer

2857062
google-chrome	firefox
even dragging simple text around seems buggy in firefox and google-chrome

2857072
addition	multiplication
it will save you an addition and may be a multiplication or a shift..

2857075
button	checkbox
that is because there s a default action associated with elements like links checkbox radio button etc

2857083
maven	pom.xml
i m not familiar enough with the maven libraries themselves to know how to generate an effective pom.xml natively without starting maven in another process although i can t imagine that not being possible

2857087
boost	stl
those libraries like stl and boost are complex also because they need to solve every need and work on any plateform

2857088
cassini	iis
then change the debugging options of your real project back to using cassini rather than iis

2857119
folder	directory
created virtual directory child folder of root - named devbunk with these settings anonymous access directory browsing

2857157
stdout	stderr
i working on a c++ string library that have main 4 classes that deals with ascii utf8 utf16 utf32 strings every class has print function that format an input string and print the result to stdout or stderr

2857166
post	get
i ve tried post and get but i think i may have been doing something wrong with both

2857168
integer	unsigned
65536 is significant as its 1 more than the maximum value that can be stored in a 16bit unsigned integer

2857170
nsurl	nsstring
i m looking for a did finish or finish thing in nsurl - nsstring initwithcontentsofurl

2857173
glassfish	weblogic
tomcat is not an ejb container therefore you should use full blown javaee 6 server for that such as glassfish websphere weblogic etc.

2857191
put	get
ejb is only a story apart since you can t just add some jars to get that to work but in fact yes you can put an ejb container on top of tomcat too if you modify the server core

2857229
listview	gridview
instead of the datagrid you can use the listview with listview.view set to a gridview

2857232
superclass	subclassing
subclassing it call through to the superclass methods to do their usual work but multiply all the return values by speed as appropriate

2857268
jdom	dom4j
if your html happens to be xhtml then one thing you can try is to put it into an xml parser such as jdom or dom4j which usually has some pretty-print option

2857276
portrait	landscape
for example i often use separate views for each portrait and landscape view

2857282
pull	push
so we push an xml to a initatorqueue and then had a service pull them from the queue extract some necessary attributes via xpath and insert them into a persistence table in our database

2857283
cpu	hyperthreading
however one for cpu resources is a bad move - your cpu may have up to six cores plus hyperthreading in a retail cpu and most cpus will have two or more

2857323
put	get	post	put	post	get
we can manipulate that object using its uri and http actions post get put and delete

2857372
post	get
thanks to luvieere in this post for showing me how to get the keyboard

2857406
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview with several subviews one uiimageview and a couple of uiview

2857480
getter	setter
however if you want to maintain a uniform syntax making all the constants accessible in the same way then you could use a class with properties attributes which call getter and setter functions

2857496
portrait	landscape
you ve probably already found the answer but for posterity see preserve html font-size when iphone orientation changes from portrait to landscape

2857517
sqldatasource	linqdatasource
if you are using a datasource control sqldatasource linqdatasource etc this would be done automatically retrieving only the current page of data

2857545
multiplying	add
multiplying that value by your speed-up factor and add it to a separate game-time counter

2857552
ienumerable	ilist
however the problem i describe above makes me think i should be performing all my filtering within the repositories and returning ienumerable ilist or single classes

2857564
stateless	stateful
sorry if i had not explained more quartz is good for stateless jobs and also for some stateful jobs but the key for me is very stateful persisted job instances not just jobs or tasks

2857692
firefox	safari
on ie7 firefox 3.6 safari 4.0.4

2857721
width	height
i d say width height is overwhelmingly more common

2857724
width	height
i donâ t know if there is a convention elsewhere but personally i always use the convention used by graphics usually even outside of computing in photography width before height

2857726
width	height
i don t know a huge number of languages but what i have used go with width height

2857731
width	height
the width height seems to be more common all around

2857809
stdout	stderr
stdout and stderr use c locale

2857844
children	parent
the sliding of cells should be visible and if the user taps - button of the already expanded row the children cells should slide back into the parent

2857853
ready	each
the ear references both other projects and pom files are ready and working in each project

2857853
maven	pom.xml
the ejb uses an external jar jbpm the dependency is correctly specified in pom.xml and it appears in the maven dependencies user lib definition and i have no compilation errors

2857928
vsto	add-in
power users who create macros and add-in with vba seem not to be the the target audience for vsto

2857928
vsto	add-in
if you are interested in add-in for excel the native .xll add-in have some specific advantages over vsto in particular they support creating high-performance user-defined functions

2857928
vsto	add-in
contrary to what omegaman says these .xll-based add-in do not work through the automation add-in interfaces support excel versions from 97 to excel 2010 and allow advanced features that vsto does not support like registration-free ribbon and rtd support

2857998
mouseout	mouseenter
when they hover over mouseenter it i use jquery to fade it in and slidedown the content and the reverse on mouseout

2858009
setinterval	settimeout
you will have to resort to braking up your function into bits and schedule these using settimeout or setinterval

2858013
mouseleave	mouseenter
you should also probably use hover instead of mouseenter mouseleave

2858020
nsbutton	nsbox
i have an nscollectionview and the view is an nsbox with a label and an nsbutton

2858058
width	height
so lets assume we have an element e and it has a height of 200 and a width of 300

2858058
width	height
to its x and y properties or grow and shrink the rectangle by modifying its width and height properties

2858058
google-chrome	safari
if you want to implement your own rectangle class note that at least with safari and google-chrome if you implement tostring to return the results of the tocssrect method you can just assign the rectangle to the clip property of an elements style object- for sake of illustration consider the object literal below

2858095
inherited	properties
edit another way to work around the issue is to inherited from stringwriter and override the encoding properties to return the encoding you like utf8 in your case

2858096
put	get
pickling lets you put and get back several items one after the other so obviously it must be a self-terminating serialization format

2858100
put	get
uniform interface use standard methods like get put

2858104
vim	emacs
mostly for ide s but also for vim and emacs

2858122
integer	radix
you could use integer s tostring int i int radix method for that

2858124
awt	swing
as synic points out the android os does not provide swing awt for instance

2858153
filewriter	bufferedwriter
every time you got the line containing your text you are creating bufferedwriter new filewriter out true

2858188
width	height
this returns a copy of the image scaled according to the width and height you require it to be

2858193
put	get
i won t get a warning on the method name getresult only if i put it in a string

2858210
google-chrome	firefox
it is still working nearly fine for ie 7 ie 8 firefox and google-chrome

2858241
int	chars
if you re looking for the ascii chars code you can just cast the chars to an int as long as they are ascii chars only

2858263
ubuntu	linux
i have the pid for the process and the name i want to bring it to the front on linux ubuntu

2858278
getter	setter
after numerous attempts at setting up custom getter and setter in maplocation.h and .m i boiled it down to where i can t even copy the obligatory getter title rename it to title2 and try to get its return value

2858282
openssl	m2crypto
currently i m using openssl binary to generate response but this seems ugly to me that s why i m trying to figure out how to make response token with m2crypto

2858329
google-chrome	firefox
warning in ie6 7 at least and possibly ie8 but not firefox google-chrome etc onbeforeunload and onunload are triggered when anchors javascript links are clicked on

2858329
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
msdn is as good a source as any considering it s non-standard and that firefox google-chrome safari seems to largely have copied the implementation from ie.

2858341
width	height
moreover you don t know the exact width and height of the content div nor do you know them as a percentage of the viewport

2858341
put	get
when i solved this i put ie into quirks mode to get the border-box box model see also w3c spec

2858341
width	height
this way you can let the jscript engine calculate the correct values of width and height added between conditional comments

2858365
width	height
edit this will also animate the height and width in addition to the opacity

2858375
int	chars
if your int value uses more than one chars and includes the sign as you mention then it is more complex

2858404
width	height
i just inspected some of the code generated by gwt from my uibinders in firebug and g htmlpanel isn t adding any width or height styling

2858421
post	get
it is bad practise to perform a delete operation via get request so i have implemented a delete post as asp.net mvc does only support post + get requests as far as i know

2858462
explode	implode
php explode string string implode string array

2858478
put	get	post	put	post	get
asp.net mvc supports all the verbs get post put delete - the problem comes from most browsers that only support get and post

2858483
int	double
however at a certain point in my algorithm i need to divide a standard double value by an int value and than do a to a log-based value

2858483
division	subtraction
my question whether it would be faster to first convert the denominator to a log-based value which would replace the floating-point division with floating-point subtraction yielding the following chain of operations twice log floating-point subtraction floating-point summation

2858486
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
it sounds like you may be looking for a dictionary version of observablecollection see msdn which implements both inotifycollectionchanged and inotifypropertychanged out of the box

2858490
ant	maven
have a look at ant maven gradle

2858512
width	height
there are a few jquery methods for calculating height and width

2858539
button	checkbox
start- settings- control panel- system- advanced- performance- settings under this i have tried all the different radio button and a variety of combinations of the checkbox

2858544
cpython	ironpython
however it s unlikely that ironpython will ever allow access to bytes underlying storage unless cpython does as it s not safe

2858548
wav	riff
the wav is actually a riff format which means they can contain all kinds of different data and the header isn t necessarily at the beginning

2858606
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome don t having problems keeping up

2858606
google-chrome	firefox
it would be tempting to look for faults in server-side and or ajax bits except for the fact that firefox google-chrome work perfectly

2858606
google-chrome	firefox
again...fine for firefox and google-chrome

2858624
post	get
i realize that this thread is over a year old but i wanted to post a solution i found in case anyone is wrestling with trying to get data out of the system.object returned using the cook computing xml-rpc library

2858628
comparator	comparable
consider the following attempt of a generic method that takes a comparable and return a comparator for it that puts null as the minimum element

2858699
put	get
appreciate a determined hacker will get what they want -- i want to at least put up some resistance if i can

2858725
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
as we all know in inherited superclass objects are created initialized prior to subclassing objects

2858725
superclass	subclassing
so if we create an object of subclassing it will contain all the superclass information

2858735
post	get
i can t get too specific without any info on your js framework post get etc

2858741
put	get	post	put	post	get
the current rails restful architecture relies on the four http verbs get post put delete

2858741
post	put
if not any opinions about the best strategy to support the options method since it has to support the routes for all the post put delete methods

2858753
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
edit you re right in that ef doesn t support inotifycollectionchanged but as far as i know it does support inotifypropertychanged and from the looks of it microsoft is thinking of implementing inotifycollectionchanged in a future release

2858754
boost	stl
also if you combine boost bind with stl sequence algorithms you can make all kinds of fun stuff see here

2858778
mouseleave	mouseenter
if you move the mouse outside of the #dropdown div and then back in again quickly it constantly fires the mouseenter and mouseleave events causing a never ending cycle of flickering

2858799
comparator	comparable
note this is a spin-off from comparable and comparator contract with regards to null

2858827
post	get
it is very good for crud pages and has built in http methods to post get edits updates

2858840
eurekalog	madexcept
a better course of action is to use an exception-logging tool like madexcept eurekalog or jcldebug that records information about the exception and gives your customers the option of sending the reports back to you so you can reproduce the conditions of the error and fix it

2858873
hash	md5
i set a cookie in the headers with an md5 hash keyword

2858895
accessor	properties
you can change the properties to return a bool but you need to then write the accessor methods by hand and they are a bit different than what dave has in his response

2858895
accessor	properties
then in your implementation file instead of declaring a dynamic properties create the accessor directly

2858925
onclick	onfocus
and then onclick or onfocus or whatever the text dissappears and you can type into the textbox

2858971
onfocus	onblur
that s not blurred text it s called a watermark. you can create the same effect by using inline onfocus and onblur statements on your input

2859023
profiling	debugging
so in summary i believe that my original problem not being able to debugging after renewing my dev profiling and the problem that resulted from all my efforts to fix the first were caused by

2859028
multiplying	multiplication
suppose we re trying to get from 1 to 12 by multiplication and the cost between nodes is the number you have to multiplying by

2859030
google-chrome	firefox
no support google-chrome 6.0 ie 8 firefox 3.6

2859030
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
google-chrome firefox and opera score well on overall html5 support

2859045
public	protected
upstream public or protected

2859086
margin	text-align
have css text-align center for the div and margin auto for the image then it should be centered within the div

2859112
width	height
using js - move the window to 0 0 make the width the same as the screen width make the height same height as the page

2859122
uploadify	plupload
ok after a whole day of trying to get this to work i ve abandoned uploadify and am now using plupload which seems much better

2859130
ironruby	ironpython
other option consist in using a dynamic language in the dlr such as ironpython and ironruby

2859131
geocoding	geocode
the google maps api geocoding provides a direct way to access a geocode via an http request

2859173
google-chrome	safari
when webkit safari google-chrome encounters an inline-block where.

2859173
opera	firefox
firefox 3.6 opera 10.53 and ie7+ treat these inline-blocks like inline elements and vertical align works as expected

2859194
int	chars
for example the very first column is defined as a chars field with a length of 2 bytes but the field contains a 16-bit int

2859213
int	chars
but it just for adding 0 chars before int

2859222
notepad++	textpad
i m not a regex guy but lots of programs allow you to search text based on regex notepad++ textpad plenty of others i bet maybe you could do something like this

2859250
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the code above only selects the 2nd instance of divmaptab but in ie it selects them both

2859306
children	parent
your children will need to register with their parent object somehow

2859306
children	parent
note that this does not take into account the possibility that children will be destroyed by any means other than destroying their parent

2859311
children	parent
deleting a parent will in turn delete all children

2859330
onreadystatechange	onload
when i have to dynamically insert a jquery script tag to meet the requirments of the bookmarklet i want to wait for the onload or onreadystatechange event on the script tag before executing any function that requires jquery

2859330
onreadystatechange	onload
for some reason the onload and or onreadystatechange events do not fire

2859364
opera	firefox
it didn t disable the form at all in opera and firefox

2859501
mapquest	directions
here i am iterating through an array of nsdictionary objects inside the parsed json response of the excellent mapquest directions api

2859516
portrait	landscape
however if i put my ipad flat on the table even though my homepage is in landscape orientation it launches in portrait orientation

2859587
opera	firefox
edit my suggested solution wont work because it doesn t matter which key the user pressed del or period i always get . as char at least on opera and firefox

2859670
super	extends
or is that super instead of extends .

2859737
icefaces	openfaces
ajax support many 3rd-party libraries myfaces icefaces openfaces anotherprefixfaces... have strong ajax support and it works pretty well

2859737
post	get
with stripes you can use whatever latest and greatest jquery has to offer and as long as you send the right get or post to the server stripes knows what to do with it and can easily send json back

2859744
inherited	properties
to specify the unitycontainer in xaml and get automatic configuration just create an inherited attached properties unityhelper.container whose propertychangedcallback simply calls buildup on the specified container and passes in the object s type and the object

2859760
matplotlib	scipy
for those of you just starting scipy matplotlib i found this helpful in finding info about my installation as i m currently using it.

2859771
google-chrome	safari
when printing the page below in safari google-chrome the content everything on the page basically is squished into the left side of the page at about 60 of the page s width

2859771
google-chrome	safari
important to make sure they re applying and safari google-chrome still won t print out the full width

2859821
iboutlet	ibaction
create and hookup the button to its relevant iboutlet submitbutton and ibaction submitaction in ib

2859859
onreadystatechange	onload
you could always cheat and put your onload onreadystatechange logic into a settimeout specifying a duration of 1 ms

2859870
lifting	unfold
unfortunately at this point we re kind of stuck because to my knowledge there s no monadic unfold and lifting it is like takewhile not trivial

2859891
public	protected
with respect to normal data non-static members are required to be arranged in ascending order as long as there isn t an intervening access specificer public protected or private

2859924
google-chrome	firefox
its working in good on firefox but in google-chrome it working in one page but not in the home page i don t know why.

2859938
width	height
then to have a label to have a variable multiline height but a fixed width just

2859941
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately internet explorer supports the tag which firefox google-chrome safari etc support the tag

2859960
put	get
just get the identifier of the static block then put this code in your template

2859970
cos	sqrt
cos theta 56 + 0 + 0 + 1 sqrt 64 + 49 sqrt 1 +1

2860011
fastcgi	scgi	apache	lighttpd
if you want to run multiple go web applications on the same server you could use apache or lighttpd as the gateway and use a protocol like fastcgi or scgi to serve requests

2860036
hex	binary
an int is neither binary hex or decimal it s just a place to store a number

2860036
hex	binary
variables themselves don t have a specific hex dec binary representation until you print them

2860070
mouse	keyboard
those users who can only navigate with a keyboard or assistive device like a screen reader will not be able to escape...because they don t cant t use a mouse

2860081
google-chrome	firefox
all the pages works on firefox and ie but when i enter on the site with google-chrome it loads only the index page and the others don t work at all - i receive a 404 error

2860082
post	get
this is just a few lines of really simple understandable reliable code that you could have written and rewritten 3 times in the amount of time it takes you to post and get a response to the re version

2860090
int	boolean	int	double
say that class a is string and class b is int or double boolean et c

2860096
typedef	typename
by the way typename is necessary in the typedef because value_type is a so-called dependent type it depends on the nature of a template argument and the c++ compiler cannot figure out on its own that it refers to a type name rather than say a static method or variable in this context

2860103
subshell	ifs
put a subshell around it if you don t want to set ifs permanently

2860109
mouseleave	mouseenter
hover just saves you from having to do both a mouseenter and a mouseleave by doing both in one function

2860133
mouseleave	mouseenter
they re the same except hover handles both mouseenter and mouseleave

2860139
mouseleave	mouseenter
well .hover binds two handlers for the events mouseenter and mouseleave so it is a more convenient way and also easier to understand the purpose

2860139
mouseover	mouseenter
mouseenter differs from mouseover so far as mouseenter is not fired if the cursor is over enters a child element of the element the handler is bound to

2860139
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout
furthermore mouseover and mouseout are real javascript events whereas mouseenter and mouseleave are events provided by jquery afaik

2860171
keydown	keyup
in this case maybe sendmessage with keydown keypress keyup three calls might work better

2860191
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
so i take it out and it works on safari google-chrome but not firefox 3.5.x but validates fine

2860230
width	height
getwidth and getheight returns the width and height of the component

2860230
width	height
i ve never heard of any difference between actual width height and screen width height

2860246
children	parent
another gotcha is that you must make sure that an instance cannot be a child of more than one parent or else destroying a parent could also destroy children belonging to another parent

2860299
put	get
if you put xml data into a core data store and hook up your table view to an nsfetchedresultscontroller and its delegate methods you can get your table to update itself continuously with very little code

2860314
postgresql	mysql
knowing sql and the use of a db such as mysql postgresql was great till the advent of nosql and non-relational databases

2860365
16-bit	64bit
for example compilation of some code for 32 or 64bit processors might entail greater overhead than one would see for an old 8-bit or 16-bit architecture

2860386
stdout	stderr
stdout stdin stderr

2860426
mouseover	mouseout
about all you can do would be to listen for mouseover mouseout on a block containing the flash and if the current window loses focus in between the mouse entering and leaving make a guess that the user clicked the banner and popped up a new window

2860483
versioning	upgrade
for both devices a firmware upgrade to the latest versioning of os 5.0 fixed the problem

2860493
trie	tree
this problem can be solved by trie or prefix tree

2860493
trie	tree
will be turned into a trie tree where denotes the root of the tree

2860505
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
to populate the properties of your class from sql or mysql or oracle etc. you need to create a sqlconnection a sqlcommand and a sqldatareader

2860571
int	double
never store money values in a double or float - use an int or long as there is no way to store 0.1 accurately in binary

2860579
post	put
one way to do this is to formulate your put post requests such that you can either give the actual data or give the url of the resource possibly with the option to make a hard or symbolic link

2861311
quicksort	mergesort
also in practice with both algorithms modified to sort short sublists with a special-purpose sort mergesort can be a close competitor to the modified quicksort used in the c c++ standard libraries

2861311
mergesort	in-place	quicksort	mergesort
edit unlike in-place sorts like quicksort and insertion sort mergesort requires auxiliary memory and is simplest to implement by copying rather than swapping

width	height
looking at the jquery 1.4.2 and 1.3.2 source code it actually performs this automatically when you call width or height on a hidden element

profiling	instrumentation
with instrumentation the profiling will show you data for any binaries you instrumentation as well as one level of callees if you call string.concat directly from your instrumented binary the profiling will show you how many times you called it and how long in aggregate the calls took

2862094
profiling	instrumentation
the profiling will not show you data for binaries that you don t instrumentation

2862094
profiling	instrumentation
instrumentation should succeed and you should get trace profiling data for your gadget

2862097
udp	tcp
unfortunately if the protocol is udp this means the rest of the datagram is lost -- part of why udp is called an unreliable protocol i know that there are reliable datagram protocols but they aren t very popular -- i couldn t name one in the tcp ip family despite knowing the latter pretty well

2862174
put	get
in thinking of this then there may be one case where you may get a concurrent modification in such a map that you would not get in another kind of map - if you put a key that already exists or call a getter method

2862176
udp	tcp
the answers to these questions vary depending on whether you are using a stream socket sock_stream or a datagram socket sock_dgram - within tcp ip the former corresponds to tcp and the latter to udp

post	get
the page seems to call a post method on a link but sniffing the packets what i saw was a get apparently using a session generated using the info i send

2862269
udp	tcp
i am assuming you are communicating in udp because incoming buffer size does not bring problem to tcp communication

that should let you change between selecting and editing at the appropriate times with both the keyboard and the mouse

2862424
for-loop	loops
i would use a for-loop iterating over the contents of a file that lists the class names to be created and in the body of loops echo the template to the newly created file using the value from the file to both name the .java as well as to fill in the classname in the template

2862595
width	height
add the map to the uiview with autoresizing of flexible width and height

2862598
hash	salt
the fact that passwords are sent as text is not important as they are secured by the ssl connection however if you are unhappy with that you can hash the password with salt and then pass that to the server and match the stored hash you have in the database thats pretty much as secure as you can get i d reccommend a sha-2 based hash

2862658
int	double
the reason you re getting the ambiguous overload error is that you have operator+ variants that can add two complex or a complex and a double but you re trying to add a complex and an int

2862658
int	double
the compiler can t decide if its better to convert the int to complex to use the first or to double and use the second

2863369
hash	salt
you need to use the same salt for hashing or you will get different hash

2863369
hash	salt
that is to say you need store the salt into the database along with the password and reuse it to hash when the user tries to login later

2863369
hash	salt
you generate a new random salt and use it to hash the plain text

2863369

2863928
put	get	post	put	post	get
i m certainly no expert but if you rethink your resources and think of them more strictly as nouns or at least lists of data it might be easier to fit any desired action into get post put and delete

2863928
post	get
presumably you d access that homebase resource mainly through get and post if there s anything there to update which i wouldn t expect on a home-base or dashboard since it s an aggregate resource

2863928
put	get	post	put	post	get
from that resource you can have get to read show and list whatever data you need including optional query parameters passed as the body of the get request post to update put to create and delete to delete

2863953

my desired solution would be to convert the string to an integer representation of radix 37 convert the radix to 62 and use the second alphabet to write out that number

2863968

post put delete from the homepage were directed to the specific resources as usual

2863982
superclass	subclassing
can anyone please guide me on how to avoid overriding of superclass methods in subclassing in objective-c like the final concept in java

as flo mentioned - if you keep the assembly versioning the same but change the assemblyfileversion then you can upgrade the assemblies in your wsp solution using

2864240
winhttp	libcurl
if you want more control over the get request like setting or altering the http headers then you have to use one of the platform dependent libraries wininet winhttp on windows or libcurl on linux osx

2864275
x86	64bit
if you re running on a 64bit machine make sure the build is set to any cpu rather than x86

2864275
x86	64bit
the default for new projects changed in vs2010 from any cpu to x86 - i believe this was to make edit and continue work by default on 64bit machines as it only supports x86

2864275
x86	64bit
running an x86 process on a 64bit machine is obviously somewhat suboptimal

2864339
hide	show
in normal circumstances the div containing the mega menu options would sit inside the li item that fires the show hide but this is currently not possible as the ul list of navigation links is rendered using a 3rd party piece of software which does not provide an equivalent of an onitemdatabound event for me to be able to inject the div into the item

if this first issue is sorted out then no addition or subtraction can introduce any rounding errors

2864399
division	multiplication
the second issue after you are able to store and retrieve data without loss of information are expected rounding errors due to division or multiplication by non integer

2864399

haskell	ocaml
probably 2 or 3 years ago ocaml led the field in practical functional languages but since then haskell has overtaken it with more libraries more features better performance and wider commercial use

2864472
spaces	delimiter
you could parse the file with the csv module using spaces as a delimiter

2864474

basically i m trying to figure out how to do in firefox what page actions are in google-chrome

2864543
uiview	subviews
uiview subviews nibobjects objectatindex 0 viewwithtag 300

2864547
implements	extends
the simplest way of avoiding lazyinitialization exception is perhaps to use dtos and have each service implements two interfaces one extends the other one that only contains method returning dtos and the other only methods returning objects of your model

2864562
gmail	hotmail
this therefore pushing down content within table cells i.e hotmail in firefox gmail in ie and firefox

2864571

superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
say i had a class superclass and two subclassing subclassa and subclassb that inherited from superclass

2864595
superclass	subclassing
that way it is convenient because i can get somelist.size in superclass and have typesafety in the subclassing

2864600
superclass	subclassing
for one thing any method of superclass sees the superclass list not that of the subclassing

2864600
superclass	subclassing
what you actually get is the size of the list in superclass not that of the subclassing

2864600
superclass	subclassing
the superclass list may be empty while the subclassing list contains elements or vice versa

2864614
dictionary	map
of course you simply use a dictionary to map the id to the item

2864619
superclass	subclassing
you re declaring a second variable - so code in the superclass will use one variable and code in the subclassing will use another

2864652
inherited	properties
the properties is inherited from uiscrollview and it specifies where the content of the scrollview as tableview is a scrollview should stay related to scroll s bounds

2864655
width	height
hey guys i am working on an iphone project where i need to change the width and height of a uiimageview dynamically

2864691
maven	pom.xml
this in turn guarantees that the aaa projects pom.xml is available in the local maven repository and the bbb-aaa-specific bamboo build may then use it as a dependency

2864693
dictionary	map
you could always map the enum to strings in a and then implement your method by looking up the correct string in the dictionary based on the enum key

2864727
dictionary	map
so if you want to map an enum to string you could use as just mentioned a dictionary

2864770
vbscript	jscript
i think instead of a bat file you should use a vbscript jscript file

2864775

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
below is my code it works as expected in ie google-chrome and safari but it doesn t work well in firefox

2864950
debian	linux
it appears to be a known linker loader bug at least to debian arch linux developers

2864956
sorting	filtering
its very view-oriented so it has powerful sorting filtering or searching features but creates some overhead and is not optimized for performance

2865017
width	height
here i have to validate the height and width of the image in client side

2865056
children	parent
if you load parent and you have set lazy false on its child set property then all of its children will be loaded from db which can affect the performance

2865060
uiview	subviews
i have also created a uiview which is a subviews and placed with a background image and two uibuttons on them

2865063
width	height
you can do this on browsers that support the new file api from the w3c using the readasdataurl function on the filereader interface and assigning the data url to the src of an img after which you can read the height and width of the image

2865063
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
currently firefox 3.6 supports the file api and i think google-chrome and safari either already do or are about to

2865082
getter	setter
i think the most important question is does the compiler know the method you call is a getter or setter

2865092
getter	setter
then i use the getter setter to make clear its not a member of the extending class

2865098
disk	ram
given that the data would most likely be too large to all sit in ram on the print server it makes sense to use sftp to transfer the pdfs so they can be grabbed from disk as they are printed

2865099
width	height
just multiply each of your pre-warped corner values in homogeneous format 0 0 0 1 width 0 0 1 0 height 0 1 width height 0 1 by the perspective matrix to get the transformed coordinates

2865100
getter	setter
in most cases they will be optimized to the same code but the point of using setter getter is to avoid changin api in case of change of implementation

2865100
getter	setter
edit of course outside class it shoudl be protected by getter setter as you may change internal representation and you can provide backward-compatibility by reimplementing them in terms of new state representation

2865162
getter	setter
there will only be a difference if the getter setter does something extra

2865166
hide	show
show the table and hide the loading div

2865188
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu debian distros have the start-stop-daemon tool which is for the same purpose you describe

2865193
getter	setter
i generally prefer to still go through the setter getter even when accessing the class internally

2865193
getter	setter
if it is way too inconvenient to use the setter getter num ++ vs setnumber getnumber + 1 as someone else pointed out

2865269
hide	show
problem once it get hide then the show is not working

2865289
post	get
well you see what i do is transferring the get params into post params

2865309
put	get
put your cursor at the top of the file hold down alt and alternate between page down to get to the next style issue and enter to bring up the smart tag to make the change

2865350
getter	setter
getter setter are nice in that they often may do slightly more than act as the interface to a private field

2865350
getter	setter
this is of course silly from the context of a getter setter but is something to avoid doing

2865350
getter	setter
i ve also heard of code that performs most of what it s meant to do in getter setter having no real methods

2865364
svg	vml
if extjs charts are not enough for you you can try highcharts which uses canvas svg or vml for rendering

2865407
next	except
everything works well except that i cannot find a way to mimic the f3 - find next behaviour as in notepad

2865410

post	get
you can use get instead if the destination accepts either post or get

2865557
post	get
receive get arguments and post them with curl or any decent http client to second site then transfer result to browser

2865557
post	get
application logic should need little adjustement on this part if domain 2 app expects to get post data in the same request as visitor is coming it won t do it

2865569
super	extends
but you can define a generic super interface and let your actual service interface extends it with parameters

2865597
folder	directory
try adding the src test resources directory as a source folder in your eclipse project

2865638
inherited	properties
you could inherited from this user control in order to add fields to it but as the child controls will share properties and behaviour they should inherited from a common parent

monodevelop	sharpdevelop
sharpdevelop and monodevelop both have good support for boo

geocoding	geocode
i believe that the google geocode is a great tool for when you give it a full address in at least a street locality country format and it is also very reliable in other formats when it doesn t have to deal with any ambiguities geocoding london uk always worked for me

2866510
innodb	myisam
for example no matter what order you insert into innodb it will always default order on the primary key which is different behavior than myisam

2866515
post	get
if you re trying to get just one post it would be cleaner to use the find_by helper or find first or just first instead

2866563
nunit	mstest
ps pet-peeve #1 managers or devs calling integration and system integration tests unit tests simply because nunit or mstest was used to automate it .

2866575
folder	directory
when you create a virtual directory with the same name and location as the folder it points to by default that doesn t really do anything

2866575

the example is about uploading but the principle is the same just use get instead of put

2866932
post	get
i d like a design for separating the two different bits of action code for the get and the post

2866936
mouseup	mousedown
however if i wanted to add a handler for all of the mousedown and mouseup events i d have to write two more methods

2866939
rss	feed
i want to get the real link digg points to not to the comments feed from rss

2866991
implements	extends
public class app extends activity implements onclicklistener

2867033
mouseup	mousedown
you could also write this using two calls adding handlers to mousedown in the first one and to mouseup in the second one

2867068
getter	setter
so you generally need not worry about performance costs associated with getter setter unless they are genuinely doing something extra which here they are not

2867068
getter	setter
do you want to redefine it in later classes and if so is the redefined setter getter correct or is the field access correct

2867089
mouseup	mousedown
if you have an event handler in your form s mousedown and mouseup you should just be able to attach to that like you already do in your

2867162
post	get
redirecting turns a post action into a get action which means that any post parameters initially sent are lost

2867175
rss	feed
rss is de-facto a name for syndication feed

long long int llround double

2867252
rss	feed
the other option if you are really keen to using the rss feed is to parse the digg links and then scrape the links off of that page -- but that is going to be less efficient and more prone to breaking

2867302
copying	overwrite
overwrite the empty filestream files with the real documents use move hard links to avoid copying data

add another callback after the fadeout to hide the div

2867437
flot	highcharts
we tried flot in the past but switched to highcharts after flot didn t meet our needs

2867438
width	height
you may need to use math.round or math.floor to force the width and height to be integers if the resizecanvas function doesn t handle that automatically

2867442
oncreate	setcontentview
i think the problem is that you didn t do setcontentview before loading the map outside oncreate

2867443
affinity	processors
however unfortunately you can t specify the processors affinity in java

2867472
rss	feed
one of its possible arguments is clean_title which you can parse from the link in the rss feed

2867615

i think this is a cassini issue that doesn t occur under iis

button	checkbox
resetting radio button and checkbox

2868647
versioning	upgrade
i haven t tried porting a setup from vs2008 to 2010 but having the same upgrade code for different build versioning will cause problems

2868647
versioning	upgrade
simple explanation is the msiexec installer fails when it tries to remove the old components because the older components have the same upgrade versioning as the newer components being installed

2868683
mp3	wav
convert wav to mp3 which i will probably leave to lame anyway

2868696

note that setting content-length together with content-disposition attachment might fail to work in safari and ie

2868771
qcolor	qtabbar
on the other hand you can set custom icon to draw attention or use void qtabbar settabtextcolor int index const qcolor color

2868787

since the bithack for min and max was already posted here is a different one

2868790

xna	slimdx
i realise there are numerous questions on here asking about choosing between xna and slimdx but these all relate to game programming

2868914
mouseover	mouseout
ppk has some excellent documentation on what is actually happening and why mouseout isn t doing what you think it should at that point technically you are mousing out of the layer when you mouseover its children which is a little odd conceptually

2868940
for-loop	loops
you should instead initialize plot objects outside of your for-loop and use the set command to update them within loops instead of just replotting them

2868949
xna	slimdx
i haven t used slimdx but based on my experience with xna and reading about slimdx s objective

2868949
xna	slimdx
also xna likes to pre-build it s resources into directx files .x if you re working with dynamic files i think slimdx is the best choice for you

2868967
glassfish	weblogic
i m working on a flex implementation currently using sdk 3.5 on weblogic 10.3 11g. we originally used glassfish v2.1.1 with zero issues there was an active directory group lookup bug but it did not hinder our progress. since transitioning to weblogic we have an issue where the flexsession is invalidated after logging in using j_security_check

2868981
strcpy	strncpy
finally please get in the habit of using strncpy over strcpy its much safer

2869008
for-loop	arrays
as codeholic alludes to you should never modify an arrays while iterating over it with a for-loop

2869088
ftp	telnet
the other options would be things like a proprietary socket solution hosting an ftp server on the device using the abhorrent imo ms-provided http server with isapi telnet or something along those lines

superclass	subclassing
either way this is pretty flexible for future reuse just subclassing another controller or divergence remove the superclass relationship and implement your situation-specific toolbar on the controller that has changed

2869127
bufferedreader	bytearrayinputstream
you need to wrap the in an bytearrayinputstream so that you can read them in an utf-8 encoded character stream using inputstreamreader wherein you specify the encoding and then use a bufferedreader to read it line by line

2869128
sequence	permutation
i d like to interpret the string as a metalanguage such that i can make lots of sequence out permutation from the lists

2869139
google-chrome	firefox
the images swap as expected in ie8 google-chrome and firefox

2869173
getter	setter
with the id annotation there is a difference if it is on the getter hibernate tries to get set all class members via their regular getter setter while if it is on the member variable hibernate will access all the member variables directly

2869174
getter	setter
very generally speaking if the entity has the standard getter setter which match the field names then there isn t much of a difference

2869204
width	height
after explicitly specifying the width and height in the stylesheet it s showing up now

2869212
webkit	gecko
i am assuming this is not a bug since it is the same in both webkit and gecko

2869222
super	abstract
i hope this question will not be rated as subjective because i thought that experienced programmers won t disagree about this kind of topic since the use of interfaces super classes abstract classes follows logical rules and is thereby not simply a personal choice

2869223
switching	screens
the messages are intended for fast user switching but the lock screens is implemented in windows as a system session

2869230
getter	setter
i prefer injecting via fields since i find it cumbersome to have to expose all properties via getter setter methods 7 lines vs 1 line when in 99.9 of the times they re going to work as simple variables and in any case i can switch the annotation style if when i need to write custom setter functionality anyway

2869231
getter	setter
it s not very common to have private getter setter so it s useful to be able to put annotation on the field

2869232
converter	multibinding
multibinding is not supported in sl and the converterparameter option is not bindable otherwise you could do something like source binding itemid converter ... converterparameter binding price - but as i said that s not possible

2869341
fadein	fadeout	google-chrome	firefox
i would say that it s because firefox and google-chrome probably correctly don t modify display css property while fadein fadeout

2869344
super	abstract
nobody agrees about the use of interfaces over super abstract classes

2869344
super	abstract
the main reason to use interfaces and super abstract classes is to enable polymorphism

2869348
implements	extends
i ask becuase it doesn t use implements runnable or extends thread .

2869354
disk	ram
both numbers were taken from a separately mounted partition in ram space and the number quoted was the number of bytes taken from the disk

2869356
fastcgi	scgi
there was another fastcgi like effort called scgi which demoed a simple scgi receiver in scheme called gambit

2869369
lisp	scheme
clojure is a lisp variant that s fairly close to scheme

2869442

google-chrome	firefox
elements defined inside the firefox extensions are part of the browser user interface google-chrome

2869468
accessor	properties
i tend to prefer and to use properties accessor

2869480
firefox	safari
i am not sure what the problem is because i put together the example below at jsfiddle and it works fine in both safari and firefox

2869483
expression-blend	silverlight
i have found the expression-blend gallery and i have found the silverlight dot net community samples

2869579
int	chars
you re using isdigit incorrectly here - it s used to test whether a chars is numeric or not - you can t use it to test an int

2869585
union	distinct
when i take these two result sets and then union them together which i have read several places should remove distinct values i get duplicates

2869637
quicksort	mergesort
multithreaded quicksort or mergesort

2869637
implements	extends
use implements runnable or extends

2869645
union	distinct
you need to create an equality comparer and use it in the union or distinct

2869646
dictionary	map
map the url of the image to the local path of the image in a dictionary

2869666
realloc	malloc
note that calling realloc with its first argument as null is identical to malloc

specifically the inflated imageview does not have the width height that i set for it via the android layout params in xml

2869749
width	height
i want to set the width height of the image in dp so that it is the correct size across multiple screen dpis and support android 1.5+

2869760

this post on so recommends some combination of removing and re-adding or cloning and re-adding the objects each time you show hide the tabs

2869771
vpn	lan
due to the 2 points below the vpn will actually be between the server and the office lan

2869806
atoi	strtod
you could also use cin.getline and atoi or strtod

2869817
oncreate	onstart
is it oncreate onstart or onresume

2869832
oncreate	onstart
in that case i imagine it would go through oncreate onstart onresume and then finally onactivityresult

2869839
opera	firefox
i believe that it is hard to say in general as i had a website on which 50 entries were from firefox and 49 from opera when ie at that point had over 75 of market

2869856
iboutlet	ibaction
forget iboutlet ibaction - they don t mean anything if you are not interface builder

2869909
folder	directory
i have a .py file in a directory which is inside the django project folder

2869920
fadein	fadeout
the solution also given in the blog would be to use fadeto instead of fadeout and fadein like this

2869977
google-chrome	safari
hy guys i ve a problem with iexplorer google-chrome safari etc

2869980
uilabel	uibutton
i created a custom uitableviewcell class with a uibutton a uiimage and two uilabel

works fine in safari and firefox

2870014
gridview	entitydatasource
gridview is backed by entitydatasource

2870069
vlookup	countif
you can combine countif with vlookup and if and that s much faster than using 2 lookups + isna

2870072
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
i am trying to retrieve the arpinstalllocation during the installation of a major upgrade versioning of the software

2870073
children	parent
edit if node2 is buried more deeply in the xml then you can iterate through all the tags check each parent tag to see if the node2 element is one of its children and the remove it if so

2870094
abstract-class	superclass
an abstract-class will be a superclass for your zombies

2870133
awt	swing
there are both awt and swing implementations

2870133
awt	swing
the awt doesn t support horizontal scrolling so i ll be using swing

2870156
awt	swing
you can get a graphics graphics2d instance from any awt swing component via the paint method

2870263
getter	setter
it ran fine for me however i needed to make some adjustments to the code you ve provided - i noticed that from your bubbles class you are trying to access ball s properties that are set as private radius color so either set them public or create the proper getter setter methods for that matter

2870263
getter	setter
or if you want to use getter setter functions

2870265
addclass	removeclass
instead of using the s why not manipulate the using addclass and removeclass

2870268
rss	feed
i have a desktop gadget that pulls rss feed from a website

2870270
nunit	mstest
your build server is ignoring your tests because mstest uses a different set of attributes to specify tests to what nunit uses

2870270
nunit	mstest
for example mstest uses and to specify a test fixtures and tests while nunit uses and

2870270
nunit	mstest
bear in mind that if your tests absolutely have to run on mstest and nunit you can decorate the tests with attributes for both frameworks and it will work to a certain degree anyway

2870302
min	max
as for b trees the min max heights depend on the branching factor chosen for the implementation

2870337
children	parent
my question is how do i set up my code so that when i scale my parent view by 1 4 or w e to make a thumbprint of the view the children subviews that the parent view owns will scale accordingly and allow the 1 4 sized thumbprint to look just like the full sized view just smaller

2870385
put	get
if i try and use ____ looks naff and so does 00 00 0000 and of course if you put in 0 like 03 11 2009 you get 3 11 29 because the 0 s are deleted as part of the mask

2870418
folder	directory
you could also easily do a virtual directory instead and not roll out the symlinked folder in each website

2870449
super	extends
class enum extends super const export import

2870462
bash	zsh
if you re using bash or zsh use this

2870472
google-chrome	firefox
try running your experiment in multiple browsers instead of stopping the browser and resubmitting fire both requests in separate browsers firefox and google-chrome which will use separate session and therefore will not block

2870522
put	get
not sure how things work on osx but in linux if i install gems as a regular user they get put in my home directory and if i install them using sudo they go into a system directory

2870552
public	protected	ienumerable	icollection
essentially you want to make the icollection type protected and use this as the backing collection for the public ienumerable

2870552
public	protected
for lazy loading to work the type must implement icollection and the access must be public or protected

2870569
coldfusion	railo
in cfml coldfusion railo openbd the onmissingmethod event handler defined within a component will receive undefined method calls on that component

2870569
getter	setter
this is the mechanism that facilitated the creation of implicit setter getter schemes before they began to be built into the various cfml engines

2870582
serializable	deserialization
you ll have to define some kind wire protocol or serializable deserialization format so that your reader knows how to interpret the data that it s reading from the fifo

2870602
portrait	landscape
mostly it s used when the view autorotates from landscape to portrait and vice-versa

2870607
x86	64bit
if you re running the batch file using systemroot syswow64 cmd.exe on 64bit windows perhaps because you re starting it from a 32-bit app then processor_architecture will be equal to x86 not amd64

2870613
cruisecontrol	teamcity
for the build server you can try cruisecontrol or teamcity free but not open source

2870614
abstract-class	superclass
my opinion is you better use abstract-class called creature as a superclass for all type of well creatures and extends it to zombie for all type of zombies

2870620
inherited	subclassing
the type parameter should be declared with the type and the subclassing will declare the specific type in its inherited declaration

2870626
innodb	myisam
i have tried this particular query remotely and locally with the myisam and innodb engines with different types of joins and with and without an index on phone1

2870634
int	boolean
the idea is an int called access-mode holds a boolean in the lowest bit and a count in

2870634
subtract	add
i add and subtract by 2 to leave the low-bit alone

2870699
mouseleave	mouseenter
i don t know exactly what your selector should be but this will grab the src of the image when you mouseenter and change it from _bw.jpg to _color.jpg and back when you mouseleave

2870716
inherited	properties
then using css inherited principles you can create more specific rules for links inside the #header element and override any of the properties you like

2870722
hide	show
i am not sure is hide show the correct status to be used in such cases

2870786
outputstream	inputstream
here s an example of copying an inputstream to an outputstream from org.apache.commons.io.ioutils

2870803
post	get
i read the other post here on outlineviews and dnd but i can t get my program to work

2870856
uitableview	uisearchbar
i see a lot of info on putting a uisearchbar in the top row of a uitableview -- but i am putting the uisearchbar into the toolbar at the top of my screen on the ipad

2870884
apache	lighttpd
if you don t need that it also has a fastcgi interface so that you can serve scheme scripts from a web servers like apache lighttpd etc

2870908
pull	push
you actually can use this file as an origin repo from which you can pull push data like a regular git repo

2870923
openssl	m2crypto
lucky for you the openssl function you need is available in m2crypto 0.16 it is just the python method that is not providing the extra argument you need

2870928
folder	dir
the example below will do a dir of your appdata folder and redirect the stdout to the debug

2870951
ubuntu	debian
it s available at that link and in the repositories of at least debian fedora and ubuntu

2870960
postgresql	mysql
product supports the various of rdbms such as oracle mysql sql server h2 hsql apache derby postgresql â vietspider crawler supports session login query by form input multi-downloading javascript handling proxy and multi-proxy by auto scan the proxies from website â

2870970
width	height
apparently the width and height were getting a value of 5 for some reason

2870970
width	height
i fixed the redraw function to adjust the width and height correctly

2871039
glassfish	weblogic	jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish
in case you are working in an application server environment such as glassfish weblogic or jboss connection pooling is provided by the application server itself

2871079
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

2871100
post	get
get post for those categories

2871100
post	get
then you will not get any categories without post

2871233
stdout	stderr
the following command will run three commands and will write all output stdout and stderr into a single logfile

2871233
stdout	stderr
stderr and stdout for all commands goes to a logfile in case i need it later--- i usually won t look in here unless there are problems

2871233
stdout	stderr
a 2 1 will convert stderr into stdout and therefore i cannot view errors if i do 2 error.log

2871258
post	get
i am trying to build a webservice that manipulates http requests post and get

2871272
stdout	stderr
additionally you can direct stdout and stderr to different places

2871272
stdout	stderr
so some combination of the above should work for you -- you could save stdout to a file and stderr to both a file and piping to another program with tee

2871273
pull	push
when i try to clone pull from or push to the windows repo via ssh it gives me an error fatal protocol error bad line length character it doesn t matter what i set the remote to in my client mac osx machine - i can point it to a folder that doesn t exist and it still gives me that error

2871273
pull	push
better yet is there anybody out there that has managed to do what i want to do push to and pull from a windows repository via ssh

2871289
post	get
i check the request_method upon every invocation of the script to see if it was called by get method or post

2871309
stdout	fflush
you may want to do fflush stdout after every print or autoflush stdout once

2871359
stdout	stderr
the stderr will then get converted to stdout which is piped to tee which appends it to the log if you are have bash 4 you can replace with and sends it to stdout which will either appear on the tty or can be piped to another command

2871359
stdout	stderr
that said it may be possible that stderr stdout is interleaved in an unexpected way

2871435
put	get
if the problem persists you can add an event handler for the textchanged event and put a breakpoint in it to se when the textbox get cleared

2871444
int	double
the built-in point structure uses int and pointf uses float but you can make your own that uses double

2871448
int	double
otherwise if you really want to use double s and pass them to int drawing functions you will need to create your own structure

2871451
stdout	stderr
executes the commands with standard error directed to standard out standard out directed to fd 5 and pipes stdout which now contains only stderr to tee which duplicates the output to fd 5 which is the log file

2871458
protected-mode	real-mode
if you want to play with hw write some programs for 16-bit real-mode or even with your own transition to protected-mode

2871499
post	put
i can redirect all those post to another sub domain points in another folder not sub folder if i put all those post in a sub folder it will recursive the subfolder name anyway it works for me by using the code below

2871512
int	chars
so if you have a long text of such chars you would need to loop through the string chars by chars using getcharat int or getchars and process each chars with string.format 04x int c.charvalue

2871530
put	get
with this script i get data from jsonresult getdevicestable and put them to table id orderdevices

2871631
web.py	cherrypy
however seeking doesn t work when running a dev server web.py cherrypy or if i return the bytes via a defined action url instead of as a static file

2871669
int	boolean	int	double
i have been able to use the method above to store both int and double as string and to the cast in the query but i have not succeeded using the same method for datedime and boolean

2871718
put	get
but if i put the name already in function i can get the correct data example

2871739
getter	setter
i used getter setter here since you usually set the fields to private and access them through accessor methods but that s your call

2871779
width	height
instead of cloning the source image as the dest you are going to have to create an image big enough to take the final rotated image which will be a square with sides 1.5 times the biggest of the source width or height

2871787
profiling	debugging
alternatively you can simulate cheap profiling debugging your application and break into it periodically to see what s executing on the call stack

2871842
put	get
but if i put the name already in function i can get the correct data example

2871888
put	get
the dispose just never get s called even if i put a wait loop after the test

2871894
next	except
all works fine except that if left inactive for a length of time the next time a request is made to the server it takes a long time for it to service it

2871908
public	protected
controls in the page are often declared as protected so you might have to change their access level to public in order to access them from the outside

2871911
postgresql	mysql
i m trying to migrate my app from mysql to postgresql using rails3-pre and the latest datamapper

2871921
jboss	glassfish
stack such as jboss glassfish etc

2872056
bash	zsh
however bash has useful interactive features dash does not zsh is still better imho

2872141
width	height
but then i break out width and height as properties of parent object so in the end use

2872163
int	double
if you only have 2 textboxes that the user can enter values into and it ll be either a string or a number do you really need to be able to distinguish between int and double can t you just store it all as a suitable numeric type depending on the db

2872188
google-chrome	firefox
looks much better on ubuntu mac as compared to windows 7 tried google-chrome firefox

2872197
mockito	easymock
my analyze is that easymock tests will break more often but mockito ones won t when you would want them to

2872205
int	double
it still converts the type - for example from int to double

2872223
rss	feed
so you have to learn xml only if you gonna parse or supply an rss feed

2872252
folder	directory
you can however write to a folder that your air app creates in the user s directory called the application storage directory

2872407
pull	push
i do not want to move my component into the gac i want to leave the custom assembly in my applicationbase to copy around to various servers without having to pull push from the gac

2872408
hash	md5
for example in case of 2checkout you would want to check md5 hash that 2checkout returns to verify the transaction and make a record of the payment maybe save the raw params received from 2checkout

2872442
hash	md5
so domain name hash maybe md5 twice this is given to the user to add to a config or you save it and the player talks to your server

2872454
ironruby	ironpython
microsoft has a project called gestalt which uses ironruby and ironpython running on top of the dlr inside silverlight to provide support for text python and text ruby and presumably any language that can run on top of the dlr scheme smalltalk php tcl.

2872461
folder	directory
the reason why i store it within this folder is since these images need to be cleared once in a while and it s so much easier just to clear the tmp directory using tmpwatch

2872510
width	height
fb.ui method fbml.dialog width 500 height 300 fbml ....

2872561
equals	gethashcode
equals on the other hand can test accross a larger number of fields - ie its test is more specific than gethashcode comparisons

2872566
cstdio	iostream
slower than the cstdio ones and extensibility iostream allows

2872576
std	ostream
such as std ostream and

2872583
temp	tmp
even if you built a php script that accepts the file name as a parameter and then passes through the file from the tmp directory you would be mixing public content with temp files that can contain sensitive data

2872588
post	get
this is my first post here so hello okay let s get to the point..

2872622
implements	extends
any class extends abstract class will implements the abstract method or else its also need to be declared as abstract

2872628
ant	maven
ide plugins ant and or maven and some huge framework which makes it

2872636
rdf	owl
yes an rdf-triple store can store owl because owl is a specialisation of rdf that provides additional semantic representations

2872636
rdf	owl
many tools including jena provide specialised api s for storing retrieving and manipulating owl constructs stored in rdf triple stores

2872656
put	get
to get fms to stream recorded video you put the files on the server where fms is installed and configure fms to use those files

2872686

rtp	sip
i would like to ask if there are one of this api sip rtp srtp zrtp

2872794
actionscript	mxml
this can be achieved by using the command-line options of mxmlc the actionscript mxml compiler shipped with the free flex sdk -- i don t know if it is possible using the flash ide

2872864
xna	slimdx
xna and slimdx are very close in nature but there are some differences

2872864
xna	slimdx
xna requires a gpu with a least pixel vertex shaders 1.1 while i think slimdx does not

2872864
xna	slimdx
slimdx supports directx10 and 11 while xna only supports directx 9

2872864
xna	slimdx
xna is a cross platform between windows xbox 360 zune and windows phone 7 while slimdx is not

2872877
ubuntu	linux
i use ubuntu linux and it would be fine if it included a bit of .sh script or anything

2872918
folder	directory
i would rather add a second source directory through a linked folder

but the demo below includes both style and script tags on google-chrome 4 ie7 and firefox 3.6

2873427
rel	src
if you want to get the content of externally-linked pages as well as the inline content you will naturally have to parse the result and follow the src on script s href on link s that have rel stylesheet etc.

2873447

filtering	grouping	hide	show
i m trying to trigger a sequence of effects simple animated show hide on a grouping of images inside of div where images are tagged with classnames that provide a filtering ability thru class selectors

2873687
hide	show
i thought i could just drop the show function into a callback on the hide function call but it ends up calling the show method repeatedly as many times as there were items hidden in the first call

2873687
hide	show
the challenge as i see it is that the show effect doesn t necessarily impact the same images that were hit with the hide effect

2873693
backgrounding	multitasking
i know that sdk 4.0 promises multitasking and backgrounding processes of the application

2873788
post	get
i tried to get more information from the jfreechar forums and found this post

2873812
hide	show
instead of showing and hiding each element individually you can add a class to the li elements after the first three then use css to show and hide them by adding a class to the ul parent

2873825
serializable	deserialization
one is that it leads to an asymmetry between serializable deserialization

2873825
serializable	deserialization
if a class is subclassed this will work transparently during serializable but will fail during deserialization unless the deserialization is made aware of the new class

2873950
wordpress	phpfox
and then when phpfox user logged in use jquery again to post to the wordpress login form

2874072
required	placeholder
you place an image in your document as a placeholder to get the size etc as required then docmosis will inject the given image at runtime from java

2874075
width	height
that share the same two properties they both have a width and a height property

2874075

2874186
interpreted-language	compiled-language
a dynamically interpreted-language is interpreted at runtime whereas a compiled-language is compiled before execution

2874189
width	height
in some occations you might just need the width and height in other scenarios you might need the full set of ia or ib or even the implementation but that should be simplified to an interface aswell

2874235
hide	show
you wont be able to change the cell to another design from ib because that would require for it to recreate itself you prolly actually could but it wouldnt look good and it would prolly be hackerish ...however you can have many different content view defined in ib and declare them all in a cell subclass which u can tie to your ib as well then you can just hide views and show views depending on the selection state...you can do this in the selected method of uitableview cell heres a ref tableviewcell ref

2874241
bash	tcsh
i would say that examples of scripting languages are things like bash or ksh or tcsh or whatever or sqlplus

2874388
sproutcore	cappuccino
to use cappuccino mentioned in another answer and a good idea to look at and sproutcore you you will be more productive on a mac and dashcode definitely needs a mac as you will need to install xcode to get dashcode

2874392

but like nosklo i prefer to store it in simpler data format like json of ini config file

2874554
google-chrome	firefox
that works for me in google-chrome firefox and ie8

2874637

i figured out how to capture mouse clicks over the entire form but this method doesn t translate well for mouseenter and mouseleave

2874725
integer	fractions
if p.value is an integer you will probably lose the fractions on this line

2874734
sequence	permutation
assuming the sequence is a permutation then given the state of the algorithm you should be able to figure out the set of n 2 remaining elements

2874734
sequence	permutation
you want to create a program p which given the final n 2 elements and the internal state of the linear-time-constant-space algorithm after it has processed n 2 elements determines if the entire sequence is a permutation of 1..n

2874734
sequence	permutation
assuming p exists we can create a program q taking only the internal state of the linear-time-constant-space algorithm which determines the necessary final n 2 elements of the sequence if it was a permutation

2875005
filtering	grouping
in this forum entry the telerik team states that the grid can sort icomparable and grouping filtering iequatable no matter of the silverlight version

2875005
filtering	grouping
since a list does not implement icomparable or iequatable i cannot sort or grouping filtering this column

2875030
textarea	textbox
by default browsers render most form elements textarea textbox buttons etc using os controls or browser controls

2875075

i would be careful using it on google-chrome firefox and opera

2875144
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
google-chrome seems to have a problem with checkboxes showing up firefox is case sensitive with styles and tags and opera seems to run fine but is slow at updating

2875150
post	get
it s really too much to get into in a single post but i would recommend finding a better source for learning the pattern and tool

2875216
width	height
i basically want the size to have a ratio of width height and then grow according to that ratio to fit the text

2875216
width	height
instead i want to say find the smallest width height to fit this text given a minimum width but the found rectangle must have some specific ratio of width and height

pop-up	dialog
i have a jquery ui dialog that pop-up when user clicks on an image

2875371
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in both google-chrome and firefox however firebug clearly shows post data being submitted

2875474
hide	show
so the script adds the column2 cell and that stays visible the whole time - instead we show hide the within it

2875536
unsigned	short
this makes me suspect almost be sure in some unsigned short overflow

2875547
calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	malloc
you don t actually need to call delete or free these operators are only used to clean up memory that have been allocated my runtime memory allocator like malloc calloc globalalloc heapalloc and so forth

2875569
pop-up	dialog
i also shown how to show standard fb friends invite pop-up dialog

2875600

i m trying to run a regular expression in vba code that uses microsoft vbscript regular expressions 5.5 should be the same as javascript regular expression

2875727
yacc	bison
bison flex or yacc lex is the traditional way to do it

2875727
yacc	bison
most propably a yacc bison generated parser will be much cleaner and faster than some hand-crafted recursive descending parser

2875736
hide	show
it s easy enough to show and hide the toolbar use -setvisible

2875777
x86	64bit
program files x86 is the redirected program files for 32-bit apps on 64bit os installs

2875778
inherited	properties
change the private properties to protected properties private are not accessible by anyone except the class that creates them while protected variables could be accessed by inherited classes

2875779
lseek	posix
if you are using a posix system like linux then open lseek read and close are a good first go at this and may be required if you don t have the next system calls

2875779
folder	directory
if all of the files that you are trying to read from live in one directory folder or under one then you may find that opening the directory with opendir or open directory_name o_directory depending on if you need to read the directory entries yourself and then calling openat which takes a directory entry file descriptor as one of its arguments will speed up opening each file since the os won t have work as hard to look up the file you re trying to open each time that data will probably be in the os s file system cache but it still takes time and has lots of tests

2875809
pow	sqrt
distance prevdist + sqrt pow prevx - acceleration.x 2 + pow prevy - acceleration.y 2 + pow prevz - acceleration.z 2

2875823
int	double
math.random returns a double and when you multiply a double by an int java considers the result to be a double

2875823
int	double
by default java will not allow you to assign a double value to a variable of type int without your explicitly telling the compiler that it s ok to do so

2875823
int	double
basically you can think of casting a double to an int as telling the compiler i know this int variable can t hold the decimal part of this double value but that s ok just truncate it.

2875823
int	double
unlike double which by definition can be converted to an int by dropping the decimal part strings can t be easily or consistently converted to an int

2875828
super	implements
really what you should have is an icar interface that both implements and from display in supercar you should call car.display you ll also have to implements make and model on super car and make them return car.make car.model to implements the decorator pattern properly

2875853
disk	ram
it would cost 256mb of ram but save hundreds of gb of file i o even when you request only 8 bytes the disk has to transfer a full page into cache

mouseup	mousedown
one candidate is the control.capture property turned on at the mousedown event for a button so that the button can see the mouseup event no matter where the mouse moved

2875897
min	max
this allows us to create datasets to preserve the common metadata between the files as you say categories and tags while we have file specific structures title start stop time min max values etc. while we could keep these in hidden files we do a lot of searching and open our interface to outside consumers via web services

2875955

it was sort of hastily put together from real working code i have here and if the find replaces broke something at least you might get an idea of what to do

2876262
ssl	https
if you will require sensible information from user by a web form it should be protected by ssl https url

2876269

client-side	server-side
for the asp.net validator controls i want to use both client-side validation for the user experience and server-side validation to guard against hackers

2876395
client-side	server-side
asp.net documentation leads me to believe that if enableclientscript true then there will be no server-side validation if client-side validation is possible for the user agent

2876395
client-side	server-side
to get server-side validation the documentation says use enableclientscript false which bypasses client-side validation altogether

config	ini
another idea is to move the strings into a config file such as in xml or ini format

2876572
mbunit	nunit
in terms of performance tests it makes sense to still use a testing framework like nunit mbunit maventhought just keep these tests in a separate assembly and don t invoke them as part of your unit tests

2876600
pop-up	dialog
basically it is a combobox with a button to the right of it to allow a user to pop-up a search dialog

2876619
floating-point	integer
the expression returns false but fortunately integer arithmetic in floating-point is exact so decimal representation errors can be avoided by scaling 1

mp3	wav
that webservice encodes a wav file to mp3 format

2876709
kerberos	ntlm
but wait you says i use sql authentication and sql authentication is not an ntlm kerberos resource

2876709
kerberos	ntlm
true says i but you also use named pipes and named pipes are an ntlm kerberos resource therefore delegation does occur

2876810
implements	extends
to implements an unmodifiable list the programmer needs only to extends this class and provide implementations for the get int index and size methods

centos	linux
the issue we are having is related to the way that this child-process is getting created on linux redhat 4.4 and centos 5.4

2876965
mouse	keyboard
this will also allow keyboard events to select deselect the radios and will work anytime the radio values change not just when someone raises their mouse over a label

2876986
hash	md5
perhaps separate the statuses with a userid or creating an md5 hash on the image data

2877029
glfw	fltk	mouse	keyboard

if c# is possible and a mac with safari firefox would be able to use it i can t install plugins and i don t want to get in trouble for making myself admin again

aptana	radrails
i ve already tried eclipse with aptana radrails

2879264
packets	multicast
unfortunately multicast ip doesn t have any such filtering by subnetwork feature -- so unless you want to muck with iptables on linux or equivalent firewall sw hw of your system network to try and drop on the floor every multicast packets you don t like i think you ll have to do it at application level with a test on fromaddr in your inner loop for example

2879296
spaces	delimiter
this obviously isn t perfect because it will still accept input like 2 1 2 1 2 which it would evaluate as 3 since it essentially sums up a spaces delimiter list of numbers while evaluating each as a fraction as necessary

cout	cin
i do not like using namespace std but i am also tired of having to type std in front of every cout cin cerr and endl

2879557
fgets	getline
you can use fgets iteratively but a simpler alternative is stdio.h s getline

2879561

then in your code you can use cin cout and so on without accidentally injecting all of the rest of the std namespace into your code

2879579

button	checkbox
i need to post the data to the controller upon any checkbox checked or unchecked i.e a click on a checkbox must post to the controller and there is no submit button

2879886
width	height
so if the width after the first resize is 100 and you wanted 75 you compute the diff 25 split it by 2 and ceil it 13 then you tell the gd function to start copying the image from 13 instead of 0 and still keep 75 height

2879913
allocator	stl
that will only work if you pass that allocator as a template parameter in every stl container declaration you have

2879933
int	boolean
boolean int long .

2879937
int	boolean
the rationale for int boolean and so on is to allow primitive types to be used in contexts that require a reference type

2879941
int	double
also there are things you can t do with primitive types like storing them in a map or using polymorphism double and int both are instances of number

2879998
put	get
if someone is willing to put classes in your package to circumvent your encapsulation they re clearly ignoring your best intentions - i say let em get on with it but don t provide support for that scenario
