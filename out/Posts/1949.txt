webmock	curb
to confirm this you can tell webdriver to use curb instead which hopefully won t be affected by what webmock does

5280055
coalesce	isnull
i ve tried isnull coalesce and even a case statement all with the same results

5280058
pop-up	dialog
but when i tried to run it i got a nasty pop-up dialog box with debug assertion failed error in file dbgheap.c expression _crtisvalidheappointer puserdata

5280060

the first thing you ll note is that you can t really control the filename but it works ok in firefox and google-chrome other than that but probably not so well in ie i ve not tried it

5280061
hide	show
i want to hide i1 and show i2 when i click a button in i2

5280076

5280155
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
i m trying to write an application that will work well on all screens sizes for that i have my graphic designer produce images that are in the requested dpis for each directory low density 120 ldpi medium density 160 mdpi high density 240 hdpi extra high density 320 xhdpi however they want to know at which resolution and aspect ratio each image should be after looking around the android documenation namely

5280155
mdpi	hdpi
low density 120 ldpi medium density 160 mdpi high density 240 hdpi extra high density 320 xhdpi

5280155
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
itâ s worth noting here that even though it seems that there is no correlation between these screens sizes there is a 3 4 6 scaling ratio between the three densities so a 9x9 bitmap in ldpi is 12x12 in mdpi and 18x18 in hdpi see

5280155
width	height
such a screen has significantly more available space in both width and height than an hvga display

5280183
getter	setter
try to learn about properties and about using getter and setter

5280183
getter	setter
and then in your .m file create getter setter

5280222

5280322
super	self
self should be always assigned with value returned by super initializer because of super can return another object upon initialization it s not unusual btw

5280355
postgresql	mysql
i am designing a relational database schema that may be ported to multiple database platforms--sqlite3 postgresql and mysql and possibly others

5280372
matlab	simulink
you can use the evalin function to execute from your own function a matlab expression as a string in a specific workspace in your case the base for simulink to find them

5280418
virtualenv	setuptools
i just recreated all my python environment reinstalled python and setuptools and installed virtualenv

client-side	server-side
you re really going to be using two technologies to accomplish this javascript on the client-side and rails on the server-side

5280512
getter	setter
im not looking for source - generate getter and setter because that would helps me in generating the methods itself

5280543
twos-complement	modulo
of course arithmetic here is assumed to be unsigned modulo 2 n or twos-complement

5280569
put	get
this type of design would put most of the stress on the php aspect of things because it would only be one sql call to get all comments from a thread

5280575
mpfr	mpc
i ve also installed and compiled gmp mpfr and mpc from source same versions as i did on the 10.10 host but it s still coming up with the same error

5280606
client-side	server-side
another option which i have used before with great results is a yui datatable with pagination server-side or client-side

5280629
websphere	ibm
if you want a tutorial that includes a demonstration of how to use ibm s jmsadmin tool to create the .bindings file look at running a standalone java application on websphere mq v6.0

firefox	safari
everything does show in firefox and safari

5280636
margin	font-size

wakelock	powermanager
you need a wakelock obtained from the powermanager

5280659
clang	llvm
i would like to know the following information about llvm clang

5280677
min	max
i am currently doing some data preprocessing algorithms such as pca and min max normalization

5280695
width	height
if you look at that you ll notice that the height and width attributes are both set to an empty string

5280695
width	height
meaning that in ie the height and width of your image are 0 since that s the closest numerical value that ie can derive from

5280695
width	height
try changing whatever it is in your script that creates that tag to either set a height and width that is appropriate or to not add those attributes at all

5280747

super	self
in the initializers you re supposed to invoke super s designated initializer and assign it to self

5280863
iboutlet	ibaction
i have a view with a bar button on it connected via an ibaction showmovie and an iboutlet moviebutton

5280874
post	put
because they should be put and delete but many servers out of the box do not support put and delete so they tunnel it through post

5280908
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
now this is working in google-chrome opera and firefox but not internet explorer ie is giving me nan

5280917

of course clients that you program have enough flexibility to use put and delete as intended but browsers can really only use get and post

5280972
accelerometer	gyroscope
i assume first 2 corresponds to separate hardware accelerometer and gyroscope

5280977

for-loop	arrays
but i m not sure how i am supposed to pull a particular column from the arrays without having to go through a for-loop to parse through it

5281019
stdout	fflush
posix-specific redirect stdout to a file fflush after all writing is done then stat the file and look at st_size or use the ls command

5281139
int	chars
i say â œlittle moreâ and not â œno moreâ for a reason the sscanf call also writes sizeof int - sizeof unsigned chars bytes beyond the end of the array so you are also smashing the stack and setting up for a potential crash

5281139
octal	decimal
thus you use scanint to parse the number in decimal and stringwithformat to convert it to octal and encode it back into a string

5281194
google-chrome	safari
i have a problem with google-chrome and safari ..the date picker is not opening while clicking on the button

5281228

5281233
webkit	gecko
they also differ for webkit and gecko

1.dynamic memory allocation using malloc calloc realloc and free

5281274
realloc	malloc
the array implementation of a list is easier as compared to linked list implementaion.in array implementaion also you could use malloc to dynamically allocate memory for your array and realloc to increase decrease the memory

5281292
opera	firefox
this will work on webkit firefox 4 and opera don t remember version and will degrade gracefully on non-supporting browsers they ll just go from start to end in one step

5281332

5281348
hide	show
you can hide show elements in your print layout the same way by using media print and setting display none on any element you don t want to print

5281369
width	height
nested divs and float equal to left or right will help you to setup the height and width not like in table case

5281423
post	put
one alternative would be to put the aspnet_users table into your entity model and then do a join to retrieve the additional user information when you request the post

5281429
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have a small script that shall redirect to another page when return is pressed in a textbox it works fine in ie google-chrome safari but not in firefox

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s because you are using google-chrome or safari browser - try with ie or firefox

5281653
min	max
another option would be to just select max year min year to find out the first and second year

5281653
filtering	grouping
if you are allowed using having keyword that will be useful in order to filtering on a grouping by aggregate however i don t remember if that is mysql proprietary or part of ansi sql

5281655
symlink	realpath
therefore if for example services webpages l is a directory and services webpages l i is a symlink pointing to services2 webpages util i g gg8375620.provider.com.br both services2 webpages util i g gg8375620.provider.com.br mydomain.com public and services webpages l i mydomain.com public will get you to the same directory but realpath will always return the former

5281672
range	median
i want to use a random number generator that creates random numbers in a gaussian range where i can define the median by myself

5281686

5282226
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the second problem is that while i m using border-radius for the round corner section containers right middle and left-nav sections for firefox google-chrome opera and safari i m using separate classes for ie with cut-up background images for the top left right and bottom corners for fluid round corner boxes - a bit of a pain to set up

5282245

these functions work by converting their input into utf-8 and then returning the int vector for the utf-8 encoded chars vector and vice versa

5282263
google-chrome	firefox
if the request is made with ajax then it is always utf-8 at least in google-chrome and firefox as our client uses only those browsers

imagemagick	graphicsmagick
according to wikipedia graphicsmagick is a fork from imagemagick 5.5.2

5282274
jboss	glassfish	jboss	resin	glassfish	resin
if the server could be replaced with jboss glassfish or resin a simple asynchronous annotated method could also do the job here

5282274
jboss	glassfish
if you could replace the server with jboss or glassfish the cdi event bus could be an option

5282295

5282411
awt	swing
there is tuiawt - it s rather old and it s for awt rather than swing but it may well do what you want

5282440
int	chars
to illustrate what goes wrong consider a 2 byte binary int field with a value of 64 xâ 0040â this will be converted to 32 xâ 0020â because xâ 40â is also ebcidic for the space chars

5282440
packed-decimal	comp-3
what i can tell you is the file is 2000 bytes long on the mainframe and contains a lot of packed-decimal fields cobol comp-3

5282443

5282698
getter	setter
because javascript doesn t universally support setter getter methods yet i d recommend you think about how you set your variables

5282698
short	base
i m personally not a huge fan of adding new methods to base prototypes but it makes things easier to refactor in the short term

5282701
folder	directory
i have started to write a plugin for phonegap and now i want to create a folder under iphone directory inside phonegap plugins git

5282747
free	malloc

5282812
rss	feed
i have a rss feed reader created using javascript and need to format the date

5282865
rss	feed
rss feed

5282938
pascal	delphi
as i mentioned i haven t tried free pascal lazarus my self so it is a bit of a guess how complex moving from delphi to this solution is

5283024
titlebar	window
the icon that is displayed in my main window s titlebar by default is the java logo

5283061
put	get
i was wondering how would i go about setting up a php code such that when someone enters a url into a form i would like to extract the name of the webpage and a photograph similar to what happens in facebook when you put a link on someones wall you get the title of the link and picture

5283119

bascially it adds a left margin minus the left border width of the image

5283133

rss	feed
zend_feed provides an easy way to work with feed either rss or atom

5283182
typedef	struct
typedef struct _filetime

5283246
versioning	upgrade
hmvc works fine with codeigniter 2.0 but you have to upgrade to a newer versioning

5283262

and my member.java class for my getter and setter

5283395
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome i m taken to

5283397
getter	setter
as of right now this is the only logical way i can think of to avoid getter setter functions and maintain the closely bonded sync between properties

5283429
versioning	upgrade
i used to build my delphi programs using a command line action because the versioning of fb that i have only supports up to d2006 natively and i haven t upgrade it

5283434

open google-chrome or firefox if you have the firebug extension installed

5283595
put	get
when i put tags around it you get this error

following links on the tuiawt site i found charva which seems to be able to replace awt and swing

5283672
getter	setter
don t do this use getter setter

5283692
public	protected
change it to protected will make name visible to children classes or make it public to make it visible to any classes

5283894
g++	gcc
i was looking for a list of recommended g++ warning options for c++ and only could find this recommended gcc warning options for c and useful gcc flags for c which are all quite c specific

5283952
implements	extends

5284003
ubuntu	linux
system is linux ubuntu

5284033
gesturedetector	motionevent
then you can use gesturedetector to detect any gestures related to the motionevent

you can also select view controllers by array index using the selectedindex property. when you embed the tab bar controllerâ s view obtained using the inherited view properties in your application window the tab bar controller automatically selects that view controller and displays its contents resizing them as needed to fit the tab bar interface

5284112
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	inherited	properties
because the uitabbarcontroller class inherited from the uiviewcontroller class tab bar controllers have their own view that is accessible through the view properties

5284164
jena	dotnetrdf	rdf	owl
i came across different apis like dotnetrdf jena etc all support rdf rdfs but there is not support for owl file

opera	firefox
calling scrolltop on html element in opera 11 ie 8 firefox 3.6 returns a number larger than zero

5292910
google-chrome	safari
calling scrolltop on html element in google-chrome 10 flock 3.5 safari 5 for windows returns 0

5292910
google-chrome	safari
if the browser is google-chrome or flock or safari than scrolltop will return 0 and you test for that acting accordingly

5292910
google-chrome	safari
ugh and body for google-chrome and safari

5292911
google-chrome	firefox
i see a post here launch file from firefox or google-chrome with this as solution

post	put
consider reading the data from your database packaging it as json and sending it to your server using http put or post

5292994
allocator	stl
i want to use tcmalloc with stl containers so i need an allocator built with tcmalloc like tbb_allocator with tbb malloc

5293009
instances	transient
the serialization of a class contains instances data the values of non transient instances variables not the code of implemented methods so there are no methods for the interface to point to

5293022
width	height
the tables width and height are set as percentages of a parent container

5293061
versioning	upgrade
it isn t just a swap of versioning you have to upgrade rails a lot has changed i recommend watching a series of screencasts about upgrading rails

5293111
folder	directory
pro tip unzip these files as high in your apps folder structure as possible don t put them under a javascriptmvc folder in your public directory .

5293158
nsstring	nsdata
if it s an nsstring then use the method instead of to get your nsdata object

5293160
sudo	passwd
presumably that would only work if the user php runs as apache nobody or something else depending on the apache config has sudo enabled without passwd for that command

5293175
post	get
background i have post that get voted on and have a counter_cache for votes votes_count in the post database

im using jenkins-php and cruisecontrol phpundercontrol

5293233
post	get
this is true of the get method not necessarily so with post though

5293335
hash	md5
you probably don t need a crypto-strength hash so md5 or sha1 is probably overkill

5293335
int	chars
even low-tech fast hashes like length of string concat as int + + number of strings as int + + first chars of each string may be fine depending on your expected values

5293352
implements	extends
i m trying to load a rsl library into a flash animation developed with flash cs5 ide that extends a custom class and implements an interface

5293352
implements	extends
i have reduced the problem to the simplest setup and find that i can have my main class extends another class or implements an interface but not do both at the same time if i want to load an rsl

5293376
setinterval	settimeout
instead of trying to explicitly unload the no-longer-needed javascript module s representation in the dom you might try stopping the old code from executing returning from methods unregistering event handlers settimeout and setinterval handles etc then explicitly setting any references to values in the module s scope to null

5293380
int	double	int	boolean
typeformat.format double d int digits boolean scientific boolean showzero appendable a

5293391
int	chars
one other advantage might be to have this status either as int or as chars record requests q accepted contacts c rejected requests j rejected and re-requested r blacklisted b and possibly other statuses so you could more easily apply more complicated logics like a user cannot request a contact again when it has been rejected twice etc

5293395
rss	feed
it gets the apps and their icons from an rss feed

5293411
textile	bbcode
if you do not need to accept and preserve html input always htmlspecialchars any variable that goes into html note that there are many formats such as bbcode markdown textile etc whose sole purpose is to allow a useful subset of formatting options without opening pandora s box

5293458
public	protected
if you were to define method1 as public or protected in parent and override the method in child then calling method2 would invoke child s method1 instead

5293490
clang	llvm
i just came across clang llvm today and decided to try it out

5293512
int	chars
there s no way to convert an instance of a derived class to base and then back to derived while preserving its original value for pretty much the same reason that it s not possible to convert from int to chars and then back preserving the original value

5293546
spatialite	proj
i ve set things up to compile spatialite as a shared library and geos and proj as static libs statically linked with spatialite

5293546
ubuntu	linux
also note this is on linux ubuntu 10.10

5293562
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
to implement your custom tabbar take a leaf out of apple s book and write a uiviewcontroller subclass which implements what you describe based on how uitabbarcontroller works but avoid actually using apple s uitabbarcontroller in any way

5293562
portrait	landscape
your customtabbarcontroller let s call it that for convenience should basically take a collection of uiviewcontrollers icons and description texts for both landscape and portrait mode items

5293593
folder	directory
in fact the build directory must be at the same folder level as the project it can t be above or below

5293608

5293630
dictionary	map
lets say a map dictionary or other hashtables of customers and restaurant orders

5293742
setinterval	settimeout
yes i realize that the setinterval thing can backfire and cause uneven update timing if the called script takes a while to return and that using settimeout instead and re-triggering it on ajax completion is better practice but i believe that the called script is simple enough that this shouldn t be too much of a problem here.

5293780
apache	nginx
other similar software packages include nginx apache s mod_proxy apache traffic server and varnish

5293791
pylons	pyramid
then after googling it i found that pylons pyramid best practices reason that import failures...should never prevent those tests from being run.

5293792
folder	directory
i had apparently moved my desktop folder into my downloads directory at some point by accident

5293792
folder	directory
although i had fixed the problem it nevertheless left an entry in my registry with a desktop folder redirection to the downloads directory

5293848
free	malloc
i don t know if it will work but try this simple wrap of malloc and free

5293897

5293916
width	margin
div#logo must have a width property for margin auto

5293950
fadein	fadeout

children	parent
for the parent page i want to pull all thumbnails specifically the featured image of the page from all the children pages

5293980

5294027
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
apple the started creating nswindowcontroller nsviewcontroller etc

5294030
int	chars
my ruby code parsed the chars as an int and your java code interpreted the chars as an int

5294030
int	chars
mine converted the chars to an int based on the ascii meaning of the chars

5294030
int	chars
so i changed your code to parse the digits into int and changed from chars to int to silence a pointless warning

5294057
uilabel	nsstring
so for example let s say you have a uilabel called mylabel that you want to have display the nsstring property

5294073
listview	gridview
my backup plan is to just use a surfacelistbox control instead of the listview but i already have working listview gridview code that i d prefer to modify to get the nice touch panning provided by surfacescrollviewer if possible

5294073
listview	gridview
after struggling with the listview gridview combination i eventually gave up and implemented this as a data-bound surfacelistbox that includes a horizontal stackpanel as the surfacelistboxitem

5294099
class-method	eigenclass
use object#extend to include methods in a module as class-method like defining them in the eigenclass would like so

i put the clientaccesspolicy.xml and crossdomain.xml in my web project but this still generates this error when i am debugging

5294196
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
latest releases of firefox opera and safari will successfully display the favicon in this case but google-chrome and ie8 won t

5294203

5294267
google-chrome	firefox
it happens on ie google-chrome firefox

5294275
crypt	hash
your main problem is that the crypt hash starts with usually

5294275
crypt	hash
the hash you get back from phps crypt is not necessarily the same as the passwd utility would generate it

5294275
hash	md5
php gives you the md5 version starting with whereas passwd might default to generating sha512 hash starting with

5294313
g++	gcc
you don t even need to use memset if you re on gcc or g++

5294313
g++	gcc
this code will work in gcc g++ only because gcc

5294331
int	double
i have an hdf5 file with a compound type int double double

5294331

i have a pair of nested tables which seem to work fine in firefox but in ie google-chrome and safari the display is all messed up

5294361
google-chrome	safari
however in ie safari and google-chrome the cell without a width seems to get a 0px width and the other cells in the table split the remainder of the space

5294381
width	height
i basically loop over each image checking what their parent tables size was supposed to be then divide that by the number of rows to find the image height and by columns for width

5294383
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this demo in google-chrome firefox internet explorer safari opera

5294385
installation	upgrade
given that magento s core_resource mechanism allows for the sequential execution of setup scripts for installation or upgrade of modules via execution of sql and also php it seems logical imho that it should support the same process in reverse

5294393
post	get
i am making an android application where i need to send some data collected from a data to server php file using post data and get the echoed text from the php file and display it

5294588
istream	getline
number 2 is possible using the getline method of istream

5294594

but you should canonicalize the capitalization for uniqueness checks since there are many badly behaved email senders that capitalize the entire email address before sending

5294633
min	max
i am not asking about the aggregate min max functions here

5294668
bluetooth	usb
the android emulator has no support for bluetooth and usb so you can you cannot use them at least at this moment

5294670
pylons	pyramid
because i am running python in a pylons pyramid virtualenv i could not run the binary installers helpfully linked to previously

5294680
hash	md5
alhough it s not directly related ever since we ve stored an md5 hash containing letters and numbers only in the cookie to look up everything else in server-side database

5294697
versioning	upgrade
the best remedy would be for you to upgrade your ubuntu system to the latest lts versioning which is 10.04 lucid lynx

from c# ecma-334 specification operator-precedence and associativity section â 14.2.1

5294929
pull	push
for the sake of simplicity and interoperating with a less-capable system svn it is recommended that all git svn users clone fetch and dcommit directly from the svn server and avoid all git clone pull merge push operations between git repositories and branches

5294931
min	max
for the update query we need to get the min and max id s for each tag only if there are duplicate rows

or you can setup a centralized repo either through your lan if you have all access to the same internal network or through the wan like a public github repo it depends on the server you have access to

5295106
oncreate	setcontentview
you need to call requestwindowfeature in oncreate before setcontentview

5295111
opera	google-chrome
i have downloaded the samples from google o3d but it can t run in my computer.the question like this even i install the o3d plug-in again and again it always prompt me that i have to install this plug-in when i visit the samples website that i published in iis 7.the ie7 opera and google-chrome has been tested them are all the same

5295118
verilog	vhdl
as usual with dms it would have to be configured to parse vhdl or verilog this easy dms has full vhdl verilog and systemverilog front ends scan the parse tree find the attached comments dms captures comments as it parses and then attempt to parse the comments using dms s built-in pattern parser

5295145
folder	directory
you can put your images in resources folder or may be app s documents directory and just save the image names as text datatype in sqlite

5295166
min	max
or you can calculate max or min width in the group sizewithfont and use it

5295202
min	max
but putting in max would give us max - min when we actually want 1

5295202
min	max
you can verify that putting in min for x now gives a and putting in max gives b

5295206
folder	directory
i am working in a project in which is is require to upload and download a directory and their all the file and folder in java .and i also need to know that uploding and downloading status means how much percent the folder to which i am uploading has been uploaded or downloaded

5295596
cakephp	yii	codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	yii
if u want to divide the php code and html use any php frameworks such as codeigniter cakephp zend yii etc. the main advantage is if ur going to change the site design not your functionality at that time it will be very useful and also we can develop the code in reusable manner

5295620
put	get
i don t put them each into the field because i think there won t be necessary for me to query this table for operations other than get their value

5295679
stdout	fflush
the reason that it isn t working is that some commands don t fflush stdout with each output

5295705
portrait	landscape
i want the camera to lock either in portrait or landscape mode

5295705
width	height
i guess the problem is that the camera uses height and width of the full screen but my app tries to fit the camera preview inside a framelayout that is smaller than the screen because of the tabs menu so that way the image is stretched

5295712
solaris	aix
right now the platform is linux but we could be porting this to other platforms as well aix solaris

5295766
width	height
well your .pastevent contains only absolutely positioned elements so it has a width and height of zero

5295828

i have an nsdictionary named jsonitem which contain object for key pictureurl an url n try to pass it to nsurl then to nsdata and further to uiimage but it is not showing any image in uiimage

5295894
post	get
i now know that in the browser it works because i get in the myapp.appspot.com page from my browser so that s why it has the cookie whilst from the iphone i post to myapp.appspot.com but i never get in the page itself so the server never send me the cookie

5295904
nsurl	nsstring
are you sure is a nsstring if its an nsurl try this

5295973
16-bit	64bit
however even when you compile code that contains this macro for a 32 bit or 64bit target it will still be 16-bit

5295988
x86	64bit
if you are running your 32-bit process under a 64bit operating system then the maximum user mode address space limit is increased to the 4 gb even though your application is compiled as a 32-bit process - this might be useful if for example you are restricted to targetting the x86 architecture due to some references still being 32-bit only

5296003
uitableview	reloaddata
when a uitableview is created and whenever you send it a reloaddata message the datasource is sent one heightforrowatindexpath message for each cell

5296097
wordpress	joomla
so i cannot give a definitive answer as to which is the best for you but as someone who has built fairly substantial websites in most of the cms s out there wordpress drupal joomla silverstripe etc. i can tell you why it s the best tool for me

5296097
wordpress	joomla
wordpress is pretty good about this to but in my experience systems like drupal and joomla are not as designer-friendly because they require you to split up your design into lots of different pieces that are then stitched together by the system which often forces you to add markup that you don t really want to be there from a design point of view

5296103
width	height
since a element is by definition block you can assign height width to it with no problems

5296141
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
there are other tools to create programs in c# like sharpdevelop or monodevelop

5296147
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller

google-chrome	safari
while in google-chrome 10 indexof seems to be faster in safari 5 indexof is clearly slower than any other method

5296333
pop-up	dialog
the problem is that you are trying to pop-up a dialog without having any reference to a window

5296333
pop-up	dialog
you need to send the message to an activity and let the activity handle the dialog pop-up

ubuntu	linux
but when i try it on my ubuntu linux machine the jiffies returned value is different

5301086
mp3	wav
one is a wav the other an mp3

5301086
mp3	wav
ie8 plays the mp3 but not the wav and fails to display the progress bar for the former

5301086
mp3	wav
edit i tried changing the mime type to application octet-stream for both wav and mp3 and that didn t seem to do anything to the player application

5301186
alertdialog	progressdialog
so i wrote the code but the progressdialog dismisses and the alertdialog doesn t show

5301280
portrait	landscape
this is very likely if the source is for example an iphone which having just played with mine seems to store its underlying image data in landscape orientation but set the exif data if the image was actually taken and should therefore be displayed as portrait

5301301
phong	shading
materials pbr phong lambert smooth shading textures and more

5301317
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have an application with a uitabbarcontroller each of the tabs has a uinavigationcontroller attached to it

5301317
portrait	landscape
yet if i hit tab 1 2 or 4 with the interface in landscape mode the interface does not get changed back to portrait but stays in landscape despite the fact that the displayed viewcontrollers clearly only support portrait

5301320
cpu	processors
that said memory-mapped registers do exist but in any modern processors they belong to other devices never the cpu

5301354
equals	gethashcode
also note that i have overridden equals and gethashcode within the city class since the static class returning the listing of cities is creating a new instance each time

5301383
google-chrome	firefox
my application works great on google-chrome and firefox but from some reason is rises some errors in ie

5301401
pecl	pear
there are plenty of good oauth libraries out there including one from pecl one in pear another from the zend framework and this other one hosted on google code

5301401
hash	md5
it looks like many of the libraries i linked above completely ignore the format requirement and simply work with a raw md5 hash

5301419
spaces	delimiter
but the delimiter can be spaces tab comma or semicolon

5301419
spaces	delimiter
the textread function works fine if the delimiter is spaces tab

5301445
put	get
anything that you want to get back to the server you need to either put it in a form

5301472
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
so in summary just about every modern browser has websockets support in some way either built-in and enabled google-chrome safari ios built-in but disabled ff4 and opera as a downloadable add-on ie9 or using the web-socket-js flash emulator everything except ios

5301486
jobs	cron
we have several cron jobs running on our apache whm server

5301488
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it works in ie8 opera google-chrome and firefox

5301494
bmp	png
i apreciate that cr requires it to be a bitmap so i was planning to download and convert the google s generated png file to bmp that s not an issue

5301573
google-chrome	firefox
you can use a tool like firebug firefox google-chrome to see live dom changes

5301595
division	modulo
modulo is defined as the remainder of a division and is specified in php using the percent sign

5301655
nltk	stanford-nlp
i ve also heard of nltk and stanford-nlp tools

5301706
allocator	stl
if i have to doesn t that introduce unnecessary repetition and other problems in this case where c is an stl container portability issues - allocator

5301717
min	max
you can change the min and max images for a slider using the code below

5301783
allocator	stl
it is also a bit more flexible as it doesn t force the container type to support stl s allocator concept

5301794
.htaccess	httpd.conf
either the main httpd.conf or the .htaccess in this directory or a nearby parent directory probably includes

5301815
nsmutablestring	nsstring
for that i use an nsmutablestring along with the nsstring stringwithformat convenience method

5301816
udp	tcp
i ve tested lateral tcp cache with udp discovery service

5301837
button	checkbox
i have a ui that can either use a checkbox or a pair of radio button with values of 0 and 1 to allow the user to insert a boolean

5301837
button	checkbox
i have an event handler being called when the checkbox or either of the radio button is clicked on

5301837
button	checkbox
if the checkbox is checked or if the radio button with a value of 1 is selected i want to do one thing if the checkbox is not checked or the radio button with a value of 0 is selected or if neither radio button is selected i want to do another

5301839
hide	show
you can use the boolean property isminimized on the ribbon class to show hide the ribbon itself

5301839
hide	show
as far as i know the default template does not have a show hide button like office does but it shouldn t be too hard to modify the template using blend to add one

5301878
sproutcore	cappuccino
looking at both sproutcore and cappuccino they both look beefy enough to handle that kind of thing see 280 slides for cappuccino example .

5301886
maven	pom.xml
this is my maven dependency in the pom.xml file

5301966
google-chrome	firefox
it works on firefox and google-chrome but not with ie 7 and 8

5301977
google-chrome	safari
but when the page is reloaded in safari or google-chrome

5302038
google-chrome	firefox
tried in both firefox and google-chrome same problem

5302038
google-chrome	firefox
edit unfortunately the memory problem arises when i create a gmaps route in my application which doesn t seem to work correctly with ie - so i m kind of restricted to firefox google-chrome

5302040
put	get
i have a nsopenpanel and i get the url for the file from it and put it into an nsstring like this

5302061
folder	directory
it had the typical expected folder but there was one directory marked

5302120
backslash	double-quotes
if it contains only printable characters and no double-quotes or curly braces and does not end in backslash then simply put around it

5302148
udp	tcp	udp	rtp
tls and rtp work both on top of tcp and udp

5302237
width	height
however since i m expecting this window to contain several different types of information depending on the context it s content s width and height may vary

5302282
profiler	visualvm
i use the netbeans profiler which is actually an embedded visualvm to monitor the memory consumption of my java applications

5302304
width	height
edit the height and width of the div are resizable in browsers that support the css3 property resize

5302343
actualheight	actualwidth
and then once it s done sizing which will take the child elements minwidth and minheight into account run some code that sets minwidth and minheight to the window s actualwidth and actualheight

5302408
db4o	eloquera
i think that eloquera www.eloquera.com is better than db4o and additionally has better licensing

5302408
db4o	eloquera
for instance eloquera is free for commercial use and db4o not db4o has the same licensing options than mysql free for free but paid for commercial use

5302465
post	put
you should put the inputs in a form and post them to another script to handle the parameters

5302477
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
while adding the closing tag made safari run flawlessly it did somehow break ie google-chrome and firefox

5302479
hide	show
the simplest solution is to use css to show and hide different elements depending on whether they are intended for screen or print

5302507
fossil	git
as the comments already mention if you are starting out with version control you would be well advised to choose a newer system than rcs git mercurial fossil subversion ...

5302516
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
just to make sure i was right on this i also tested your site in safari opera ie and firefox

5302547
gif	png
so when i attachment a file diferent to image when i donâ t upload jpeg gif or png example zip show this error

5302551
width	height
then subtract half its height for its margin-top and half its width for margin-left

5302557
pop-up	dialog
when i pressed pause modal dialog the timer stops but video continue playing after 10 seconds the modal pop-up window destroying by js â œwindow.close â and in my code i am going to the next line and executing alert â œ resume â

5302558
profiling	instrumentation
under profiling i selected ask on launch but instrumentation never pops up

5302566
lxml	elementtree
so if you want to parse xml into an elementtree but donâ t want to use the slow builtin xml parser if lxml is available you would need to check this the moment you need to invoke the parser

5302580
hex	binary
if you save your image you ll notice in a hex editor it s binary image data with your little snipped of html appened to the end of the file

5302670
xstream	jackson
and you can choose best in class solutions to enhance your solutions such as xstream for serialization jackson json support and springs own rest template for a rest client or unit-tests

5302701
filtering	grouping
note for reference this is to grouping the names into filtering buckets by first letter where anything not an alpha character is grouping into # think iphone contacts browse grouping

5302817
cat	tee
if you re in unix at the start of your program you could mkfifo a named pipe and launch in the bg a cat from it to a tee of the terminal and the desired output file

5302844
scheme	racket
the easiest way to get started with scheme as someone new to programming is probably to install racket

5302848
g++	gcc
now i compile it with my g++ gcc 4.4.4

5302867
cvs	rcs
in fact this is essentially what cvs does though in recent versions it handles the rcs data itself rather than invoking rcs to do it as it used to do

5302867
cvs	svn
svn subversion is an attempt to rectify some of the problems in cvs though it also brings some new limitations and keeps many of the existing ones

5302867
bazaar	svn
it does however have a rather simpler user interface and there are a number of useful plugins including a distributed-development-friendly svn plugin committing from a branch back to svn need not interfere with the validity of others branches of your branches and bazaar metadata is even committed back to svn

5302867
bazaar	svn
it also supports plugins though its svn plugin isn t as nice as bazaar s it doesn t support lossless commits so branching from other peoples branches is unwise

5302949
put	get
i have put breakpoints at the dispose methods of panel and view and videoplayercontrol derives from axwindowsmediaplayer classes but none of those get hit before the exception happens

5302950
post	get
there is a chance that if your server expects a post it s not looking in the url for your parameters and if it is looking in the url it s expecting a get instead

5302969
hide	show
if you use use closeaction hide then the window can be show and hidden but you must do this with hide and show calls

5302994
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly fine in firefox and google-chrome

5302994
google-chrome	firefox
when i trigger the handler via ajax it goes into my stepin function and then does a redirecttoaction search at the end following rpg principles this is followed by firefox and google-chrome but not any ie browser and i m unsure why

5302994
google-chrome	firefox
i can add some generated code from google-chrome or firefox if that is likely to help

5302994
google-chrome	firefox
further edit checked in fiddler and in firefox and google-chrome the 302 redirect is honoured returning a 200 status code for the search page however for ie6 it seems it s not following any further

5303009
children	parent
i want the parent div to expand to the width of the children no matter what even if it means overflowing its own container

5303030
cpu	processors	disk	ram
for example you can see a dual-core 2.33 ghz processors 2 gb of ram 100 gb of hard disk vm but what you don t know is that behind the scenes your server could be throttled so that it will never use more than 33 of the available cpu resources

5303036
int	chars
for example using a base 62 alphabet i can represent int up to 238327 before the representation uses 4 chars instead of 3

5303077
pop-up	dialog
and it automatically pop-up up a print dialog asking for print

5303095
pop-up	dialog
but the other application process crash causes a dialog to pop-up on the machine asking if the process should be killed or help sent to microsoft or something

5303111
innodb	myisam
in myisam it is stored in the table s metadata in innodb in a special memory object populated with max id on the first insert after the server startup

5303166
children	parent
in this example the stretchable-div element will bust out of its parent and stretch to its children

5303203
children	parent
i didn t test this but you might have missed calling children on the parent

5303227
x86	64bit
the os is 64bit windows server 2008 running iis7 with an intel zeon x86 cpu

5303279
try-catch	exception-handling
as long as the exception-handling is caught by a try-catch nested inside the loop you should be able to continue the loop no problem

5303290
tolower	uppercase
if uppercase but no whitespace do tolower and return

5303315
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you need to call setcontentview r.layout.main before you make any findviewbyid calls

5303327
width	height
you would be better off using a 100 height and 100 width

5303360
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
indeed if you hash your password using md5 or sha1 adding a salt is a good idea btw you will not be able to recover the password

5303387
des	aes
if you want encryption there s aes des and various other functions available

5303407
sudo	passwd
you can provide the passwd to sudo

5303414
onresume	onpause
i skipped the onpause onresume but i implemented webview.pausetimers and webview.resumetimers and it at least stops the cpu bleed

5303414
onresume	onpause
i also added cookiesyncmanager.getinstance .stopsync startsync to my onpause onresume as well

5303417
vim	textmate
though i m no vim expert i ve been scratching an itch by working on a rough vim equivalent of textmate s âœ r functionality to run ruby code from a buffer and display the output

5303422
hash	md5
normally you will hash the password with md5 these days it s better to use sha-2 and when the user submits their password to try and log in hash that password as well and see if the hash are a match

5303422
hash	salt
add the salt to the beginning of the password and then hash it

5303422
hash	salt
store the hash of the salt+password and the salt together

5303422
hash	salt
now when the user submits his password to log in you would combine it with the salt hash it and check if the hash is a match

5303422
hash	salt
the salt ensures that if multiple users have the same password chances are they do their password hash will not be identical

5303425
heapsort	in-place	mergesort	in-place	mergesort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort	quicksort	heapsort
of course you just asked for advice about sorting on stack overflow so i feel compelled to ask you if you need an in-place sort what kind of big-o performance you re looking for and then ask you to choose between quicksort introsort heapsort mergesort and stoogesort for what will work best for you

5303428
width	height
in your javascript set the font size and attributes that you are trying to measure put your string in the div then read the current width and height of the div

5303504
inline	inlining
remove the inline hint knowing that the compiler is going to decide about inlining regardless of the hint

5303507
powerpc	i386
under architectures i have set i386 powerpc and when compiled finder sees the binary as universal

5303598
folder	directory
i entered the folder created the build directory ran cmake and then built the static libs which seemed to work

5303598
folder	directory
but there wasn t even a build directory in the android folder so i created one ran cmake in there and make again but get this error

5303642
post	get
check out my blog post for how to get around this -- basically you need to delete your xcuserdata for the project

5303666
memcpy	memset
of course it seems a bit heavyweight to link in msvcrt.dll just to get at memset memcpy etc

5303713
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for starters i need to test on ie6 ie7 ie8 ie9 google-chrome firefox 3.6 firefox 4.0 safari 5 and opera 10 on their most likely os

5303734
portrait	landscape
in my app i display images in portrait modes amongst other information and want to display them full screen in landscape mode

5303734
portrait	landscape
in portrait mode the images in the end depend on user interaction so the landscape class needs to be told which image to display

5303776
free	malloc
it may even be that you have to call free on the pointer if getstr created it with malloc

5303779
google-chrome	safari
it seems like the creator of thickbox 3.1 added code to disable the loading functionality on safari google-chrome

5303897
width	margin
both the inner ones are styled with no padding border or margin and as width 50

5303899
hide	show
alternatively what s a better way to show hide the full text of a post

5303935
stdout	stderr
most of us know that to redirect stderr to stdout we do

5303935
stdout	stderr
if you want to redirect both stderr and stdout of prog1 to prog2 you place the prior to the |prog2 pipe

5303935
stdout	stderr
on the other hand if you are redirecting stderr and stdout of prog1 to a file file.txt the goes after the

5303938
junit	jmock
the runwith jmock.class is for 4 otherwise you need to the testcase class that comes with jmock s junit 3 integration

5303944
gif	png
parse the html using domdocument to get the img tags while also filtering out any image that is not a png jpg or gif you know sometimes people place tracking scripts inside img tags

5303948
wadl	wsdl
wadl to rest is similar as wsdl to jax-ws soap

5303955
rss	feed
so i ve a very simple app that displays a bunch of rss feed from different sites in a listview

5303962
put	get	post	get	post	put
rest has less overhead than soap since it is just an http get post put delete

5303987
hide	show
what might be easier is to have two buttons and show hide them in your functions

5303997
gmail	hotmail
so here s another example user goes to website then website logs him into gmail yahoo and hotmail then pools all the emails together into the website

5304005
for-loop	loops
there is only a for-each loops in xslt though no for-loop with a counter

5304043
stdout	stderr
that diverts stderr from the program to the current destination of the program s stdout which is the stdout stream of the shell and diverts stdout of the program to out.txt

5304043
stdout	stderr
that diverts the stdout of the program to out.txt then diverts the stderr from the program to the current destination of the program s stdout which is out.txt

5304045
awt	swing
here you have a class which does not relate in any way to swing or awt

5304047
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
if so try to do it in viewwillappear or viewdidappear

5304065
post	get
one end of the spectrum could be a dumb browser that just talks to a service using a form url encoded post and a get while the other end could be a more rich client that uses atom odata or a hypermedia based media type

5304075
inherited	properties
__curious_geek said it s not a good idea to inherited controls to set properties this way but it s good practice to always have common base class for your business classes and screens

5304090
gmail	hotmail
simple enough encrypt them and throw them in the database once they have added gmail yahoo hotmail etc

5304112
allocator	stl
the reason i say very close to being perfectly correct is that it s possible to customize how stl containers get their memory by providing a new allocator as a template argument in lieu of the default

5304120
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
an aggregate-functions avg count sum min max grouping stdev stdevp var and varp

5304129
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception	nullpointerexception	runtimeexception	nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
runtimeexception like illegalargumentexception and nullpointerexception for example don t need to be explicitly caught because they shouldn t happen

5304143
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception	nullpointerexception	runtimeexception	nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
illegalargumentexception along with some others for example nullpointerexception are examples of a runtimeexception

5304150
children	parent
this styles only the nested divs that are children of the parent div

5304151
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
you need to read up on unchecked-exception - exceptions which inherit from runtimeexception

5304162
jruby	mri
i ve tested the above with mri 1.8.7 1.9.2 and jruby 1.5.6

5304192
folder	directory
one way i ve seen this handled on a number of very highly traffic ed sites is to have multiple folder in the inetpub directory

5304192
folder	directory
once the push to the new folder is complete you change the iis site to point to the new directory

5304196
extjs	mootools
these tools can include with a simple check frameworks such as jquery extjs mootools etc

5304215
min	max
the join condition for this table may need to be changed or you can use group by along with max min to show only the shortest longest trip depending on the need

5304218
udp	tcp
incidentally they do use bytebuffers for both tcp and udp connections

5304255
maven	pom.xml
however i have verified that the widgetset was indeed declared as a dependency in my project s pom.xml and i have also verified that it appears under the maven dependencies library icon in the eclipse ide

5304266
rss	feed
that allows you to build lists of things nodes users ... and expose them as pages blocks rss feed and much more

5304300
hash	md5
also for passwords you should be looking at bcrypt or similarly slow hash functions for passwords anyways instead of using a fast hash algorithm like md5 or sha

5304339
mef	prism
take a look at the prism 4.0 quickstart - modularity with mef for silverlight

5304361
filtering	grouping
i would prefer to associate an specific grouping django.contrib.auth.models.group called students rather than all the users or at least filtering and or validate this field to just add and view students and also do the same with the teacher field

5304361
filtering	grouping
update 1 i just noticed that maybe i could filtering those users who are in a certain grouping using the optional parameter limit_choices_to

5304422
getter	setter
also note that browser support for javascript getter setter is probably sketchy.

5304423
min	max	range	max	range	min
ie the range includes min but excludes max and values greater than max or less than min wrap around in a circle

5304423
min	max
note that the min param can be assumed to be always numerically less than max

5304426
children	parent
so the two tables form a one parent - to many children relationship

5304426
children	parent
if i use the following query i will get the parent and the children at once where each parent will be repeated as many times as many children it has

5304426
children	parent
using this approach i d have to find all the unique parent rows and then read all the children

5304426
children	parent
and use linq to merge all parent with children

5304426
children	parent
the third and final also most inefficient approach is to grab all parent and while constructing each parent object make a trip to the db to grab all its children

5304426
children	parent
this approach takes n+1 connections 1 for all parent and n number of trips to get all children for each parent

5304487
post	get
facebook is requiring all canvas apps to support http post in the iframe instead of get

5304517
post	put
i put together a simple test of an ajax jquery post within a django framework but don t really understand why the output doesn t make it to a template page

5304534
folder	directory
my conclusion when something goes wrong in the migration process and you end up with both a and a .new file in your app s folder in the application support directory you are stuck because everytime that addpersistentstorewithtype tries to create a store for merging .new it runs into posix error code 17

5304538
children	parent
from there you d read the first table creating a dictionary of the parent in a by parentid then simply read each row in the 2nd table to add the children

5304546
getter	setter
if you trace you ll see that the setter actually calls the getter if the values of what you pass into the setter and the getter are the same the binding will not occur

5304548
screens	mdpi
if you only want to support mdpi screens with 480 800 resolution you can try adding this to your manifest file

5304563
children	parent
this ensures all children from the same parent are in consecutive rows

5304569
google-chrome	firefox
could be useful for google-chrome on windows or maybe firefox though

5304603
filtering	grouping
here s the thing - i need to filtering records based on grouping of fields

5304606
int	double	int	chars
can you convert a class object to for example to int double chars etc

5304628
gif	png
this might have the answers you re looking for converting transparent gif png to jpeg using java

5304657
hex	binary
the algorithm i m using to detect the viruses is via binary converted to hex signatures

5304665
serializable	deserialization
a traditional approach is to define a c++ message structure for each protocol message and implement serializable and deserialization functions for it

5304665
serializable	deserialization
using the helper functors above and representing input output buffers as char iterator ranges only one function template is required to do both serializable and deserialization of the message

5304700
min	max
1 enforce max min lengths from the db

5304734
direct3d	directdraw
originally the names of these apis all began with direct such as direct3d directdraw directmusic directplay directsound and so forth

5304754
subobject	instances
consider that even in linked lists the container will not allocate an instances of your type but rather a templated structure that contains a subobject of the type

5304783
gif	png
png was created to improve upon and replace gif graphics interchange format as an lossless image file format not requiring a patent license

5304797
firefox	safari
this same problem recently began happening in firefox and safari circa february 2011 if not earlier somewhere about the time i upgraded firefox to 3.6.1.3 and was then directed by firefox to update adobe flash

5304819
textview	imageview
i think that you re getting npe because you re trying to create a textview and an imageview in a view where they aren t there

5304819
oncreate	setcontentview
and in the oncreate method you set the view to this xml with setcontentview r.layout.main

5304819
textview	imageview
in your custom adapter you should access to your textview and imageview inside getview or bindview without any problem

5304853
profiling	debugging
if you want it to use debugging then pull down the platform dropdown select edit scheme go to the profiling side-tab and tell it to use debugging instead of release

5304887
hash	salt
use a hash and salt

5304928
children	parent
i have a table that contains parent and children

the weirdest bit about this is that if i compile this exact same code with mingw gcc g++ on windows it runs fine

5305391
g++	gcc
the worst part is it works fine using mingw gcc g++ on windows and linux both

5305393

as we ve seen it doesn t work but also you ll need to change it every time you upgrade to a newer versioning of the heroku gem

5305477
rubygems	bundler
doing so may actually get the heroku command working but the whole point of using rubygems and bundler is that they manage stuff like this for you

5305938
post	get
i ve search and found two previous post regarding the problem but can t seem to get the solutions to work

5305939
int	double
you can mitigate this slightly by specifying that you want an unsigned int which usually double the maximum value by disallowing negative values but you perhaps ought to look into the fixed-width types available in stdint.h if you need a specific range

5305942
sorting	filtering
that way the collectionview definition would not sit in the view but instead in the viewmodel where it belongs and that would help you do all the manipulations you want easily in the viewmodel be it paging sorting or filtering

when a key is pressed in a browser three events are generated keydown keypress and keyup

5306132
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup have a keycode property which is approximately the physical key pressed

5306132
keydown	keyup
novnc needs to send the keydown and keyup events separately to the vnc server otherwise it s not a completely functional vnc client

5306144
pull	push
you can even implement push pull functionality in your repositories locally by storing your repository in a different folder

5306147

if for instances a transient non static object allocated on the heap prior to _struct2 is removed by the gc then the memory in use by that struct may be shifted into the free space used by that transient object

5306204
hex	binary
you can also view vcl rtl classes in the binary using a hex editor

5306209
integer	unsigned
we also discovered that if you want the ns uint64_t to be treated as a python long variable equivalent to a c unsigned long long then a few further typemaps were required to ensure the vector methods using values and references would instead just use 64-bit integer values

5306214
profiling	debugging
i thought at first that i could easily have access to debugging execution archiving conveniently from a single scheme particularly as each of these modes run test profiling analyze archive are selectable from the workspace toolbar

5306253
cifilter	nsimage
in fact since the false color patch is just a wrapper around the core image filter with the same name cifalsecolor you could do this without involving quartz composer at all --- just set up and apply a cifilter instance to your nsimage

there is http proxy support built into .net at the higher httpwebrequest webclient layer - but you ve already discounted this

5306298
webclient	httpwebrequest

5306547
getter	setter
using getter setter is good advice for any oo driven language so yes you should protect your internal data members via the properly exposed methods

5306547
getter	setter
a nice byproduct of the c++ language is that those getter setter will probably end of being inlined which means it s just as fast as accessing the members directly only more safe

5306551
getter	setter
getter setter are part of object oriented programming

5306551
getter	setter
since c++ lacks properties which are the only way to get the equivalent of getter setter there s really no other way to get that functionality in c++

5306554
getter	setter
don t create getter setter by default

5306554
getter	setter
there are exceptions to every rule so you ll end up with a handful of getter setter eventually but it s not useful in most applications to have more than say one or two per class very rough guess

5306554
getter	setter
maybe you need hundreds of getter and setter

5306666
profiler	aqtime
i then ran the c# app through the aqtime memory profiler and it reported that there were an excessive number of com c++ objects live on the heap

5306668

5306724
width	height
i have a web service asp.net that displays the height or width of the display that is attached to the server

5306730
mutators	getter
personally i follow the school of thought if you have many getter and mutators your class design has a flaw

5306736
getter	setter
i like an approach where you let dynamic getter and setter in a class do all the work for you

5306768
pull	push
i was able to create a repository that everyone could push and pull from together

5306837
hex	binary
you can see the relationship between hex and binary here

5306848

5306886
superclass	subclassing

5307130
hide	show
so my guess is to create a module that every time a node of that type is loading check the status field which is a field that we have created in that node type and based on the value of that field decide which node should show up or hide

5307152
put	get
this query is basically to fetch the column names of the table.there are more than million records in the table.when i put the above condition its taking so much time to fetch the first row.is there any alternate to get the first row

as such i am not aware of any scenerios in which a zero byte return code from recvfrom on a udp socket would be caused by anything other than a zero length datagram being received

5307257
vb.net	vb6
so this is one of the features that did not make the transition to vb.net -- exactly - however you can accomplish much of what you would have done in vb6 with two different mechanisms in .net looping through the controls collection and handling control events

5307258
ffmpeg	libavformat
i would suggest you take a look at libavformat which is part of ffmpeg

5307602
hash	md5
it is a bad idea to try to turn an md5 hash into a string

5308544
filtering	grouping
i think i have disabled all the text editors and text filtering for every user and grouping

5308582
post	get
if you re a little bit clever with how you name your get post variables you can minimize your view code significantly

5308582
post	get
however you need to make sure that the get or post variable names in choices exactly match including case the field names of your model

5308604
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
as of now it works properly with firefox but i need to make it work smoothly on ie8 ie7 safari and google-chrome

5308628
width	height
you can pass the width and height in as parameters

5308657
int	boolean
so this condition will be false by comparing an int and a boolean

5308658

though all data is usually unsafe basically user data sessions are safer than the post or get or cookie or simply request and some server variables since you set it yourself

5308959
put	get
it realy depends on how much prosess you want to spend for this simulation one of hte easies ways to do so is to simulate your drop using springs just put 5 or 6 nodes and connect them to each other using springs you have to play with the number of springs to get the best result and then you just have to overly your nodes to draw your drop heres the sample code though in cpp to create springs and move them

in this case my website is located on my home development server running windows server 2003 and my smtp server is a remote dedicated box running centos linux with qmail

5318190
cvs	svn
bugzilla and cvs svn or git do different jobs

5318190
cvs	svn
in brief and assuming you re writing code alone and are not doing this collaboratively svn cvs will be useful as purely versioning systems ie to keep older versions so as to be able to go back check what has changed and keep a historical record while bugzilla is used to track bugs i ve never used it so that s all i know about it

5318250
pull	push
for example if the driver had to push the steering wheel in or pull it out to make the car go faster or slower they might risk changing the car s direction at the same time

5318430
domxpath	domdocument
i m not sure what file_get_html is but you may want to use file_get_contents instead probably with domdocument and domxpath

5318450
int	chars
first int arithmetic is never performed with operands smaller than int so in the case of both the short and the signed chars operands are promoted to int the two int values are multiplied and then the result is an int

5318462
width	height
just change the height and width to whatever and you ve got a centered div

5318469
stdout	stderr
both stdout and stderr are connect to a terminal aka tty and output to it is buffered until a newline

5318483
google-chrome	firefox
i suggest that as a new developer you should get tools like firebug for firefox or google-chrome which can help you debug the underlying errors...although in this case since html simply outputs the text within the span tags the only way to know what stock_data equals to would be to view the source

5318519
post	get
i have not tried this myself but this post may get you started

5318555

5318876
puts	gets
the form gets from objc my control and puts it into panel

5318896
addition	multiplication
let s start with addition as this is simple and we can use parts of it for the multiplication later

5318896
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
i want method names that you can read like you would read the formula thus plus minus times instead of add subtract multiplying

5318896
multiplying	add
so we have to multiplying each digit i of the first number with each digit j of the second number and add the product in digit i+j of the result and pay attention to carry

5318896
equals	compareto
in the equals method we simply can delegate to the compareto method instead of implementing the same algorithm again

5318896
division	subtraction
subtraction and maybe negative numbers and division are more complicated so i m omitting them for now

5318896
multiplying	add	multiplying	division
as already answered in another answer about converting numbers we have to do division remainder multiplying add

5318906
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

5318906
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome fix

5318911
serializable	deserialization
you will have to write your own serializable deserialization support for the protobuf-net file and if you want need to use the system.configuration namespace you will have to synchronize the content of your file with the standard config file

5318935
versioning	upgrade
check which versioning you have installed and potentially upgrade it to the latest

5318941
apache	nginx
a better way would be to run it under user space and proxy it via apache mod_wsgi or nginx

5318950

5319070
strtol	atoi
strtol atoi sscanf etc.

5319074
pdcurses	conio	pdcurses	ncurses	conio	ncurses
you ll need a library like ncurses on nix or pdcurses for windows conio functions would probably still work on windows

5319085
multiplying	add
basically you take the value of each sample multiplying it by the decay parameter and add the result to the value in the buffer delaysamples away

5319115
freertos	ecos	rtos	ecos
the survey also does not consider non-commercial rtos such as freertos rtems and ecos

freertos	ecos
in 2009 for example freertos was downloaded more than 77500 times and ecos has extensive support for file-systems and networking etc

5319137
int	boolean
trying to simply cast the value won t be possible since it would require rules to handle cases like casting boolean to int

5319184
serializable	deserialization
it s important to have these accessible as properties so the automated serializable deserialization works asp.net mvc model binding and those properties must also be individually nullable to indicate unsubmitted sections

5319189
post	get
if you are doing a search page i recommend passing the parameters using get instead of post

5319198

5319571
rss	feed
to parse the following rss feed

5319571
rss	feed
i am well aware that using regular expressions to parse a context-free grammar is bad but in my case the regular expression is likely to work only for that rss feed it is a gmail inbox feed by the way and i know i can use an external library xml parser for this task it is only an exercise not an habit

5319600
fast-forward	merge
you can easily rebase feature branches in need of a review to keep them ahead of your main branch allowing the review to do a fast-forward merge and not have to worry about merge conflicts

i m converting a for-loop to use nsoperations but most of the time the code just freezes at some point through loops

5319694
folder	directory
3 to package the myhelloworld class inside a jar i created the folder com mytest in the current directory and moved myhelloworld.java to that folder

5319725
opera	google-chrome
2 buggy with ie opera and even google-chrome

5319743
google-chrome	firefox
and it actually works in ie8 and firefox but in google-chrome i have underlined all the single textes inside the two child divs

5319833
mouse	keyboard
you cannot prevent them from taking a print screen while the hint is displayed but you can capture keyboard and mouse input so that they could not copy the text from the page

5319835
for-loop	arrays
with in the addmarker function we check and make sure we don t create duplicate marker on the map by calling the for-loop and if we the passed param has already been created then we return out of the function and do nothing else we create the marker and push it onto the global markers arrays

5319864
union	distinct
then to get everything that is at level x and above you do a distinct select on all of the children with a path_length x union with the root unless you included a record of null root 0 when you started your recursion looping

5319866
width	height
the visible area in a listview would be from x 0 to x width and from y 0 to y height

5319888
gif	png
along with jpg gif and png

5319888
reportlab	pdfrw
pdfrw can read and write pdf files and can also be used to read in pdfs which can then be used inside reportlab

5319927
post	get

5319978
backtracking	greedy
so it backtracking making the greedy quantifier match one less thing leaving the o at the end of the string unmatched

5319978
backtracking	greedy
that still doesn t match the f in the regex so it backtracking one more step making the greedy quantifier match one less thing again leaving the oo at the end of the string unmatched

5319978
backtracking	greedy
a possessive quantifier is just like the greedy quantifier but it doesn t backtracking

5319997
backtracking	greedy
if it were a greedy quantifier it would backtracking and try making the only match up to the next-to-last character then up to the third to last character then up to the fourth to last character which succeeds because only then is there a foo left after the has eaten the earlier part of the string

5319998
opera	firefox
anyway this works as intended in ie7 firefox and opera

5319998
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome go quirky with it modified from

5319998
mouseover	mouseout
mouseover mouseout are the actual listeners explicitly called using apply 1 because i needed that height value for later and 2 because for some reason at least within jsfiddle it doesn t start out in the correct position and only if the listeners are called in that order will it get there

5320027
submit	submission
this might be a really stupid and self-answering question i am stripping down my submission like so but need to submit to my table and also echo out the data to the screen

5320185
width	height
a pointer to the upper-left corner and the width height of the rectangle this node describes but you won t need it in most cases or need things like the average values you can precompute to speed things up

5320185
width	height
with every subdivision you half the width and height of a region so for a square image of size n you ll need to subdivide log2 n times for a non-square image of size you ll need at most max log2 n log2 m steps

5320191
width	height
so you d need to get the node s width height and offset top and left and then overlay that with a div that has a semi-transparent background-image

5320205
width	height
how can i find the width and height in pixels

5320252
put	get
get value from textbox put it into the link of #addbutton

but on operating systems that give you a command-line window to type in a program started from that command line will have stdin connected to the keyboard and stdout and stderr both going to the terminal

5320297
implements	extends
if myclass extends abstractmyclass and implements myinterface i wanted all methods in myinterface to be advised but this was not the case

5320313

also it automatically handles salt generation a different salt per hash which makes a rainbow table attack close to impossible due to the slow nature of bcrypt and the fact that it would take a full rainbow table per password

5320802
post	get
what i really need to get to is to be able to pass a complex object but i can t get past making a post request with json content type

5320871

5321741
octal	binary
so i have this code for converting a binary to octal

5321763
put	get	ant	maven
if you have to re-get the wsdls and schemas on every build i would be inclined to put the get process into the build as a preliminary step in maven it would be the initialize phase and i would look at using the get ant task followed by the wsdl2java step in maven i usually hook the wsdl2java ant task to the generate-sources phase

5321784
jquery	scriptaculous
i m using prototype and scriptaculous on the same page as jquery so i ve included a noconflict call

if you are using an older versioning of xcode which doesn t support your device versioning then you ll either have to upgrade xcode or downgrade your device

5321851
width	height
i am supposed to display a mxn pixels image in xxy container a colleague suggested to only provide either height or width attribute in img tag

5321851
width	height
so according to him if i provide width browser will calculate the height and resize the image proportionally

5321871
width	height
yes browsers do resize an image proportionally when you provide either width or height property

5321874
fadein	fadeout
this basically runs the fadeout first once the animation is done then it will run the callback function in our case the fadein

5321894

obtaining a properties value using the get accessor would have an observable side effect

5321928
width	height
from my personal experience browsers do resize an image proportionally if you were to specify either a height or width

5321938
opera	firefox
i tried deploying with both firefox 2.0 and opera 10.11

5321954
hash	md5

better you can create a new layout where you have a imageview and textview in linear layout. textview is kept under imageview

5322025
width	height
you need to set the unit when styling width and height

5322043

5322075
userid	usergroups
such as to retrieve their userid usergroups e-mail etc

5322082
int	chars
a chars value in c is implicitly convertible to an int

5322082

hash	salt
note the difference between the when you store the hash password to start with when you generate a random salt and when you verify the stored hash when you use the stored salt

5322134
hash	md5
just hash it md5 sha1 bcrypt and save the hash value which you compare then with the hash value of each password the user enters

5322181
getter	setter
for properties that are optional you should define default value in the construct then create getter setter

5322192
width	height
for this you can use the relative layout and set its height and width as fill_parant

if you want to sort each parent s children sort the children collection on that object by itself

5325145
children	parent
you can just do it when you enumerate the results - since the parent s are already sorted simply sort each one s children

5325160

there is no direct way of doing this but you can use somewhat of a workaround - project the parent and children onto an annonymous object and then select and return the parent from the object

webgl - not yet available except as beta in google-chrome and firefox

5330872
free	malloc
on most implementations malloc and free may be called from different threads

5330877

it s thread-safe in that sense the malloc pool is process-global not thread-local but not in the sense of behaving sanely if called while another thread is calling malloc or free

5330906
hex	binary
you cannot represent 0.10 exactly in hex or binary but you can in decimal

5330912

5330938
uiview	subviews
i have two uiview a and b are added as subviews to a uiviewcontroller main view the superview

5330970

you would have to redefine the words you look up to exclude the punctuation remembering that you might or might not want to eliminate all punctuation for example you might want to keep dashes and apostrophes - but not single quotes

5330977
post	get
however that will only really work well if the target accepts this data as a get instead of as a post

5330993

google-chrome	firefox
greasemonkey was made specifically for handling your type of problem and while you need a plugin to run greasemonkey scripts in firefox google-chrome ships with greasemonkey support built-in

5331882
opera	firefox	min	max
i see in many browsers firefox opera ie that elements i give them inline-block and min max width their width is automatically sets to min-width and not max-width as expected

5331897
range	max
the example below uses a cte to create one on the fly i would suggest a permanent one containing at least 17 000 numbers if that is the max size of your range

5331955

you should use the mouseover and mouseout functions instead of hover because hover doesn t reset when you move the mouse off the element

5332101
hide	show
also the show and hide functions are easier than animating the opacity

5332147
getter	setter
here propertyname is a getter it s signature name exactly corresponds to your declared property name so if you want to check for setter presence you should add additional expression

5332161
rss	feed

most likely what you are looking to do is implements a widgetprovider which basically means extends android.appwidget.appwidgetprovider and overriding two methods

5334689
implements	extends
to communicate out information the widget provider like any broadcast receiver extends context and can issue startactivity intent or startservice intent i think this is most likely what you need to do unless you really are implements a widget host

actionscript	mxml
i am an actionscript developer and i know nothing when it comes to mxml

5335263
sorting	filtering
i m not sure i get the question but if you want to apply the sorting to the filtering objects you might want to add some sort of caching different from django s builtin caching that stores the filtering queryset and sort that

5335263
sorting	filtering
or you can pass the filtering option around using django s session management and redo the sorting query

5335263
sorting	filtering
now your sorting methods can get the filtering values that was passed originally

5335310
folder	directory
so if you are running it from the folder of your local filesytem on the file protocol it has no server and does not know that a blank directory should request index.html

5335317
width	height
the image will surely take up larger space when it rotates especially if the image is a rectangle because the height and the width are of different sizes

5335317
width	height
you will find that the paper now takes up half of its former height and double its former width

5335317
width	height
the usual solution is to make a square dimension containment with the height or width of the image whichever is higher then add a quarter to that value to accommodate the change in dimension when rotating

5335336
opera	firefox
if you manually use html5 audio then remember that firefox and opera don t support mp3

5335697
hide	show
probably the easiest way to hide and show the view is to adjust the alpha property on the view

5335727
portrait	landscape
and just for the sake of staving off any confusion it s probably worth mentioning you need to use the width of the status bar in landscape mode because uiwindow s coordinate system always works as though it s in portrait despite how you hold the device

5335727
uiview	subviews
this is in contrast to subviews uiview instances that get managed by a uiviewcontroller which benefit from automatic coordinate transformations

in that sense jgit is connected to eclipse in that egit uses jgit features to develop the eclipse git plugin

eclipse is committed to offer a good support for git through egit which should ensure by extension the development of jgit used by egit

5335941
jgit	egit
even though you say that egit uses jgit it is not quite clear in the above that egit is an eclipse plugin for git giving git support in the same way that cvs is already supported in eclipse

mouse	keyboard
these can be ui events mouse keyboard or code that you as a developper give to him

5339528
portrait	landscape
putting in that attribute should be done as a last resort and typically for activities that do not have separate portrait versus landscape layout files

5339565
put	get
and the code to get you going put this into test.rb for maximum reproducability

5339609
client-side	server-side
the solution is to validate the data they re submitting server-side not to try to prevent them from submitting the data client-side which will always fail

5339660
tetris	pong
my advice is to start small think pong breakout tetris etc... before tackling bigger games

5339662
portrait	landscape
my app runs in portrait mode but i want to show one screen in landscape mode only as it is a chart

5339683

in the meantime as a hack i hide all the videos when i show overlays in my website so i don t have this weird behavior anymore

5339694
rss	feed
the server connects to a news site which has rss feed

5339756
versioning	upgrade
we still support older versioning of our product and if i upgrade to a newer kubuntu i don t have guarantees that some ancient jdk will still be available as a package

5339756
ant	maven
same thing and similar arguments apply to ant and maven

5339756
ant	maven
finally other programs might require ant maven jdk but it s only me who uses intellij hence the different approach

5339765
pyodbc	adodbapi
personally i find it easier to use a module that follows the standard python db api such as adodbapi included with pywin32 which you are already using which also uses the com api but takes care of that under the hood or pyodbc

5339804
jtextfield	jpasswordfield
was thinking jpasswordfield was simply a jtextfield simply overriding the renderer component but it seems not to be the case

5339829
post	get
what you would need to do in this case is check that for a given request - post or get - that the particular user whose unique user id or similar is stored in the session has permission to add change delete whatever with that particular request

5339832
for-loop	arrays
thus we created a global arrays called flightplancoordinates to track the lat lng of the polyline and pushes the locations lat lng to it with in the for-loop

5339901
versioning	upgrade
this can be done 3g watchdog does it when you upgrade from the lite versioning to pro but it s an extra layer of complexity that you can avoid

5339907
switching	screens
i want to make a screens or part of the screens switching to another part in a 3d cube-like transition

5339927
operands	scalar
operands to the || and operators must be convertible to logical scalar values.

5339943
createfile	getlasterror
createfile would fail and the getlasterror function would return error_sharing_violation

5339977
many-to-many	one-to-many
user and message in terms of recipients have a many-to-many relationship but fromuser has one-to-many

5339986
textchanged	selectedindexchanged
if the user changes tabs selectedindexchanged it then activates the format parse and fires the textchanged event which makes it seem like the form s been modified

5340073
capistrano	bundler
i m using the standard bundler capistrano recipe that installs all necessary gems on the server after deploy update_code

5340076
inherited	subclassing
some might suggest the natural django solution would be to use model inherited to represent a base task model with two subclassing - installtask and settingtask

5340119
post	get
i mean i can post a link like but what i want to do is to get text that is link to domain.com

5340133
versioning	upgrade
no doubt an upgrade of ruby on rails to a newer 2.3.x versioning may also fix this issue

5340134
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
all child view controllers in your uitabbarcontroller or uinavigationcontroller do not agree on a common orientation set

5340143

example if i take a picture of fish then how should i measure the fish actual height and width

5340192
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
when trying the page in firefox google-chrome and safari i get the appropriate behavior of the file uploader marking the upload as complete and the data being inserted into a table on the page

5340236
post	get
when called before any getparameter call this only instructs the servlet api what encoding to use to parse the parameters of the post not get

5340243
qtableview	qtablewidget
alternative way is to look directly for selectrow in the qt assistant but then you will have to know that qtablewidget inherits qtableview

5340245
put	get
in my cfc i have a main cfc that get s all the data i need format s it in the various way s i need then put s those results into different position s inside an array

5340394
clang	llvm
try to grab top-of-tree llvm llvm-gcc which is deprecated by now btw and try to reproduce the issue or alternatively grab clang

5340436
crossover	mutation
my questions are about the relation between mutation and crossover operators

5340436
crossover	mutation
mutation must be applied only to children obtained after crossover or another genetic operator

5340448
ant	maven
ant is an xml configuration oriented improvement over makefiles and maven is a dependency build tool improvement over ant

5340451
hide	show
just call the hide and show methods from p commandlink

5340486
crossover	mutation
different crossover and mutation schemes may work well for different problems

5340486
crossover	mutation
but of course if you 1 say that mutation is only applied to children after crossover and 2 say that children after crossover don t mutate then the result is that you have no mutation - so that combination is probably not a good one.

5340528
devise	cancan
i use devise for authentication and cancan for authorization

5340535
packets	multicast
if your host supports ipv6 you can use the scope component of the multicast address this is the x in the multicast prefix ff0x to implicitly restrict both incoming and outbound packets to the local host by specifying a scope of 1 use the ipv6 multicast address ff01 107 for the name service server on the local host only

5340536
nscell	nstablecolumn
i have a custom nscell actually subclassing nstextfieldcell which is used both in a standalone editor and in an nstablecolumn bound to core data through nsarraycontroller

5340538
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you won t be able to manipulate your view from the java side before your setcontentview call because findviewbyid r.id.yourview will return null unless the view in question is actually on the screen

5340557
jar	war
i m sure the javascript can be improved--i m no expert--but it seems to work well-enough for me running antunit tests to make sure my osgi manifests are created correctly. as an added bonus it loads from either a jar or ear or war file or a stand-alone manifest file

5340626
disk	ram
you might want to set file_upload_max_memory_size which will force files larger than that size to be streamed to disk rather than allowed to continuously consume ram

5340641
primes	modulus
hypothesis the first n powers of two each have a different modulus when divided by p where p is the smallest primes that is larger than n

5340769
children	parent
parent contains a list of children and children refers back to parent

5340769
children	parent
retrieve a parent entity which would contain a list of all its children list however when listing parent getting list it of course should omit the children from the results therefore setting fetchtype.lazy

5340798
ant	maven
maven is not ant which is usually a good thing but this is one of the cases where i think it should be more like ant

5340812
width	height
bounds java.awt.rectangle x 0 y 0 width 1280 height 1024

5340812
width	height
bounds java.awt.rectangle x 1280 y 0 width 1280 height 1024

5340820
packets	multicast
you may have figured this out already since the question is now 2 years old but to do multicast on a single host you only have to do two things 1 make sure that your receiving multicast sockets have so_reuseaddr set so that multiple processes can bind the same multicast address and 2 make sure your sending multicast sockets have ip_multicast_loop set so that packets will be looped back to receivers on the same system

5340859
debian	linux
in case it matters my linux server is running under debian 5 within a virtualbox virtual machine

5340929

5340939
oncreate	findviewbyid
i can t findviewbyid in oncreate because the full code will use

5340940
geocoding	geocode
this works great but what i can t figure out is how to add geocoding to this so that a place name could be entered posted via a form geocode using google maps api and set as the centre point in the above script without breaking the current functionality

5340942
snmp	mib
on pure snmp point of view there is a management information base mib on your snmp device

when using webclient webrequest or htmlagilitypack it is only the html you will download

5341007
jar	war
ring has support to serve files directly from a folder ring.middleware.file or ring.middleware.static which is what i would use or from a resource in the jar war

5341010

i m uploading a csv tsv file from a form in gae and i try to parse the file with python csv module

5341184
dictionary	map
for the sake of clarity i will assume in the rest of this post that i am dealing with a dictionary map where the key string is the word and the value string its definition

5341184
dictionary	map
the way i found of doing this is to declare a second map the binding map that just binds each key of the dictionary to an integer

5341212
accessor	properties
if you change properties values using standard accessor methods core data will observe the resultant change notification and so invoke willsave again before saving the objectâ s managed object context

5341220
spawn	execv
after that there is an execv command to spawn usr bin nano

5341238
getter	setter
getter setter public

5341243
dbcontext	objectcontext
both generators produce the same entities however ado.net poco entity generator is based on objectcontext s api whereas ado.net dbcontext generator is based on dbcontext s api

5341243
dbcontext	objectcontext
dbcontext s api has a few very nice new features local query on navigation property etc. and api is somehow simplified but at the same time it looks like some features used in objectcontext api are missing in dbcontext api or at least it has not been explored enough yet

5341284
getter	setter
all the variables that i declare in the backing bean are non static and have getter and setter methods

5341308

hex	binary
so in the above method i am converting binary strings to hex strings

5341406
width	height
that is 1 4 the width height of the

5341436
put	get
then it s just a matter of someone taking the role of administrating that system and ensuring any new projects get put into source control right away

5341463
getter	setter
as i know one of the benefits using dto is that you can make all domain fields as public and remove all that stub code with getter and setter

5341497
calloc	malloc
you malloc calloc

5341526
fast-forward	merge
finally the merge of master with wip was just to fast-forward master to the end

5341526
fast-forward	merge
merge was just the safest of these because if something weird had happened it would have let you know that it was not a simple fast-forward

5341532
goto	break
notes this does not use goto or break and it does not recurse especially not from within a catch block

5341537

fixed-point is not worth the trouble anyway while that may be true on my platform i was creating this to improve the execution speed of my code on a platform where there was no floating-point hardware

5341671
google-chrome	firefox
i would recommend using firefox or google-chrome with the web developer toolbar to make html css validation easier

5341690
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
i would use illegalargumentexception or nullpointerexception in case of null argument

5341697

assuming record implements both gethashcode and equals properly i d use a different approach altogether

5341701
vb.net	vb6
i m learning vb.net coming from a vb6 and java background

what i ended up doing was wrapping the show hide options in a django template if and use the context that was being passed

5341722
hide	show
since i was capturing the selection of pets i was able to then use the if to show or hide the cats and dogs selection section

5341741
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade just now to latest versioning of pervasive server ver 10 if that helps but this issue was in 10.3 and its still there

getter	setter
getter and setter can do that transparently

5341811
rss	feed
i use simplepie to display an rss feed on my page

if i put dlr expression instead of consolewriteline method in my code and run my console applicaton i will get the same .exe file that contains cil code and i will get hello world written in the console as a result of .exe file being executed

5341889
macvim	textmate
as changelog pointed out the absolute best way to get macvim to behave like textmate is to use janus

5341889
macvim	textmate
in order to launch mvim the way that you launch textmate with mate project_dir an mvim script is included in the macvim download

5341898
getter	setter
and then synthesize the property so that we can use getter and setter

5341910
webrat	cucumber
first i found cucumber + webrat + selenium guide which is really useful

5341924
wtl	atl
edit additional info for atl wtl

wtl uses atl _atlbasemodule.getresourceinstance for the module handle in its win32 calls

5341970
children	parent
that is a2 s immediate child becomes the child of it s parent along with its children

5341982
config	ini
then use an ini config file or a database to keep track of what you should load

5342013
qthread	qmutex
if there is a lot of data as you imply in your question make the shared memory available to both either by having it in a separate module or by using the pointer that was created when creating the qthread object and protect access to the memory with a shared qmutex

5342041
int	double
using the different tryparse methods that are defined on the int double datetime and other types in the bcl you can see if the passed in string is parseable to one of more of these types

5342060
move	drag
i have a jtable where the rows can be move with drag drop

5342063
boost	stl
unfortunately i cannot use boost and limited to stl

5342090
tabcontrol	tabitem
i want to expand the software by adding in a second set of ui elements that collect different data for database b and i want to navigate between them using tabs at the top so using tabcontrol and tabitem

5342090
tabcontrol	tabitem
i tried seeing if i could change the root element of the software from a navigationwindow to a page that contains a navigationwindow inside of tabitem since only page implements tabcontrol but i have not figured out how to do this if it can even be done

5342103
gmail	hotmail
if the email s an html mail and particularly if the receiver s going to be viewing it in a web-based email hotmail gmail yahoo etc... or an email client that supports html views then injection into the body is definitely a concern - xss can happen anywhere

5342133
versioning	upgrade
almost everytime i upgrade qt creator there are some problems with it if id don t remove older versioning

5342135
width	height
i don t want to set explicit height and width of 480x800

my vsto add-in doesn t do anything exciting

5342336
vsto	add-in
i ve only recently started on the vsto add-in and noticed that now when i attempt to debug my xll i can t attach to an existing excel process

5342336
vsto	add-in
if i disable the vsto add-in then this problem goes away and i can debug the xll by attaching to the process

5342348
put	get
but i can t figure out how to get them all put in a foreach and output correctly

5342350
put	get
the issue i m experiencing is that i can get download files just fine but when i try to put upload them onto another server i get an eoferror exception

5342362
hide	show
successive show hide events can more simply use the form s visible property or show hide methods

5342366
indexof	hasownproperty
here s my full code so you can mess around and point out if i did something that invalidates my testing somehow but this seems to make sense to me using indexof it needs to iterate across the set until it finds the object assuming a purely linear collection not a tree same with hasownproperty needs to get list of all properties and iterate across them unless there s a mechanism built-in to find the property more efficiently

5342467
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this has worked fine in all major browsers ie7 8 firefox google-chrome safari opera for some time but when i upgraded to ie9 the banner is displayed with a 1 pixel shim on the right-hand edge which is throwing the layout off

5342510
put	get
but the whole problem of programming is we can never be sure of what our application is going to get put through

5342517
fixed-point	fractions
well there are fixed-point formats and fractions basically a specialized form of symbolic computation but neither are very popular probably because they don t have any benefits over float-point except for very specific applications

5342536
vbscript	jscript
one problem is that afaik jscript is unable to differentiate vbscript types on its own

5342536
vbscript	jscript
to jscript any com or vbscript object has

5342536
vbscript	jscript
the following could work â but only when the json.stringify call is done within brackets since thatâ s the only time when both jscript and vbscript sections would both have been parsed and executed

5342536
vbscript	jscript
the basic principle should work iâ m not 100 certain of the possibility to pass a jscript function reference from vbscript

5342579
dns	spf
wrong dns setup blacklisted on dnsbls invalid dkim or spf setup invalid headers or mail encoding .

5342645
hide	show
a simple toggle to hide and show areas works perfectly i need to add a class to the p tag of the one that is open and remove it when its closed

5342666
int	double
i have a class that handles several numeric arrays type double and also needs to handle an array of descriptors which will include a mix of strings and int which need to be utilized as strings and numbers accordingly

5342719
clang	icc
vs is notably famous for being extremely lax in template code validation and template code that was accepted and compiled by vs will often be rejected outright by more compliant compilers clang comeau icc gcc .

5342781
firefox	safari
in firefox safari good browsers these appear at the top right absolutely positioned

5342790
yacc	bison
i have a project which i m porting from solaris lex yacc to linux flex bison + autotools

5342962
post	get
when i change the drop down it submits but php does not get any post data

5342971
google-chrome	firefox
now the problem is that under google-chrome this code works smoothly but under firefox 3.6.15 when i resize the window then it takes a while to work

5342977
google-chrome	firefox
i can t figure out why this is happening and especially why firefox is able to access the resources while ie and google-chrome can t

5343023
rss	feed
in fact i just did a discussion search myself and found the resulting pages to have wildly differing layouts and not all of them have rss feed or use standard forum software

5343028
portrait	landscape
i have an ipad app with two different views one for portrait one for landscape

5343052
min	max
there are methods like min and max already available

5343052
intersect	contains
ienumerable also exposes methods like contains intersect and union - so ranges cannot only be queried they also can be combined

5343060
hash	md5
i don t have the code but you could generate an md5 hash code out of the album art

5343118
g++	gcc
so if you had one file called test.cpp that had two functions declared in it but one of them was unused you could omit the unused one with the following command to gcc g++

5343128
post	get
it will show you exactly what that javascript event sent to the server get or post + the data even if it is https - as well as the server response

5343169
awt	swing
this will be significantly easier if you already know something about awt or swing

5343171
jlist	jtree
most out-of-the-box swing components have support for this built in jtree jlist etc

5343234
nsmutablestring	nsstring
it sounds like it must be getting set to an nsstring instead of an nsmutablestring

5343260
post	get
i thought this would be equivalent to what i have above using the fluent api but i get a strange error i will post below

5343329
hide	show
you can show hide the background by yourself instead of using triggers

5343361
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
i know of no way to access the xmlhttprequest object from jqxhr

5343379
width	height
when i look at onsurfacechanged it is being called once when the phone is powered on with width 480 height 800 then again when after the phone is unlocked with width 800 height 480

5343379
width	height
it appears as if the surfaceview thinks the width is the height and the height is the width

5343379
width	height
i did more printing of the surface view s width and height and get this output

5343379
width	height
so the width and height appear to fix themselves sometime after onwindowfocuschanged but graphically it never looks correct

5343429
inherited	properties
settings done in properties sheet are inherited in every project

5343462
powerpc	i386
in that case your binary must have been compiled for three architectures i386 powerpc and x86_64

5343462
powerpc	i386
note however that in sdk 10.5 cocoa was not available for x86_64 so you will have to use sdk 10.6 for the x86_64 variant while keeping sdk 10.5 for the i386 and powerpc variants

5343501
tinyurl	bit.ly
a classic example to me is tinyurl bit.ly

5343564
docx	.doc
i need to be able to view a file .doc docx .pdf .txt .....ect in the system.windows.forms.webbrowser c# visual studio 2008 on a system that does not have office installed on it

5343591
profiling	instrumentation
also you can use instrumentation with the cpu profiling instrumentation to detect the bottleneck within your code

5343593
spidermonkey	chakra
definitely there ll differences between the javascript engines - chakra spidermonkey v8 and others as the implementations will vary and their support for non-standard features

5343622
google-chrome	firefox
and once you get a large suite of thousands of functional acceptance regression tests it will take hours to run even with faster browser such as the new ie9 firefox or google-chrome

opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the easy to code very rubyesque watir api and the broad browser support ie firefox google-chrome opera headless of the selenium webdriver back-end

5343626
postgresql	mysql
the row locking of h2 seems relatively immature compared to mysql or postgresql

5343626
postgresql	mysql
in addition mysql and postgresql also provide replication mechanisms instead of rolling your own

5343626
postgresql	mysql
lastly although i ve not run this performance test i suspect that although h2 is lightening fast for small to mid sized databases as you increase the database size and especially the number of concurrent queries mysql and postgresql will start to equal and then best its overall performance -- especially looking at query time distribution

5343654
japplet	jdialog
i have a japplet which contains an about button which when pressed creates a new jdialog

5343655
hash	salt
that said phpass portable hash does store the salt in its hash

5343655
hash	md5
also phpass uses php_version during the generation of those hash to check if the md5 function available with that version supports the parameter

5343665
folder	directory
i have a folder in my root mamp directory site

5343676
accessor	ivar
which will invoke ivar s corresponding accessor method

5343676

6 in the event for disclosure triangle click use nsalert s saved window frame to adjust the height size and width of nsalert

5343760
squash	merge
you can also rebase onto the existing base and use the interactive session to squash or skip commits then merge that if you want it to appear as a merge instead of direct commits

5343779
xfce	gnome
open suse lets you select xfce as your desktop environment and xubuntu is an ubuntu variant that uses xfce instead of gnome

5343779
xfce	gnome
you might want to look at one of these options if you re running in a vm since xfce is slightly lighter weight than gnome although not all that much lighter these days

5343797
hide	show
and then this is the jquery code that hide or show them

5343829
post	get
looking at this blog post you might be able to get the behavior your are looking at by doing the following

5343850
fseek	fread
now we can read just the third column using the functions fread and fseek

5343944
filtering	grouping
there is not currently a way on market to filtering for private grouping

5343988
getter	setter
you can of course get the desired effect by manually writing your property getter setter methods

5344005
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
as the title states i d like to know if there is a way to prevent mouse events specifically mousemove and not mousedown mouseup from propagating to a child control

5344050
width	height
the problem happens when i change the parent s x y or width height and the drawn object got a bad effect like left blur

i think the issue was related to gdal dropping support of the format due to a conflict with arcgis unbelievable

5344308
google-chrome	firefox
how many parallel requests does the latest version of google-chrome firefox ie support

5344321
stdout	stderr
the implementation is solid and works however i found its not too useful since you can t specifically extract things like stderr or exit status because the commands run in a sub-shell so you can only get stdout

5344393
post	get
this should pass the get parameters as well as the post ones

5344409
public	protected
the way that i ve dealt with this issue in the past is to create 2 methods a public one in the base class and a protected abstract one perhaps virtual with no implementation as well

5344439
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

this lets me get away with fgetcsv fputcsv and be blissfully ignorant of how they re broken in the real world

5344582
implements	extends
i m not sure in which direction your extends relation goes but if assertion extends ssobinding ssobinding extends ssodecoder and ssodecoder extends xmldecoder and httpdecoder then if two objects implements ssobinding and assertion respectively both will implements every method in xmldecoder and httpdecoder

5344667
nsoperation	nsinvocationoperation
writing an nsoperation subclass as mentioned before seems like overkill to perform the simple task but there is no doubt that checking for cancellation is more elegant than anything i ve come across for nsinvocationoperation

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
from safari google-chrome and firefox the form works beautifully

5344743

5344860
super	self
change it to if self super init

5344891
vbscript	vba
with a bit of work you can convert the vbscript code to vba code

5344897

uimodalpresentationstyle is used to specified whether you want the modal form to be full screen basically what iphone uses or otherwise therefore only makes sense for ipad as a page sheet full height width is the size of the portrait mode screen width a form sheet partial width and partial height or current context what the parent container uses

5345067
portrait	landscape
the issue that i do have is that i would like for all the pages to be in portrait as some of the pdf files have pages in landscape and i would like for them to be rotated to portrait

5345067
portrait	landscape
so based on the code in the link of the 1st code sample how would i go about to change the page layout of the page from landscape to portrait before i add it to the new merged pdf document with cb.addtemplate.

5345067
portrait	landscape
determining whether a page is either landscape or portrait i use the following piece of code obtained from so adapted for the code example above

mp3	wav
i would expect the result of the second expression to be true regardless of the value of the string strext any extension is either not equal to wav or not equal to mp3

5345276
mp3	wav
if your variable strext was equal to wav it would not be equal to mp3 and versa-visa

5345276
mp3	wav
i think what you re trying to say is something like neither wav nor mp3

5345276
mp3	wav
which is logically equivalent to not wav and not mp3

5345298
mp3	wav
if you want to get into second if when strext is not equal to both wav and mp3 you need to use an operator

5345307
packets	pcap
i m trying to anonymize packets from a pcap file that i have

you seem to try and open the file from a different directory than the folder where you created it

5345535
put	get
a much simpler solution is reordering the decorators such that staticmethod get applied last - put it at the top above all other decorators

5345536
jax-ws	saaj
last but not least is the jax-ws also relies on saaj

5345546

implements	extends
you should implements your own table model by creating a class that implements tablemodel or perhaps more easily create a class that extends abstracttablemodel

5345944
many-to-many	one-to-many
i regard many-to-many mappings as just a notational abbreviation for two one-to-many mappings with the intermediate table as you call it enabling simplification of the relationships

the server is behind an ips but is otherwise directly connected to the internet and will terminate the https connections from end-user browsers directly without any intervening reverse proxies or ssl accelerators or such

5346034
backgroundworker	dispatchertimer
what i think is that the application is creating 7 dispatchertimer s and is linking the tick event of the timers with the runmainsyncfortask method which inside create a backgroundworker that fetch the data from the server and save that data to a local database

5346058
google-chrome	firefox
copying and pasting the empty paragraph from google-chrome firefox didn t work either

5346107
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
assuming the first letter of the search string is lowercase if the case-fold-search is nil then replace-string does case-sensitive search otherwise it does case-insensitive search

5346107

5346176
apache	nginx
if you place an apache or nginx instance running in reverse-proxy mode between your servers and your clients you could handle some requests in javascript on node.js and some requests in your apache-hosted php until you can completely replace all your php with javascript code

5346176
apache	nginx
you will probably always want an apache or nginx running as a boring web server to handle serving all the static files the sendfile 2 system call makes serving static pages from a real web server very fast it removes the double-copy of copying data into the process memory from disk only to copy the memory into the kernel for the network card -- by telling the kernel which filedescriptor s contents you want sent over which socket the kernel can arrange to copy data directly from disk to kernel memory for the network card

5346230

i ve written an applet that works perfectly in google-chrome firefox and ie but when i try it on safari it immediately dies on init

5346340

uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
uitabbarcontroller - 1 child is a uiviewcontroller inherited class named tab1controller

5347014
multiplying	add
in a modern cpu s instruction pipeline this could be more like start a loading start b storing wait for a to load multiplying by 2 wait for b to store return instead of start a loading start b storing wait for a to load wait for b to store start a loading wait for a to load add a to c return and you start to see why the potential for aliasing can have a significant effect on performance

5347042
int	chars
performance of built-in types chars vs short vs int vs

5347066
int	chars
on any modern practical machine chars int and long will all be fast probably equally fast

int	double
i have an assignment where i need to create an arraylist of bookinventory objects with params string booknum string booktitle int qoh double bookprice

5347291
comparator	comparable
the thing to take away from this is to implement comparable so that you can implement your own custom comparator method thats automatically called when you sort an arraylist

5347325
comparator	comparable
since comparator is defined by comparable while a comparator must implement compare that tells you that your class must be declared as which means that it must have a comparator method

5347339
udp	tcp
on the other hand you could use tcp ip or udp protocols depending on your application needs

5347353

5353075
client-side	server-side
personally i would use a server-side solution for that session or database but if you want to do it client-side you would have to use something like cookies or local data storage

5353076
google-chrome	firefox
instead of the native style like in windows 7 with gradient-grey background and dark blue checks that are shown in google-chrome and firefox

5353080

5353386
versioning	upgrade
if your code is sufficiently different depending on the api versioning you re using you might want to fork your code and then merge it again later when you are confident most of your user base has upgrade to the api level you need

5353392
post	get
since the first query is just to get a list of post in the menu you probably don t need that huge select statement

5353493
ddms	adt
googling for android ignoring second debugger suggests that you re running two ddms or two adt plugins or eclipse instances

5353498
mongodb	bson
require mongodb lib mongodb bson bson .objectid

5353513
disk	ram
my assumption in the question above is that disk is as fast as ram or faster than ram

5353544
folder	directory
downloaded the libxml2 from ftp ftp.zlatkovic.com libxml and put the libxml-folder from the include folder in the devkit include directory for mingw in my case sth

5353574
disk	ram
because disk access is orders of magnitude slower than ram access

5353574
disk	ram
but if as you say disk access would be faster than ram there would be almost no reason to have ram

5353612
getter	setter
this means that for all class s it creates the setter and getter even though we wont want

5353630
firefox	safari
issue is that it is working safari firefox but not in ie

5353655
inherited	properties
when it inherited from control base class it would have many events and properties that may be not uses in usercontrol and i what to hide then in properties window

5353683
disk	ram
i m not very familiar with the options for interfacing with a ram disk via java but you re either going to end up with an inputstream which you can keep open for the life of the process and continually read from or you re going to continually poll from inside a while loop

5353711
versioning	upgrade
there is a versioning upgrade utility or versioning utility info here by infragistics

5353716
factors	matrix
we need to factors out a scalar r from this matrix to get a traceless orthogonal 2x2 matrix as in formula 1

i had the standard versioning of php which comes bundled with mac os x working perfectly but i wanted to upgrade to the new versioning so i used macports and all went well

5353955
profiling	instrumentation
yes use the memory allocations and leaks profiling that are part of the instrumentation application

5353958
try-catch	exception-handling
because of the nature of the bug i placed the call inside a try-catch to log the exception-handling and then the exception-handling does not appear

5353965
profiling	instrumentation
you ll probably want to profiling it using the instrumentation app that comes with xcode

5353983
versioning	upgrade
i have recently upgrade to the helios versioning of eclipse and noticed that after editing one of these long lines i am scrolled to the right after a few seconds the editor window will automatically scroll back to the left to the beginning of the line

5354017

all you have to do is start the app and select a solution file .sln or a project .vbproj or .csproj file the app let you select to what versioning of infragistics you want to upgrade and it will do the rest of the job

5354073
getter	setter
to show how to use property getter and setter i have made gear accessible as a short set of labels and a private state property _gear which stores the current index

5354077
hide	show
show it when you start the request and then hide it when the request completes

5354083
serializable	deserialization
however i can t tell you right now if this cost is higher than the serializable and deserialization cost

5354108
getter	setter
as a side note i m using __get and __set in my page entity instead of full blown getter setter

5354187
folder	directory
i would like to list all the files contained in a directory which path is resources folder images inputimages

5354210

i just use window.history.go -1 to return previous page in firefox it won t work if the script in a iframe it works fine in ie opera and google-chrome

5354265
setcontentview	findviewbyid
method findviewbyid r.id.share_to_twitter_webview returns null because you forgot to do setcontentview r.layout.main

5354294
qmail	exim
take a look at exim or qmail

5354304
post	get
i assume your example is a truncated version of your actual query so perhaps you should post what you are after to get a possibly more optimal query

5354384
post	get
whether or not you can use get post head delete etc will depend on the url and what s configured in the application that is running on the server at that url

5354393
width	height
no you would have to set the height width to the contents instead of the .wrap element itself

5354406
button	checkbox
under the palette there are numerous views such as the analogclock button checkbox and so on

5354421
folder	directory
i wrote this batch file after a coworker asked for help with deleting all the files except for those of certain types from a folder and all subfolders while maintaining the directory structure

5354435
button	checkbox
i also have a checkbox that when changed in the event handler i set causes validation false for the next button

i donâ t need to load the file i just need the width and height to load a texture in directx

5354499
cvs	rcs
i look back on my days with sccs rcs cvs with sadness

5354512
profiling	instrumentation
however i used instrumentation time profiling and saw that the runloop thread was always active

5354516
put	get
i have an instance of property which is abstract and i was using type inference to get the true type to pass to my ioc without having to resort to reflection to put together the right generic type

5354526
google-chrome	firefox
you can use google-chrome s console for simple stuff if it is not enough then there is tamper data plugin for firefox and for hardcore traffic inspection you can use wireshark analyzer

5354535
width	height
you re looking for the ihdr chunk and that contains the width and height

5354562
width	height
if you know for sure that you have a valid png file you can read the width and height from offsets 16 and 20 4 bytes each big-endian but it may also be a good idea to verify that the first 8 bytes of the file are exactly 89 50 4e 47 0d 0a 1a 0a hex and that bytes 12-15 are exactly 49 48 44 52 ihdr in ascii

5354564
redmine	chiliproject
i recommend the chiliproject fork of redmine

5354574
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome will return nothing but firefox will give you the json object

5354605
system.in	system.out
the short is yes but you have to build it using the standard output with system.out and using the scanner class to wait for new line input n from standard input from the system.in

5354619
folder	directory
the tfs server is already configured the build agent and controller are successfully tested msdeploy full installed and i have a public drop folder myserver drops c drops on my server configured with a domain account with full rights on the directory

5354722
realloc	malloc
if you really don t know in advance how large a buffer needs to be use malloc or realloc to dynamically allocate and extend the buffer as necessary possibly using a smaller fixed-sized buffer as an intermediary

5354752
ada	vhdl
don t forget ada and vhdl access types

5354805
notepad++	gedit
i vastly prefer gedit + gnometerminal + nautilus filezilla to the sluggish cygwin + console2 + notepad++ setup i have in windows7

5354841
stdout	stderr
in client i want to redirect stdout and stderr streams of child process to socket

5354901
profiling	debugging
i believe xcode will now handle this debugging team profiling automatically for you however i like telling it to use my development key as you know what it s doing and when they need renewing.

5354936
int	boolean	tinyint	boolean
if your field data is truly binary yes no true false enables disabled etc. then for the sake of cakephp conventions you should just use an int 1 or tinyint 1 field and then convert the boolean value to yes no etc in the view

5354963
gtk	cairo
the best way to do it would be to use a canvas like goocanvas which is made to work with gtk and draw with cairo

5354967
udp	tcp	icmp	tcp	icmp	udp
i want to create my own packet generator so that i am able to create packets of tcp icmp ping echo udp

5354970
strcpy	malloc
use malloc before the strcpy

5354980
free	malloc
if you malloc the memory you should remember to free it at some point

5354998
strdup	malloc	strcpy	malloc	strcpy	strdup
strdup does the malloc and strcpy for you

5355003
versioning	upgrade
they yielded separate hash results for the same string so now i need to get away from using string.gethashcode because i don t want to have to worry about this changing when i upgrade my app to to future versioning of .net

5355037
qlcdnumber	qspinbox
i have been trying to get the qlcdnumber to read the number in from the qspinbox

5355104
fileinputstream	filechannel
unless there s a file there can t be a fileinputstream or a filechannel

5355117
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i need to print some pages with css backgrounds but they don t appear in safari or google-chrome in firefox there s an option in page setup but i haven t been able to find it in these two browsers

5355130
width	height
i tried creating an iconview extends imageview class which overrides onmeasure so that i could create image views of the necessary size by scaling the width depending on the height

5355133
google-chrome	firefox
if you have firefox and google-chrome open load the page in firefox and then in google-chrome the images appear

5355196
super	abstract
note also that the super calls in synchronizedtable â s get and set methods statically refer to abstract methods in class table

5355201
vb6	vba
for vb6 but likely will work fine under vba

5355211
hash	md5
you could always use an md5 hash instead which is relatively fast

5355213
fgets	feof
you need to test feof fp after each fgets fp or test to see how many characters were returned by fgets fp or do a one-character get and unget

5355214
hash	md5
as a note sql server from 2008 supports has the function hashbytes that given some data a string for example can generate a md2 md4 md5 sha or sha1 hash

5355233
google-chrome	firefox
if you re using firefox take a look at firebug and if you re using google-chrome you already have one just hit ctrl+shift+j to pull up the console

5355244
stdout	stderr
since you are the proclaimed author of both server.exe and client.exe rather than trying to catch stdout stderr and redirecting it to a socket at that point you should re-engineer the client so that you re catching the text destined for stdout before it goes to stdout

5355252
bluepill	pheanstalk
i ve created a beanstalkd worker script using pheanstalk library to handle the thumb nailing of images when uploaded and wanted to implement bluepill to monitor daemonize the worker script but the bluepill fails to start the process and just cycles between starting and going down

5355270
udp	rtp
they were able to do rtp udp and in circumstances where both clients were behind nat

5355327
for-loop	arrays
is it best using a for-loop or is there a function that i can use to set all values in an arrays to 0

5355362
width	height
to a database width height

5355365
free	calloc
by doing a free and then a new calloc call you are not guaranteed for the same memory space to be assigned to your array this could be a problem if you have a pointer to this array before doing that and try to use it later

5355376
inherited	subclassing
better yet would be to create a custom activity that all of your activities inherited from place the final processing logic in the ondestroy method of the custom activity and then have all subclassing call super.ondestroy in their ondestroy method

5355388
implements	extends
public class jokeview extends linearlayout implements radiogroup.oncheckedchangelistener

5355391
memset	calloc
so you can either use calloc or get the memory from somewhere else and use memset ptr 0 size

5355397
for-loop	loops
an alternative to the nested loops method you could use a while boolean loops method outside while boolean indicating whether a change was made for-loop internal

5355413
dictionary	map
i want to define a class on the fly with properties that map to the key value pairs from the dictionary and methods based on the type of data it represents

5355434
realloc	malloc
if you need to create variables on the fly use malloc and realloc and maintain an array of their values

5355440
content-disposition	content-length
for instance are you explicitly setting the content-disposition header and the content-length headers

5355458
oncreate	setcontentview
just make sure in your oncreate to call setcontentview before you call super.oncreate

5355465
hash	md5
based on this the byte array should also be a pretty collision safe representation of the object graph and the md5 crc hash on this too

5355482
ant	emma	ant	maven
see the emma documentation for how to integrate emma into ant or maven scripts

5355574
hash	md5
i thought it create a crc md5 hash lists for these files and compare them with realtime hash

5355579
webrat	cucumber
if you set up cucumber to use webrat you can set up webrat to use mechanize by default

5355602
haskell	ocaml
haskell does reduce and simplify some of the ocaml syntax

5355602
haskell	ocaml
so ocaml has simple syntax only for single fields but haskell lets you have simple syntax for more than one field

5355639
magnolia	alfresco
for some reason i m liking magnolia far better than the others i ve tested briefly alfresco hippo

5355645

button	checkbox
the issue i have now is once the canvas is placed on top of the controls i am not able to access the controls like clicking on a checkbox button etc

5355684
serializable	deserialization	public	protected
in implementing your custom exception you ll need to provide at a minimum the 3 standard public constructors plus the protected constructor and method required for serializable deserialization although the serialization-related constructor and method may be omitted if you ve not actually extended the base class

5355691
google-chrome	safari
i tried the same request on ios mobile browser google-chrome safari ie and the cookie information is sent on each request

5355718
std	ostream
this works because the global namespace is associated with the adl lookup set for because a is a template argument therefor finding the globally declared template when instantiating the respective member functions of which will use your for t being a which then in turn will use of std ostream

5355784
width	height
i m using the loadermax class from greensock in order to load an image which matches the screen s width and height using a scalemode of proportionaloutside

5355844
pop-up	dialog
to make chainsaw work click the second check box on the dialog that pop-up hit ok start your app and a new tab should appear

5355853
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested this in firefox google-chrome and ie and it seems to work

5355950
tinyint	varchar
the choice of appropriate datatype entirely depends on how you ll be dealing with the table data in your application if any if you re having this table just for storing the records than varchar would be a better option since it ll make your data more verbose but if there s a processing to be done on the table data like filter results on certain criteria long names could be confusing when it comes to comparing them in the application logic and in such situations char or tinyint would be a better option

5355966
viewdidappear	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
should be only implemented in viewdidappear because i tried it in viewwillappear and viewdidload and it s not working in the both methods

5356045
google-chrome	safari
and for google-chrome safari webkit there is cursor -webkit-zoom-in and cursor -webkit-zoom-out

5356103
post	get
i also detail in that post how i attempted to get appkit gui to work

5356123
int	double
obviously the int value would need to be translated from 100 to 1 or 1.00 before displaying it to a user or upon user input of a currency value but this doing this doesn t seem significantly more burdensome than formatting a double or a bigdecimal for display

5356196
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome shows it opera and firefox don t

5356249
curlpp	libcurl
i ve downloaded curlpp libcurl and openssl

5356265
outputstream	inputstream
if you don t worry about using just java you could use the runtime class to execute the shell command withing java through exec command this will return you a process object on which you have either getinputstream and getoutputstream so you will then be able to process the output of both the java program and the shell command inside just one place and do whatever you want keeping it in memory and directly send it by redirecting the outputstream to the inputstream of what you use to send the mail with another exec or saving it or whatever

5356280
min	max
a b c - min max avg dev

5356284
width	height
your datagrid s if present in a control like stackpanel has a fixed width and height doesn t have them as auto

5356317
floating-point	integer	floating-point	fixed-point
it s a very good idea to use fixed-point or decimal data types because they usually don t have the negative properties as floating-point and integer data types

5356352
uiview	calayer
every uiview has a calayer which you can get via the layer property

5356400
firefox	safari

just tread carefully and write good tests so you know of any problems when you upgrade your django versioning later on down the road

5356457
int	double
if you need to apply tax for instance or multiply your cents value by a double do that to get a double value apply banker s rounding to round to the nearest cent and convert back to an int

5356457

5356508
entities	entitymanager
how do i reattach entities to the entitymanager after an ajax call

5356522
children	parent
so far the way we are doing this is to first fetch the human that will be the parent and then fetch the humans that will be the children and then add the children to an nsset property called children on the parent object

5356522
children	parent
this however requires fetching both the children and parent from core data which is slow especially given that we can have potentially tens of thousands of objects

5356523
jar	war
maven has support for jar war bin files but those seem to expect certain conditions to be true which don t apply for my flex projects i don t have a web.xml

5358250
getter	setter
in general setter and getter were a bad hack by the early gui builders borland to get around the fact that all variables should be private really this is absolutely necessary

5358250
getter	setter
a boilerplate setter getter is no better than a public member

5358250
getter	setter
they still allow full access to the variable at times the class can t control and still restrict in-class changes if your variable is an int you still have to change everything that calls the setter and getter to change the variable to a string

5358250
getter	setter
getter and setter encourage accessing the data of a class from outside the class

5358250
getter	setter
any code that accesses a member of a class should probably exist within that class as your design states and therefore shouldn t need setter or getter

5358250
getter	setter
a better pattern for those systems that need the cross-cutting variable access would be to access the variable directly through reflection but to call a setter or getter if one exists--making the setter and getter private if possible

5358254
getter	setter
for initializing it is also not good to call property setter and getter for much the same reason as above

ie8 is a must as is firefox 3 google-chrome 10.0 and safari

5359013
put	get
many compilers put the vtable pointer at the beginning of the class so you could get it by casting your class pointer to a pointer pointer and retrieve it

5359066
int	double
can we not type cast an int pointer to a double type

5359067
min	max
i would like to create an advanced search form much like a job site would have one that would include criteria such as keyword job type min pay max pay category sub category etc.

it depends if you re in an environment running epo mcafee epolicy orchestrator or if your antivirus is standalone

5359091
int	double
int is usually aligned to 4 bytes on 32-bit hardware while double usually needs to be 8-byte aligned

5359093
int	double
on most platforms double is 8 bytes and int 4 therefore no you can not cast int to double and use it

5359096
int	double
you re not casting an int to a double you re casting an to a

5359096

5359176
keydown	keyup
i ve used the keydown event as well as keyup because the former fires on each key repeat

5359177
for-loop	loops
this is not a case for a while loops if you want to loops a certain number of times always use a for-loop

5359295
mutators	setter	mutators	getter	getter	setter
if the code that uses a class only uses accessors mutators getter setter to access the object state then you can often make changes to the classes state representation and invariants while hiding the effects of the changes from the callers

5359295
subclass	accessor
an accessor or mutator method s behavior can typically be overridden in a subclass

5359295
getter	setter
it should also be noted that simple getter and setter methods are inlined by the jit compiler and therefore have minimal performance impact

5359302

firefox google-chrome ie8 .

5359313
post	get
first when there are two implementatios for one action post get then an exception is throwed

5361527
google-chrome	safari
when i do that with either google-chrome or safari both webkit-based browsers if i inspect the element with the built-in tools it has no style.display property at all and so the default div style of display block is used

easy enough with the built-in tools in google-chrome or safari to set a breakpoint on the code creating the div and walk through it

5361527
firefox	safari
i m using built-in inspector in both firefox and safari

5361527

i recently figured out how to use objectoutputstream and objectinputstream to send objects over a simple java socket connection between a server and a client

5366083
outputstream	inputstream
i would suggest writing instrumented inputstream and outputstream which just pipe to from streams provided at construction time while counting the number of bytes going through

5366094
int	double
remember that the c++ language directly defines + for arguments of double and int there is no standard conversion involved

5366094
int	double
double operator+ double int -- requires one user-defined conversion and no standard conversions

5366094
int	chars
in this subclause the term promoted integral type is used to refer to those integral types which are preserved by integral promotion including int and long but excluding chars

5366100
versioning	upgrade
however this application can upgrade itself which is done by replacing the actual code written by me .py files with new versioning downloaded via the internet

5366105
nsoperation	nsautoreleasepool
according to the documentation you should create an nsautoreleasepool in the main method of your nsoperation

5366105
nsinvocationoperation	nsblockoperation
the documentation for nsinvocationoperation and nsblockoperation doesn t specify whether they create an autorelease pool for you so to be safe it would be best to create one when using those classes too

5366127
background-image	background-position
the concept is to set the image as a background-image property of a container like a with a background-position of center center and the position of the container to relative or anything non-static

5366127
gif	png
the first is a position absolute clipping circle image of the color of your background either transparent png or gif i prefer the former and the next four are divs also with absolute positions that have left right top and bottom attributes set to 0 for each of the respective sides they will clip

5366127
width	height
the idea is to animate the top left width and height of the clipping circle image and synch up the width and height of the clipping divs using the step callback option of the .animate call by matching them to the current left and top values

5366215
mouse	keyboard
it allows you to launch a browser and programmatically control mouse clicks and keyboard presses to do exactly what you need

5366241
post	get
1 make the login post into a get

5366242
getter	setter
if you think you might need a more complicated getter or setter later the automatic property syntax lets you upgrade without recompiling all callers

5366281
ubuntu	linux
i need to install libgtk in ubuntu linux

5366282
post	get
if you want to send a get post request use or or the generic method

5366288
public	protected
public private protected

5366288
public	protected
also you can have get and set with public private and protected which can also

5366296
getter	setter	accessor	properties
properties just offer a nicer syntax for getter and setter aka accessor and indeed a properties just wraps set and get methods under the hood

5366333
solaris	bsd
the hosts file is etc hosts in linux bsd os x solaris or c windows system32 drivers etc hosts in windows

5366333
solaris	bsd
you ll need to edit this file as root with sudo or pfexec in bsd linux solaris os x or as an administrator in windows

5366344
width	height
the width and height cannot be clicked upon also there is no uitableviewcontroller so i just used uiviewcontroller

5366344
width	height
change the width and height

5366382
google-chrome	safari
i know this works the way it should in google-chrome and i think safari since they are both webkit

5366406
put	get
however when i put it all together i get the following error

5366412
post	put
note put is idempotent and post not

5366447
post	get
the problem is when i curl the page to get the hash and when i include it as the post value in my next curl call to the same page the hash is not valid anymore since the succeeding curl cal is like the page refreshed already and it regenerated a new hash

5366513
punctuation	words
i am working with a text where all n s have been deleted which merges two words into one like i like bananasand this is a new line.and another one. what i would like to do now is tell python to look for combinations of a small letter followed by capital letter punctuation followed by capital letter and insert a whitespace

5366516
hide	show
in your case you hide your elements by default then show it again inside the load function after your binding has loaded

5366524
junit	testng
rather than putting your test steps in a database table it s probably better to use a testing tool like junit or testng to organize your tests

5366524
junit	testng
learn a testing framework like testng or junit

5366601
uiview	subviews
in the first case the uiwebview is a subviews of the uiview

5366612
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
if that is the case just wrap a dataoutputstream on top of that bytearrayoutputstream and call writeint somesequencenumber before writing the image data to the stream

5366613
integer	unsigned
i ve tried to convert using a mask like so but if i 1 the other end of my stream a serial device expecting uint8_t thinks i ve sent an unsigned integer 6

5366643
onresume	onpause
i ended up using step 2 and setting my header object to null in onpause and resetting it in onresume that way the garbage collector could free up the resource

5366647
jdom	xerces
here is a variant that works if rome jdom and xerces are in the class path

5366683
filewriter	printwriter
printwriter pw new printwriter new filewriter c output.txt

5366842
uilabel	uitextview
the exercise detail is blank right now but will eventually load a uilabel or uitextview in the same exercises s detail view

5366891
nullpointerexception	illegalstateexception
unchecked exception generally happen at runtime example nullpointerexception illegalstateexception

5366949
uitableview	nsindexpath
i want to respond to a deleted event in the same way i would respond to a selected event where i get the dialogviewcontroller uitableview and nsindexpath

5366957
onresume	onpause
in your activity class implement the methods onpause onresume

5367001
ssl	https
you need to ensure the page is accessed through ssl https and you need to securely access your credit card processor

5367017
cvs	svn
change the use this reference source to a scm provider like cvs svn or git

5367024
hide	show
so i hide the comments in blog list page but i want to show comments count in list page

5367056
children	parent
the number of children in each parent varies and is unknown but the children must line up in a row without wrapping to a new line

5367056
children	parent
example if all three children are 150px the parent should become 450px so that none of the children wrap

5367056
children	parent
if there are two 150px children the parent should become 300px

5367056
children	parent
but the parent needs to vary based on it s children and not be a fixed width

5367064
maven-dependency-plugin	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
resolving duplicate jars with maven is best done with a combination of the maven-dependency-plugin and maven-enforcer-plugin under maven or sbt s dependency graph plugin then adding those jars to a section of your top-level pom.xml or as imported dependency elements in sbt to remove those dependencies

5367130
hide	show
you also need to initially hide the image and show the loader gif

5367131
post	get
i know what get and post methods are in ajax but i was wondering how to implement them into a simple code so i can understand it better and here s a simple code i found

5367144
post	get
you need to post code to get a really accurate answer

5367168
valgrind	memcheck
i would run the program under valgrind memcheck

5367215
superclass	subclassing
in case you want to enforce the subclassing have their own version of printme just make the printme method in the superclass as abstract

5367230
superclass	subclassing
i would define an abstract method called .print on the superclass in such a way every subclassing of car must override it and have your own way of printing

5367245
wav	ogg	mp3	ogg	mp3	wav
i d expect audio formats with little compression like wav and midi to consume fewer cpu cycles than mp3 or ogg at the cost of higher ram usage

5367254
getter	setter
update note that getter and setter may simply get or set an instance variable but they might also do a lot of work such as going into the db and check the existence of a record and if not create it etc

5367266
int	double
you re comparing a double with a constant which is problematic for floating points numbers using int selected will probably do better or in case you need to use a double try using something like

5367273
min	max
you ll need to adjust the min max instance properties of the asg to accomodate whatever use case you re trying to satisfy

5367278
union	distinct
take into account that the union operator selects only distinct values by default whereas union all will also select duplicates

5367289
getter	setter
the need to use self in the setter is to avoid ruby setting the value as a local variable while the lack of the use of self only works in the getter instance when there is no local variable of the same name being used in that context

5367318
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
make sure that you re nextwindow uiviewcontroller has reference to the uinavigationcontroller

5367345
wav	ogg	mp3	ogg	mp3	wav
as for wav mp3 aac ogg all of those have the same technique which is what paul suggests in his answer

5367350
autocomplete	autosuggest
personally i would consider gwt too heavy to just add an autosuggest to a simple web page and instead use something like jquery autocomplete

5367358
postorder	inorder
we know the pre-order inorder and postorder traversals

5367362
getter	setter
the code in the .m file is instructing the objective-c compiler to automatically generate getter and setter for the animationlayer property using the _animationlayer variable to hold the actual value that is set

5367362
accessor	properties
setting the value using the properties accessor does

5367397
getter	setter
if you are willing to break the conventions you can write your setter using jquery style using the same method for getter and setter depending of whether it has arguments or not

5367411
post	get
post and get

5367457
subtract	add
simple when the song changes set a variable foo somewhere to the current time and set another variable bar to the new song s current playback time usually gonna be 0.0 . when the song changes again subtract the value of foo from the current time then add the value of bar

5367470
width	height
the trouble is that when the second ball comes into contact with a stage boundary and is supposed to simply reverse its x or y velocity depending on the boundary hit it also apparently increases its width and height properties for some odd reason

5367470
width	height
the graphic doesn t change but the values of width and height do drastically and this results in some stuckhandler methods i ve defined for the odd situation where a ball ends up partially offstage getting called repeatedly

5367470
width	height
nowhere in the code do i change width height or scalex scaley properties so i have no idea why this is happening

5367470
width	height
width height properties indicates the width height of the display object in pixels

5367470
width	height
the width height is calculated based on the bounds of the content of the display object

5367470
width	height
when you set the width height property the scalex scaley property is adjusted accordingly

5367470
width	height
you can see that the width and height properties increase dramatically just after a velocity reversal which indicates collision with a boundary

5367482
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome does not provide an extension api to access the info from the operating system like firefox does

5367483
mouse	keyboard
other than that you could employ various ad hoc ways of tracking the mouse and keyboard action before the user tries to unload the page

5367540
postorder	inorder
because it is bst inorder can be sorted from pre-order or postorder 1

5367540
postorder	inorder
similar for postorder and inorder

5367549
subtraction	addition
i note this program is only for addition not for subtraction i

5367576
firefox	safari
this site doesn t care about ie try it in firefox or safari change the browser width and notice how the width changes using this property

5367580
free	realloc
when realloc moves the memory area and does return a different pointer it calls free on the pointer it was called with

5367619
getter	setter
it seems to have two properties with setter that are never used and getter that are basically lazy references to static members

5367647
portrait	landscape
now when the phone goes into landscape mode all of the objects in the nsmutablearray are deleted from the view but not from the nsmutablearray then when the phone goes back to portrait mode i put all the objects contained in the nsmutablearray into the view but when i try to access the first object i receive exc_bad_access

5367688
google-chrome	firefox
on top of that if you plan this plugin extension to also work for browsers other than ie then you can develop a cross browser extension once using an extensive unified api and we will make it work for google-chrome and firefox

5367688
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox each one gets a a native extension file crx and xpi respectively while ie a special exe engine to run your app

5367702
width	height
however for the wrapping to occur you need to give your label a correct width and height if the height is not big enough you won t see the other lines under the first one

5367709
google-chrome	firefox
i have a jquery ui datepicker control in my asp.net mvc application and it works fine in ie and firefox but it doens t work in google-chrome when i click the datepicker button

5367851
klocwork	coverity
higher-end tools vendors include the likes of coverity polyspace an abstract analysis tool cantata ldra and klocwork

5367862
width	height
see and change the width height of the result panel to see it working

5367870
width	height
the x and y origin of a new bitmapdata object top left is the same as the x and y origin of the circle center but it s not possible to translate the x and y position of the bitmapdata.draw - its parameters only accept width height transparency and fill color

5367897
yacc	bison
i would like to use tools like yacc flex bison - but the problems i am facing are -

5367940
yacc	bison
to get started with yacc and lex or the gnu versions bison and flex i can recommend tom niemann s a compact guide to lex yacc

5367941
post	get
i followed this post to get apps localised

5367955
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately though it works in firefox and google-chrome it doesn t seem to work in ie as the demo demonstrates.

5367972
portrait	landscape
the problem comes when i change my phone view from portrait to landscape or vice-versa the button text gets reset

5368028
typedef	struct
i want to keep other people from accessing data directly so i thought i d declare the structure in the .c file instead and use something like extern typedef struct point

5368046

5368109
post	put
you can create this resource by doing a put +info with response 200 ok or post +info with a response of 201 created and location sessions 123334

5368109
post	put
the authentication process can then be done by following links and filling in forms put + post to authenticate create session resource

5368193
folder	directory
the .net code is presumably trimming the directory and so the folder with white space get lost

5368206
colorbox	thickbox
- switched from thickbox to colorbox to try and resolve this issue and because thickbox isn t supported for a long time now

5368282
isr	freertos	rtos	isr
freertos itself only defines what rtos calls are valid in an isr

5368285
margin	height
i ve tried the css display table-cell option and it didn t work so i m using jquery to detect the height and then apply a top margin if necessary in order to accomplish the centering - which works when something needs to be adjusted but then doesn t work to readjust it to have a top margin of zero

5368289
postgresql	mysql
i read with great enthusiasm the question entitled migrate from mysql to postgresql on linux kubuntu

5368337
versioning	upgrade
once everything is upgrade to the required versioning run

5368358
slider	jcarousel
i m using jquery jcarousel for a slider after few mins i found the way to stop the slider on mouseover but the problem is it doesn t stop immediately on mouseover it only stop at the end of the image set 3 images in my demo

5368405
sequence	permutation
there exist mathematical problem it is the problem of generating sequence of n unique random numbers random number is element of n 0 ... n like permutation but without using memory

5368473
int	chars
a chars is really an int type

5368473
int	chars
the chars type a chars contains a single 16-bit unicode chars that are actually represented by unsigned 16-bit int

5368504
int	chars
it looks like decompiler treats difference in constant types as difference in the types of local variables also it can use the signature of print choosen by compiler as a hint to determine the type of t and variable names are generated depending on types c for chars i and j for int

5368508
getter	setter
since you refer to arraylists and getter setter i assume you have a java background

5368508
getter	setter
getter setter are done in the form of properties in c#

5368508
dictionary	map
the dictionary is like a map in java

5368514
int	chars
jvm and bytecode do not distinguish between chars and int per se

5368524
range	max
so you would be creating a list then generating a random number in the list s range 0 to the size of the list as the max

5368542
int	chars
now some are pretty obvious like chars int etc

5368548
min	max
just to add that my x axis min and max are -2v and +2v and for y axis i would have -10ua to +10ua that is 10 10 -6

5368594
user-controls	tabcontrol
the tabcontrol recognizes automatically that this special workspace item in the collection is of type myspecialviewmodel and selects the right view user-controls through the datatemplate we have defined to connect viewmodel and view and displays it in a new tab

5368597
apache	nginx
note with some linux distributions the php.ini file used in cli is not the same one as the one used with apache not sure about the one used for nginx

5368603
int	chars
however an int is a chars just like a letter and can be part of a string

5368617
config	ini
mozilla offers this possibilty by editing the user ini plus a setting in about config

5368626
width	height
check the manager.sublayout int width int height api

5368626
width	height
so at some point after the screen has been constructed but before it is painted the ui framework calls its sublayout int width int height where all layouting measuring happens all child fields get their sizes

5368670
int	double
as said local variables for the vm can only have the types or more exactly can be accessed with commands for int long float double and reference - so all int types apart from long are treated as int internally

5368670
int	chars
the first variable remains chars since this is the argument type of the println method called here so the compiler has some way to guess it while the other two variables are not used anymore so they stay int here

5368680
getter	setter
you could achieve the same by using getter and setter

5368703
google-chrome	firefox
here s a basic implementation that works in current versions of ie firefox and google-chrome

5368891
integer	unsigned
a cyclic right shift of 30-bit unsigned integer x is a number obtained from shifting all bits of a binary representation of x right by one position and moving the most significant bit to the least significant bit

5368891
integer	unsigned
which given a 30-bit unsigned integer x finds its right cyclic shift which has the maximum value

5368891
integer	unsigned
you may assume that the argument x is always a 30-bit unsigned integer

5368961
google-chrome	firefox
in ie and google-chrome all tabs starting playing when pages load but in mozila firefox it starts playing when you click on the tab

5368992

5369157
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
code above works fine in firefox google-chrome safari but in ie nested table does exceeds the screen height exactly by the height of header above thus causing vertical scrollbar which is an undesired behavior

5369163
post	get
you are probably mixing get and post requests

5369163
post	get
edit it can but still check if your form is sent as get or post and update the variables accordingly

5369190
sfx	zipfile
this possibility is exploited in producing self-extracting zip files sfx an exe which reads itself as a zipfile and extracts the entries contained within

5369190
sfx	zipfile
an sfx is basically comprised of some stub exe logic that knows how to read and extract any zipfile plus a variable set of zip entry records

5369238
backgrounding	multitasking
later the developer needs to change the protection class to ksecattraccessibleafterfirstunlock because the application must access it in the backgrounding multitasking

5369240
datamapper	activerecord
use datamapper instead of activerecord

5369402
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox	background-color	transparency
with background-color transparency firefox shows image google-chrome and opera doesn t

5369402
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
opera shows image only when using background-color rgba 0 0 0 0 firefox and google-chrome shows in all cases

5369475
folder	directory
however as the pages utilising the footer are spread across a variety of different directory levels the image paths in the footer are not correct for the pages in sub directory assuming my image path is and my image folder is in the lowest directory

5369565
maven	pom.xml
so i need a maven pom.xml dependencies element that pulls down the minimal dependency set hibernate spring database and test frameworks etc

5369568
post	get
hidden fields are just like any other form fields when you get to the post action being sent to the server

5369582
put	get
for example you use a put request to update the state of a resource but you only want the put to be actioned if the resource has not been modified by someone else since your most recent get

5369583
public	protected
the class has public or protected properties in your example specifically the collection property that contains the order lines

5369583
public	protected
the class has a public or protected parameterless constructor

5369600
iboutlet	ibaction
make sure there are no invalid connections connections to non-existent iboutlet or ibaction

5369612
getter	setter
make the fields private introduce getter and setter methods and you can call whatever you like within the setter if the value s changed

5369650
implements	extends
this is implements in java via extends obserable and having objects that want to be notified implements the observer interface

5369716
versioning	upgrade
i didn t realized that apple had also released a versioning of xcode 3 that includes ios 4.3 allowing you to postpone the upgrade to xcode 4

5369747
implements	extends
you could either implements runner directly or extends parentrunner

5369748
listview	gridview
you cannot put listview gridview etc inside each other or inside a scrollview

5369757
virtualenv	setuptools
usually i installed distributed easy_install aka setuptools in my global python installation together with virtualenv

5369826
post	get
difference is that in specific calls .get .post .load some parameters of .ajax are fixed and as a result you can not send a post request using .get or get request using .post

5369873
width	height
as to a lights-out effect usually this is implemented by creating a 100 width 100 height div that is layered above the rest of the content

5369885
firefox	safari
the form works fine in firefox and safari where you can click anywhere in the text input field to gain focus

5369924
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu systems you can install it by typing

5369970
many-to-many	one-to-many
at a glance if modification represents a version or change to a page it should be one-to-many not many-to-many

5369974

exc_bad_access is a hard crash not an exception-handling which is why the try-catch won t catch it

5370079
button	checkbox
checkbox radio button combobox do inherit from qwidget

5370089
hash	salt
i think sending the hash is a bad option then i must generate a random password convert to a hash + random salt replace it in the database and send the new random password by email

5370115
hash	salt
passwords should only ever be stored as salt hash

not sure what you re trying to do here when you use polymorphism the ultimate goal is to create the proper subclassing beta and it inherited all of the methods of superclass alpha

5370168
put	get
i believe it doesn t matter where you put the pointer qualifier asterisk and i thought i would ask the question to get clarification to know for sure

5370232
rss	feed
when i open my app it parses an rss feed and displays the results in a tableview and there are no leaks but if i press my refresh button it leaks a lot

5370242
bellman-ford	dijkstra
you could consider the bellman-ford algorithm but unless you re dealing with negative edge weights i find dijkstra s algorithm preferable

5370253
fancybox	colorbox
use fancybox or colorbox they are simple and easy to integrate

5370271
accessor	properties
1 declare a new string as an instance variable with properties to synthesize the accessor

5370296

5370344
button	checkbox
i want when button1 text is select all then i clcik on button then all the checkbox will be checked and button1 text will be unselect all ..

5370344
button	checkbox
if the button text is unselect all then all the checkbox will be unchecked .

5370349
filtering	grouping
i have also tried querying the feed for a grouping and filtering for feed items with this seems to work pretty well for getting all events from a grouping although you have to explicitly query for each event to get event information

5370355
xlwt	xlutils
xlutils requires both of the xlrd and xlwt packages

5370396
put	get
i ve been through a few documentations but am not able to communicate to the datastore yet...can anyone give me a sample project code of objectify used in gwt web app i use eclipse ...just a simple put and get action using rpc should do...or atleast tell me how its done

5370408

in the merged list take the next item compare that one to all items except the one you just checked

5370523
ubuntu	linux
i am using linux ubuntu 10.10

5370560
mouseover	mouseenter
mouseover mouseenter not fired by browser on animated moving element

5370560
google-chrome	firefox
the animation between my firefox and google-chrome seemed identical

5370595
yacc	bison
other preprocessors such as yacc bison use the same mechanism to relate c errors to the correct lines in the input .y file

5370609
google-chrome	firefox
there is a difference in how firefox and google-chrome render the padding in css

5370609
google-chrome	firefox
what appears correct in google-chrome is extra padded in firefox

5370628
public	protected	access-specifier	protected
with accessor i mean access-specifier like public private protected etc

5370635
lisp	scheme
that s a hard question to answer impartially especially because many of the lisp folks would classify scheme as a lisp

5370635
lisp	scheme
the scheme people really like the parenthesized syntax that they took from lisp

5370636
post	get
using powershell i need to make a http post and also get request

5370648
inherited	properties
the content pages would not inherited from the master page but instead reference it using the masterpagefile properties

5370655
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome render padding exactly the same way

5370670
post	get
i get that when i try and add edit a post

5370689
button	checkbox
i need to show 5 radio button when a checkbox is checked the checkbox represent languages that the user speaks so for each of the selected there should appear 5 separate radio button for how good they speak it 1 to 5

5370689
hide	show
and i tried to hide a present control with css but then when the script show it it is there only invisible

5370715
width	height
the only thing to keep in mind is that setting it at runtime won t work for the width and height of the stage

5370736
puts	gets
my entitymanager persist gets id from sequence and puts it to my image object but the image object itself is not showing up in the database

5370754
int	boolean
when the doinbackground is complete i want it to pass an int value or perhaps a boolean value to the postexecute and then the rest of my code will execute

5370756
awt	swing
the problem is that awt and thus swing does not give us enough events - there are mouse-clicks mouse-moves and mouse-drags but nothing like two- or more-finger movements which are used in modern touch applications

5370758
accessor	properties
or if you need to do the above in a number of places you might want to implement an accessor for the ergtimes properties so that you can add a time directly

5370794
rss	feed
xgoogle has unfortunately stopped working for me but i ve found out that bing doesn t mind scraping their results as long as you use their rss feed found here

5370804
width	height
my program draws text strings into rectangles by working out the width and height of the text and selecting a smaller font if its too big for the rectangle

5370818
int	boolean
if you want your login class to accept an int or boolean in the postexecute result method you must specify in the asynctask s generic types what type of value to pass in

5370818
int	boolean
please note that these are the objects int and boolean rather than the primitives int and boolean

5370818
int	boolean
you should have no issue returning an int or boolean from your doinbackground method integer... as autoboxing should take care of the conversion

5370872
textblock	itemscontrol
fulltext is bound to the visibility property of two textblock inside the datatemplate of the itemscontrol

5370872
textblock	itemscontrol
i copied the visibility property as-is from the textblock both of them independently to the itemscontrol and it works correctly

5370875
mergesort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort	quicksort	heapsort
any good implementation of quicksort heapsort or mergesort is likely to outperform it by a wide margin

5370905
pop-up	dialog
is there anyway to have the jqgrid pop-up set the correct zorder so this window shows on top of in front of the jquery ui dialog so this is usable

5370908
hide	show
you could put the controls that you want to show and hide inside of a div then just show or hide the div as necessary

5370926
postgresql	mysql
i m trying to update supplier table on both postgresql and mysql using the following update statement

5370957
typedef	struct
there is a typedef for a template specialization named ostream which obviously comes from the standard header and there is a struct ostream defined somewhere else in your code which you must seek to find and rename ramove

5370969
typedef	struct
the compiler can t tell if ostream refers to your struct ostream or the more complex typedef exported by the standard header file

5370971
folder	directory
on startup check if the examples folder is in the application storage document storage directory

5370971
folder	directory
if it doesn t exist copy app examples folder into the application storage document storage directory

5370988
postgresql	mysql
you can solve it by using the coalesce function available in both postgresql and mysql like so

5371029
cos	sin
open up your textbooks on sin cos and tan since you re using bangle

5371029
cos	sin
specifically you ll probably be looking sin for the vertical motion and cos for the horizontal motion

5371029
cos	sin
also you could consider caching the horizontal and vertical speeds since sin and cos are expensive

5371033
cos	sin
first convert the angle to a vector using the sin and cos functions

5371069
geocoding	geocode
there s nothing to stop you doing it but chances are if you continuously abuse the reverse geocode your app may get pulled or reverse geocoding requests will simply fail until your rate limit is reset

5371086
autocomplete	typeahead
s autocomplete anything suggest-style dropdown but the answer is 2 years old and seems to reference an fbml tag called typeahead which is no longer in use

works fine in google-chrome sorta works in ie but the bullet point shows up only after it s fully faded in and just doesn t work at all in firefox 3.6

5371224
disk	ram
save a copy of the system s ram to disk regardless of memory locks

5371241
width	height
then you should be able to calculate the bounding box for each of the layouts for given instances of rectangles 1...4 hint for the first case width sum of widths of 1...4 height max of heigths of 1...4

5371257
width	height
the listview should take up all the available height and as much width as possible while the relativelayout should be a small as possible and vertically centered within its parent

5371270
portrait	landscape
i was wondering if it is possible to get an uploaded images dimensions using php so that i could set it as a portrait landscape image which would help in making thumbnails that don t look awful

5371285
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
now all of that works perfectly in ie surprising google-chrome opera safari

5371285
addclass	removeclass
it works fine with addclass just not with removeclass

5371311
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 4 rc and google-chrome 10

5371311
google-chrome	firefox
please see screenshot below - google-chrome on top firefox below

5371438
background-color	transparency
by the way if you had an opaque background this would be very easy - you could just add a background-color property to the set to the color of your background and the transparency would work

5371459
width	height
i have the following script that returns the height and width of the image on my local server using php 5.2.6 but not on my shared hosting account using 5.2.17

5371484
maven	pom.xml
im currently developing a eclipse plugin which can download required jars and dependencies form maven without the maven compiler or pom.xml files

5371537
getter	setter
it is placed behind a proxy with getter setter that can capture and handle any changes

5371545
super	extends
when you extends a class that has required constructor arguments you must provide them using super

5371555
put	get
can someone tell me how to put in the parameters for the odeint function for the python to get the integral

5371555
put	get
i am trying to get the integral of e x from 0 to 2 but i am not sure how to put in the parameters

5371596
width	height
a quick but also dirty solution is to set the width height explicitely to 10 pixels via

5371673
prepare	execute
then produce a prepare statement handle and execute with the appropriate parameters - you ll find plenty of examples else where on stackoverflow

5371679
eigen	lapack
you should probably use something like eigen lapack vtk libraries and follow the style there

5371680
implements	extends
so one should think twice before implements that interface on a class high up the inheritance tree or extends it in an interface

5371688
versioning	upgrade
please upgrade to the latest versioning

5371689
google-chrome	firefox
i hear there s webgl for firefox 4 o3d for google-chrome and shockwave has been around for a decade for all browsers

5371696
converter	multibinding
in this case the multibinding requires a value converter defined

5371712
google-chrome	firefox
it s already built into google-chrome 9+ and will be in firefox 4 it s in the beta versions already

5371731
lwjgl	jogl
there are simply too many bloat layers on java2d for it be anywhere near as fast as an lwjgl or jogl app

5371800
put	get
i want to get all the rows back for comp101 and put it into coursepermissions

5371800
put	get
then i want to get all the rows back for comp102 and put it into coursepermissions

5371868
width	height
my app needs the height and width of the extended imageview

5371894
serializable	deserialization
i assume you want to do some general operations on those events like isolatedstorage or serializable deserialization operations

5371909
inherited	properties
finally i found the solution the code showed is wrong i added a jribbon as a properties in my jribbonframe but by default when a class inherited from a jribbonframe conatains the jribbon element

5371911
next	except
everything seems to work great except the fact that previous and next links don t work at all

5371950
vrml	x3d
for other way of doing 3d on web you can use something like vrml x3d flash got something serious but here is the good thing that happen with webgl

5371950
google-chrome	safari
i think it won t take long til it google-chrome and safari will be doing the same

5371995
getter	setter
not sure of exactly what is causing your described behavior but you re probably better anyway to have your toarray method call getter setter rather than having toarray operate directly on the class properties

5372002
pecl	pear
there are some on pear there s a pecl extension etc

5372026
int	chars
it appears to be basically a radix sort that is classify items by their most significant part leading bits digits for an int first chars s for a string then recursively by less significant parts

5372090
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
f12 in ie firebug addon for firefox ctrl+shift+i in google-chrome and opera

5372115
range	max
c is in range 0..1 0 means there is no behavior deviation and 1 is max deviation

5372119
jobs	cron
cron jobs are of course a possibility but i want the refreshing of data to happen as soon as the previous interval has completed

5372149
listview	gridview	gridview	listviewitem
i have a binding for listviewitem which is under gridview listview scrollviewer

5372149
listview	gridview
after i press ctrl+a in a listview gridview all items that are currently in the scrollviewer area will have isselected set to true

5372206
getter	setter
to solve this you should create a component of your titlewindow that accepts data the data you want it to know about by using a getter setter named dataprovider which is the standard

5372221
lsp	principles
one thing to remember is that traditional oo principles such as the lsp only describe public inheritance

5372230
jobs	cron
cron jobs are of course a possibility but i want the refreshing of data to happen as soon as the previous interval has completed

5372230
daemon	cron
the neither a cron job nor a daemon are the way to solve the problem unless the daemon becomes the data sink for the scripts

5372298
jobs	cron
i was thinking about using this for my e-mail newsletter tool instead of cron jobs as configuring cron jobs has various pitfuls

5372316
multiplying	add	multiplying	division
the conversion between different number systems in principle is a repeated division remainder multiplying add operation

5372352
folder	directory
notice how the kind of the documents directory is no longer a folder but a document after your download completes

5372374
ant	maven
if these do affect your project when exporting rather use ant maven to build your project

5372398
jdom	dom4j
use the one that s built into the jdk or perhaps you ll find jdom or dom4j easier to use

5372422
put	get
a long while ago i wrote a dreamweaver extension called get put all which allows for getting or putting of all open documents

5372447
inherited	properties
since they will be used separately a is not the parent of b b won t inherited properties from a in the layout

5372459
width	height
width 100 height 100

5372459
width	height
the actual controls.image covers the entire screen but the source image contained in the controls.image does not fill the entire controls.image height width

5372459
width	height
i am not worried about warping the source image i would just like to fill the entire controls.image no matter what the height width of it are

5372482
r5rs	r6rs
rarely will you find someone writing an application in pure r5rs or r6rs scheme and because of the minimalistic standard most code is not portable across scheme implementations

5372482
scheme	racket
there are various object systems you can load as libraries when you want to do oop but integration with existing code heavily depends on the scheme dialect and its surrounding culture chicken scheme seems to be more object-oriented than racket for instance

5372482
scheme	racket
mit scheme is known for strong interactivitiy support while plt racket feels much more static

5372482
lisp	scheme
in any case interactive programming does not seem to be a central concern to most scheme subcommunities and i have yet to see a programming environment similarly interactive as most common lisp

5372482
lisp	scheme
overall common lisp is much more uniform than scheme and more radical language experiments if done at all are usually embedded as a portable library rather than defining a whole new language dialect

5372482
lisp	scheme
common lisp features a built-in object system clos a condition handling system significantly more powerful than mere exception handling run-time patchability and various kinds of built-in data structures and utilites including the notorious loop macro an iteration sublanguage much too ugly for scheme but much too useful not to mention as well as a printf-like formatting mechanism with goto support in format strings

5372482
lisp	scheme
both because of the image-based interactive development and because of the larger language lisp implementations are usually less portable across operating systems than scheme implementations are

5372482
lisp	scheme
scheme dialects tend to be more static and less interactive than common lisp

5372495
awt	swing
the code you posted is used for awt painting not swing painting

5372503
prepare	execute
you probably should not try to open a transaction after a prepare statement has been started but before it s been execute

5372558
iboutlet	ibaction
control-drag from your object to your source file - presto iboutlet or ibaction created

5372586
width	height
the next time the print header routine is called the call to calcgraphicheight fails because the width and height of the image are zero

5372618
lwjgl	jogl
as someone who co-developed a 2d casual game in java using lwjgl i recommend against using lwjgl or jogl if you re going to be making a casual game

5372634
floating-point	integer
so super-naive but probably adequate pseudocode is as follows note that it ignores stuff like conversion between integer and floating-point values

5372657
addition	multiplication
so we need a way to represent an arbitrarily large binary number and implement multiplication by 10 and addition of small numbers

5372657
addition	multiplication
you can then apply the algorithms for addition and multiplication your learned in elementary school except that digits will overflow when they exceed 1 rather than 9

5372675
int	double
it is declared as having a single parameter of type double but the two virtual member functions named print in base are declared as having one and two parameters of type int

5372682
int	double
because double can be automatically converted to an int in the first definition it sees in the base class

5372683
hide	show
another might be to take the css media attribute idea and run with it render the raw data in the original html document hide it in the screen stylesheet and show it in the print stylesheet

5372686
mouseleave	mouseenter
i think you have a typo â your event for mouseleave is the same as the one for mouseenter

5372696
for-loop	loops
i ve been advised to use a for-loop and loops through each line

5372724
post	get
i believe i could get this working using post but the only problem is that i want the target page number to go in to the url in this format

5372741
wordpress	joomla
i know about the popular cms like joomla drupal wordpress etc

5372759
min	max	range	max	range	min
if this needs to be limited clamp it to a min or max value if it goes out of range

5372774

you could just find the day of the week of the passed in date subtract that from the target day of the week and finally add that result to the date passed in

5372865
put	get
i ve tried to put the struct in twice and i get

5372905

5372937
children	parent
each dom element is an object in and of itself having children parent properties etc

5372952
division	modulo
and since you asked for an explanation the modulo gives you the remainder when you do a division

5372953
truecrypt	umount
my understanding is that with truecrypt you would need to download the full 3gb partition open it edit some files umount and then resend the whole 3gb

5372956
whenever	capistrano
you should be able to just require the whenever capistrano command in your cap deploy file like so

5372956
whenever	capistrano
require whenever capistrano

5373010
bash	zsh
i m using oh-my-zsh but loading it both in bash and zsh i m still getting the same error

post	get
that way i get the new post on top

5373071
post	get
yes on a get your add action can return caseeditmodel to the view and on a post the argument for the add action can be of type case

5373071
post	put
on the post the model binder will try and bind to whatever you put in for an argument

put	get
when i put a breakpoint in my code on the very first nsautoreleasepool before that line even runs i get this warning

5373147
post	get
security trough obscurity does not work and using post in stead of get only makes the information slightly harder to snatch up if you re actually looking the user over the shoulder

5373147
ssl	https
if an update is available you can send the user to a webpage using https to download the update which saves you the trouble of implementing ssl yourself

5373173
hide	show
this will allow you to hide or show elements as required

5373196
ubuntu	opensuse
apparmor would be easiest to use on ubuntu opensuse sles pld mandriva pardis or annvix distributions as the tools come pre-installed

5373205
np-hard	subset-sum
the proof is a reduction from subset-sum which is known to be np-hard

5373224

5373225
public	protected
all public protected variables are available to subclasses this way

5373230

5373605
width	height
was what i used with all the problems of resizing the image the the width and height of the button.

5373619
tabcontrol	tabitem

5373778
rss	feed
i m trying to parse two rss feed at the same time using a for-loop but the thing is when the first rss feed is parsed completely and allocated in the table view parsing the second feed causes the table view to be overwritten by that second feed showing the second rss only

5373839
getter	setter
which is better for short functions getter and setter

5373893
google-chrome	firefox

the extra multiplication which depend on the actual exponent bit values will add up only to less than 20 of the total cost

5377967
exponent	modulo
also for rsa private key operations those which use the private exponent it is customary to use the chinese remainder theorem the crt uses the special structure of the modulo n pq where p and q are big primes to replace the modular exponentiation by two exponentiations on twice smaller values

5377967
exponent	modulo
i must also add that designing the rsa key so that the private exponent is substantially shorter than the modulo to speed up operations is a security risk if the exponent is smaller than 29 of the modulo length then the key can be cracked

first use ksort and then use asort for the new sorted array

5378694
width	height
so if i m viewing the image on a screen sized 800 x 600 px - that is 800 px tall and 600 px high - then i need to scale the image to be 800 1600 0.5 times smaller in height and 600 1250 0.48 times smaller in width

5388400
onmousedown	onmouseup
the root cause for this issue is that the _ondropdownmousedown method of dijit._hasdropdown will manipulate the dom node which cause the e.target of onmousedown and onmouseup changes for the first initialization

ostream	istream
to the extent that iostream both is-a istream and is-a ostream the istream isa-a stream and the ostream is-a stream and furthermore they are the same stream any functions in stream which it makes sense to apply to iostream should deal with the same underlying structure

5388667
ostream	istream
in c++ in order that the copies of stream in istream and ostream can be shared it must be inherited by them virtually

5388667
ostream	istream
however if you prefer you can not inherit virtually and each time you refer to a member of the base class specify which of the two copies one in istream or one in ostream you want either by casting or by using scope blah

no its not possible.only viewdidappear and viewwillappear will be called by itself.you can call it manually

5391700
portrait	landscape
i am trying to display a text that that will use the maximum possible screen in the device in both landscape and portrait mode

5391717
nsstring	nsdata
if your nsarray contains nsdictionary nsarray nsstring nsnumber nsdata or nsdate objects no custom objects int s etc you can simply write the contents of your mutable array to a plist file

5391806
post	get
however you can send some data to a url using two methods - get and post

5391806
post	get
here s a link that show s the difference b n get and post methods

5391836
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested nn firefox and google-chrome for mac and linux this works as it should prevent reloading of the ajax part on the first load of the page but in safari it prevents the first user activated reload

5391836
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome for mac and linux will reload the ajax bit directly on the first page load

5391837
viewdidload	viewwillappear
if you want some code to be executed when the view is about to be displayed be it when it s being pushed or when the top one is being popped it makes more sense to use the appropriate method viewwillappear for that instead of trying to call the viewdidload method at a time when it isn t appropriate

5391840
lemmatization	stemming
edit i actually need a stemming + lemmatization

5391905
accessor	properties
the problem now is that the set accessor for the properties ispressandholdenabled is never called ie

5391966
width	height
the scrollviewer gives its content infinite width height to render

5391966
width	height
to make your scrollviewer work you have to put a width height on the viewbox

5392097
nginx	lighttpd
i have recently moved from lighttpd to nginx and while everything seems speedy and good json output is invalid

5392100
iprincipal	iidentity
don t store user identifiers or other sensitive information in the session implement iidentity and iprincipal with forms authentication instead though this doesn t completely rule out information exposure altogether

5392125
getter	setter
in the abstract domain class i have all getter and setter and simple persistence stuff in it in the concrete domain class is the more complex stuff and the test class stands for it self

5392135
free	malloc
actually free doesn t delete anything it just tells the os it can use that memory again for example next time you call malloc it could overwrite some of your nodes

5392138
many-to-many	one-to-many
if you want to expose other properties in junction table you must map it to separate entity and mapt two one-to-many relations from former entities used in many-to-many

5392262
mvp	presenter
in mvp you should not be using methods from another presenter

5392292
set	bag
i am quite new to the world of nhibernate and i can t seem to get this to work with the use of a criteria query query a many-to-many relationship or query a collection set bag on an entity

5392314
children	parent
if the main window opens a child using window.open and the child opens a window using window.open these two child windows need to be siblings and children of the main window currently one child is parent to the other and this is causing problems

5392324
min	max
changing the max min values doesn t affect the value of the slider

5392344
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i need the functionality in safari 5 firefox and google-chrome would be nice but are not essential

5392386

5392470
express	node.js
i m using the jqtpl and express modules on node.js for the server and i have jquery and its template plugin for the client

5392478
onkeyup	onkeydown
the quickest way to solve this is to redefine onkeydown onkeyup calls in your activity b and do not call super.onkeydown when you receive back key just finishactivity

5392512
free	malloc
the behaviour of malloc and free depends heavily on the operating system and c library that you are using

5392512
free	malloc
the c library memory allocator which is in fact part of the application code and uses the pages provided by the os to provide fine-grained memory management facilities as provided by malloc and free

5392515
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome does not show the calendar itself only the button row on top

5392546
folder	directory
say that this document management system does not support the cifs protocol which is the protocol that enables users to open a directory from that system in windows explorer as if it was a local folder

5392560
public	protected
you specific methods as private when they are only used internally by the object normally called from other methods some of which will be public or protected

5392668
many-to-many	one-to-many
i have a request entity which has references children for buildings many-to-many and requesttimes one-to-many

5392702
haskell	scheme
i can t imagine trying to use numpy through haskell or scheme will be easier than just writing functional python

5392702
itertools	functools
try using itertools and functools if you want a more functional flavored python

5392764
inherited	properties
the private fields of button are not inherited in my derived class but don t the properties need to still be there so that the public properties can access the internal private state

5392793
google-chrome	firefox
when i m doing this in the modern browsers such as firefox or google-chrome i can do something like this

5392859
std	ostream
while it might seem like an awkward situation consider that n might be the std namespace test might be ostream and operator+ could be

5392898
viewdidload	viewdidappear
when releasing the view controller the view s events will target a freed object and make your program crash probably in viewdidload or viewdidappear if it s instant but it doesn t matter

5392900
bmp	png
i am currently saving the image as a png but have the option of a bmp or jpg as well

5392900
bmp	png
edit changing the save format from png to bmp or jpg with the threading seems to reduce the save time considerably

5392909
hide	show
make your own image to use as a tab and apply this plugin to any div to hide the content off the right left top or bottom of the screen it animates to show the content when the handle tab is clicked

5392912
user-controls	tabcontrol
either way after you perform this you may create a tabcontrol and add templated data to its datacontext or a user-controls to each tab

5393020
client-side	server-side
this seems to be quite an omission - i think most people would assume that the remoteattribute would work like all the other built-in validators and validate on both client-side and server-side

5393051
setcontentview	findviewbyid	oncreate	setcontentview	oncreate	findviewbyid
presumably that view is one from your activity either fetched from your xml layout via findviewbyid or constructed and passed to setcontentview in the activity s oncreate method

5393084
pull	push
i don t have much experience using external repositories pull push but i suspect this could be solved using local external repositories

5393111
pull	push
you can then push and pull between the main repo and your clone

5393111
pull	push
take a look at git clone git push and git pull

5393135
folder	directory
no problem - the xcode 3 installer lets you select an installation directory - my preference is to install it in developer-old for consistency with the earlier xcode 4 installers but you can put it anywhere you like perhaps even create a subfolder inside the xcode 4 installation folder for xcode 3

5393146
codeigniter	cakephp
you might want to read this thread in the codeigniter forums which compares speed on a full site first developed with cakephp and then rewritten using codeigniter

5393159
public	protected
this means that the defining class can control access to them and make sure that they are not set to invalid values or that any work that needs to be done upon their changing is done but the derived class can still make use of the way that they are used to implement protected and public members

5393161
fadein	hide
it looks like it is getting confused with the fadeall function because you are running the fadein within the hide function

5393175
rss	feed
i heard that there are problems with the rss reader webpart if the webpart consumed a feed from my sharepoint

5393190
xctest	kif
kif builds and performs the tests using a standard xctest testing

5393202

i would like to get ordered all my post with multiple cutom fields wordpress 3

5393257
ubuntu	debian
i am working on a large open source c++ program that uses the r standalone library librmath ubuntu debian package r-mathlib

5393278
children	parent
when i saveorupdate the parent it also saves its children

5393278
children	parent
more importantly when i create another parent with children based on the same set these children need to be persisted separately

5393324
versioning	upgrade
it s an upgrade and bugfixed versioning of the current winning answer hgimenez

5393334
int	double
problem with this approach is that there is only one mapping allowed per sql type and it doesn t resolve correctly between int and double .

5393359
mdpi	hdpi
as i m just rendering vector art for each physical size without respect for dpi pairs like large mdpi and normal hdpi which are both 480x854 pixels are duplicate files

5393387
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
setting the width height margin and padding is great knowing where my components are going to be puts the mind at ease

5393401
codeblocks	kdevelop	qt-creator	kdevelop
other options are qt-creator kdevelop codeblocks and ultimate++

5393417
for-loop	loops
lazlo have a look at these examples vectorizing a loops and coding the r-ight way - avoiding the for-loop

5393428
public	protected
if a class is not marked with any accessibility modifiers internal public protected private protected internal it s by default internal if it is top-level not nested or private if it is nested

5393437
google-chrome	firefox
edit possibly that could work in all the browsers not only google-chrome and firefox i know that might not exist but i would like to have an alternative for people that use ie

5393444
rss	feed
one of the simplest simplest methods to syndicate content onto a remote domain is to parse the rss feed using magpierss

5393444
rss	feed
to get the rss feed for a particular category use something like

5393457
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
you must always pass exactly the same pointer to free that you got from malloc or realloc . if you don t the behavior is undefined which is a term of art that means you can t rely on the program behaving in any predictable way

5393483
daemons	systemd
if your operating systemd has a daemons command

5393493
public	protected
however any public or protected members of button are accessible in myclass

5393540
free	malloc
you must pass to free the same pointer to the same location malloc returned

5393543
google-chrome	safari
first off open up firebug or google-chrome safari console and log your data being passed to your php page - then perhaps just start seeing what s being passed

5393568
teamcity	jenkins
if you use any sort of continuous integration tool like teamcity jenkins or cruise control you could have your commits automatically cause the other solutions to be built

5393602
serializable	deserialization
gut feel is that the expression tree serializable deserialization will take much longer than just evalling some conditionals

5393602
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization is slow - and will increase at the very least polynomially as n increases.

5393621
hash	salt
the entire purpose of a salt is to ensure that the same two passwords result in a different hash value

5393621
hash	salt
each salt value would require a rainbow table to be created encompassing all of the password hash possibilities

5393621
hash	salt
now the salt value has to be available to the function that is going to hash a password attempt

5393690
mdpi	hdpi
i would advise providing images for ldpi mdpi hdpi and optionally xhdpi depending on your target users

5393692
gridbaglayout	miglayout
gridbaglayout will be powerful enough to do everything you need but it is not as easy to use as something like miglayout

5393701
tax	shipping
logically there s nothing wrong in calculating summaries and storing them in a table to reflect the amount that was actually invoiced - including tax shipping etc

5393773
inherited	properties
inherited properties from superclasses of the hibernate documentation

5393779
move	drag
heres a start i ve move the image into the container div and you can see it drag around with the box

5393790
put	get
i managed to get some code put together that works in every browser but one internet explorer

5393794
min	max
-100 max contrast 0 no change +100 min contrast note the direction

5393799
stdout	stderr
you should probably set the redirecterrorstream property so that you don t have to handle two input streams stdout and stderr making for a much simpler design

5393803
hash	salt
how is bcrypt verifying the password with the hash if it s not saving the salt anywhere

5393803
hash	salt
the only idea i have is that it s somehow appending the salt at the end of the hash

5393807
equals	charat
an o n solution would be to iterate the string from 0 to length-2 and using charat .. to verify whether the current character is equals to the current+2

5393840
put	get
now to put some condition according to the variable received .the problem i am facing is that how can i get the name of the vairable which i have received

5393902
hash	salt
the output of the function is not merely the hash it is a text string which also encodes the salt and identifies the hash algorithm used

5393902
hash	salt
clearly the returned string is version information followed by the number of rounds used followed by the salt encoded as base64 followed by the hash encoded as base64

5393935
cassini	iis
it works if i switch from cassini development web server to iis

5393950
jar	war
anyway i just unchecked package under my war project properties lib directory and added an entry for the same jar in project properties packaging specyfing web-inf lib as path

5393992
hide	show
often we can use p foo or foo.inspect to see the instance variables but is it only the default behavior and the object can choose to show something else or hide all instance variables probably by re-defining the inspect method

5393997
ubuntu	linux
ps it might matter i am working under ubuntu linux 10.10

5394010
hide	show
if collection is clicked will only show the collection textbox and hide the other divs

5394010
hide	show
the code below seems only show but not hide after change

5394048
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
malloc free and realloc are not part of c language

5394099
google-chrome	firefox
i am using a userscript for google-chrome and firefox and i am checking for links that have been visited by the user

5394099
google-chrome	firefox
on each link and they all return red for the visited links in firefox but in google-chrome they all return blue

5394113
width	height
a component will always set the height and width of children

5394113
width	height
but it can never set the height and width of itself

5394113
width	height
the flex framework containers all have code written for calculating height width positioning

5394113
width	height
although if you are specifying absolute height and absolute width then measure will never be run

5394197
uiview	subviews
you could create your own eaglview which is a subclass of uiview add it as a subviews to your tab view and make cocos2d render your scene into this view

5394208
gradle	ivy
beyond that gradle has a plugin architecture is dsl based integrates with maven and ivy and has true incremental builds

5394220
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
there is a firefox-only -moz-outline-radius properly but that won t work on ie google-chrome safari opera etc

5394278
memcached	apc
you can cache results to memcached apc redis or equilevent with expire cache after one day

5394320
mpfr	mpc
i compiled gmp mpfr and mpc they re all 64bit

5394320
mpfr	mpc
when i try to configure gcc as follows i get an error complaining that mpc mpfr and gmp are the wrong elf class

5394327
rss	feed
please note that you shouldn t make a rss feed with thumbnailed images on the fly

5394353
stringbuilder	printwriter
unfortunately i cannot share my actual source because of security however the following test represents fairly well what i am doing the fact that the files and data are unix style eol writing to a zip file with a printwriter and the use of stringbuilder

5394356
versioning	upgrade
all servers have old versioning of setuptools 0.6c8 which needs to be upgrade for pymongo module

5394370
rdf	owl
but as i understand there is no direct support in r or packages for predicate logic or rdf owl

5394392
inherited	properties
you can override other classes using addclass according to the rules of css specificity just as css classes override inherited properties from each other when using the class attribute on the element

5394393
width	height
the first approach creates a log file to get the width and height but not sure if you wanted the extra step of looking at a log file

5394455
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
so i m thinking about switching to concurrent in apple s terms nsoperation with asynchronous nsurlconnection loading

5394492
post	put
i read in a post that google s emul is picked up itself hence i put both jre and google s stuff in super but only included jre as super source

5394526
vsto	add-in
i did a blog post last year that discussed the problem with respect to adding support for the new office 2010 backstage view from a vsto 3 add-in vsto 3 doesn t support backstage but it s still doable and you d basically use the same technique to swap out implementations of the ribbon support

5394541
x86	64bit
32-bit version for x86 and 64bit version for x64

5394569
min	max

all i get is error please use post request

5394618
post	get
when using xmlhttpreqeust the post get request fails when the data exceeded 7k

5394680
vsto	add-in
with a vsto add-in you can pretty much fully control word unload docs load docs save them whereever etc

5394680
vsto	add-in
but it can all live within the vsto add-in

5394712
children	parent
i created a parent class that has too many common methods that all children will use in the same manner

5394712
children	parent
each of the subclasses children all share static information these variables or information will be used in the methods declared only in the parent

5394729
vsto	add-in
what you likely want to do is write an add-in for word iether vsto or by implementing iextensibility2

5394751
post	get
it s the method post get that makes a difference for the limit

5394777
textview	simplecursoradapter
yes this is correct although you will need to use a cursoradapter instead of a simplecursoradapter since the point of a simplecursoradapter is to populate a row with only a textview in it

5394826
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade to the 1.5 versioning of fullcalendar

5394826
google-chrome	firefox
however on firefox and google-chrome the calendar shows up but you don t see any events

5394826
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome it doesn t

5394826
google-chrome	firefox
it s as if there needs to be some other event called in firefox and google-chrome to make the final event rendering execute

5394867
width	height
bind your height width to your window s height width

5394870
vsto	add-in
generally i install vsto add-in just like any other add-in or application

5394922
queue	fifo
assuming queue is a fifo if you can take from the end of the queue just take from the end of a and put them into b

5394933
width	height
simply remove the explicit width and height settings and the horizontalalignment and verticalalignment settings thus

5394989
titlebar	window
can you change the above code to make the window without a titlebar or do you have to do it completely different

5395007
addclass	removeclass
then it s a simple matter of using addclass and removeclass or even toggleclass

5395009
google-chrome	safari
en-us applewebkit 534.13 khtml like gecko google-chrome 9.0.597.86 safari 534.13

5395012
inherited	properties
now i ve decided that it would be good if some generic properties and methods all of these forms will share not gui features but some glue-code for my data middleware could be inherited

5395028
kerberos	ntlm
claims-based authentication also supports kerberos as well as ntlm

5395044
xlib	motif
i have to do something like this with motif and xlib

5395064
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
both look good in ie7 8 firefox google-chrome and safari windows and mac os browsers

5395104
post	get
using this code i can insert into my database but when i try to insert again if i want to add another comment on my wall post i get an error duplicate entry 1 for key primary

5395123
uigesturerecognizer	uibutton
i implemented this as a subclass of uigesturerecognizer so that you can just drop it in and attach it to a uiview or uibutton

5395131
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works on ie6+ safari google-chrome and firefox on pc

5395137
pop-up	dialog
almost all microsoft text apps use ctrl + g to pop-up a dialog that accepts a line number

5395146
width	height
you can use the exifinterface class to read the image width and height

5395192
strtol	atoi
to make the above code production-worthy you should 1 check the return value from strchr so as not to fail when there is no colon in the string 2 check it again so as not to fail when there s a colon but it s further in than 256 characters or allocate hostnamechar dynamically or something 3 use strtol rather than atoi 4 check the return value from strtol to make sure the port number is legal and 5 check the other kinda-return-value from strtol to make sure there isn t trailing junk after the port number

5395255
range	minimum
then if you api allows clients to request a range of results you can use that in order to limit the size of message body to a minimum since you only want the count

5395304
superclass	subclassing
you will use your dad s money for to get a good education then you will start earning in your question get superclass s benifits before you create your own subclassing

5395304
superclass	subclassing
at your bad time first you will loose your money and slowly you may drain your dad s money too in dealloc method release subclassing s object then superclass

5395320
libjpeg	libz
it seems to compile the libjpeg and libz fine which are dependencies

5395340
pop-up	dialog
i use dialog object to implement these pop-up

5395349
hide	show
anything after the # can easily be parsed and re-written without forcing a page reload allowing the javascript code to load hide show page elements based on the developer s choosing

5395364
uiview	subviews
im adding a uiview as a subviews to a scrollview

5395428
post	get
but when i attempt to post a link to the users wall i get this exception message

5395479
nunit	mstest
in about 2 hours on the other hand i was able to get ninject working including testing integration with both nunit and mstest

5395507
action-filter	onactionexecuting
now that this has been clear you obviously could use a global action-filter in which you can override the onactionexecuting and onactionexecuting methods which will be invoked respectively before and after a controller action is executed

5395515
metaphone	soundex
rather than correcting misspellings and checking for duplicates on the result drop everything to a soundalike format like metaphone or soundex and check for duplicates in that format

5395519
struts-tags	taglib
taglib uri struts-tags prefix s

5395519

5395614
backgrounding	multitasking
ultimately i will add code to facilitate the use of multitasking but right now i just want to better test the core mechanics without ios pushing it into the backgrounding all the time

5395619
inherited	properties
as for inherited if you want to define general method signatures and properties that should be available on every repository object then use an interface to specify exactly what each repository should have in common

5395662
int	double
int add int a int b vs double add double a double b

5395672
oncreate	ondestroy
for example in oncreate you need to call super.oncreate or ondestroy super.ondestroy

5395680
int	boolean
int.parse will give you back an int rather than a boolean

5395688
subtraction	addition
with this schema you can count the answers in every hierarchy with a simple addition subtraction

5395701
min	max
what you need to do is modify the axes to to have a different min max value

5395701
min	max
if the axes change their min max you can modify the scale of the information being shown

5395712
google-chrome	firefox
this all works fine in google-chrome and firefox but in ie the third level is hidden

5395712
google-chrome	firefox
here s the css i have setup which works correctly in firefox google-chrome

5395745
vsto	add-in
this will not execute when deployed as a vsto template because it s not the type of add-in word expects in order to run autoexec it expects either .wll files or .dot files in your startup folder

5395745
vsto	add-in
the way around this for vsto is to use autoopen instead which will execute the code in that sub routine when the template is opened as a vsto add-in

5395748
expressionengine	joomla
i have also used joomla expressionengine and pyrocms extensively

5395749
width	height
this is a memory leak you never delete that map also there s almost no reason to create a mat with new - just mat mat width height cv_8uc4 does the job fine and you don t need to delete it

5395766
google-chrome	firefox
you can test most browsers via google-chrome firefox and ie8

you would want to implement pull getdata or push takedata based on how would problem solution look like in the real world business problem

5396028
pull	push
i dont know about the technology you are using but there should be mechanisms to implement either a push or pull model atleast wcf has these ws-eventing

5396028
pull	push
it might make sense to send push notifications to the paid clients on every change about the ticker each client is interested in while only allowing pull like getdata with delayed data for free clients

superclass	subclassing
sounds like you should make the second class a subclassing of the first class or make a common superclass for your two classes

5396612
put	get
i d recommend against trying to guess the module name we put under java since for unusual packages it can get mangled pretty badly

5396646
getter	setter
simplest solution would be to make a hashmap property called country with appropriate getter setter and populate it with what you need

5396664
super	implements
1 create a super class that implements the methods you want to reuse

haskell	ocaml
however in f# vs2010 at least which likely would be similar to ocaml haskell here the compiler intellisense infer fun1 to have the signature that is a function which takes a generic type a and returns a generic type a so intellisense is very slim

5396826
width	height
then insert a placeholder element into the simplemodal and when the modal is shown make the iframe visible and change its position to that of the placeholder also matching height and width

5396835

5396854
implements	extends
at this point i am also limited to using the partial class approach to extends the linq-to-sql classes so they implements interfaces defined in my business layer

5396859
hide	show
thought it would be a simple show hide but it dosn t seem as simple as that

5396907
superclass	subclassing
it means just because your superclass has a contructor doesn t mean the subclassing will automatically get the same constructor

5396907

mousemove	mousedown
in my implementation in accordance with rsplak s response we keep track of the change of the mouse movement between when mousedown is fired and when mousemove fires

5396979

so if our change in mouse coordinates is dx dy we would increment the draggable s coordinates by dx cos 45 +dy sin 45 -dx sin 45 +dy cos 45

5396989
hide	show
you could assign the first ten li s a class like li class always_show stuff goes here li and then make a script that hide all show the always_show class and waits for a button click to show the whole thing

that means each specialtreenode only ever has a parent of type specialtreenode and also children of type specialtreenode

5397093
implements	extends
if you have a lot of utility methods that don t really care what implementation you use you might want to make either extends a non-generic base class or implements a non-generic interface

5398179
backbone.js	sammy.js
related backbone.js and sammy.js

5398195
content-length	content-type

xslt	xquery
you need to make a decision whether you want to process the xml using procedural languages like c# or declarative languages like xslt and xquery

5398434
xslt	xquery
generally working at the c# level is appropriate if your application is 10 xml processing and 90 other things while xslt xquery are more appropriate if it s 90 xml manipulation and 10 other things

multiplying	add	multiplying	multiplication
loop over the container multiplying the element by 17 take the last digit and sum it towards the result take the rest of the digits as remainder and add it to the result of the multiplication in the next iteration

5398476
listview	gridview
the gridview is a view and not a standalone control as far as i know you would normally use it as the view of a listview

5398486
multiplying	add
when you run out of digits to multiplying you just have to add the digits of the carry

5398487
express	node.js
in the code for the express module for node.js i came across this line setting inheritance for the server

5398516
multiplying	add
since you add all the digits after you multiplying by 17 you can calculate the digits sum whlie going over each element

5398519
inherited	subclassing
for my application i am thinking of using single table inherited for a table because it allows me to write specific business logic for each of the subclassing

5398524
google-chrome	firefox
predictably however the formatting is off in ie8 firefox google-chrome etc

5398524
google-chrome	firefox

5398640
equals	gethashcode
hashset is better then other collections if you also override equals and gethashcode in your entities

5398650
width	height
then i would like to have something like 10x250px width x height from the left of the image to be repeated - should a visitors screen resolution be wider than the image it won t seem like the site just stops at the edges

5398653
getter	setter
i also sometimes have to assign some specific values to some members of the specimens i have autofixture create but i tend to use the above technique because the normal .net api of getter and setter is already specialized at doing exactly that

5398787
mouseup	mousedown
i want to display an image under the mouse a finger to simulate a touch screen when a mousedown event occurs and hide it when the mouseup event occurs but when i do this the image i display blocks the subsequent mouse events click in particular on elements under this image

5398793
for-loop	loops
nesting to depth d + 1 does a for-loop over all loops of depth d

5398923
width	height
do this in onsurfacechanged so you ll know the width and height to use

5398969
getter	setter
so it s a setter in case you need separate functionality than default for getter and setter

5398982
tcplistener	tcpclient
i need to choose between tcplistener tcpclient and wcf

5398982
multiplying	subtract
and microsoft s 6-stage tutorial makes wcf sound pretty cumbersome involving code generators command-line and xml crap just to remotely subtract or multiplying two numbers

5398982
tcplistener	tcpclient
wcf doesn t seem to facilitate these things so i abandoned it in factor of tcplistener tcpclient

5398982
tcplistener	tcpclient
using tcplistener and tcpclient the work of juggling the connections and threads is getting a bit messy i have no experience with iasyncresult and i m not just not confident in my code quality

5398987
valgrind	callgrind
i m currently profiling an application with performance problems using valgrind callgrind

5398999

google-chrome	safari
this works fine in the latest safari and google-chrome browsers on mac and windows and also on the ipad

5399131
width	height
now using the first as an example one idea is to store such a structure internally then sync it with the existing width height canvas.left and canvas.top properties but i really don t ever plan on reading it back out so that isn t needed

5399178
sorting	filtering
this is extreamly handy when you need anything like list filtering paging and sorting + changing number of displayed columns loading realted entities etc

i m preferring phpquery and querypath which allow for

5399255
for-loop	loops
as a first step you can take a look how to simplify the while loops inside the for-loop

5399281
portrait	landscape
one needs to set up 2 different layouts for the activity one in portrait normal mode one in landscape mode

5399281
width	height
in landscape i changed this by inverting the layout height width attributes for all controls and setting the orientation of linearlayout to horizontal the tabwidget and framelayout must be next to each other horizontally

5399281
textview	imageview
the difference with the original google code is that the view layout itself the textview and imageview ids are from our own application not android internal ids

5399281
width	height
for a landscape-friendly version we need to invert again the layout width and height attributes

5399285
entities	entitymanager
then all create read update destroy crud operations on the entities are managed through an entitymanager repository

5399319
getter	setter
but i want to get the advantage of creating a getter setter method with the synthetize thing but with an int

post	get
you can use hibernate annotations to expose the set of tags that are applied to a given post as a java collection so that you can just say gettags to get all the tags

5399320
post	get
and you can do the same thing on tag so that you can say getposts to get all the post that have a given tag

5399347
post	get
i was just wondering how to pass in post parameters such as following exercept from html options normally i would get a array in language such as php would work i believe

5399348
profiler	visualvm
visualvm will not register this method in the profiler until one of the other threads sends the message the first thread was waiting for when the application terminates

5399348
visualvm	jprofiler
the solution as i see it right now is to pay for jprofiler - visualvm just doesn t seem trustworthy for this task

5399360
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you have a browser with a javascript console safari google-chrome or firefox w firebug then you can type and if that is undefined then the library isn t loading properly

make two auxiliary arrays each with as many elements as the input array called min and max

5399475
min	max
for each element m of the input array compare its value to the corresponding values in min and max

5399475

5400162
inherited	properties
going back to what i said about inherited - there is no such thing with interfaces which means just because both interfaces have a properties with the same name the derived one isn t overriding or hiding the base one

5400185

5400482
children	parent
the parent s state depends on some aggregate of its children s states

5400482
children	parent
in another variation it passes them a callback that the children can invoke to notify the parent

5400482
children	parent
during destruction of the parent it must be on the lookout for ongoing callbacks from its children

5400482
children	parent
if there are locks in both the parent and the children very likely in a multi-threaded non-trivial application locking order becomes an issue the parent invokes a method on the child which in turn experiences a state transition and tries to notify the parent dead-lock

5400482
children	parent
adding removing children outside the constructor can be an issue if the child tries to notify the parent from its destructor

5400482
children	parent
the parent must be holding a lock in order to modify the map of children yet the child is attempting a callback on the parent

5400482
children	parent
what i m looking for is some advice on how to handle clean destruction of the parent in the face of threads locks and dynamic addition removal of children

5400591
public	protected
i suspect what you really want though is something like the non virtual interface pattern nvi - expose a protected virtual method in your base class that child classes can override but have a public method on the base class that is actually calling that method internally - this approach allows you to extend what you are doing before and after that call

if i remember correctly the image gets the width and height when it gets loaded

5404451
mouse	keyboard
in the absence of suitable events such as select and selectstart which are indeed absent in firefox which has the select event but only applies it to form controls all you can do is use mouse and keyboard events as you suggested in the question

5404451

to use the dynamic_bitset class you have to download the boost libraries and add the boost folder to your compiler s include directory

5404748
backgrounding	multitasking
my answer would be as per kirky todds but don t use applicationwillterminate -- it s not a good strategy on ios4+ with multitasking because this method often won t get called -- an app will be backgrounding and then can be dumped from memory if other apps are run or the phone is turned off restarted without applicationwillterminate getting called

5405183
getter	setter	int	boolean
it contains a huge amount of strings int and boolean class variables and their getter setter

5405183
getter	setter
the problem is that every time a new property gets added i have to add the variable the getter setter the code that sets it from loading the property file and the code that uses the getter

5405209
getter	setter
if you want to enforce this pattern at the model level then you could override the setter and getter

equals	tostring
firstly you correlate tostring with equals object .

5405791
equals	tostring
tostring should return a useful method to debug the state of one object not to identify an object in the java semantic equals object

5405791
equals	tostring
of course as equals object is not necessarily correlated to tostring highlighted differences should be studied with our eyes but it would be already a very good basis and anyway it is much better than no comparison tool

5406141
folder	directory
it is batter to save xml file inside document directory itself not in any sub folder .try to save in to document directory

5406159
comparator	comparable
you could go down the road of creating something like a generic deepequals method which compares both internal not sure this is necessary and external properties and fields but this can be tricky especially for property getters with side-effects and properties that don t implement comparator or are otherwise easily comparable objects

5406164
submit	submission
what i would like to do is if the user clicks submit and the form is blank have a message popup in a new window or same doesn t matter that requires them to fill out the form prior to submission

5406323
dependencyobject	freezable
if you are animating a value of a custom type that you wrote it appears you need to either derive from freezable or not derive from dependencyobject

5406323
dependencyobject	freezable
for properties that already exist that derive from dependencyobject and not freezable you can t animate them styleproperty or templateproperty are cases in point

5406323
dependencyobject	freezable
there s an outside chance that you could write your own custom objectanimation that would not be restricted to freezable or non- dependencyobject classes

5406464
webkit	gecko
i think this is because many ipad android-specific websites rely on webkit features that aren t present in gecko

5406498
getter	setter
my guess as to why is because a property on an interface uses the readonly modifer to determine if it should have a getter setter rather than the presence of a getter setter

5406516
put	get
the problem arises when i put this app within a page tab environment ie add app to my page pull up in a tab everything works except for the share button when clicking on the share button within the tab i get the provided application id is invalid.

a properties is a construct that has accessor methods

5406580
accessor	properties
when you put the overridable keyword in a properties it is applied to its accessor

5406580
accessor	properties
for a read-only properties you only have the get accessor so it is overridable

5406580

onchange	onkeyup
so i have a an ajax call on the onchange event of a text box and a very simple mask function to add dashes to an ssn on the onkeyup event

5406811
put	get
you mustn t change the relevant values within a key after adding it to a map - it will potentially cause false positives and even false negatives you could use the same key reference you used in put and not find a match with get if you ve made a change which affects the hash code for example

5406830
hide	show
the simplest solution to this question would be to handle the click event and set the visibility property on the elements you want to show hide in the event handler

5407450
int	double
the int result would then be promoted to a double

5407477
tolower	toupper
you could always convert the file name to a string value and then use the toupper or tolower functions to check for the old file

5407494
rubygems	bundler

as to your question how to send a post as long as you have the url mapped properly requests will get sent to it

5407551
getter	setter
and getter and setter

5407567
free	alloca
alloca allocates on the stack and has no knowledge about scopes so it gets free after leaving the stack frame after leaving the function

5407578
free	alloca
it will be free at end of function but since you call alloca inside the loop you ll likely get stack overflow

5407590
content-disposition	content-type
i see that most of the time both content-type and content-disposition headers have the filename but i have seen cases where only one had proper encoding or valid mime header

5407613
rtsp	sdp
when transmitting files over rtsp at one point a message is sent sdp such that

5407618
int	double
as mark peters noted the issue is most likely that penquant and pen.getlargecapacity are both int meaning java is doing int division and then casting the int result to a double

5407618
division	modulo
to take advantage of built in integer division and the modulo and eliminate a step altogether

5407644
yacc	bison
in the other .c generated automatically by this other tool called bison or yacc you will find

5407672
profiling	benchmarking
not having done any profiling or benchmarking i d say it s a fairly safe bet that if you don t need regex magic then the overhead of the regular expression parser which you ll get no matter what in terms of memory as well as cpu usage costs you a lot more than you can possibly gain on the other end

5407673
client-side	server-side
models are used on both the client-side and server-side for validation

width	height
imaging plane-thing is a distance of 1 away from the camera and has a width and height of 0.5

5408690

in this specific scenario the obvious advantage of accessor is that you can limit access to only those properties and children that are valid for your xml schema assuming that a schema exists which should be so because you are in control of the xml

5408690
getter	setter
this will be implemented by the setter but the getter will also help you reduce typing a bit

you could simply use columns and rows with no width or height set

5409332

that your grid contains fixed width height boxes which contain your actual elements

5410851
dbcontext	objectcontext
dbcontext api is just wrapper on top of objectcontext api

5410858

a better way would be to use a dialog for the customer pop-up and not to pop it up from the customer constructor and then register a listener on the dialog to just notify the main app when a new customer has been saved

portrait	landscape
if you want to achieve this functionality - just display your view in landscape mode even if the iphone is in portrait mode and later enable rotation of your view

5411051
post	get
i followed the advice of a post on the emacs wiki to get that spacing back

how do i within the custom uiview layoutsubviews method determine its x y width height so i can position it

folder	directory
after reading some of the above comments - it appears that xcode group names can clash with directory folder names

since i get this to work in ie but not in firefox or google-chrome i m leaning at the conclusion that it s due to the browsers security precautions and that i won t get it to work by only using php session

5411637
int	double
i have a java application which parses a number from somewhere and checks that it is a valid int between integer.min_value and integer.max_value or a valid double between double.min_value and double.max_value

5411637
int	double
which works fine for int values but for some reason fails for any zero or negative double value

5411646
versioning	upgrade
i also don t recall seeing any warning from the usual microsoft suspects scott guthrie scot hanselmann etc saying that you couldn t run the same solution across both versioning of vs so you should be good to upgrade at the speed you want

5411667
int	double	range	minimum
since the range of double s are symmetrical around origo as opposed to int which stretches one step further on the negative side you can get the minimum negative value by writing -double.max_value

5411687
portrait	landscape
we also noticed that in landscape the tabs were all the same size but in portrait they weren t so obviously somewhere we had a fill_parent instead of a wrap_content

5411810
equals	compareto
the reason for using mergesort is that they want a stable algorithm - where equals objects by compareto or compare are at the same relative order as before

5411819
equals	gethashcode
return the count of the dictionary as suggested by digemall it won t give a great distribution but still better than always returning the same value and it satisfies the constraint for gethashcode objects that are considered equals should have the same hashcode

5411847
getter	setter
now based on this description one would expect the business object to not just have getter and setter but also behavior such as what i show below

5411847
getter	setter

5417585
postgresql	mysql
you could potentially export to csv from mysql and then import csv into postgresql

5417593
postgresql	mysql
if the mysql dump is in plain sql format you will need to edit the file to make the syntax correct for postgresql remove the non-standard backtick quoting remove the engine definition for the create table statements adjust the data types and a lot of other things

5417597
google-chrome	firefox
it works in ie7 google-chrome and firefox but fails in ie8 and ie9

i am making a webform in asp.net and i want to display gridview with data from asp sqldatasource

5417905
ienumerable	iqueryable
i have been exposing iqueryable on my repositories until recently but after understanding that iqueryable is a leaky abstraction because of it is deferred execution and is effectively crossing the boundry from my data layer i have changed it so that my repositories return ienumerable instead

5417931
qnetworkrequest	qnetworkreply
i was thinking of a downloadqueueitem that will manage the qnetworkrequest qnetworkreply for each file and a qlist where i will insert the downloadqueueitems in order to be able to delete them after they download

5417949

junit	mockito
i ve seen several tools to mock the sut in junit like mockito sevenmock classmock etc

5418025
implements	extends
cycle detected the type test cannot extends implements itself or one of its own member types

5418054
super	extends
since inside extends outside inside first calls the super method implicitly since you ve not called it yourself

5418057
width	height
whilst this may not be noticle for tables rendered only at page load for dynamically changing tables like hiding showing a row which has a border this is noticable because it changes the height of the cell above or the width of the cell to the left by -1px due to the way td height and widths are calculated and therefore causes noticable resizing from the original

5418062
super	extends
remember that since inside extends outside it has an implicit call to super which is the constructor of outside which in turn calls the constructor of inside and so it goes around

5418084
post	get
once you have run your query and you are looping through it you can access the id of the parent of each post with and if that is not null you can get that post content with get_post

usually there are some tlv s special parameters you will need to set in your smpp packets in order to use ussd but nothing outside the standard protocol

5418111
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
after all every inherited chain is a eventually finite graph and computationally speaking with a very small number of nodes and edges. more precisely the inherited graph from subclassing a to eventual superclass z must be a line not the other way around though and the compiler can easily determine if it is a line or not

5418179
post	get
i used get for .getjson and post for .post and .ajax

5418192
notepad++	gedit
open it with a text editor that allows you chosing the file encoding gedit or notepad++ and convert it

5418201
lxml	elementtree
it s easy to completely remove a given element from an xml document with lxml s implementation of the elementtree but i can t see an easy way of consistently replacing an element with some text

5418206
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
in your case it s slightly more complicated due to inherited but if you recall that constructor of subclassing implicitly call a constructor of superclass it should be clear that these calls form infinite recursion

5418286
innodb	myisam
note cannot use full-text since i have a table which gets quite large and needs constant inserts and selects therefore i use innodb instead of myisam which is required to use full text searches

5418316
bindingsource	dataadapter
i ve got a dataadapter dataset and bindingsource on my forms to connect to an sql database to show the data in the form and it all works fine

5418388

there doesn t seem to be any real convention surrounding the issue as there is for more established interactions like button checkbox etc

5418542
google-chrome	safari
this error happens in safari and sometimes google-chrome

5418575
hide	show
if the operation gets completed i need to register a script in the ajax postback to hide the loading panel and show the content

5418597
serializable	deserialization
it s much better than the built-in .net serializable because it doesn t save the assembly-related data which can make a deserialization a real trouble

5418648
udp	tcp
tcp is stream-based while udp is message-based which means that you can get a half message in the first read and the other half at the second read

5418737
int	chars
both n fields still have chars 9 type although it s planned to move to int type

5418738
google-chrome	firefox
although the reference states a link tag may only appear in the header interesting enough the style link does work if you use the code i provided in all browsers i tried ie firefox google-chrome

5418739
awt	swing
as most java programmers know updates to swing guis should only be done on the awt event dispatching thread and the recommendation is that long-running processes be executed on a worker thread with updates sent to the event dispatching thread using swingutilities.invokeandwait or swingutilities.invokelater

5418740
mouseup	mousedown
on mousedown the item starts dragging but not at the same speed as the mouse so i continue dragging when the mouse is outside the window but if the mouse is not over the page i can t get mouseup events

5418746
innodb	myisam
if the results don t need to show up immediately in your search you could run a cronjob periodically once per hour that inserts new rows in the innodb table into a separate table searchindex which is myisam with fulltext index and is being used only for searching

5418753
jobs	cron
2- get you schedule jobs out of you application and use the linux system cron jobs

getter	setter
also i deleted both methods from the class and let the synchronised getter and setter do the work

5418853
mouseout	mouseup
you can maybe catch the mouseout event and then call your mouseup function from there

5418890
vbscript	jscript
since windows scripting can handle jscript as well as vbscript iâ d recommend going that way

5418926
post	get
you are looking for the ajax method or one if the convenient front-ends for it post get load or getscript

5418926
post	get
when using jsonp as the result type jquery silently turns ajax post and get requests into script requests adds a script tag with the url and url-encoded parameters to the data source and expects a script back that executes a callback with the returned data

5418957
sorting	filtering
sorting and paging works and i can enter some text as a filtering and it filtering my result and sorting and paging still works after that

5418985
inherited	properties
what this means is that the rootviewcontroller s view properties inherited from uiviewcontroller isn t connected to a view in the nib file

5419009
ssl	https
if you want to send information securely you need to consider a secure transport such as ssl https

5419048
spweb	spsite
another important consideration is that you can t simply copy the contents of spsite and spweb items etc as this will cause all kinds of hell with guids and so on so your approach should be to create new spsites and webs based on the information you gather programmatically from your source private site

5419086
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that it looks great on firefox but on google-chrome the only issue is the button s height

5419118
min	max
if the scene rect changes after user edit the saved scroll position will no longer be valid since the new min max are now different

5419161

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
its works in firefox safari google-chrome and even ie8

vb6	vba
in vba and vb6 i ve often seen where classb can only become a valid object through a method of classa

5419711
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox seem to be in conflict with displaying the styles in your classes small green and input in conjuction with the style applied for the id add-friend-button

google-chrome	firefox
turn if off in firebug in firefox and you will see the button take on the same dimensions as in google-chrome

persistent	transient
to be more specific i have a persistent object in the database and have a transient object not inserted to the database yet and those two objects are same with respect to equals and hashcode methods

instances	transient
but since the id of the entity class of those objects is annotated with generated value annotation hibernate still creates a new instances for the transient object in the database

5420425
serializable	deserialization
if you re using sql server i invite you to have a look at my open-source bsn modulestore project it s a framework for db schema versioning and using sps via some lightweight orm concept serializable and deserialization of objects when calling sps

5420836
int	double
it seems you just want a general mapping from the standard numerical types int int float double to double

5420902
superclass	subclassing
since nstextstorage is a subclassing of nsmutableattributedstring which has a method through its superclass nsattributedstring initwithhtml baseurl documentattributes you can use this to get what you want

5420909
cout	cin
msvc runtime does not flush the output buffer when calling system it isn t required to thus all output to std cout remains buffered if no std flush std endl or input from std cin were performed

5421329
getter	setter
and they are also much slower than a regular getter or setter

5421355
vsto	add-in
if you re creating a c# vsto add-in you can intercept the document save or saveas events

5421393
pop-up	dialog
i m using jqueryui s dialog with the modal form option to open a pop-up form

5421421
public	protected
for them to be visible to the parent class they have to be either protected or public

as rinuwise said you can make x and y visible by declaring them protected or public but it s still wrong logic

5421445
width	height
moves it to the left and up by half of the width and height of the fixed-size div respectively

5421451
width	height
i have many videos and photos with size of width 600px but different height in a wordpress blog

5421454
width	height
the concept is to set the top left positions at 50 and then use negative margins set to half the height width to pull the container back to being centered

5421473
tax	shipping
this happens regardless of whether tax is involved or not and regardless of shipping method flat rate fedex ups

5421545

i read that when using crystal report stored procs it s best not to use bmp files i tried jpg and png didn t work either

5421622

note that the getter and setter won t and i don t think can change

5421627
solaris	aix
my concern is that a compiler on one of the platforms i ship on linux aix hpux solaris windows will play some game with the bool type i m not aware of and break something

5421629

my ultimate goal is to put the information i get in to a local database but since i don t know how to get the information from the string i don t know put the info in the database

5421922
wordpress	joomla
reinstall wordpress joomla download customer data is not so fun

5421994
integer	fractions
yes readdouble is useless here it will interpret your 64 bit integer as an ieee 754 formatted double-precision float sign bit + 11 exponent bits + 52 fractions bits and that will get you a garbage result

5421994
integer	unsigned
if the sign bit is set your code will effectively be interpreting the 64 bits as an unsigned integer which is not what java is sending you

5422004
inline	inlining
if i remember it correctly inlining is not used for debug compiled code but release code might inline the called method making the jitter load dll b before the check

5422008

5422279
invokelater	invokeandwait
you can simply create a new thread runnable or futuretask to run on an executor and call invokeandwait only when necessary to update components but if you can get away with it invokelater is better

5422284
portrait	landscape
the problem happens when i rotate from portrait to landscape or from landscape to portrait

5422284
portrait	landscape
let say i am in portrait mode i switch from view1 to view2 then rotate the ipad in the simulator from portrait to landscape when i switch back from view2 i.e to go back to view1

5422290
submit	submission
and using onsubmit to submit the form fails to provide the page s proper function which indicates to me that it s the script-defined function in the onsubmit code which needs to be executed - meaning that simply filling the box via javascript and then submission the form with javascript will not work

5422290
keydown	keyup
it looks like i m going to need to be doing a create-init-dispatch of either a keydown or keyup event

5422291
domxpath	domdocument
as gordon said you need simplexml instead of domdocument domxpath if you want to access child elements like parent- childelements

unless you do something else in the getter or setter they are functionally identical

5422338
getter	setter
in the background vs creates autonamed variables for you when using the auto getter and setter

getter	setter
the only way this could possibly be better is if you feel you will be adding more logic to the getter and setter at a later date

5422525
children	parent
what you have implemented is a max heap the values of the children of each node are smaller than the value of the parent node

children	parent
you need to just change the siftdown function so that the parent is always the smaller than the children

5422544

5423080
height	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
this is the quite similar to thirtydots in that it uses a mixture of relative and absolute but this method uses the border-box box-sizing model so space can be created by padding and still maintain the use of height 100

5423104
apache	nginx
apache nginx etc not you rails server

5423118
width	height
since the canvas.left right top bottom properties measure distance between those sides of the canvas and the associated sides of your ellipse the only way to use them to control where the center of the ellipse lands is to accommodate its height and width in the viewmodel

5423118
width	height
in other words however you ve determined that the ellipse s center should land at 4 6 and that it should have height width 10 the x and y properties exposed by the viewmodel should have the values 4 - 10 and 6 - 10 -6 -4 which would be the resulting values of canvas.left and canvas.top

5423176
width	height
if you set the brush.color before setting the width and height the bitmap will use this color for all the pixels

i d like to do something as in the example below so derived can get the meta properties from base in this case to inherited permissions as part of django-guardian

5424305
codeigniter	cakephp
cakephp in my opinion is also a good choice if you find that you don t like codeigniter

5424359
folder	directory
with most of their upgrades you can just copy the application folder into the new codeigniter directory

this is the compileclass that i am using for getter and setter methods

5424447

if i fill in values for the kvp text boxes and post the form back to my controller i do get the values correctly model bound back into my user.claims dictionary

5424737
post	get
i know this is a pretty noob question so it would help very much if someone could post code for what i need but any help i can get would be greatly appreciated

5424743
getter	setter
its worth noting that when accessing properties through dot notation you are actually going through the setter and getter

5424743
getter	setter
you should almost always go through the setter and getter rather than accessing it as a local variable

5424807
stdout	stderr
popen the easy one to understand and use but popen works only with stdout of child but you can redirect stderr to stdout as well by appending to command line string 2 1

hide	show
the jquery code must identify which select anchor tag was clicked so that it can show hide the appropriate element pairs emptybox.jpg checkmark.jpg and select deselect anchors

5425010
x86	64bit
you can see behavior like this if you re accidentally mixing 32-bit and 64bit components ie. the zlib.lib file is built for x86 and the application is being built for x64

5425018
google-chrome	firefox
i tried doing it on google-chrome and firefox same leaks on both browsers

5425028
onchange	onfocus	onchange	onblur	onfocus	onblur
you can always use javascript to hook client side events like onblur onchange onfocus

5425031
hash	salt
the problem with this is that you would be reusing your salt and you are defeating the purpose of salting your hash

5425031
hash	salt
you need to generate unique salt for your hash

5425053
median	max
i m a beginner r programmer attempting to plot a histogram of an insurance claims dataset with 100 000+ observations which is heavily skewed mean 61 000 median 20 000 max value 15m

if it s about the messages themselves and not how to color them i remember that in another similar question which i can t find at the moment it was suggested to use llvm clang instead of gcc as it has better error messages

5425329
google-chrome	firefox
it looks like firefox and google-chrome handle fractional percentages differently

5425364
post	get
for example somehow it couldn t correctly recognize a form on web page requires method post not get

5425398
google-chrome	firefox
if you want use the name of new window etc posting a form to this window then the solution that working in ie firefox google-chrome

5425415
put	get
a so-called ajax request is just an http get or put

5425417

i get post as result

5425427
versioning	upgrade
as for using the ppm versioning it is exactly because of ssl i had to upgrade

5425444
stdout	stderr
yes you can redirect the stdout and stderr to a file but then you can t see what is going on unless you tail the log file

5425444
stdout	stderr
so consider running your batch scripts using a stdout stderr logging utility like logger which will log the output with a timestamp and you are still able to see the script progress as it happens

5425444
stdout	stderr
yet another stdout stderr logging utility

5425478
put	get
from what i understand it s in the design of streaming that you don t get explicit access to the pieces in order to put them back together

5425493
hide	show
hide and show utilities cmd - opt - 0

5425517
keydown	keyup
the library was built to write games but would probably give you the functionality that you are looking for with keydown keyup events

5425592
cos	sin
the angle theta must be in radians for cos and sin to work correctly

5425600
typedef	struct
but now i want to move the equalbyfield1 typedef into the struct s

width	height
for example if the browser is open to a 1000 pixel width the column will be 250 pixels and i want the height to also be 250 pixels

5425620
cvs	svn
you need to implement your own command which would delegate to the relevant command for svn cvs or mercurial then assign you preferred keybinding to that command

5425631
for-loop	arrays
after the for-loop only the first value is saved in the arrays startvalues but not the second one

5425634
google-chrome	firefox
however it s come to me in one of those eurika moments if you get the tab lined up perfectly in google-chrome which leaves an overlap in firefox set the ul height to the height of the li including any padding you can remove the offending pixels in firefox by setting overflow to hidden on the ul

5425671
submit	submission
form submission is done purely in ajax and there is no form action or classic form submit button

5425671
qnetworkreply	qnetworkaccessmanager
i ve checked that qnetworkaccessmanager has finished qnetworkreply signal that allows to interact with http response but it s not clear to track modify http requests in qtwebkit

5425673
put	get
the best way is to change your db model get rid of 30 tables and put everything in one table

5425686
width	height
the only thing you can do is use javascript get the table s width and set the height to the same level

5425710

determine min and max of the array

5425714
min	max
if max - min + 1

5425732
stdout	stderr
roll your own cl.exe that launches cl-orig.exe capturing its stdout stderr

5425735
stderr	fflush
your choices are to either call fflush stderr periodically change the buffering type with setbuf or setvbuf or catch the signal and call fflush stderr at program termination

5425803
versioning	upgrade
note also that running on the same line of thought even when you upgrade delphi versioning you need to build using the correct versioning

5425814
mouseover	mouseleave
i have a list item which rotates every 3 seconds which is fine my problem is actually introducing two events to it a mouseover and mouseleave

5425946

5425969
integer	radix
you can use the integer.parseint string s int radix method to convert the hexadecimal representation back to an integer which you can then cast into a byte

5425981
for-loop	arrays
i ll use this arrays to execute some further processing in a for-loop

5426004

5426017
for-loop	loops
inside the while loops i have a if condition which has a nested for-loop which does some processes

5426017
for-loop	loops
what happens is that the code exits once the for-loop finishes despite the fact that the condition to keep the while loops running is still valid

5426030
jobs	cron
we now had to implement some cron jobs which runs every day every day we make a list of passes which are supposed to expire and we ask apple if the original receipt is still valid the magic thing is that in their answer there is a field latest-receipt which embeds the latest receipt

5426055
octal	decimal
i think that printf can handle only decimal hexadecimal and octal values

5426089
textview	imageview
if you want the layout_weight for the imageview and textview to be honored you need to set the layout_height to zero

5426131
addition	modulo
so it becomes possible to provide different ways of adding waveforms or to specify modulo arithmetic for integer addition

5426151
post	get
file_get_contents as others have suggested will not pass along the get vars or post

5426174
komodo	notepad++
komodo edit is also a good choice but i felt it was kinda of in the middle between ide and an editor which meant he lacked in features but was also quite bloated compared to notepad++ for example

5426184
jlist	jtextfield
it is up to the ui to decide how best to represent the selectionvalues but usually a jcombobox jlist or jtextfield will be used

5426193
setinterval	settimeout
instead you would use something like settimeout or setinterval and check for whatever conditions you are waiting for so the browser can do work while it waits

5426235
udp	tcp
games usually have their own protocol built on top of tcp ip and udp to handle everything since there is lot of different type of information going both ways in real games not just physical state

5426272
disk	ram
this leads to efficient use of caching at everything from l1 cache in ram to big chunks of data read off of the disk without needing to know the specifics of the sizes of any of those caching layers

5426347
google-chrome	safari
edit compared to google-chrome safari ie8

profiling	debugging
i cannot get it to actually profiling the functions i wrote either in debugging or release

5426446
comparator	comparable
you could combine the two approaches by modifying the original constructor to use a comparator that casts the first values it wants to compare to comparable instances

5426466
width	height
if you change your fiddle like this you ll see that chrome is running the animation as fast as you could want it to but the image only shifts when there s a whole integer change in the property value width and height

5426487
stdout	stderr
above this limit the subprocess does no longer produce any stdout or stderr

5426487

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
a custom navigation controller created via a root uiviewcontroller that does not actually subclass uinavigationcontroller to easily manipulate the design

5426555
expression-blend	silverlight
i decided to try and port a silverlight timer example from the default examples in expression-blend 4

5426572
setinterval	settimeout
you made the right choice using setinterval instead of settimeout here as in this case settimeout would have been less efficient with memory resources

5426638
qobject	qwidget
if you don t have a suitable qwidget subclass in use you d either have to introduce it or install an event filter in the right place using qobject installeventfilter possibly on your application object if it s supposed to be a global shortcut

5426648
opera	google-chrome
opera and google-chrome decode from utf-8

5426679
post	get
just set the post data or get if it s easier and execute the request

5426683
qitemdelegate	qstyle
i have crawled through the qt source and i can see where it sets the drag pixmap by calling the qitemdelegate paint function but the only thing it changes is it forces qstyle state_selected in the item option style

5426700
free	realloc
or is it necessary to use free with realloc

5426706
ivar	subclassing
by adding an property assign property and ivar to the subclassing controller pointing to the main view controller

5426762

the code compiles without error but i get the warning that i am trying to initialize a nsstring with a nsurl

5426778
google-chrome	firefox
the css is working on google-chrome but both ie and firefox dont show any style change

5426816
textview	simplecursoradapter	textview	listactivity	simplecursoradapter	listactivity
when you go to use simplecursoradapter which i recommend in your listactivity make the last field in your simplecursoradapter constructor to be which is the ids for the textview you stored in xml

5426839
nsurl	nsstring
however the easiest way to get round this and convert it to an nsstring without changing the method is setting the string to the nsurl s absolutestring

5426929
min	max
but you could filter the results again by wrapping another aggregate around the above query and then pick a min or max product id to ensure you will get only one result per order

5426930
post	get
basecommandcontroller works only with get post

5426959
submit	submission
i d also suggest a name change for the function if you modify it to do this and handling the form submission via ajax -- if not you can remove the handler and simply trigger a submit on the form

5426966
nsstring	nsobject
the objects it contains are all nsmutablearray objects each of which will normally contain 10-15 objects a simple extender of nsobject with a few nsstring and nsdate properties added and may contain as many as 50

5426985
getter	setter
in fact in well designed object oriented code you sould probably not have many if switch getter or setter either

5427007
accessor	properties
as you can see i m accessing properties with accessor operator instead of indexer

5427012
free	realloc

implements	extends
and interface1impl implements interface1 and extends dao2 class

5427091
opencv	cimg	cimg	magick++
i have looked at opencv gil cimg and magick++ but either they were not too great or i couldn t figure out how to convert an image to grayscale with the library

5427120
implements	extends
so the proxy implements the interface but does not extends the class and hence you can t cast to it

5427130
put	get
mind you some people add values to existing enums not caring about order and if they put the new value at the top you get undefined behavior in code written like that

5427154
put	get
you could technically put the reference to the door handler outside the using statement but then if your idoor implementations are disposable they ll get disposed along with the lifetime scope at the end of the using so be careful with that

5427187
put	get
so it will only get what you put in limit

5427199
width	height
this is a raw format and you can easily subsample the pixels of the returned image yourself take a single pixel as the average of every 4 pixels so you will reduce both your image width and height by two

5427206
des	aes
the underlying block encryption method that is symmetric as noted by ian triple des aes etc.

5427212

5427259
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
if i then pull this data out of localstorage and parse it via jquery i can successfully parse all elements within the xml on ie 9 google-chrome 10 opera 11 firefox 4

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i can t find any information on it of course google-chrome safari firefox are already adding support for it

5427276
google-chrome	safari
i used to write rounded corners using css3 for google-chrome and safari like this

5427280
powerpc	i386
the problem is that the python 2.6 included with os x 10.6 was built for three supported architectures i386 x86_64 and powerpc for compatibility with earlier releases of os x and python s distutils tries to ensure that all c extension modules are built with the same arch s as the python interpreter and library

5427288
firefox	safari
as a matter of fact soon enough you won t need these two properties anymore as the standard border-radius is now supported by safari 5+ and firefox 4+

5427298
next	except
i can figure most of it out except how to keep control in php so when the timer times out we go back to php for call to next page

5427329
for-loop	loops
so the question is for a big list which is faster the for-loop or loops that every does with the overhead of the test function call

5427329
for-loop	arrays
edit #2 but this was faster than a for-loop for a test i ran on an arrays of a million points

5427342
rss	feed	post	get
i am using the following script to get the post title and the content of an rss feed

hide	show
i have a hide show div faq section on my website using jquery

5427400
factors	mean
you can simulate different colors of filters by changing the factors -- by far the most common filter in b w photography is red which would mean increasing the red and decreasing the other two to maintain a total factors of 1.0 but keep the g b ratio around 6 1 or so

5427425
dictionary	ropes
removing an item from a dictionary or collection cuts that one ropes

5427438

google-chrome	safari
safari and leaves google-chrome alone

5427450
post	get
this is called the post redirect get pattern

5427455
background-color	transparency
declaring background-color separately however may be much better for your scenario as it lets you use different colors based on the same background images if you re good with transparency pixels on the parts of your images to be filled with the css background color

5427484
stdout	stderr
add the -s silent option to remove the progress meter then redirect stderr to stdout to get verbose output on the same fd as the response body

i see no reason to store both the julian day number and the tdatetime just use a constant subtract add from the trunc fbasedatetime value and return that in the getjuliandaynumber setjuliandaynumber functions

5427581
entity-relationship	diagram
update it looks like you re better at entity-relationship modelling than me so if you posted that diagram i d upvote it and that would be it

5427582
yacc	bison
lex yacc flex and bison all come with the mac ios developer tools

5427615
min	max
the can take 2 arguments min max

5427618

5427695
width	height
there s a solution for it posted here -- adjust width height of iframe to fit with content in it

5427700
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
all the other browsers ie9 google-chrome 10 safari 5 opera 11 do not throw an error on that line

5427846
google-chrome	firefox
the screenshot is from using the code below - and when i use padding instead of height firefox looks fine but google-chrome is unaligned

5427850
put	get
if your purposes still require a lot of subquerying as you put it there is a neat prefetch pattern that nick johnson outlines here which basically fetches all the properties you need in your entity set as one giant get instead of a bunch of tiny ones which gets rid of a lot of the overhead

5427909
jstl	taglib
you need to declare jstl taglib in top of the jsp page where you re using jstl tags to get them to run

5427909
jstl	taglib
for the jstl core taglib that ll be

5427915
for-loop	arrays
on the other end i am iterating through a for-loop so this method gets called 20 times if the picture arrays i need to collect has 20 images

5427915
for-loop	arrays
i am thinking that instead of passing in an image id i can just pass in the count of the arrays i need to make and then setup a for-loop of some sorts here in the request method which would then allow me to pass back an arrays of images.

5427932
vim	textmate

at first it seemed the only difference was that one was a get and the other a post so i copied the get ajax call into the second call which happens on user input where the first one happened on load

5428396
ibatis	mybatis
but ibatis developers has moved to create more elegant version of ibatis called mybatis

5428396
ibatis	mybatis

5428770
prepare	execute
if you have a query which needs to be execute multiple times with changing data the best option is a prepare statement

for this particular experiment i ve attempted to get the infobox window pop-up when the marker has been hovered over and out however i ve struggled to resolve the issue with the event system regarding mouseover mouseout on the infobox window

5429444
mouseover	mouseout
what happens is that i can locate the div and use a google.maps.event.adddomlistener to attach a mouseover and mouseout event to the infobox except it s too fiddly -- when i mouseover a child node within the infobox it counts as a mouseout on the parent node and fires the event

5429473
jlist	jfilechooser
i have a jlist on my jframe which populate all the musics listed in there using jfilechooser done

a good place for this would be either tmp on linux or similar or c temp on windows or similar

5429788
division	multiplication
what s more if you start writing bit shift operations instead of multiplication or division your code will rapidly become unmaintainable

5429836
put	get	post	get	post	put
curlopt_post curlopt_put and curlopt_get allow you to send post put get requests -- which are some types of requests that are common enough to have their own options

5429889
int	double
is it int or float or double or any other primitive type

5429902
put	get

rtp	sip
basically the dll s are responsible for things like voice recording+voice output through openal afaik and rtp and sip implementations

it would not work well for long duration animations however as it actually only changes the animation speed at the max min points of the animation

5430131
post	get
if you re modifying things on the server you should probably use a post request instead of a get request but this should work if your server side script only accepts get requests

5430135
boost	allocator
i would say that is intuitive but there may be a more clever solution to overload the allocator instead to internally hold a boost array and use it to make your vector s allocator

5430135
boost	allocator
with regards to the pod or nearly pod issue the actual data in the vector is guaranteed to be a contiguous buffer and internally your allocator is using boost array so it will be contiguous

5430142
int	boolean
the following types for parameters can now be enforced either coercively or strictly strings string int int floating-point numbers float and boolean bool

children	parent
aslo it looks strange that you don t have cascading and don t persist children inside the same transaction with the parent

5430910
calloc	malloc
i am generating an 2d array and i used malloc instead of calloc

5430910

fgetc	fread	feof	fread	feof	fgetc
feof is only useful after fread has returned zero or fgetc has returned eof

5432517
fgetc	fread	feof	fread	feof	fgetc
it is always necessary to check the return value of a read either an fread or an fscanf or an fgetc before calling feof

getter	setter
i am getting tired by adding tons of getter setter all the time in my beans

5432706
getter	setter
in my real world i have to access about 15 classes with about 10 data members in each class which would produce 300 useless setter getter

5432727
getter	setter
in sproutcore i am using the universal setter getter method like so

5432727
getter	setter
as you can see you have one method that is the both the getter and the setter

5432732
getter	setter
in eclipse for example define some properties rightclick source choose source and then generate getter and setter

5432751
getter	setter
see this link the getter and the setter are implicit

5432771
children	parent
parent has to-many relationship to a child called children

5432771

at the same time parent property of every added child point to proper instance of parent and nsfetchedresultscontroller fetches such children predicate is well

5432811
postgresql	mysql
no it s not possible in mysql unlike postgresql sql server and pl sql in oracle

5432823

the method will be used by a web ui and must support pagination sorting and filtering

5432964
erlang	lisp
i am basing this statement on the cool erlang movie and this fragment from practical common lisp when the bug manifested in the wild--100 million miles away from earth--the team was able to diagnose and fix the running code allowing the experiments to complete

5432968
nunit	mstest
here you can find good table which shows nunit and mstest attributes side by side

5433010
do.call	lapply
you could use lapply with do.call rbind ... instead of the for-loop

5433143
getter	setter
note that i do not wish to discuss the relative merits of having setter and getter in general just the reasons why spring has made this choice

5433174
post	get
the problem is that you are specifying method post but passing the arguments as the url is a get

5433174
post	get
you either need to use the get method or you need to perform a post write the parameters to the request stream

5433271
getter	setter
since configuration happens by bean properties getter and setter you can t really tell - in the likely case that both exist - if you want to call setvalue or set the member value

5433306
ubuntu	linux
if you re developing using eclipse on ubuntu linux you need to add a rules file that contains a usb configuration for each type of device you want to use for development

5433426
nunit	mstest
since you re using nunit you could try this technique to run mstest as well

5433429

prepare	execute
prepare statements are designed with special care so that only valid and programmed sql is execute

5433652
primes	palindrome
the flip side is that factorisation isn t entirely cheap but then it s all pretty small numbers and you can simply generate a list of all primes less than 1000 for your trialling as any palindrome with a primes factor larger than 999 will not be a product of two three-digit numbers

5433663
r-tree	quadtree
look into r-tree and quadtree data structures

width	height
in such a case the grid slows down to a crawl even when column width height is constrained to only show the first 300 characters of data in that cell

5433850
hide	show
another problem might be that if you are fade-ing the elements to hide the old and show the new content you might need to get them nested like this

5433933
inherited	subclassing
you can get a full list of classes that inherited from context in the docs under indirect subclassing

5433988
put	get
easy to get something like jquery and just go use their documentation to put your call into play easily

5434021

5434089
ready	each
in a loop i then run select.select on each subproccess s stdout stream waiting for them to tell me they re ready

5434106
icu	gettext
if you don t need icu s full power and are only interested in message translation you may want to look at gettext which depending on your platform and licencing requirements may be a smaller cleaner and less-complicated alternative

5434133
mapply	lapply
this is much faster than the loop but not quite as fast as the mapply and lapply solutions shown previously

5434143
width	height
perhaps creating a white image the width and height you want and setting it as the background on hover would do what you need to

5434146
hash	md5
i have an offsite backup solution which runs on c++ to break the files into blocks and keeps track of the blocks using md5 hash on a sqlite3 database

min	max
aggregate functions like min max etc

5434181
width	height
full height and width

5434188
gridview	rowdatabound
then in your gridview s rowdatabound event you can work with the gridview as much as you like

5434243
textmate	bbedit
coda bbedit and textmate are--in my opinion--the most popular text editors for web development

5434243
textwrangler	bbedit
for a free text editor you can use textwrangler from the same people who made bbedit

5434244
width	height
automatically makes it takes it s parents width and height actually minus any padding you want to use

5434247
profiling	benchmarking
this is of course just a hypothesis you would have to profiling benchmarking your code to see the difference

5434269
folder	directory
in unix there are two directory in every directory folder . and ..

5434283

5434360
post	get
it s impossible to know without seeing your server code but your server may not like that you re combining http post parameters in your request body with get parameters in the url

5434381
post	get
i usually setup a form on the view for the parameter entry and then just change the method to get instead of post

5434383
next	except
everything works perfectly except on thing when in edit mode the user has explicitly hit the edit button and the insert row has appeared at the top if the user tries to delete the bottom row the next row up gets deleted instead

5434407
inherited	subclassing
while it is possible to monkey-patch your classes to allow you to change the behavior of put you might be better off writing a method -- call it save for the sake of argument -- that wraps the put in a more explicit and obvious fashion and frees you from having to worry about having the patched behaviors being inherited or not by subclassing

5434417
udp	tcp
you can use the connection-less udp protocol instead of tcp if reliable delivery of messages is not of concern

5434450
folder	directory
i cannot figure out why quite yet but it seems like the issue may actually be that going forward in directory can be autocorrected but going backwards being at level 3 in one folder and jumping back causes issues

5434518
uiview	cashapelayer
even better you could try making your uiview s backing layer a cashapelayer by overriding the following class method

5434558
lxml	beautifulsoup
html parsers such as beautifulsoup and lxml will let you parse the raw html so you can get at the sections you care about

you can t use a png as an ico

5434950
png	ico
since a png isn t an ico the browser needs to support png images as favicons for this to work

5435010
int	chars
0x12u is acually an unsigned int not a chars

5435010
int	chars
the format specifier 2x reads two hex chars and stores them in a single int

5435010
int	chars
therefore you could use 2x 2x 2x 2x 2x 2x 2x 2x to read 8 int and then copy each of them to the corresponding unsigned chars

5436069
stateless	stateful
explain the differences between stateless and stateful systems and impacts of state on parallelism

5436087
put	get
now you talk about things being faster given that the clr is natively aware of string i suspect a third-party class won t be able to match the speed for some of its operations and you d have to put a lot of work in to get many of the others to be the same speed

5436171
junit	testng
junit and testng both have good support for doing this

5436185

5436258
switching	screens
actually i ended up doing was calling container.resolve on the view i called called container.resolve on the view model this could be done with a standard background worker - then in the runworkercompleted with happens bank on the main thread i create the view passing in the view model that we happily waited for in the background and switching out the wait screens which of course wasn t impacted by our long running process

5436271

hide	show
i just upgraded to xcode 4 and i m trying to open a project i created with the previous xcode but when i open it after about 1 second it hide all the folders and inline projects in the project navigator and only show the resources folder

5436330
disk	ram
i had a project-specific reason for wanting my own in that we re dealing with very large amounts of data and therefore it s optimal to leave them on disk as memory mapped nsdatas ie use ios s virtual memory system so that it s exactly as though the file is loaded as an immutable object without having to spend the ram and most of ours in practice were coming in uncompressed form though the container format allows jpg and png forms if i recall so rolling our own was a subtantial benefit because there s no reprocessing step â we just end up directly mapping the original dicom where the data is in a suitable format

5436339
portrait	landscape
my view on the other hand rotates to both portrait and landscape and in both orientations the keyboard obscures the textfield.

5436339

i have 2 java classes that are the same imagine the getter and setter

5436480
multiplying	add
you can now infer from the definition of sinc x above whether you have to multiplying the two functions or add them

5436489
portrait	landscape
you ll need to set the frame size of your views that you add as subviews before you show them otherwise you ll run into issues the orientation is landscape but the last time you saw the previous view it was portrait

5436489
portrait	landscape
so then you add it as a sub view and fade it in but it shows up as portrait then when we pop without animation the same view but the one that is in the stack now is landscape

5436494
filtering	grouping
basically all we re doing here is passing in the filtering list of grouping we want to use into the context for the template

5436494
filtering	grouping
since i m trying to alter how the grouping filtering is displayed i m checking if it equals grouping

5436494
filtering	grouping
the only things that i ve changed here are adding a new argument to the method called grouping so i can pass in my filtering list of grouping from before as well as adding a new key to the dictionary to pass that list into the context for the template tag

5436494
filtering	grouping
obviously enough i ve set up a check to see if this value is in my filtering list of grouping i want to show and only render the link if it is

5436518
firefox	safari
usually safari s rendering is fine as long as firefox is happy

5436551
post	get
displaying the above form in the template and after a get post should give you the integer value of the colour

5436616
width	height
your images might not be loaded when your script starts so calculating width and height won t work

5436631

you could add a target action to one of your uicontrols within your childviewcontroller class which uses the inherited parentviewcontroller properties to dismiss itself as follows

5436639
children	parent
one table parent is realted one to many with table children

5436639
children	parent
when user want to create an element for parent table the editor must have an opportunity to add create children

5436639
children	parent
when user edit parent then he should have opportunity to delete edit children

5436654
client-side	server-side
basically everything server-side client-side database connection etc is set to utf8 and utf8 general_ci collation.

5436742
explode	implode
alternatively you could use explode to create an array of each individual id and then loop through so you could do some checking on each value to make sure it s correct before using implode to concatenate them back together into a string that you can use in your select .

5436793
pop-up	dialog
if you are using chrome it will automatically open the pdf in a new tab and pop-up the print dialog

i have written an example and ran clang llvm with -s

5436813
hide	show
use jquery to show hide your throbber

5436875
for-loop	loops
as you mentioned you could use a for-loop to get this value out of each row and add it to a list but loops like that aren t very concise or declarative

5436875
for-loop	arrays
when you call .toarray it pulls items from the .select which pulls items from the .cast which iterates over dtgetimages.rows the same as if you d written a for-loop to populate an arrays

5436892
ant	maven
if you want automation you re going to need an automation engine like teamcity or hudson to run an ant or maven build

5436990

5436997
google-chrome	firefox
works great in google-chrome and firefox but ff4 is the only browser that will save the icon in the bookmarks bar

5437077
google-chrome	firefox
this issue occurs in several situations that i know of when using firefox 3.5+ or google-chrome using some specific ntlm configuration for which i don t have the details at hand and when using fiddler see the ad fs 2.0 continuously prompted for credentials while using fiddler web debugger technet article post and the fiddler and channel-binding-tokens blog post which contains more technical background information

5437077
google-chrome	firefox
note that nowhere i could find any information how to make ntlm authentication to ad fs from google-chrome and firefox 3.5+ work without switching off extended protection

5437077
google-chrome	firefox
or is this a google-chrome firefox implementation bug restriction in their use of the windows ntlm library

post	get
when the user pressed the submit button either an http get or an http post message was sent to the server and the browser refreshed using the html code returned from the cgi program on the server

5437195
post	get
this will unobtrusively ajaxify the ajax.actionlink generated result and perform a post request instead of the default get one

5437195
post	get
if you have used firebug you would immediately have seen this that the browser is simply redirecting and sending a get request instead of the expected ajax post request

5437208
ready	each
the function might return data an end-of-file indication or an error other than one indicating that it is blocked and in each of these cases the descriptor shall be considered ready for reading.

5437226
subtract	add
this would work like the thing you see in paint programs etc where you can create a selection by drawing rectangles and clicking the + or - button to determine whether to add or subtract from the current selected area

5437226
subtract	add
i can do all the drawing code but need to know how to convert an ordered series of rectangles each with a mode of add or subtract into one or more polygons

5437248
width	height
to do this you need to play around with the background offset and width height of the actual element that you re setting the background on

5437268
width	height
set the width and height of the element to 48px

5437268
width	height
if you can t control the width and height of the element you are trying to put the background in but you can add new dom elements you can try adding a span inside the element you really want to put the image as a background for

5437389
put	get
you have to get the value of the textbox and put the result back in the value

5437402
easyhook	detours
if you want to use pure c++ check out the libraries easyhook and detours

5437402
easyhook	detours
easyhook works in c++ and c# 32 and 64-bit while detours is somewhat outdated and only for 32-bit c++ even running it on a 64-bit os can crash your program

5437480

after that you can attempt to fix the permissions however you want this may be as simple as running sudo chown -r yourname staff usr local if no files in that dir need to be owned by someone else

5440071
spaces	delimiter
then each field is padded with spaces so the delimiter field align â and everything receives and extra-space by default except for the last field i think

5440071
spaces	delimiter
then the zero with field generated between delimiter is also padded with the extra 1 spaces by default

5440160
getter	setter
penultimately if you have many trivial objects with trivial getter and setter and if you have no profile-guided optimization or link-time optimization there may be caching effects due to large numbers of tiny functions

5440165
fflush	gets
the one big distinction here is that when you change virtual memory spaces the processor s translation lookaside buffer tlb or equivalent gets fflush making memory accesses much more expensive for a while

5440181
onresume	onpause
save shared document-like data in onpause by writing to a database and restoring shared document-like data in onresume

in the end you really can do everything mysql or postgresql do with nothing more then the os file system commands after all that is how the people that wrote these database engines did it

5440581
hash	md5
pb seems hard-coded to use md5 hash over the wire which absolutely won t work in our implementation

5440613
subtraction	addition
i did subtraction for totalrevenue and addition for totalpayment

5440640
apache	nginx
which by the way is also using nginx instead of apache as well

5440704
post	get
so from an abstract high-level view i want to get the post returned from the above scope and remove any which have any associated locks even if just one

5440705
hash	salt
then do something like concatenate all parameters in your case just the id together with the salt and create a sha hash

5440705
hash	salt
now when someone changes the id they would also have to regenerate the hash which is impossible without the secret salt

5440784
put	get
so was looking through different collection types in c# but could not figure out which one has best performance in regards to speed of doing put and get operation in queue

5440822
put	get
if you are looking for high performance put get while checking for uniqueness duplicate checking but order doesnt matter not a queue then use

5440839

i am planning to follow one of the suggestions made here to control window dimensions hide show and bring to front of a window owned by a different process from my process

5441335
post	get
there is of course now the option to use ajax clients but ultimately they are still stateless and code on the server whatever language it is written in still waits for input to be sent via get or post methods

5441447
google-chrome	firefox
it does not happen for the same url in explorer or firefox only in google-chrome

5441447
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
edit same problem observed in safari on iphone so impacts google-chrome safari not firefox explorer

5441505
getter	setter
i m having trouble converting especially the getter and setter

5441508
inherited	subclassing
however subclassing doesn t inherited static_method from class

5441517
folder	directory
i kept the folder imapbuilder on the same directory as the home page file

5441529
getter	setter
sample of getter and setter in java

5441542
getter	setter
java getter and setter aren t as easy to use as c# s

5441542
getter	setter
in java every getter and setter has to be explicitly defined rather than using the shorthand you have there

5441542
getter	setter
for example for your code public int productid you would need a line defining the variable in addition two methods a getter and setter as follows

5441542
getter	setter
you d need to define similar variable declarations and getter setter methods for each variable you have

5441554
textview	imageview
to use something other than textview for the array display for instance imageview or to have some of data besides tostring results fill the views override getview int view viewgroup to return the type of view you want

5441588
put	get
usually it goes simply put get input do physics stuff render pause until 16.67ms has passed

5441603
post	get
to get the tags and the number of post each tag has sorted in descending order you could use the following query

5441604
qfileinfo	qdir	qfile	qdir
qt have some qdir qfileinfo qfile

i want those buttons to be clickable while having a hover background-position background-image change

5441682
amr	aac
the live555 rtsp server is a fully fledged rtsp server that implements most payloads h.263 h.264 mpeg2 pcm amr aac etc

5441751
actualheight	actualwidth
edit after further inspection i found out that it s not the updatelayout itself causing the problems it actually happens when i call actualwidth or actualheight

5441755
gif	png
your only chance of a workaround is to create the gif which doesn t support alpha transparency like png does which is the reason for the rough edges in a way that works with the background you re putting it on - like defining the dominant background colour as the transparent colour so the edges are calculated for that colour instead of black

5441811
winpcap	libpcap
i would suggest starting with libpcap or its sibling winpcap on windows and then interpreting the saved captures

5441847
boost	eigen
among others there s heavy use of boost some eigen

5441852
ant	maven
maven or ant are the best option but for an eclipse-only solution

5441891
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
if you have options dropdownlistfor checkbox ..etc which change the chart graph area up on user preferences or filters go with the 2nd option

5441959
vim	emacs
emacs uses chording extensively whilst vim uses single letter commands chained in quick succession

5441963
free	malloc
malloc and free is located in stdlib.h

5441967
jnetpcap	libpcap
jnetpcap might be what you re looking for it is a java wrapper around the native libpcap library that sarnold mentions

5441984
dlsym	dlopen
as an example in linux you would look at dlopen dlclose dlsym functions

5441984
dlsym	dlopen
basically the user implements a .so object and when your application loads it opens the .so file with dlopen once the library has been loaded and the user enters a string you can look for the specific function name with dlsym and call it through the function pointer

5441986
hide	show	mouseover	mouseout
so that on mouseover and mouseout elements on my image would either show or hide the tooltip

5442031

that s an elf header - a linux bsd solaris bunch of others executable file

5442048
rss	feed
i have the following code that converts my twitter account rss feed into a string so that i can parse my followers user names

5442063
setinterval	settimeout
off-topic note that you almost never want to give either settimeout or setinterval a string containing code

5442070
setinterval	settimeout
if you want settimeout to act like setinterval you ll have to make the function you specified recursive

5442093
uiview	subviews
create a uiview with 2 subviews a uiimageview and a uilabel

5442096
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid

5442219
children	parent
for now i have an idea to add a number field for children so the first child for a given parent object gets 1 the second gets 2 .

5442251
margin	height
if more stuff is going in there it s probably better to give the container a height if you absolutely must and tweak the margin padding etc

5442259
versioning	upgrade
now this isn t a ideal situation and i m a noob when it comes to creating upgrade but the situation i wish is that the program looks at a website ftp server where i deploy a new versioning

5442268
post	get
stephen walther has an old post on the basics that can get you started

5442285
getter	setter
then you could implement appropriate getter and setter

5442388
width	height
however when i resize the application my component which fills the application container ie width height 100 seems to make the rotations calculus based on it s previous width and height

5442393
rational-numbers	fractions
remember that any rational-numbers in 0 1 can be represented as a finite sum of distinct positive or negative unit fractions

5442441
uilabel	uibutton
for this you can subclass uilabel and overwrite its -drawrect method and then use your own uilabel and add a uibutton over it of custom type

5442470
intersect	contains
these tests return an enum of contains disjoint intersect

5442543
implements	extends
your best solution would be to implements your own layoutmanager or extends an existing one if one is really close to your needs using the features and controls you are looking for

5442574
uiview	subviews
i have a uiviewcontroller that contains a uiview subclass as a subviews

5442574
uiview	subviews
in the subviews i dynamically create another uiview

5442574
uiviewcontroller	uipopovercontroller
when the innermost view is created then the uiviewcontroller is informed via a delegation that it must show a uipopovercontroller whose arrow head need to be pointing to the inner most view

5442577
hide	show
i need in my website to hide show a rounded corner div that contains the pie.htc to round it in ie

5442577
hide	show
if i click any link with href then click to show hide the div with the rounded corners it will be displayed without styling

5442577
hide	show
you can click show container then hide container several times and it works perfect but if you click on click here just alert link which is just link with alert then click on show container it will display the content of the div without the background as an example this is as tested in ie8

5442587
range	infinity
generate a positive or negative infinity by going out of range

5442587
subtract	add
add them or equivalently subtract two infinities of the same sign

google-chrome	firefox
the thing is it works in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

5442638
width	height
my wrapper div is floating left and the a tags within are displaying correctly but mousing over them you ll see that they are not the proper height width

5442638
firefox	safari
i am on a mac tested with firefox and safari so far they don t hover correctly only the very bottom portion of them actually function as a button

5442640

i m under the impression the request line of an http request uses a spaces as a delimiter being formatted as

5442678
post	get
adrian link post is about storage of the passwords in a database and you will get there useful info

5442704
width	height
tags accept both height and width declarations through css

5442704
width	height
if you wanted to do it inline it d be for height and width values of 100px

5442704
width	height
incidentally if you want to maintain proportions you can simply define the width without the height

5442712
scatter	graphing
eventually i want a scatter plot with a fit line and error bars with axis that stay on the screen while the graphing is zoomed .

5442712
switching	screens
i ve already built a view that can take a drawable can use focused pinch-zoom and drag can auto-scale images can switching images dynamically and takes images larger than the screens

5442752
int	chars
in c suppose the pointers are strictly typed ie a pointer to an int cannot be used to point to a chars

5442803
memcpy	malloc	memcpy	memmove	memmove	malloc
without pointer casts you must have several versions of memcpy memmove malloc as these all require pointer conversions to be implemented and used

5442823
spaces	delimiter
in fact the rfc even states that spaces are delimiter and should be ignored

5442845
inherited	properties
all container controls have a controls properties which exposes a controlcollection which takes only a system.windows.forms.control or classes that inherited

5442851
rational-numbers	fractions
bisection will give you a limit toward a specific real number as represented as a power of two and continued fractions will take the real number and find the nearest rational-numbers

5442851
integer	fractions
our continued fractions search needs to round to the nearest integer not use floor this is clearer below

5442851
next	except
on further reflection continued fractions are the way to go never mind bisection except to determine the next term

5442914
uilabel	nsstring
for any question of this nature simply go to google type in something class reference where something should be replaced with uilabel or nsstring or some such objective c class and follow the result from developer.apple.com

5442915
hide	show
the function being called loadprojects simply hide the current panel with this gridview and show another one after databinding that second gridview

5442918
put	get
you could put overflow hidden on #main but then the graphic in #branding would get cut off at the bottom

5442941

5443346
width	margin
you need to set the width of the second nested div to 800px for the auto margin to work

5443346
width	margin
right now it s the same width as the containing div so the margin has no effect

5443351
put	get
the fastest path to get something working would be to omit the codebase parameter completely and just put audioapplet.class in the same directory as the jsp

5443392
bazaar	git
as an occasional emacs developer i want to build emacs from the git bazaar sources

5443432

you have put in lots of validation for when the user writes post to prevent xss attacks and such but your validation is faulty

5443446
accessor	properties
i can of course override the image accessor and make sure the properties are loaded by accessing imagedata but it would be nice if there was a way to have awakefromfetch invoked as normal

5443463
width	height
specify the width and height that you want and then use the css property

5443475
g++	gcc
i have mingw installed on my windows platform so gcc and g++ are what i use to compile.

updated using predicatebuilder to show filtering and paging and dynamic linq for sorting

5443820
hash	md5
create a hash on the byte array using md5 crc or similar

5443820
hash	md5
since hashing the bytes will take very little time in comparison to creating the list you may want to use a larger-sized hash function than md5 or crc32 to reduce collisions without a practical performance hit

5443845
udp	tcp
i want to forward all my tcp and udp connection from one of my port and pass them to another machine

uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the reason you re seeing that extra margin at the top is because uinavigationcontroller normally expects that it will be sized to fill the entire screen except perhaps a tab bar at the bottom if it s inside a uitabbarcontroller and therefore expects that the top edge of its view will be under the status bar if the status bar is visible

rational-numbers	fractions
note that this can be combined with templatetypedef s original interview question and apply towards any rational-numbers p q not just between 0 and 1 by first computing q x 0 then for either positive negative integers bounding between two consecutive integers and then using the above algorithm for the fractions part

5445908
rational-numbers	fractions
first note that until the rational-numbers is found the # of steps n k for each new continued fractions term is exactly 2b a_k -1 where b a_k is the # of bits needed to represent a_k ceil log2 a_k it s b a_k steps to widen the net of the binary search and b a_k -1 steps to narrow it

use parse_url trim explode array_pop and implode

5445969
pop-up	dialog
strange that everyone answered this question but failed to spot the obvious problem given that exceptions raised in a background thread are asynchronous and can occur at any time this means that showing exceptions from a background thread would pop-up a dialog box at random times to the user quite possibly showing an exception that has nothing to do with what the user is doing at the moment

technically one way to write such a preprocessor is to use standard tools like lex flex and yacc bison to define your grammar and generate the parser say in c

5446227
yacc	bison
it would be best if analogs of tools like lex flex yacc bison were available within mathematica i mean bindings which would require one to only write code in mathematica and generate say c parser from that automatically plugging it back to the kernel either through mathlink or librarylink

i binded hover and mousemove but when unbinding them i have to also unbind mouseenter and mouseleave to get it to work a little better but still it doesn t work correctly

5447396
int	chars
an interesting point that was noted in the discussion of another answer which i didn t really think the author needed to delete is that there is a difference between a chars set which in the other author s words - don t remember his username defines a mapping between int and chars capital a is 65 and an encoding which defines how those int are to be represented in a byte stream

5447396
int	chars
most old chars sets such as ascii have only one very simple encoding each int becomes exactly one byte

5447414
firefox	safari
i know you like firefox but you could try safari on windows since it allows cross domain from file and it has good tools in the form of web inspector

5448335
lisp	scheme
i am new to lisp and i am learning scheme through the sicp videos

5448335
lisp	scheme
in lisp at least in scheme a different kind of abstraction seems prevalent in order to attack a problem you design a hierarchy of domain specific languages each of which is buil upon the previous one and acts at a coarser level of detail and higher level of abstraction

5448372
textview	imageview
each collectionitem holds a textview and an imageview

5448762
ienumerable	ienumerator
you can try to remove ienumerable ienumerator from class definition

5448780
for-loop	loops
the for-loop uses i as a counter and it s incremented 1 unit for each iteration starting by 0 when i y loops ends so you are doing from 0 to y-1 beeps counting the 0 beep the sum of all is y and that is what you want

5448811
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a problem i have created a project window based application in xcode then i create a uitabbarcontroller that manages two views all programmatically the second view is a tableview and i want to see in the top a uinavigationcontroller i have tried a lot but i don t know how to have a uinavigationcontroller in the second view

5448909
trie	tree
tree versus trie is a bit difficult

5448949
inherited	properties
i have to get needed css properties of element properties may be inherited from it s parent

5448958
many-to-many	one-to-many
general answer is you must know which relations were created or removed and you must manually set either state of related object in case of one-to-one or one-to-many or state of relation in case many-to-many

5449010
post	get
using post and get method doesn t

5449012

data is uniquely referenced by url and can be acted upon using http operations get put post delete etc

5449052
extjs	gxt
however the instructions at didn t work because there simply isn t any google web toolkit configure for using extjs gwt gxt for me either

5449056
rss	feed
a completely different approach would be to use the views module and create rss feed of your nodes

5449069

you want only to detect if it is 32 bit system and in this case it will be always x86 of course for x86 processors everything else means 64bit

5449072
put	get
you take advantage over the http methods get delete put

5449137

i prefer this instead of a middle layer because the software is simpler no extra web development just couchdb get and put and it can crash restart be upgraded etc

5449221
textarea	textbox
i just want to know how can i change the background colour of a textarea to a colour typed in a textbox

you could use indexof int ch function found in java.lang.string .it returns position of chars in the string or -1 on failure

5449256
mouse	keyboard
moving the cursor with the user s mouse or the right key in the keyboard should be relevant to the div s width and to the movie size

5449303
public	protected
the only solution i have come up with is creating a convert function that takes the foo object as an argument and then copies all public protected values to a new fooson object that is then returned

5449336
getter	setter
if those private fields can be accessed from getter and setter method so wrap that methods in your fooson class

5449347
for-loop	arrays
i know i can iterate over the arrays with a for-loop - i m just wondering if there s a more concise alternative

5449359
google-chrome	firefox
browsers i tried are firefox ie and google-chrome

5449409
put	get
but when i try to put a picture in the div i cannot get it to display

5449421
put	get
the msdn docs says that the designers deliberately did not put in a foreach with an array due to the fact that 1 it is trivial to write 2 exactly your problem -- people will get confused whether the original array is modified or not

5449421
for-loop	arrays
however if you want to modify the original arrays in-place there is the good old for-loop

5449440
prepare	execute
connect to the database using dbi prepare query execute the query and fetch the results

5449446
width	height
i can see after your 100 width and height that you wanna make the whole page an iframe

5449457
implements	extends
read through the documentation for abstractauthenticationprocessingfilter based on your earlier question i guess this is the class that your custom filter extends the abstract method to implements is attemptauthentication which receives httpservletrequest and httpservletresponse as parameters

5449480
unsigned	short
best you probably can do is use the above mentioned uintptr_t if you have a c99 compiler or compile a program on the target platform which checks whether sizeof void is equal to any of the sizeof unsigned short int long long long and generate a header file where you typedef your own uintptr according to what the program found out

5449482
hide	show
but if i hide it and then show it back again it show up but without using the flags

when debugging on device using developer profiling it should be checked

5449613
boost	eigen
using the boost filesystem namespace before including eigen causes the compiler to fail

5449613
boost	eigen
the reason is that if boost filesystem is added to the global namespace it pollutes it and causes some code here eigen that depends on unpolluted namespace to cause errors during compilation

5449644
single-quotes	double-quotes
note the single-quotes in the first and double-quotes in the second

5449678
post	get
i don t understand why post and get are not an option

5449680
typemock	moles
when that isn t practical you can either write proxy classes that use an adapter interface as you ve suggested or use a black-magic tool like typemock or moles just kidding about the black magic part i just don t have any experience with them

5449683
short	base
the short answer is no you cannot assign an object of some base class to one of a derived class at all

5449701
prepare	execute
as you can see i didn t use dbi prepare execute fetch and finish because selectall_hashref method does it all for us

5449709
implements	extends
or to make a concrete class extends the abstract class and thereby implements the interface

5449788
rss	feed
this will allow you to get an rss feed which can then be parsed and used by your application

rackunit is the unit-testing framework that s part of racket a language and implementation that grew out of scheme

5449804
int	double
note the double is necessary rather than an int in the above declaration for later usage.

5449827
udp	tcp
unluckily all operations on one recvmmsg invokation refer to the same socket so it is mostly useful for udp based services for tcp there would have to be a kind of recvmmsmsg syscall which also takes a socket descriptor per item

5449834
versioning	upgrade
this is particularly troublesome when loading javascript libraries dojo or jquery -- you have to change each html page when you upgrade to the next versioning

5449861
nsstring	nsdata
well i know it s few months late but you re sending nsstring instead of nsdata to the contents parameter

5449966
maven	pom.xml
you can use the unpack goal of maven dependency plugin in your pom.xml to unpack the desired dependencies to a folder and ensure maven war plugin includes this folder

5449993
post	get
also you should rather use the post method with forms not get

5450015
uiview	subviews
i ve seen custom subviews implemented as an uiviewcontroller subclass but that maybe could have been implemented as an uiview subclass

5450016
cpython	pypy
pypy is a lot smarter than cpython about noticing commonalities and avoiding the memory overhead associated with duplicating things unnecessarily

5450046

5450159
boost	allocator
many boost libraries do this for example boost.any does this to hide your type and boost.shared_ptr does this to hide the de allocator mechanic

5450172
inherited	properties
the data classes i use are fairly complex ones lots of properties quite deep inherited tree etc.

5450183

folder	directory
don t put the folder in you web directory if you don t have to

5450260
hash	md5
as i ve mentioned in the comment to your question md5 and similar hash algorithms don t use much memory -- less than a kilobyte per instance

5450260
hash	md5
in this case to save memory you want to feed md5 shaxxx hash calculating object a stream of data chunks keeping as fewer intermediate values as possible

5450283
fts4	fts3
i tried this using fts3 and fts4 with the same results

5450289
awt	swing
one thing that may be the reason swing is not thread-safe so all changes on the gui with includes your setcontentpane should occur in the awt event dispatch thread

5450535
cassini	iis
where should i put the cross domain policy file so that i can test within visual studio cassini webserer and not iis

5450536
int	double
in math.h due to its primitive nature the abs function is essentially just for int types and if you wanted to get the absolute value of a double you had to use fabs

5450536
int	double
it improved things like having to distinguish between fabs and abs and just made abs for both double and int types

5450536
int	double
use math.h and use abs for int fabs for double

5450541
setinterval	settimeout
in javascript you can t really spawn new threads - the closest you can get to that is using settimeout or setinterval

5450551
qnetworkreply	qnetworkaccessmanager	qnetworkrequest	qnetworkaccessmanager	qnetworkrequest	qnetworkreply	qnetworkrequest	qiodevice	qiodevice	qnetworkaccessmanager	qiodevice	qnetworkreply

the for-loop is supposed to loops through the arrays and since the fibonacci numbers are equal to the sum of the two preceeding numbers i want to add them then display them

5450711
post	get
post to superuser.com to get answers for problems you have with linux admin issues

5450717
for-loop	loops
you might also want to use a foreach loops instead of a plain for-loop just to be idiomatic

5450731
jar	war
in a war the bundles should be in a jar file in the web-inf lib directory or in the web-inf classes directory

5450804

uitableview	reloaddata
you don t appear to be calling the uitableview reloaddata method at any point after you ve carried out the deletion

5451074
implements	extends	super	extends	super	implements
and usually also composition is better than inheritance so a class should extends a class or implements a interface only if it truly is-a super type

5451101
bash	zsh
this all assumes that you re using bash sh and zsh will work as well iirc

5451122
thin	webrick
i was not able to get the stack traces to show with webrick or thin but my eventual workaround was to use mongrel which properly prints the stack traces to stderr

5451213
put	get
and just for some super-kicks it would be awesome if the program could read those pdf files parse the tables in the pdf and put them into a spreadsheet or something - if someone tells me how to do that in a few hours you ll get some serious respect and love

5451241
sorting	filtering
also creating dataview s in your view model class gives you an easy path to implementing sorting and filtering commands when the time comes

5451242
put	get
i get it returns que onda with a space because so i put it in web service but never it returns que onda +nombre .

5451263
width	height
i m not sure how they are displayed on the page but if they are on a solid colored background you could make a png of the negative space and place it inside a div of the exact width and height of the image then just change the background color of the div on hover since the actual logo is transparent you would see the background color of the parent div

5451265
dictionary	map
so the idea behind a dictionary is to map a key to a value object

5451277
cassini	iis
i would suggest that you look to test with iis express rather than cassini

5451277
cassini	iis
cassini is deprecated in favour of iis express

5451281
hide	show
in the html for each row is a containing an anchor tag with an onclick event that runs a jquery script to show hide elements for that row

5451299

it has sorting filtering pagination row selection and a lot more features

5451566
qmail	exim
i have seen a number of open source and free email servers such as hmailserver and mailenable windows and qmail postfix and exim linux

5451597
gif	png
this applies across both jpg and png filetypes i haven t tested gif or others.

5451662
post	get
it seems as though i can access the page with the get method but not post i assume this has something to do with the variables being sent through the url but i don t have enough knowledge of rails currently to solve this

5451787
draggable	droppable
i m trying to use jquery ui draggable droppable plugins

5451787

5451803
children	parent
your controls are all children of same frameworkelement parent all of them are within a grid

5451808
maven	pom.xml
i can run it from eclipse but not from the pom.xml alt-click run as maven test

5451815
int	double
this is used if you want your int value to be converted to a double or to specify that your value is indeed a double

5451820
int	double
the d after the value 9.02 forces the int numeric real value 9.02 to be treated as a double

5451827
int	double
stylistically you generally only need to add a d or a d when you want an int literal to be a double

5451831
int	double
suffix d is important while using reflection and other dynamic usage to enforce complier to consider the number as double instead of int where double can have number without decimal

5451844
children	parent
parent know only about its children

5451845
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

5451874
folder	directory
for me it worked to change the file type in the file inspector of the folder en.lproj from default directory to directory

5451900
int	double
since you are passing a double into a method that expects and int you are getting truncation

5451900
int	double
for example the double 1035.55 becomes 1035 when you convert it to an int

5451902
onclick	preventdefault
strangely before the onclick function i do have a simple div centering function which is working even following the form preventdefault

5451913
post	get
this seems to be working fine with form get method but not with post method

5451915
opera	google-chrome
this happens on all browsers i ve tested firefox2 firefox3 ie6 ie7 latest opera latest google-chrome

5451923
realloc	malloc
another way is using dynamic memory allocation malloc or realloc

5451963
inherited	properties
you need to use a new style class inherited from object for properties to work

5451970
hide	show
or just show hide a different type of control

5451989
post	get
this will get you the most recent post of the user

5452079
gmail	hotmail
i tried googling around for a good php plugin code that enables me to place an invite your email contacts on my website something like linkedin s invitation plugin which works for all kinds of networks including gmail yahoo and hotmail

5452094
width	height
you could adapt bozho s code but substituting your original image and passing the two extra arguments for the height and width that you want

5452102
implements	extends
you would need to create a class that either implements runnable or extends thread to do this work in another thread to prevent the hang

5452140
min	max
an outer query will simply take min max from this derived table

5452182
width	height
i want them to be half that size yet when i define the width and height of the object tag etc. the video is not resized merely zoomed in

5452202
versioning	upgrade
it will replace the app on device however any files created by the previous versioning will survive the upgrade including your shared preferences and db files

5452269
fadein	fadeout
right now it seems like it is returning only after completing fadein fadeout animation on all the iamgeviews

5452318
int	boolean
previously i would have had 3 int act as boolean say aflag bflag and cflag

5452319
int	chars
its returning an int but i want the results of the command to be sent to a chars

5452339
integer	unsigned
the better way to do this is to use an unsigned integer type to represent a collection of flags

5452392
post	get
it handles oauth and you can use it to sign your http requests to get or post data to your calendars

5452421
rtos	qnx
with the blackberry playbook moving to qnx we might see for the first time a friendly development environment libraries as well as tools for an rtos

5452443
put	get
you also don t want to put this on the main timeline because any code references on the main timeline automatically get yanked onto frame 1

5452444
pull	push
yet it is vital that the on-site team is able to synchronize commit push pull their changes between another

5452444
pull	push
then have the on-site team change their origin to the netbook and push to and pull from the netbook

5452461
awt	swing
the awt or swing focusmanager uses a focustraversalpolicy to determine which component gets the focus next

5452461
gridbaglayout	grouplayout
this works best when using some grid-based layout manager like gridlayout gridbaglayout grouplayout and such

5452473
hide	show
it worked fine but it did the hide + show animation if i clicked an opened option

5452473
hide	show
so if the content is not hidden it should just hide the content instead of hide and show again

5452484
post	get
get and post have important differences but nothing relevant to parsing the response text of your http request

5452494

if you want to make sure both are more than 50 you ironically need to check width or height

5454873
sorting	filtering
this way you can use it as a model property that will automatically be bound on your search actions pass it to service and repository methods instead of a bunch of separate params persist it in session if need be have strongly typed filtering properties specific to the current type you are searching for ie user have a supertype for holding generic paging or sorting

5454882

i am attempting to use jquery so that i can hide and show this region based on div id value of abc

5455024

another option to consider is sending the lvm_approximateviewrect message which is documented to return the approximate height and width required for a listview control to display the specified number of items

5455024

5455184
udp	tcp	udp	rtp
according to computer networks rtp is the payload of udp or tcp as the book indicates

5455184
udp	rtp
according to wireshark s wiki only rtp on udp could be detected by wireshark

5455567
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
and the jqxhr in jquery 1.4.x xmlhttprequest object

5455567
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
the function receives three arguments the jqxhr in jquery 1.4.x xmlhttprequest object a string describing the type of error that occurred and an optional exception object if one occurred

5455567
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
the function gets passed two arguments the jqxhr in jquery 1.4.x xmlhttprequest object and a string categorizing the status of the request success notmodified error timeout abort or parsererror

5455567
hide	show
so the best idea would be to show the indicator in the callback passed to beforesend and hide it in complete

5455573
converter	multibinding
in the multibinding the first binding is your binding as now - without the converter

5455595
hide	show
when you select another tab the tab you were currently viewing is hidden but jquery also likes to hide everything within the tab as well so you may have to create another call that checks for any elements currently being hidden within the tab and iteratively show them

5455635
post	get
becase the website resouce is protected by session so i have to login the website first before i can do some operation such as get or post some data

5455722
response.redirect	redirecttoaction
i think what s happening is that redirecttoaction is doing a response.redirect which is terminating the processing of the request and not allowing the cookie to be set

5455759
width	height
you should prefer to pas teh target width amd height as parameters teh way you set teh height prevents multi-threaded usage and makes it very hard to read

5455759
width	height
also are you sure you are setting the image height correctly the height is related to a ration between height and width a narrow image will give you a very tall image and stretched image assuming the width of the target image is to remain constant

5455764
stdout	stderr
ofcourse we all know that ls command exists immediately after printing some stuff to stdout or may be stderr but the above script never exists

5455783

5455880

getter	setter
should not contain descriptions of its getter and setter

5456181
getter	setter
you asked why the description of the getter setter should contain a description of the variable not the other way around

5456181
getter	setter
the getter and setter should describe the effect they are having which may include the modification or retrieval of some abstract property of this object

5456278
post	get
however instead of hardcoding the value 30.days.ago i want to get the retainer value from the post s category and base the condition on that so something like

5456278
put	get	post	get	post	put

running the collation from a cron job at this frequency is about borderline - there are a number of constraints which vary depending on the implementation of cron - and you need to think about what happens if a single invocation takes longer than the actual interval to process - if it were me i d do it in the data capture or running as a daemon

5471543
rsa	dsa
talking of signatures as encryption with the private key is the way the rsa standard historically put it hence names such as md5withrsaencryption but it is inaccurate paddings are and must be different and overly specific it applies only to rsa not el gamal dsa diffie-hellman ntru...

have a table of availability with columns int hotel_id date date boolean available

5474231
haskell	agda

yourworkerthread is a class that extends thread and implements a method run where the logic of the server is located

5474391

with that in mind you can let s say class b extends class a then if you whant class b to have a particular constant defined class a should implements an interface

5474401

hmm if object b extends object a and object a contains a constant or variable then object b will also contain them if the variable is protected or public

however you typically can t use the same approach here as there is a big difference in how a floating-point value and an integer is represented

5474886
int	double
to leave that generic but limited to only double and int

5474947
int	double
double is 64bit and can contain any value that int can have

5474947
int	double
also since the int s never have a fraction casting from and do double won t cause loss of precision or rounding errors

5474951
width	height
i m trying to make a box with rounded corners where the height and width of the div depends on the content so it s automatically adjust to it.

5474964
int	double
you can however store any int value in a double so i would just use a double for everything

5474966
int	double
but if object size is your primary concern then this might not be the best solution as you need to store a reference to the wrapper object double or int in addition to the object itself which is almost certainly larger than just storing a double itself

5474967
put	get
i get the same if i remove the button and action but put in a handler for the scrolling event of the uiscrollview

5475364
children	parent

to open it at the very top left with a width of 50 and height of 20 you would do

5475519
move	drag
i can drag my finger up and down and this makes the uiscrollview s scrollbars appear but my custom-drawn content never move or changes - i still always only see the top half

5475540
postfix	lamson
it looks like people have used postfix listening on port 25 and forwarding requests to lamson

5475564
stateless	stateful
because http is stateless and jsf is stateful

5475564
filtering	grouping
i ve seen lot of codes and projects which unnecessarily duplicates the entire database table into java s memory in flavor of a session scoped bean where java is been used instead of sql to filtering grouping arrange the records

5475609
disk	ram
we re running a moderate size 350gb database with some fairly large tables a few hundred million rows 50gb on a reasonably large server 2 x quad-core xeons 24gb ram 2.5 10k disk in raid10 and are getting some pretty slow inserts simple insert of a single row taking 90 seconds

5475650
mouseup	mousedown
i need to undo some behavior in a library i m using by stoppropagation of the mousedown and mouseup event for the textinput

5475650
mouseup	mousedown
as i mentioned above i need to be able to stop the propagation of mousedown and mouseup from the textinput to a component up the food chain - event.stoppropagation in mousedown and mouseup for the textinput does the trick

5475666
post	get
getting profile permissions works find yet when i post to profile permissions i get

5475667
hash	md5
if it is a standard has algorithm like md5 you can find websites that already have large mappings of source and hash and get the answer that way

5475681
windows	wow64
process or a wow64 process windows

5475719
apache	nginx
i have nginx setup as a reverse proxy and to serve static files javascript css images and apache using mod_wsgi for serving django as described in the documentation

5475724
mouseup	mousedown
i think all you would need to do is register listeners for the mousedown mouseup and click events and then use to stop the events from bubbling further from the currenttarget out to the parents stopimmediatepropagation would stop the event from triggering listeners on the current object

5475726
mouse	joystick
i m working on a project where i need to use a joystick directinput to control the mouse pointer inside a wpf application

5475726
mouse	joystick
preferably this should actually control the mouse allowing the joystick to be used to control other applications as well

5475828
google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure if this is something that isn t supposed to work but i cannot seem to figure out why it works perfectly in ie and google-chrome but not in firefox

5475865
pop-up	dialog
what you should do instead is pop-up a loading dialog at the time the request is made then move your code for showing the other pop-up and closing the loading dialog into the complete handler

5475892
hide	show
i m trying to hide show a subset of rows when clicking a row with a specific id

5475892
hide	show
only problem is this code for some reason only hide show the very first set of rows

5475908
qmap	qdatastream
i saw in qtassistant that qdatastream supports qmap and qmultimap inherits qmap

5475910
implements	extends
consider extends the existing interface with a new interface and implements that just in the app that needs it

5475938
folder	directory
so i hava a usual flex project folder with .actionscriptproperties .flexproperties .project files in it and src libs html-template directory

5475945
getter	setter
in the preapproval class there are a few public getter setter for the datamember attributes

5475947
octal	hex
i don t know how to properly specify the character code of â emdash but vim tells me it is 151 hex 97 octal 227

5475972
mp3	wav
you can easily save that data as it happens and subsequently save that file as a new wav mp3 what-have-you

5476005
bmp	png
the second parameter lets you pick the format you want to save the image on like bmp png or jpeg

5476007
versioning	upgrade
this way you ll get a chance to run code not only once per app lifetime but also once per versioning upgrade

5476063
width	height
jquery now uses a csshooks feature for certain .css requests width and height in particular

5476081
jobs	cron
specific use i have jobs scheduled to run daily using a cron trigger

5476110
client-side	server-side
this is a very nice way of designing your code because it decouples any client-side requirements from those on the server-side

5476112
udp	tcp
according to unix network programming vol1 received udp packets and received tcp packets are never passed to a raw socket

5476112
udp	tcp
if a process wants to read ip datagrams containing udp or tcp packets the packets must be read at the datalink layer .

5476133
postgresql	mysql
install mysql postgresql image magick etc

5476151
firefox	safari
the first code snippet below works in ie and firefox but doesnâ t pop a new window in safari

5476161
qtextedit	qfile	qstring	qfile	qstring	qtextedit
instead of using qtextbrowser setsource read the contents of the file manually with qfile and then set the contents of the browser to that qstring using qtextedit sethtml

5476161
qstring	qfile	qstring	qurl	qfile	qurl
this allows you to check that the filename returned from your database is valid that the html contents are valid by inspecting the qstring read from the qfile and that construction of the qurl and search path used by qtextbrowser setsource is not an issue

5476163
portrait	landscape
this will mean if your device is in landscape and you switch activity the new activity will display in portrait on its side and the user will then have to rotate the phone into portrait mode to view it correctly

5476175
google-chrome	firefox
you ll also want to test in ie i ve only tested in google-chrome 10 and firefox 4

5476218
put	get
you should put up some of loading image or something while it is running also anytime you call a gui you should run a loop with a timeout that activates the app then checks for the existence of the items you want to click then when it exists click it and get out of the loop

5476252
hide	show
go int edit region for the region you want to hide show

5476256
rss	feed
i just don t want to show the rss feed but i want to also show the proper nodes and

5476262
mouseup	mousedown
in such case i got what i wanted by stopping propagation on the mousedown event but not on the mouseup

5476265
submit	submission
lastly give your form a submit button and try clicking it instead of submission the form

5476284
innodb	myisam
whenever there are joins involving myisam and innodb innodb tables will end up having table-level lock behavior instead of row-level locking because of myisam s involvement in the query and mvcc cannot be applied to the myisam data

5476284
innodb	myisam
unfortunately if there is a mix of innodb and myisam in the join query the innodb tables would have to experience an intermittent lock like its myisam partners in the join query because of being held up from writing

5476284
innodb	myisam
believe it or not there is still an open ticket on innodb myisam joining during a select for update

5476333
post	get
unrelated to the concrete problem you d like to use post for this instead of get

5476384
width	height
okay so say i got a rectangle this is all 2d made from thing a s x y width and height

5476520
hash	salt
then hash this using my secret key as the salt

5476521
folder	directory
unfortunately after setting ror up all i get is a directory listing of my public folder

5476566
post	put
however i have noticed if i put other buttons on the screen and the post back it doesn t fail even after authentication has timed out

5476662
serializable	deserialization
remember each call to webservice need xml serializable deserialization time processor power + space memory

5476737
post	put
2 - use curlopt_postfields with a string and make it look like a post and then you change the http method with curlopt_customrequest to put

5476743
user-controls	elementhost
also the user-controls is being used as an elementhost in a winforms application not sure if this makes a difference

5476761
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout will only fire once setinterval will fire every x milliseconds

5476763
freebsd	linux
most of the solutions i ve found thus far are linux specific but i need this to work in freebsd

5476839
jnetpcap	libpcap
i m trying to port jnetpcap a java wrapper for libpcap with jni to android

5476839
jnetpcap	libpcap
when trying to compile jnetpcap as a shared library and linking with libpcap.a i m getting errors because some libpcap s functions weren t declared in this scope

5476849
next	except
this doesn t seem to do anything except increase the counter value next to the text box

5476875
int	chars
and as this string will contain chars in the 0-9a-f range casted to an int you have

5476894
children	parent
now parent can have it s own opacity value that will not be inherited by it s children

5476894
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is fully supported by firefox opera google-chrome safari and ie9

5476895
qplaintextedit	qwidget
i would try subclassing qplaintextedit and reimplementing qwidget keypressevent

5476927
int	chars
this is because reading an int from the stream makes the stream read until either it reads a nondigit chars or it runs out of chars to read

5476974
keystore	jks
that s easy when the ca certs are in a jks keystore but i need to use the windows keystore as well

5477025
put	get
when i put xmlelementwrapper i get null in groupnodeslist

5477025
put	get
when i put xmllist i get an exception saying that groupnode is a complex type to be put under xmllist

5477072
maven	pom.xml
i consider this maven s pom.xml as one of the most important artifacts generated by the spring roo

5477072
maven	pom.xml
using pom.xml you can configure your ide projects settings among other maven tasks building and reporting for example

5477087
folder	directory
through putty gave ec2-user chown permissions in var www html and sub directory and plopped a simple index.html in that folder

5477189
udp	tcp	icmp	tcp	icmp	udp
when you create a raw socket you can specify which protocol to bind to udp tcp or icmp using the ipproto_tcp etc protocol options

5477189
udp	tcp
so if you set ipproto_tcp and open a raw socket on port 5000 your application will receive raw tcp packets sent to port 5000 but not raw udp packets sent to port 5000

5477227
jnetpcap	libpcap
or downgrade jnetpcap to version that support old libpcap

5477227
jnetpcap	libpcap
libpcap 0.9.8 if from 2007 so you should choose jnetpcap from around this year as well

5477305
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
the other browsers opera google-chrome safari ie works well

5477395
int	double
so you will need to modify your code to either take into consideration this extra line or remove it from the first record as your code is expecting int string string string string double string whereas the first record is int string string string string double string double

5477438
rss	feed
this is a very simple question but its difficult for me to answer myself because i am testing my pipe with rss feed that are always changing

5477527
post	get
i am new to jquery and ajax for that matter and i am trying to get a grasp on how the get post ajax methods work

5477588
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd
there is some ability to deal with other operating systems conventions freebsd has the linuxulator which handles the linux-specific kernel interface netbsd similarly has emulators for the system call formats of other operating systems using the same hardware say ultrix on mips or osf 1 on alpha linux used to have ibcs2 to handle the unixware sco unix kernel interface wine provides replacement shared libraries and a binary loader for pe-style windows executables

5477655
google-chrome	firefox
my website has a form which works in firefox but not in ie or google-chrome

5477655
google-chrome	firefox
the source code is the same both in google-chrome and firefox

5477762
min	max
this syntax is accepted but produces alpha sorted sets like max 53 min 1203

5477762
min	max
i tried nesting cast inside of min max but that syntax got rejected

5477763
opencv	emgucv
you can use opencv or emgucv to create a program to create images from each frame of a video but for the program to be able to detect positive and negative images you would need to already have a trained classifier to recognise the shape of the hand which is exactly what you want to do

5477871
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a tabcontrol in my window inside each tabitem i want to have a different page

5477872
profiling	debugging
this works fine in debugging it also works if i run the release executable from using the start profiling option from dependency walker

5477917
jobs	cron
we have a resque worker who is supposed to pop data-synchronisation jobs off a queue the reasons are two-fold using cron and paying rails environment boot time over-and-over sucks and the alternative queues well github made a pretty good case against them when they announced resque

5477917
postgresql	mysql
the mysql adapter and the postgresql adapter in activerecord are differentâ but either way i would expect the activerecord reconnect true configuration to work

5477934
onresume	onpause
stop the preview and release the camera in onpause and acquire it in onresume

5477956
pull	push
you could also write a middleware that pull the user out of the request checks user.is_staff and if so call request.session.set_expiry to manually push the expiration time out

5478022
mouse	keyboard
simulate mouse keyboard input in wpf

5478032
google-chrome	firefox
i m encountering a weird problem with how a php file s code read source code is rendered in some browser s source code view i ve tested firefox 4 google-chrome 10 ie9

5478101
jaxp	stax
if your jaxb implementation uses a stax parser under the covers via the standard jaxp apis then adding the woodstox jar to your classpath should cause your jaxb impl to use woodstox

5478130
min	max
but what i would then like to do is style highlight or bold the max or min the team leader of each stat column

5478137
hash	salt
then hash the users incoming plain text password add the salt to it and hash it again

5478137
hash	salt
once you have the posted hash you can add the salt to it and hash it again then store that value as the users password

5478165
google-chrome	firefox
i try to write a greasemonkey script to be run in firefox and google-chrome

5478180
width	height
the width and height to the image in xaml are optional

5478186
mouse	keyboard
each time you receive a mouse or keyboard message restart your timer

5478252
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
fix for no mousewheel in a flex app when wmode opaque it actually works in ie just not firefox or google-chrome probably not safari or opera either

5478268
google-chrome	firefox
after all i run my project in ie9.0 google-chrome and firefox

5478268
google-chrome	firefox
if i run this project in google-chrome or firefox message shown like there is error undefined

5478312
ssl	https
the only safe way to connect to a webserver is by using ssl https

5478313
listview	gridview
you can definitely do this with a listview and nested gridview

5478313
listview	gridview
i suggest you start with a listview and just make the parent rows ie the grey bar rows. from there you can add in your nested gridview

5478330
subclass	abstract-class
basically i need to have an abstract-class that contains a field of a list that details it can hold subclasses of a certain class and then create a concrete class that stores a specific subclass of that certain class

5478409
datediff	difference
for calculations on difference between two date use the datediff function

5478417
children	parent
rspec will run the parent grouping before after for the children blocks and have the mixin available to them

5478424
hide	show
but if i hide it then show it again its just an empty black space

5478437
google-chrome	firefox
i recommend using firebug in firefox or the elements developer tool in google-chrome to inspect your html elements and see which element is occupying that space

5478443
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari it works as it should

5478468
innodb	myisam
another possibility is that the query itself is very expensive due to lack of indexes a huge dataset or limitations in the table engine you are using probably either innodb or myisam

5478480
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade to xcode 4.0.1 from the last versioning of xcode 3x not sure which

5478498
gtk	gdk	gtk	cairo	gtk	gio	gdk	cairo	gdk	gio
gtk-fortran offers currently an interface to nearly 8600 gtk functions gtk gdk gdkpixbuf cairo pango atk glib gobject gio

5478532
google-chrome	firefox
since ie handles this kind of error differently from firefox and google-chrome

5478600
versioning	upgrade
i am using the apache click framework and had recently upgrade from versioning 2.2.0 to 2.3.0-rc1

5478605
plot	heatmap
i want to plot this using a heatmap such that a black square will represent a -1 and a white square will represent a +1

5478619
rss	feed
i m looking for the best way to extract the content of documents formatted in various ways some restaurants provide an rss feed others provide an html table for others you have to compile the result displayed on multiple pages.

5478642
rss	feed
you can use rss feed from website like espncricinfo

5478695
stdout	stderr
note that in general when using runtime.exec you ll want to consume the stdout and stderr streams to avoid deadlock although in this case it s not an issue since the open command doesn t produce much output

5478698
avr	microcontroller
you can build mini web servers using tiny little 8-bit microcontroller like pic and avr microcontroller

5478715
super	self
super your_form self .__init__ args kwargs

5478748
trojan	virus
this is to limit the chance you can accidentally introduce a virus trojan or whatever to your server just by web browsing form it

5478775
keydown	keyup
i am developing one application for the ptz i have taken one grid and when i press up arrow key then on keydown event of up arroa key i am starting my movement and on keyup even i m stopping the movement

5478775
keydown	keyup
but when i pres arrow key its keydown event is called and then focus is getting moved to another control so its keyup is not getting called....so i want stop this focus movement on arrowkeys so that i can get both event.....so how to do that

5478800
google-chrome	firefox
note you must view this with a html5 browser like google-chrome or firefox

5478801
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade eclipse to 3.6.2 and made sure to install the latest versioning android sdk r10

5478802
uitableview	uiswipegesturerecognizer
basically i have created a uiswipegesturerecognizer for my uitableview for when the user swipes from left to right

5478858
superclass	subclassing
you can t assign a superclass to a subclassing without casting you can however go the other way around

5478925
jar	war
the instructions from david chandler part of the gwt team suggest that the maven-clean-plugin should be used to remove the jar from the resulting war file

5478962
width	height
the plan is first the rectangle decreases in width x after that the rectangle decreases in height y

5479009
put	get	children	parent
if you are using mysql i would use the group_concat function to get all your children and put them into one row for the parent in a new column

5479018
x86	64bit
your application can run perfectly fine in a 64bit environment even when the target platform is x86

5479020
ord	chr
ord ch gives the integer value for that chr

5479021
tstringgrid	tcheckbox
put a tcheckbox inside a tstringgrid in delphi

5479043
google-chrome	firefox
this exact code works fine from firefox 4 and google-chrome 10 and i was led to believe the android browser resolves this header from version 2.1 up

5479089
put	get
however i get an error when trying to put . in the first char of yytext

5479100
indexof	replaceall
when you call methods from string class for example replaceall indexof the program will work correctly but when you have null you have nullpointerexception all time when you re calling method on it

5479109
for-loop	loops	for-loop	while-loop	loops	while-loop
see also loops while-loop for-loop and do-while

5479110
for-loop	loops
in contrast to a for-loop the foreach loops doesn t require the coder to maintain a counter variable to avoid off-by-one fencepost bugs

5479168
appfuse	struts
zend really isn t substantially more complicated than say a struts + appfuse + hibernate stack

5479187
for-loop	loops
personally i used only once time ago in order to break a for-loop inside other two for loops with if-else and continue in the outer loops as break inside a loops breaks this loops but you continue in the outer loops not the most-outer that was my case

5479253
hide	show
in the first one you show the image and in the second one you hide the image

5479270
accessor	properties
these items have a properties called autospecqty that has a get accessor that needs to execute some code that is specific to each item

5479270
ready	each
what i d like to do is to store the code for each item in a table in my database then when the app starts just pull the relevant code out and bung it in a list ready to be executed when the time comes

5479272
google-chrome	firefox
if you open it in firefox all works well and the position of the overlay div in the images is perfect but in google-chrome and ie the result is different

5479273
free	malloc
move the malloc and free outside the loop

5479277
ready	each
each payment view model could implement an interface for example with a getpaymentdetails method and perhaps this could return a serialized form of the details ready to be persisted

5479277
viewmodel	caliburn
should also mention in your conductors view let s assume it s called shellview.xaml you can use a contentcontrol to display the current payment viewmodel and have caliburn inject the appropriate view and do the binding which is referenced as the activeitem

5479277
viewmodel	caliburn
caliburn will automatically bind the selected value a payment viewmodel to the activeitem property on your conductor and therefore your current view will automatically switch as you change combobox values

5479290
integer	fractions	rational-numbers	integer	rational-numbers	fractions
try integer arithmetic using rational-numbers equivalent fractions like they teach us in grade school

5479294
fgets	fread
first of all i wouldn t go with formatted input fgets text mode but with raw binary input fopen with the b flag fread and fwrite for writing

5479319
width	height
since matrices width height aren t multiple of my dimensions it was a terrible pain to get things work and the code is becoming more and more complicated to get coalescence memory reads

5479325
multiplying	add
rsa and el gamal and similar systems work with any field that specifies both a multiplying and an add operation and ecc has a different representation of that field that magically packs more data into a bit

5479325
x509	openpgp
this is still not an easy problem as the complexity of x509 demonstrates but mechanisms such as openpgp and openssh have simpler models and mechanisms that work well for many uses

5479325
des	aes
of course speeds can vary significantly by algorithm des is wickedly slow in software and can be fast in hardware but aes is 1.8 to 3.3 times faster for small data sets on my system and could probably be much faster still in hardware.

5479356
post	get
however i am unable to get the id attribute from the post object here

5479402
pop-up	dialog
how can i make the message notfication dialog box pop-up when the page load

5479402
setinterval	settimeout
if you want to notify users in real time you may use javascript settimeout or setinterval functions to start a timer and trigger an ajax request to check for new message

5479408
implements	extends
option #1 create your own subclass of activity implements those methods there then extends your custom subclass for your actual activities

5479419
odt	opendocument
opentbs is a php tool that can create opendocument files odt ods odf odg ... using templates

5479439
put	get
you could configure log4j.properties to get only your code logs as below and put it inot different file than catalina.out too

5479461
stdout	stderr
in either stdout stderr

5479461
stdout	stderr
from stdout stderr

5479470
cpu	affinity
not lock but it is possible to associate a cpu affinity for a process

5479471
cpu	affinity
if you want to change the cpu affinity from your own program use sched_setaffinity

5479504
move	drag
i want to create a user-control where i can move an object like a rectangle within certain boundaries via drag drop

5479618
ienumerable	ilist
if the library designer does not do this note that c# s ienumerable only does a small subset of the covariant portion of ilist then you re out of luck and you have to resort to the same hassles you have to do in a language without any sort of variance

5479657
setinterval	settimeout
instead of using settimeout you want to use setinterval

5479657
setinterval	clearinterval
for that you ll need to call clearinterval on the result of setinterval

5479668
setinterval	settimeout
also i would use setinterval instead of settimeout for this reason

5479676
hid	keyboard
so the answer is - bluetooth keyboard remote wiimote ps3 remote etc.. implement the bluetooth hid device roles

5479702
spaces	delimiter
the data in the file is unreliably delimiter -- there could be any number of spaces or tabs between the different numbers

5479734
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately the code from the links below seems to work only with firefox and not with google-chrome for a button div s work just fine

5479744
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
look at the images loaded via the dev tools of a good browser like google-chrome safari or firefox + firebug

5479762
setinterval	settimeout
note i am aware of how to do recursive settimeout calls as that s what i ve been using this question is my trying to figure out if it s still worth using them or whether setinterval can be used safely

5479787
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome it works perfectly

5479790
folder	directory	installation	upgrade
i also keep the app installation folder in the registry for major upgrade i use applicationfolder property and directory id -- instead of installlocation -- per wixui_advanced requirements

5479790
x86	64bit
there is a bug in wixui_advanced sequence that causes the destination folder dialog to display the app folder under c program files x86 instead of c program files when running on a 64bit machine even when the code correctly sets app folder to programfiles64folder property

5479805
width	margin
set a left margin or minus half the width of the handle

5479806
google-chrome	firefox
you can t have spaces in the window name in ie and in fact it only works in firefox google-chrome by fluke it s not compliant to try to use them

mtu	icmp
see the following wikipedia entry for an overview of mtu maximum transmission unit and a basic description of the path mtu discovery method basically setting the the df do-not-fragment flag and relying on the icmp destination unreachable datagram too big messages to detect that some node on the way couldn t handle the packet and hence try with smaller size until it goes through

and just the code is pulling the title from the rss feed you can pull the description link pubdate etc

5480017
width	height
the only thing i m aware of that passes on height which hasn t come from top of the tree is an absolutely positioned element - so you could for example absolutely position all the top right bottom left sides and corners you know the height and width of the corners anyway and as you seem to know the widths of left right borders and height of top bottom borders and the widths of the top bottom centers are easy at 100 - the only thing that needs calculating is the height of the right left sides if the content grows -

5480055
post	get
i was thinking of some type of after_save to the post model but i can t get it working right

5480285
pull	push
we have a git repo hosted on a central place beanstalk and all of us push and pull there

5480294
addition	multiplication
but more to the point you don t want to be using gemm to do matrix addition -- you re doing a completely pointless matrix multiplication which takes takes 20 000 3 operations and many passes through memory for an operatinon which should only require 20 000 2 operations and a single pass

5480294
factors	matrix
matrix multiplication is memory-bandwidth intensive so there is a huge factors of 10x or 100x difference in performance between coding it yourself and a tuned version

5480302
folder	directory
i made a winforms application which acccesses folder on another server in another active directory domain

5480302
folder	directory	pop-up	dialog
the line of gets all directory from a folder but it may sometimes fail with an exception because the credentials to access the folder basic authentication have not been saved so the basic auth dialog box pop-up again and again breaking the system

your guess was close - the exponent is a binary exponent not a hex exponent though

5480352
hide	show
edit here s another example that hide the element then show it and repeats forever documented code

openssl	m2crypto
if that does not work try getting and compiling openssl yourself and configuring m2crypto to use that

5480364
gesturedetector	motionevent
make use of a gesturedetector within the view.ontouchevent motionevent ev method

5480367
google-chrome	firefox
instead asking it first you can simply check your code by firebug in firefox or in the developer menu in google-chrome

5480379
google-chrome	firefox
the same code works fine for google-chrome and firefox

after you ve removed the non-alpha characters you can explode on spaces and then implode with dashes

5480466
pop-up	dialog
you would render that second page as an iframe inside a dialog pop-up

5480484
explode	implode
i would explode the string at the spaces and then implode it with dashes like this

5480486
udp	tcp
of course you could also use executable content in your browser such as javascript java applet or others to communicate with the target over the tcp ip or udp ip

memcached	apc
with your other caching back-ends apc memcached etc data is shared and available for requests from every client

5480755
memcached	apc
while per-client caches are reasonable things generally the difference in operation model between them and the other shared-storage cache back-ends you mention apc memcached etc mean that many applications that are expecting a shared-storage cache will likely break when presented with a per-client cache

5480779
textview	imageview
i am hoping there is a library like scriptaculous for javascript that allows me to easily manipulate an existing textview imageview etc

junit	testng
it provides an excellent test context framework and specialized testrunners that hook in well to testing frameworks like junit or testng if you prefer

5481066
int	double
right now it says it is the wrong type so i changed the variable dif to a int instead of a double but then it says possible loss of precision

5481099
mp3	ogg
i have a list of files in mp3 format and in ogg format both formats for each

5481110
int	boolean
but for individual boolean 1 byte and int 4 byte values the compiler can automatically align them in such a way that the cpu can guarantee that all reads and writes to them are atomic so that isn t a problem here

5481148
int	double
you need to make sure the data types match as mentioned before your bubblesort class operates only on an int array this is the code as modified to work with double arrays which is what diff contains

5481197
google-chrome	firefox
ideal solution is in google-chrome or firefox

the prefix -- operator is analogous to the prefix ++ operator except that the value of the operands is decrement

5481499
rss	feed
note remember that pulling an xml file from the web using webclient works the same way as pulling an rss feed or atom feed

5481520
getter	setter
if dependency properties are always accessed through their getter setter on their parent objects which defer to getvalue and setvalue then how can the dependency repository know who is making the request in order to prioritize it

accessor	properties
alternatively if you choose to establish cityname as a retaining or copying properties of your class use the dot-notation or accessor method

5481842
box-sizing	border-box
the key to it all is that box-sizing border-box is less susceptible to browser differences in padding and border calculations on form inputs

5481919
hide	show
i mean i guess i could have it hide the form and show the message

5481930
pull	push
flash has the capability of setting up persistent tcp connections which can be used to push pull data just like with a normal tcp connection

5481972
width	height

post code snippet on myprofile.php would be better to get more proper answer

5482033
kde	gnome
you could use other terminals too- putty xterm rxvt etc even the kde and gnome terminals are available through cygwin ports - but mintty is probably the best option for most cygwin users needs it s rather simple small and fast and it integrates well with windows

5482033
stdout	stderr
another option would be to redirect compilation messages use to redirect stdout to a file overwriting it if it already exists to append and add a if you want both stdout and stderr redirected

5482063

the second one is just a folder in your project directory which can include other things such as resources etc

5482430
pull	push
one method is draw your ellipse then pull push each of the four corners one by one

5482520
uilabel	uifont
to set custom font to your uilabel or any other object needing uifont you can use

5482544
put	get
the issue is my repository contains a submodule which doesn t get put in the archive and therefore doesn t get put in the release directory

5482545
hash	salt
the reason to use a different salt for each user s password is so that an attacker can t take a list of all the hash passwords and see if any of them match the hash of something easy like password or 12345

5482545
salt	md5
if you were to use the password itself as salt then an attacker could calculate md5 12345 .md5 12345 and see if it matched any entries

5482545
hash	md5
for example if a user has the password password then an md5 hash stored in the database would be 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99

5482545
hash	salt
the attacker can calculate the hash of a weak password plus your salt and see if any user in your database uses that weak password

5482545
hash	salt
use a distinct salt value - now you take something distinct like the user name e-mail address or even user id and combine that with the password and the large random string from your configuration file before you calculate the hash

5482545
hash	salt
now an attacker who knows your salt still has to recalculate the hash for every user to see if they have used a weak password like password

5482565
post	get
in order to get the list of menu items in the post action you need their corresponding values must be included in the html and because this is a collection follow the standard naming convention so that the default model binder can parse them

5482577
rss	feed
i am grabbing the rss feed from various websites and displaying the content like title title link associated image and short description in my site

5482577

now in my rss feed i am grabbing the image from the original source

5482578
submit	submission
depending on the browser the enter key may only cause a form submission if the form has exactly one text field or only when there is a submit button present

5482617
jobs	cron
cron does repeating periodic jobs and at and batch are for one-time jobs because those two commands don t support automatically repeating commands

5482617
jobs	cron
we use cron a lot at work for jobs

5482618
mouseover	mouseout
just that click events on them don t work anymore just the mouseover and mouseout

5482620
super	implements
the constructor is there for when you have a class that implements it you can call it implicitly or using super

5482625
subclass	abstract-class
in my opinion the constructor in abstract-class can do some init work which all the subclass do not need to repeat in its own construtor

5482634
inherited	properties
when you instantiate a class that inherited from this abstract base class you can call the constructor of the abstract base class to assign any properties private the abc

5482697
post	get
you shouldn t be sending your data as a get request you should be sending it as a multipart post call

5482713
width	height
basically add a width and height to the longlistselector

5482765
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox 4 or google-chrome 11 i see that the divs appear side by side as i would expect

5482765
google-chrome	firefox
at the top of the page ie9 works fine just like firefox and google-chrome

5482768
cassini	iis
it won t work with cassini nor iis 6.0

5482776
folder	directory
if the zip doesn t contain content.jar and artifacts.jar go to your eclipse install s dropins directory create a subfolder name doesn t matter and expand your zip into that folder

5482800
cvs	svn
there are version control systems like cvs which operate on the file level and there it s possible to have the version numbers of files in sync between branches but in svn you create a copy in order to create a branch

5482854
pop-up	dialog
what i really what is whenever i have a new update on the market i want some dialog to pop-up on their application only when i have update

5482869
nsstring	nsdata
convert this code into nsstring from nsdata

5482889
width	height
put a div over the top of your iframe like so replace top left width and height values with your own

5482955
hash	salt
the reason why random password salt is recommended for hashing password so that an attacker who knows the password hash can t compare it to rainbow table of pre-calculated hash from dictionary

5482955
hash	salt
if you re using password as salt attacker can pre-calculate hash of word.md5 word first from their dictionary

5482966
free	malloc
if the pointer is not null i free it before i use malloc

5482972
postgresql	mysql
if you are not limited to mysql postgresql sql server or oracle would give you a lot more

5483050
hash	md5
with a precomputed dictionary as the name implies someone has already created a table of hash the computed md5 result for particular words ahead of time

5483093
rss	feed
i m trying to build an open source tool that will accept rss atom url feed as input data and then i want to validate these entries to avoid errors when parsing the xml results

5483097
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
if you used custom adapter for listview then you set clickevent on button or other views.you can t set onclickevent in main file because in that file we set onitemclicklistener if you want onclicklistener on particular view like button then you written your code in onclicklistener code that write in the adapter class

5483100
sorting	filtering
i don t know what kind of application you are developing but if you need to display data in a datagrid i would suggest using the devexpress xtragrid available for winforms wpf silverlight and asp.net which has a servermode which works pretty well with subsonic s linqtemplates since it can be bound to an iquerable and itself handles the paging sorting filtering on the iquerable and only needs a few records at a time

5483147
dxcore	coderush
it is possible to do this with the parsers that are part of dxcore and coderush

5483160
hash	salt
every freakin day i see questions regarding salt or hash

5483174

redmine	chiliproject
i would like to restrict access to certain users of a redmine chiliproject install as long as they are coming from a certain ip address or a certain range of ip addresses

5483184
children	parent
parentid list which is parent id list is are id of menu record that have child i just want to load all record includes root menu that have no children record and children record

5483353
inherited	properties
but if you want to take advantage of javascript s prototypical inherited you can t use any properties on this to refer to the parent because you ll run into the grand-child problem it s easy to create a parent child hierarchy that way but it fails as soon as you try to create a grandparent parent child hierarchy

5483353
superclass	subclassing
when defining the subclassing you assign the superclass s version of the function to a property on the subclassing s version of the function

5483361
uilabel	uibutton
note that the green bar is a uiview and notifications is a uilabel and round button is a uibutton all set up in ib

5483370
rspec	capybara
my recommendation would be to use either shoulda extends test unit or rspec with capybara and -no- cucumber

5483397
google-chrome	firefox
the moment i add at the top of the page ie9 works fine just like firefox and google-chrome

5483482
ssms	sqlcmd
go is not sql command it is special batch control command for tools like sqlcmd osql or query editor in ssms

5483483
cpython	ironpython
by the way if you really are an expert at java or c# threading then you probably should go with threading instead but use jython or ironpython instead of cpython

5483499
xmltype	clob
if the values only contain xml then either clob or xmltype may be used - you ll need to work out which is better for your situation - more info here

5483582
versioning	upgrade
you can have a small file containing the current versioning number have that downloaded on startup and then decide whether an upgrade is necesarry or not

5483591
google-chrome	firefox
preventdefault works with google-chrome and firefox in this case

5483626

i initialize the tfs map the server folder with a local folder and create directory in both

5483680
innodb	myisam
mysql has issues with huge limit offsets with myisam engine mostly where innodb optimizes that

5483681
mp3	ogg
reading the html 5 audio specification w3c outlines which formats mp3 or ogg are supported by which browsers

5483681
mp3	ogg
what i would do is have an icecast server not shoutcast streaming a mp3 and an ogg stream

5483693
post	get
everyone can send you a post or a get for that matter request

5483701
ocl	uml
it used to be ocl in uml 1.x but now with uml2 direct access to the metamodel you can just create any constraints directly in the model without any transformation

5483701
ocl	uml
my workaround is also better because i can write whatever i want and directly put it inside my class diagram without having two different models one for uml and one for ocl

in the ci environment the python calls for determining shell height width return funny values

5489093
maven	pom.xml
i could either double the projects and package them together like i do with my stylesheets or i could run the entire maven reactor for the parent pom.xml and master assembly twice with different groupids and thus create two completely separate paths for all involved projects

5489096
maven	pom.xml
i did not find a way to create multiple artifacts from the same pom.xml file not even to run the flexmojo compile target more than once even when binding with execution tag maven will complain

another option would be to add a property to the child page and master page and use session data to hide and show buttons

5489177
hide	show
in your master page you could have a session variable you can set to hide and show the buttons

5489177

inherited	properties
particular on whether we can define properties in an aggregating pom and then inject them into the referenced modules thus allowing that module to locally overwrite the default properties defined in the inherited hierarchy

5489311
inherited	properties
we would like a super parent pom for both parenta and parentb to inherited shared properties and config such as dependencymanagement and plugins etc

5489311
inherited	properties
these build files are not part of any inherited tree so nothing will pick up the properties

5489311

but when we need to override this inherited we would like to be able to specify injectable properties in the build file which would act exactly as if they had been specified in the module originally

the salt is used to prevent rainbow table attacks where a dictionary of common works hash with md5 is used to try to gain entry

5492028
for-loop	loops
whether writing the for-loop like that is a good idea or why is it not just using the erase-remove idiom are different issues as a matter of fact the previous loops is arguably better than erase-remove for a list the concrete situation is that the semantics have changed and because the type is syntactically compatible with the previous one the compiler will not notice that the code is wrong it will not point you to that function and chances are that you will not review rewrite it

5492029
stdout	stderr
attempts are being made to get a proper ipc component that will allow you to write to the process stdin and read from its stdout and stderr but this is not yet available in releases of xulrunner

5492331
children	parent
it sounds like your model has a foreign key constraint that prevents deleting a parent record when it has children

5492331
children	parent
you might also be able to write a delete trigger on the parent that goes and deletes all the children first

5492331
children	parent
alternately you can structure your code to find the children delete them first then delete the parent

meanwhile tho given a need for what i have described it would seem reasonable to me to vote for html inline height width parameters along with alt text descriptions as a matter of standard practice

5494651
button	checkbox
from there i have a button which opens another form that contains a series of checkbox

5494678
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream

create an object that extends observable and implements runnable

5495106
mouse	keyboard
it s not 100 because screen readers won t have mouse movement and some people navigate the web with a keyboard but that s extremely rare

5495121
getter	setter
in practice you should have getter and setter for each field unless you are omitting them for a reason

5495127

fgets	fread
i had a few problems with the length - fread does require it but i decided to use fgets to avoid it

5495162
getter	setter
kinda hard to determine here without your spring configuration but looking at the code and the stack trace it appears that you re doing setter based injection but haven t provided any getter and setter methods

5495162
getter	setter
so you can either a switch to using constructor based injection or b provide getter and setter for all of the properties you want to set via spring

5495163

you need your class to implement icomparable and then override and implement the compareto method to help c# understand how it should compare those objects

5495190
width	height
there is no problem with your code only is that your sprite container has no height and width so instead of doing this

5495190
width	height

5495423
filtering	grouping
right now we re building a dimensional model they can slice and filtering with powerpivot though these account grouping are threatening to turn an otherwise ruthlessly simple star schema into something complex enough that the users will balk and return to their current spaghetti solution

5495423
filtering	grouping
having end-users filtering out grouping from 17 different columns isn t going to go over well in user-acceptance and would likely result in users refusing to use the solution and i don t blame them

sse	avx
if you search around the web to see people s comments it always come to the idea that gcc allows you to enable automatic vectorization but it extremely rarely makes actual use of it and so if you want to use simd acceleration eg mmx sse avx neon altivec then you basically haveto figure out how to write it using compiler intrinsics or assembly language code

switching	screens
if you re running in a worker thread or in any context where you either don t have access to a uiapplication or pushing a screens would not be allowed you re only allowed to work with ui components on the original ui thread then pushing a screens onto the screens stack is a bit different -- you need to switching to the ui thread and then push the new screens onto the screens stack

instead you should provide a proper implementation of gethashcode and equals in your object that allows you to compare two objects based on their values - if two objects are equals their hash codes have to match

5504907
hash	md5
if you just want to compare custom fields within an object and a full comparison might be too expensive a large binary array it might make sense to generate an md5 hash with md5cryptoserviceprovider.computehash on the field and store that within the object itself it will then be serialized just like any other object property

5505704
post	get
a post http request can still have get params

5505760
firefox	safari
my javascript works fine in firefox but in safari i get a parse error

5505776
post	get
i am using a method post to get the value which is entered into the textbox to the controller

5505783
uitableview	nsindexpath
float getheight uitableview tableview nsindexpath indexpath

5505792
restrict	shared
the servers are shared servers with cpanel so i am pretty restrict therefore i tried these ftp modules

5505830
hive	oozie
you can submit map-reduce types of jobs hive jobs pig jobs system commands etc through oozie s action tags

5505861
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this and verified that it works and looks the same on ie9 google-chrome v11b safari v5 and firefox v4

5505861
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox currently punt on security and disallow you from reading the canvas getimagedata or todataurl after you draw any svg to the canvas regardless of the domain these have been fixed

5505861
width	height
firefox currently has a bug where it refuses to draw svg to the canvas unless the svg has height and width attributes specified

5505870
ienumerable	iqueryable
i don t see any reason to think that the specification pattern is better than the patterns established by the linq framework so your approach isn t necessarily wrong. however keep in mind that your method will only work on iqueryable objects and not on ienumerable objects

5505884
put	get
half-split works well put var_dumps halfway through your code put a die at the end find which half is going wrong split that in half etc until you get to a point that you can logically guess where the error is and start debugging the syntax etc

5505888
bash	zsh
it s supported in bash and zsh

5505952
post	get
by the time your code sees the params rails has already merged the get post params for you anyhow

5505975
subtract	add
if there s an offset in your data you can obviously add or subtract this from the result

5506001
put	get
to get -1 i would remove the contractpage declaration and put that in the net.tsn.contract.log function or object object i would pass page in the live s handler function

5506028
carrierwave	fog
i m using carrierwave 0.5.3 and fog to upload images to amazon-s3

5506033
getter	setter
getter setter formatters etc

5506041
equals	compareto
note that using compareto is different from simply checking the equality of two strings which is done using the equals method and not the operator which doesn t doesn t check for meaningful equality only referential equality

5506045
getter	setter
getter and setter are nice but are completely useless when you have to support ie6 or ie7

5506054
post	get
then a guru like frank schmitt could post his solution immediately and a nitpicker like me wouldn t need hours to get evidence for the objection that

5506095
plot	heatmap
i m trying to build a simple javascript click tracker that one could add to any website which will plot its data to a heatmap

5506115
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
for the array to persist in memory it either needs to be declared static or it should be explicitly allocated using malloc or calloc each solution has functionality implications-- the static version will be overwritten the next time the function is called and the allocated version needs to be explicitly free later to avoid memory leaks

5506115
free	malloc
here is an example that allocates populates and returns a 2d array using a single malloc both for the sake of efficiency and to allow the use of a single free for deallocation

5506129
hide	show
i need to add show hide table in appropriate div when corresponding secondary or main is clicked

5506150
getter	setter
so now declared a string variable ajaxjsondata in the action with getter and setter

5506177
actionscript	mxml
embed i assume since you are using actionscript instead of mxml you intend to dynamically load your images

5506180
setinterval	settimeout
you should use settimeout rather than setinterval for occasions where you need to do something repeatedly

5506194
public	protected
if both forms are part of the same project which i guess it s the case then you need to ensure that the button is one of protected internal internal or public

5506204
put	get
you might get more responses if you put a link up to the wsdl you re tying to use to build your proxy

5506244
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it either needs to work in ie firefox google-chrome or opera i don t care

5506262
dbcontext	objectcontext
i asked on msdn how to do it with dbcontext api but it is possible only if you cast dbcontext to objectcontext and use objectstatemanager and changerelationshipstate

5506271
cfstring	nsstring
however kuttypeimage is a cfstringref and according to the cfstring documentation a cfstringref is compatible with nsstring

5506286
ant	maven
in my experience the best way to do it is have a version normally a static properly in a class number increment every time you build by using ant or maven

5506316
processors	hyperthreading
moreover the system has hyperthreading processors and if i have a thread on core 0 i don t want to allow anyone to schedule on core 0 s hyperthreading sibling

5506330
toggleclass	each
note also that you need not call toggleclass for each class - you can pass it a space-separated list of classes toggle much like you can do with .addclass and .removeclass

5506340
int	chars
i have only 2 datatypes in my application int 4 bytes and chars 1 byte

5506340
int	chars
also each of these attributes can be either an int or a chars

5506346
getter	setter
you have to use a backing field if you implement getter and setter yourself otherwise it will keep calling itself on the setter i.e like this

5506358
accessor	properties
also note you re other properties are going to have the same issue when you access the set accessor

5506376
post	get
it s the same way you add extra get data in a plain php html form except with ajax you pass post data the same way

5506385
client-side	server-side
there are very simple ways to enforce this server-side that are hard to game client-side

5506402
entity-relationship	diagram
i am new to entity-relationship diagram but i am trying to plan out a concept for an app

5506433
getter	setter
adding getter and setter is pointless for basic data containers

5506468
for-loop	loops
instead of using a foreach loops use a for-loop

5506471
int	chars
i just cant seem to figure it out i was going to convert it into a chars array and then cast into an int and the sort and convert it all back but i figure there must be a simpler way to do this if there is a way at all

5506489
post	get
i used the tweetsharp sdk to get and access token secrettoken and the stored them and i can them use those with my api key and secret to post to twitter with no issue

5506495
fseek	fread
its a lot faster if you are accessing your file in a random-access manner -- that is doing a lot of fseek fread fwrite combinations

5506506
vb6	vba
vb a is funny this way i say it that way because this same problem shows up in vb6 as well as the vba in office applications ..

5506509
post	get
whether the values are sent in the query string get request as form values post request or as route values it doesn t really matter for the default model binder

5506529
int	chars
you can use string charat int to retrieve the chars at positions 0 and 1 and use those to compare

5506530
xcodebuild	agvtool
there s a useful guide to automating iphone builds here that includes building with xcodebuild and versioning with agvtool

5506558
bash	zsh
it works in bash and zsh

5506586
wxpython	pyglet
from what i ve read it seems like the recommended way to do this would be to use some kind of gui library like pyglet or wxpython no experience with any of them

5506621
linqdatasource	entitydatasource
for basic grid-type updating i ve had decent luck with either a linqdatasource or an entitydatasource assuming you re using l2s or ef but again for large applications you re going to want to stay away from things like this separation of concerns and all that

5506627
uitableview	nsindexpath
- uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

5506657
disk	ram

5506703
uiview	subviews
make the class a subviews of uiview

5506726
client-side	server-side
my contribution one of the advatanges of using node is that you can write both your client-side and your server-side code in javascript

5506727
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the following works

5506746
boost	stl
- it works almost without any problems i found two minor compilation problems with quite complicated sources with tons of templates boost spirit parsers other boost stuff including meta-programming modules etc. stl qt everything together

5506763
firepath	firebug
i would suggect using firefox with the firebug and firepath extensions to help you work out xpaths this is my personal favourite combination

5506773
int	chars
it works with any kind of fields int float chars of any length

5506781
versioning	upgrade
i have seen some complaints about this before but it was related to a previous versioning and people advised to upgrade pyqt4 to the latest versioning and so i did but that didn t help with the crashing problem

5506794
post	get
as you mentioned you are calling restful api for login service i think you need to specify the ajax type to be post method because it is get method in default

5506827
getter	setter
first you need to understand that properties are just getter and setter methods or functions to speak more generically only that they have a special syntax aimed to make the code that uses them more readable

5506827
getter	setter
the typical way to do this is to define a backing field for the property a member variable where the value will actually be stored and then from your setter and getter you set or return that field respectively

5506827
getter	setter
normally setter are useful to perform sanity checks for example you could check that the passed value is not null but there are many situations when there is no need for checks on neither the setter nor the getter and having to define the backing fields and the setter getter themselves becomes boring bloated redundant and error-prone

5506827
accessor	properties
for this reason c# supports auto-implemented properties if you replace both accessor with get

5506862
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
this uinavigationcontroller pushes a uiviewcontroller implementing uitableviewdelegate and uitableviewdatasource

google-chrome	safari
keep in mind this uses a real browser webkit thus most quirks are addressed by major browsers like google-chrome and safari

5507193
google-chrome	safari
as you can see google-chrome and safari keep the first cell only as high as its content exactly as i want it to be displayed

5507206
client-side	server-side
if the user has to enter it and the code that reads it is accessible for reading by a malicious user is client-side not server-side its only a matter of skill time patience for the malicious user to figure out which keys are accepted by your program

prevent the width height of the image from getting to small

5507416
width	height
prevent the width height of getting too big

5507416
width	height
the width height of the image object are not modified by the gesturelistener so i cannot simply do

iboutlet	ibaction
declare an iboutlet to the nswindow and hook it up in interface builder just like you did for the ibaction by control-dragging to the iboutlet declaration

5507447
post	get
the only real difference is the get post

5507449
pull	push
i am able to push code from my local computer and when i run git pull from the command line on the server the changes will properly pull

5507476
width	height
just define the width and height of the x icon and it should work

5507476
google-chrome	firefox
tested on google-chrome 10 firefox 3.6 and ie8 just click the top right corner of the green div

5507500
width	height
if you want to limit the width to known pixels and have the height adjusted so that it maintains the proper aspect ratio a style like

5507516

pull	push
for simple setups you can provide ssh access to a central server and set up each user s working directory to push pull from this origin

5507595
post	get
the text box renders with an id of myobject_description ...the problem is when i post this to my controller action myobject does not get bound at all althought the list items do as they recieve the appropriate ids of myviewmodel_mylist guid .mylistvalue

5507654
superclass	subclassing
i m trying to figure out if it s possible to subclassing an existing implementation of method that takes variable args and call the superclass implementation

5507662
actualheight	actualwidth
if you want to constrain it to it s parent then just get the actualwidth and actualheight of the parent as use those as your limits

5507688
proj	ogr	gdal	proj	gdal	ogr
the best way to do this i figured would be to get gdal ogr or preferably ogr in isolation built for the iphone and brought into the proj

5507693
oncreate	recreate
the trace logs indicate that it s crashing in oncreate ... which tells me that the activities have been destroyed and they are being recreate when going back

ogr is a part of the gdal library

5507697
gdal	ogr
ogr is a part of the gdal library

5507738
ubuntu	linux
however in production environment edit#1 - ubuntu linux slackware java - 1.6.0_18 we observed that other threads of the application which are not managed through this new threadpoolexecutor are getting affected

5507767
hide	show
and instead of two buttons hide show to change it back to one button

5507816
ddms	hprof
in order to get memory usage from eclipse you have to dump hprof file from the ddms prospective

5507816
ddms	hprof
before doing that you have to choose in the ddms preference panel when it says hprof action the save to disk action

5507834

solaris	bsd
x solaris bsd os and ...

5507846
freebsd	linux
in large part like linux freebsd

5507878
ssl	https
so it seems pretty clear that there is some disagreement between java and the https server over how the handshake should go down which probably means the server has some strange ssl configuration

5507929
debian	linux
for a debian gnu linux system installing emacs23-common-non-dfsg will install emacs23 s info pages

5507950

if you want to delegate the browser to scaling just set the width height of the image

5507958
profiling	instrumentation
i ve got a relatively long function that s dominant in the instrumentation time profiling

5508030
hash	salt
is it acceptable to store them in plain text in the database or should i hash and salt them

5508047
width	height
though you can give the inline-block a width and height

5508064
ant	maven
for the long term however i d recommend learning a build tool ant maven whatever

5508086
folder	directory
i have the files stored in a folder called photo_gallery in the sites directory on my computer

5508097
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
try presenting the modal transition from the containing instance of uitabbarcontroller and not the uiviewcontroller the action was triggered from

5508102
width	height
also on resize i will have this bound to a listener so that when the width changes the content still remains the same height in each element

5508103
profiling	debugging
both profiling and debugging apis provide stack walking functionality

5508109
post	get
such as in your case you could use get or post

5508129
google-chrome	firefox
and one final question -- it appears that a selenium test case mentions google-chrome in its default configuration even though the docs say you can only record tests using firefox

5508151
post	get
my aim is to get the content it is done all the post s images except the first and add them to the new content with value varcontent1 2 3 and so on

5508158
xslt	xquery	xsl-fo	xslt
xml i already understand so then i saw xpath xslt xpath xquery xlink xpointer xml schema xsl-fo

5508170
hash	md5
another problem with the code you copied from the rfc standard of the md5 hash

5508170
int	chars
the md5transform function copies the data from chars array format left-to-right and requires them to be packed in a 32bit int in little-endian format

5508170
int	chars
after performing the computational cycles you need to translate the results from little-endian 32bit int into the chars array format requiring you to reverse the encoding step that was done during the initial call of md5transform

5508188
filtering	grouping
actually if you know your way around excel it would probably be easier as an alternative to take the custom report and export it to excel and then split up the page column into individual columns by the and then filtering grouping sum whatever from there

5508230
xsl-fo	xslt
if you happen to have data and want to use it to produce html or xsl-fo or something else then xslt is by far the best way to go

for linux testing with ubuntu i found that this worked with the ubuntu linux kernel 2.6.35-28 or newer

5508335
free	malloc
i had to use malloc free instead of new delete as you didnt define csettings however the effect should be the same

5508339
ccscene	cclayer
ccdirector ccscene cclayer

5508341
width	height
i want to be able to create a 2d array the size of the width and height i read from a file but i get errors when i say

5508342
int	chars
i typecast the number to ensure it s an int and i presumed that there were no non-numeric chars in it

5508384
rtsp	rtmp
when this happens you can change the rtsp to rtmp or mms and it should work unless the link is dead

5508437
feof	fread
my next choice would have been wrapping fread with feof to take bytes in chunks then i could at least provide percentages complete for a better experience although from what i could gather iteration 1 2 3 4.. s bytes will be hard to track to equal exactly the amount needed

5508481
fgets	fread
i just saw that fread wasnt working fgets reads a certain number of byes from file stream into buffer

5508494
many-to-many	one-to-many
the table attribute applies only to many-to-many relationships not one-to-many

5508536
hash	salt
to make it more secured you could add salt on it make it a double protections so hash the actual password first add the salt to the hash password then hash them again

5508541
salt	md5
to keep things simple use md5 with a salt

5508541
hash	md5
md5 is a one way hash

5508609
uitableview	reloaddata
you handle it all manually in your own code most importantly calling the uitableview s reloaddata method after the data in the datasource has changed

5508620
multiplying	add
multiplying by velocity and add to the current position

5508620
multiplying	add
rotate a unit vector by the quaternion multiplying by velocity and add to position

5508661
int	double
if you re dealing with large data sets and can afford rounding errors you can use int floats double etc

5508693
int	double
values represented by nsdecimalnumber are objects unlike built-in numeric types like int float and double

5508700
fileinputstream	filewriter	fileinputstream	fileoutputstream	fileoutputstream	filewriter
fileinputstream fileoutputstream filereader and filewriter won t work with vfs for much the same reason

5508737
google-chrome	firefox
use firebug for firefox or in google-chrome use developer-tools

5508809
inherited	properties
enums are primitives and cannot inherited from other enums as inherited is a properties of objects

5508836
folder	directory
i have a powershell deployment script that downloads files from svn into a directory and then updates the iis settings to point the site at the new folder

5508843
folder	directory
i just copied original db directory in the mysql data folder

5508843
centos	linux
i m using mysql-5.2.0-falcon-alpha on centos linux

5508865
std	ostream
std cout is an instance of std ostream

5508865
std	ostream
calls one of the overloads as would be done for any instance of std ostream

5508865
std	ostream
in this case the chaining for +s on mytype work for the same reason the s work on top of std ostream

5508865
std	ostream
you then see that you once again have a std ostream the result of the call to and a which you once again turn into the function call

5508880
swt	swing
this is an excellent article on how to use swing inside your swt rcp apps

5508904
int	double
in c i have an array of double called a and an int variable called anotherintvariable that i want to pass to python

5508926
post	get
another post suggested that not properly closing an hinternet could cause an application to block on a subsequent get to the same host due to a limit on the number of parallel connections to the same host

5509026
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
there are high level classes such as nscalendar and nstimezone and nsdatecomponents which do take timezone into account

5509048
post	get
note get checklogin might be post checklogin according to your case

5509228
persistent	transient	accessor	properties
the most common scenario you write a custom accessor to perform maintenance create a default object handle transient wrapper of persistent properties etc. but want to use core data s optimized storage

5509229
int	chars
error operator does not exist int + chars varying

5509240
yacc	bison
fwiw this was compiled on macos x 10.6.7 using the system provided yacc actually bison 2.3 - i got essentially the same output with 2 other variants of yacc on my machine

5509248
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	debian	centos	centos	linux
and on linux if the net.ipv6.bindv6only sysctl is set to 1 like it is on debian but not most other distros including centos or ubuntu then you will need to explicitly bind to and 0.0.0.0 to support both

post	get
your httpservletrequest object has a getmethod property which will tell you if it was a get or a post

5518972
post	get
foo bar actually works that is i don t think you can have both post and get parameters at the same time

5519035
strcpy	strtok	strcpy	malloc	free	malloc	free	strcpy	strtok	malloc
either declare your structure with static storage to store the string arrays and then use strcpy to copy the data from strtok into those arrays or use malloc and allocate memory for your pointers just remember you ll have to free those pointers later unless you want memory leaks

5519035
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
and again if you use pointers with malloc calloc etc. be sure to free that storage afterwards by a call to free

5519097
width	height
i am trying to set the width and height of a certain level of nodes to be smaller than the rest

5519187

rss	feed
i use curl to get an rss feed from my own wordpress blog to display it as a feed sidebar and when i get the headers all quotes appear as this ã â â

5519517

it turns out that if the streams are read synchronously a deadlock can occur either by reading synchronously before waitforexit or by reading both stderr and stdout synchronously one after the other

5519538
post	put
plus sharding partition might put comments of same post on different parts

5519620

google-chrome	firefox
i switched to classes to ensure that google-chrome worked firefox always works.

5519627
google-chrome	firefox
these work in firefox and google-chrome

5519650
subtraction	add
because if every subtraction had to be two instructions negate and add then you d waste a lot of memory traffic because code would become larger cache space because code would be larger and instruction decode time because there would be more instructions to decode for a tiny gain in cpu simplicity

5519660
implements	extends
i ve implements some validation in my form by extends the form.vtypes class to include another vtype that i personally made

5519666
post	get
if you want to write xml to it you would need to post it or send it as a variable of get the latter is space restricted

5519684
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction are used enough that it makes sense to build it in

5519854
post	get
i assume you re running php as cgi with apache so you can use verbs other than get and post as most rest services do

5519992
google-chrome	firefox
but if you access the same page using other browser like firefox or google-chrome you will see a gorgeous login page with a big no huge cloud in the middle the mobileme logo and interesting lighballs comming out of it

5520012
qtabbar	qwidget
there is no item in the designer that is a qtabbar the only way you could accomplish this is by creating a plain qwidget and promoting it to a tabbar but you will then have to set up the whole thing in code

5520012
qtabwidget	qwidget
as for the pages you do realize that you can also promote the content widgets of a qtabwidget in designer to any subclass of qwidget builtin or something that you created

5520037
many-to-many	one-to-many
so i m trying to make one-to-many and many-to-many relationships with weapons and attachments actually much more but keeping it simple here

5520268
postgresql	mysql
with postgresql and mysql it is all right to do something like

5520279
google-chrome	firefox
for example the v8 engine which is what google-chrome uses is available and so is the spidermonkey source code which is used in mozilla firefox

5520282
google-chrome	firefox
some of these are open source for example rhino used in firefox or v8 used in google-chrome

5520294

generated by md5 or other hash algorithm

5520329
pull	push
i tried small experiments with ruby and rails and would like to push and pull from the mac to pc and vice verse

5520376
width	height
place a holder around it and it will take the height from the green one and give them only absolute and bottom 0 it won t matter what width you give your elements

5520384
put	get
i created a new controller for one of my models called review and named it review_controller i put in show and update methods in it but cant get them working because rails didn t add the paths for the 2 methods

not to impact other subfolders under the same parent folder i cannot change the parent folder to stop propogating its permissions to its children

5520490
webkit	gecko
for webkit and gecko dom implementations the createrange method is defined on the document object

5520569
put	get
if yes you will just get it from cache if no you will really execute functionality of executing part and then put it to cache

5520578
post	get
your best bet would be to actually do a response.redirect however if the request was a post and not a get then you have problems as the post data will be lost.

5520591
free	malloc
using malloc and free it is easy to allocate structures with extra data beyond the end

5520591
free	malloc
what i want to accomplish is the same as the following example but using new delete instead of malloc free so that constructors destructors will be called properly

5520597
sorting	filtering
if you go the filtering route i d look into glazedlists a truly great java library for doing things like dynamic filtering sorting etc

5520610
dlsym	dlopen
on linux you can do this with dlopen and dlsym functions

5520615
put	get
using a single linq to sql statement i want get all the users that have either viewed or messaged a user and put them into an object like this

5520662

you definitely can t allocate with new malloc and dispose with free delete

5520666
coalesce	isnull
coalesce or isnull does not make a difference

5520689
quicksort	mergesort
for example i am happy to disclose the performance for bubble sort insertion sort binary tree insertion removal mergesort and quicksort but don t ask me to come up with the performance of avl trees or djikstra s shortest path algorithm off the top of my head

5520690
put	get
the get and put requests should be including the id of the user in the endpoint

5520718
innodb	myisam
afaik mysql 4.x and myisam do not support transactions so mysql 5.x and innodb is required but i m not sure what s the current default database engine mysql uses

5520735
udp	tcp
certainly tcp has more overhead than udp

5520735
udp	tcp
in this case udp has some significant advantages if a packet is dropped tcp will wait for that packet to be retransmitted before sending others

5520765
ssl	https
the problem with redirecting from https to http is that the browser is still going to initiate an ssl connection first to the https url before it can get the redirect so it s somewhat pointless

5520813
free	malloc
it s better to sidestep the c++ object model with malloc free than to twist it to avoid dealing with data as objects

5520830
free	malloc
you can do this without resorting to malloc free or undefined behavior i m not sure about the reinterpret_cast but at least construction destruction can be done just fine

5520832
pthreads	fork
fork is available on pthreads systems only

5520840
postgresql	mysql
you can use any version new or old of any sql engine sql server mysql sqllite postgresql oracle and countless others.

google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the dialog box displays before the processimages function runs and then displays status messages during the running of the processimages function

5520865
put	get
i m sure there are a few ways to do this but you could put all the numbers into something like a stack jumble it all up and then pop off of it to get your random numbers

5520922
opera	firefox
this has been tested in ie and opera firefox doesn t seem to have this problem

5520946

i am trying to work on a rss reader app and have been able to set up a decent nsxmlparser and such to parse the xml feed

5520982
width	height
whenever i set the swf directive s width and height equal to the width and height of the flash.media.video object i m creating

5520982
width	height
even if i set the width to 16 and height to 9 on both it scales and fits perfectly on the size of my window

5521069
rss	feed
the second table has repeated data or people listening daily to an rss feed

5521072
firefox	safari
firefox and safari support go back as far as version 1 assuming this site is correct

5521108
subtraction	addition
you can throw any amount of zeros into an addition subtraction and it will come out the same

5521113
floating-point	integer	floating-point	fixed-point
that said the neon vector unit does support integer operations as well as floating-point and it is possible to speed up certain operations by casting them as fixed-point problems instead

5521124
width	height
this way you avoid having to repeat the swf width and height

5521124
width	height
the swf tag in particular specifies the info in the swf header such as desired width height framerate

5521125
ubuntu	linux
in ubuntu linux though i get the following

5521173
put	get
when i traced the call my put request was handled by get method and not by put method in my class

5521244
installation	upgrade
we can install upgrade and query the gem version.if one uses a tool like my geminstaller one can easily automate the installation and loading of rubygems with a single simple config file

5521244
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
to upgrade one have to uninstall and then install upgrade versioning

5521266
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i would install firebug if you are on firefox or use the built-in tools in google-chrome or safari

5521267
hide	show
i would be able to just have the base page subscribe to a message mvvm light and send a message when i want the progress bar to show or hide

5521283
inherited	properties
i want to have all of my entities inherited from audit which provides the properties columns isactive createdate updatedate createuser updateuser

5521292
width	height
it s important that i can know the dimensions of the resulting image although if absolutely necessary i can create a very wide blank canvas to render this in to and then at runtime detect the width and height myself by checking the bytes

5521299
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
use the remote ip user agent hour of the day note that this can make it fail if the hour switches in between requesting and sending the form and similar data to calculate a salt hash md5 sha1 .

5521299
hash	salt
but the unique salt will allow this to be widely used - different salt values make it impossible to predict the field name easily even if the method to compute the hash is known

5521317
ddms	adb
framework eclipse plugin adb ddms emulator all in one place

5521342
integer	fractions
if your score needs to show and integer with no fractions part

5521359
width	height
the jquery code you have used to create your canvas element sets the display size to 300x300px by setting the css width and height attributes but does not set the intrinsic size differently than the default of 300x150

5521359
width	height
to fix it set the actual width and height attributes of the canvas element directly

5521412
setinterval	settimeout
to draw changes and see the results on the screen you need to use setinterval or settimeout to yield control back to the browser but ask to run code at some point in the future

5521437
google-chrome	firefox
try running it inside the javascript console in firefox or google-chrome and you will see the new script get added appended to the body tag in this case

5521439
pull	push
with dvcs they can pull only from each other without sharing with everyone and then check in a fully working feature in one cohesive push

5521492
pull	push
the one notion to realize with a dvcs distributed vcs like git or mercurial is that it adds the notion of publication push pull to the notion of branching

5521494
h.264	webm
flv vp6 m4v h.264 ogv theora webm vp8

5521514
hide	show
here s a different solution that will hide parent and show child - however the height of the parent will not be collapsed

5521520
memcpy	strcpy
look for strcpy memcpy or similar commands

following it in ubuntu i installed codeblocks for ubuntu but in linux as well it generates .exe and .o which do not works in linux according to my knowledge

5521592

go ahead and check the bind checkbox and select tablearray from the bind to popup button

5521592
iboutlet	ibaction
use it to create iboutlet and ibaction connections both natively within ib and between ib and source code

5521701
post	get
i believe you are referring to the difference between get and post method of http

5521701
post	get
methods get and post in html forms

5521718
subtract	add
edit the c language spec defines pointer arithmetic what happens when you add or subtract with pointers this way because the most common use of pointer math is to navigate around an array that you re pointing to

5521791
qapplication	qwidget
qt requires you to create a qapplication before creating any qwidget subclasses as well as certain other classes such as qpixmap

5521895
ubuntu	debian
i do this occasionally on debian ubuntu when i need a newer package for something

5521909
button	checkbox
however as you can see there is no red border around the checkbox and radio button

5521951
button	checkbox
but if checkbox or radio button i think you can t do that by use a default package like jquery

5521952
opera	firefox
my code works in firefox opera

5521975
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
supported browser opera new rel ie9 google-chrome firefox and all browser that support html5 and canvas

you can add a small change to the plugin that will hide all panels before executing slidepanel to show the intended panel

5522009
min	max
set a float variable max to the height member of the first element of the array set a float variable min also to the first element s height memeber

5522081
realpath	tmp
i don t really know how .. file.txt is supposed to turn into tmp file.txt in your example but to check whether a path is a subpath of another use realpath with a simple comparison

5522147
typedef	struct
you don t need that typedef either the struct declaration is enough

5522153
hebrew	persian	hebrew	farsi	urdu	arabic	persian	farsi
last thing i wouldn t fix list of rtl languages to say arabic hebrew urdu and persian farsi as there are other bi-di languages

5522165
hash	md5
i suspect you don t really need to do an md5 hash of every file every time and you might be better off carefully considering your actual requirements and what is the minimal solution which will meet them

5522167
free	malloc
if you really need to use other memory allocator like malloc free or something of your own design then you have to allocate memory and call the placement new it is like calling the constuctor explicitly

5522171
post	get
if i echo the variables to the screen or when method post i get an empty array

5522251
min	max
if it it is being filled via your functions you can keep 2 variables max initially set to min_int and min initially set to max_int

5522251
min	max
for every insert check if the value is bigger than max or smaller than min if so set them to properly

5522272
qstring	qbytearray
usually the error happens when converting from plain text data const char qbytearray to the qstring

5522272
qstring	qbytearray
i suggest you define qt_no_cast_from_ascii and qt_no_cast_to_ascii to avoid any unwanted qbytearray - qstring conversions

5522272
qstring	qbytearray
if the string is wrong the error usually happened before when converting from qbytearray const char to qstring in query.value fieldno .tostring

5522288
hide	show
in order to show and hide the datagrid columns you need to bind the visibility of each column to a boolean property that determines whether to show this column or not

5522297
apache	nginx
for example you may be able to do this entirely in nginx or apache bypassing the need to have sinatra serve static files at all

5522319
libxml2	libxslt
make sure the development packages of libxml2 and libxslt are installed

5522319
libxml2	libxslt
so i need libxml2 and libxslt but there are not accesible via pypi

5522333
twig	smarty
if you do go down the template route twig and smarty are quite good since they compile the template into php which speeds things up

5522368
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
it is currently supported by google-chrome safari and opera

5522424
implements	extends
for example if and b extends a then automatically b cannot because it can only implements an interface once

5522512
docx	xlsx
i m doing a java project about digital signature on microsoft office files docx xlsx pptx

5522554
post	get
i have also read a few chapters from various asp.net mvc books about fundamental structure of the web about http post and get requests routing and all that goodness

5522578
dwoo	smarty
use a templating system i suggest using although it looks like you re more interested in smarty or dwoo

5522618
implements	extends
one way to go with this is create a custom deserializer for each field type that will implements postlogicdeserializerinterface or extends some postlogicdeserializerabstract

5522620
width	height
imagefield also has height and width

5522658
geany	gedit	emacs	gedit

5522775
udp	tcp
so the wan link under test is saturated and the testing is for fairness of the tcp and udp protocols

5522775
udp	tcp
if you have a 2mb link you set the tcp traffic to say 1.5mb and leave the remainder for udp traffic for gaming

5522775
udp	tcp
if you are developing a split protocol game you would define a upper bandwidth limit say 25kb s per client for the total traffic and then define separate limits for tcp and udp traffic within that limit 15kb s for tcp and 10kb s for udp

5522775
udp	tcp
generally games tend to use http tcp for downloading game content outside of the game and then switch to udp inside the game to remove the issue completely

5522789
switching	screens
in cases where you are situated at a terminal without scrolling if you are on a xterm and see no scrollbar simply switching it on a tool very useful is screens it provides virtual vt100 termials you can switching between terminals even detach from it and come back later nice for long running programs on remote serversthat need the occasional interaction

5522798

the platforms that use struct sockaddr inside struct ifreq also have an ipv6 friendly version struct lifreq that uses struct sockaddr_storage instead for example solaris other platforms such as linux and aix already use the longer structure

5522834
google-chrome	firefox
i think there is something wrong with my selectors that make my jquery popup script not working in ie firefox and google-chrome is ok

5522834
google-chrome	firefox
html dynamically generated probably nothing wrong there since firefox and google-chrome works fine

5522851
int	double
in this case the base of generics is class java.lang.number so you can use int double long ecc

5522864
google-chrome	firefox
for instance try this example in google-chrome or firefox vs

5522921
hide	show
i want to be able to show and hide the text input distance depending on whether the radio group is either true or false

5522932
webkit	gecko
of course webkit and gecko come to my mind but they are both hard to understand and hard to compile

5522935
postgresql	mysql
choosing something like sql server oracle mysql postgresql will work just fine

5522945
try-catch	exception-handling
answering exactly to what you are asking try-catch blocks are used to handle exception-handling so you should put them where you will actually be handling the exception-handling

5522964
gitolite	gitosis
i m not sure if this will be of any help to you but it s worth noting that the successor to gitosis gitolite has built-in support for wildcard repositories documentation here

5522997
for-loop	loops
the possible problem here would be that the for-loop which loads images won t wait for the load to complete and continues loops whatsoever

width	height
public int width height

5523044
google-chrome	firefox
first of all i work with google-chrome but it should work on firefox

if you know what the form is going to be beforehand you can simply get the program to send post requests to the server as though somebody had submitted a form

5526045

5526464
profiling	instrumentation
and finally you may also want to try instrumentation instead of sampling in your profiling session settings

5526464

if it needs a newer versioning and you are willing to upgrade you will need to download a new package

5531658
opencv	emgucv
emgucv opens the opencv open source computer vision library library of programming functions mainly aimed at real time computer vision to .net developers

5531658
vb.net	c++-cli
emgu cv can be used from several different languages including c# vb.net c++-cli and ironpython

5531659
opencv	emgucv
emgucv is a cross-platform .net wrapper to the opencv image processing library

5531697
width	height
then i calculated coord for the line of paddle movement using constants like pos 0 0 and screen height width

5531714
lxml	elementtree
another possibility is lxml which is a third-party package which implements the elementtree interface plus more

5531733
rss	feed
one way to do this is to place your messages in an rss feed then read that feed from the flex application

5531775
accessor	properties
one accesses the properties directly the other uses the accessor

5531775
accessor	properties
using the properties and the accessor allows for more flexibility for example key-value-observing is only possible using the accessor

5531785
portrait	landscape
i d like to restrict the application to only using portrait orientation on smaller devices and allow a different more large-screen friendly ui to be used in landscape when the device is larger

5531785
portrait	landscape
a larger tablet device gets to use uis that are more large-screen friendly and is allowed to be used in both portrait and landscape with unique uis for each orientation

5531788
put	get
probably not an answer you d expect to get but the easiest you can do is create an activex that will put the certificate to the right certificate store in ie

5531788
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
for firefox and google-chrome and opera you would need to find other solutions

5531794
freebsd	linux
this is on freebsd but i had the same issue on linux before i ported my code here

5531805
width	height
so my question is if there is a method to scale an uiview to a certain width and height which is not relative 3x its size but expressed in pixel 200 pixel x 300 pixel

5531816
cloudant	couchbase
i would also note that couchone couchbase supports the geocouch extensions while cloudant does not

5531831
cashapelayer	uiimage
i m having trouble drawing a uiimage in front of a cashapelayer

5531850
put	get
i have put the swampy folder into the site-packages folder of python 2.7.1 but i don t know how to make the .pth file that will get it installed so that the module can be imported

5531871
mouseleave	mouseenter
now this worked too but i wanted to add the same effect for mouseenter mouseleave

5531900
folder	directory
or you can map your windows folder to same machine and access then navigate through the directory and copy the dlls but for this you need admin previleges

5531900
folder	dir
now create a new dir inside the solution name it crdist paste all dlls inside the folder and refer from there at the production end open command prompt and register the dll using regsvr32 -i dll path

5531934
put	get
however when i try to transfer a file from my local machine to the ftp server using put i get a 553 could not create file error

5531941
onresume	onpause
i have a couple of things which are the same in all my activities throughout my application an optionsmenu and some code which needs to run onresume onrestart and onpause

5531941
width	height
one add a dummy listview to the layout with visibility false height width 0 haven t tried this but i guess it should work

5531953
caliburn.micro	prism
i would also seriously consider using an mvvm framework such as caliburn.micro prism or mvvm light toolkit

5531959
trie	tree
i ve got stuck at implementation of entry removal from a tree trie like structure to be a more specific

5532007
width	height
scaling uiview to certain width and height is easy as well

5532036
try-catch	exception-handling
you don t need try-catch block in this method- it only re-throws the exception-handling so doesn t change anything

5532049
inherited	subclassing
in this case you don t need to create myactivity or mylistactivity classes but you need to call methods of the helper class in every activity subclassing you want to inherited these features

5532089
jxtable	jtable
for an easy way to set an alternate row colors you can use swingx to create jxtable the same as jtable + some cool extra features like

5532092
preferenceactivity	preferencescreen
you can make another preferenceactivity that loads nested preferencescreen

5532097
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
they claim it s non-standard but also that it s supported by all major browsers firefox safari google-chrome opera and ie

5532108
client-side	server-side
keep in mind the difference in visibility between server-side and client-side code

5532117
inherited	properties
the inherited properties should be describing the class the page will use

5532117
inherited	properties
if that is the case then you just need to drop the .cs from the end of the inherited properties

5532147
hide	show
if you need to show drop down list on the client side use javascript function with onclick client event to show or hide any section you want

5532159
folder	directory
this c program create a folder in the current directory and return 1 if no error

5532159
int	chars
this program is working just if i use int instead of chars in the create function like shown but i need to use chars in this function

5532173
google-chrome	firefox
i ve found that it s jumpy in firefox and google-chrome and oddly smooth as silk in ie

5532196
median	percentile
as noted below median is a subcalss of percentile

5532200
for-loop	loops
use a for-loop not a foreach loops

5532263
folder	directory
after you unzip your swampy-2.0 folder in the site-packages directory you only have to create also in site-packages a text file called misite.pth the only important thing here is the .pth extension you can use whatever filename you like

5532273
uiview	subviews
later i add that uiview as a subviews of another view but without removing it from the array

5532278
submit	submission
1.6 contact form submission i want to set a custom successful message so that the front-end user can view that message after he submit the contact form

5532351
portrait	landscape
4 pictures 2 landscape en 2 portrait

5532351
portrait	landscape
when i fade from landscape to portrait the last pictures stays behind the current picture

5532371
typedef	struct
the code looks as follows myrecord is a typedef to a struct while filename is a #define to the file s name

5532389
hide	show
i m trying to disable a button hide a select list show some text once a button is clicked.

5532412
audiotrack	audiorecord
don t use those classes for streaming audio - use audiotrack and audiorecord instead

5532413
hide	show
you can disable button hide select box and show elements by doing the following

5532417
listview	gridview	gridview	datalist
i want to view the result of this method in datalist or listview or gridview component.maybe the kind of data source of component is object but the problem how can i pass the parameter ids into these comonents

5532437
hide	show
show the form totally hide and clear the space

5532440
audiotrack	audiorecord
use audiotrack audiorecord apis for streaming audio recording and playback

5532476
width	height
you can give items in the wrappanel a width and height and they re stacked together like a 2d stackpanel

5532478
lxml	beautifulsoup
lxml is many times faster than beautifulsoup so you might want to use that

5532539
stdout	stderr
in short you re going to read from child-process stdout and maybe stderr and write to child-process stdin

5532547
calloc	malloc
calloc 3 and malloc 3 do interact with the kernel to get memory if necessary

5532547
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
but most implementations of free 3 do not return memory to the kernel 1 they just add it to a free list that calloc and malloc will consult later in order to reuse the released blocks

5532547
free	malloc
malloc and free cooperate to maintain a directory

5532547
free	malloc
the alternative is a bit more shared-memory and paging-friendly and it involves allocating memory specifically for the directory. malloc and free have little if any ability to enforce access to individual blocks even when special and optional debugging code is compiled into the program

5532547
free	malloc
finally the few programs that do return large amounts of memory are likely to bypass malloc and simply allocate and free pages anyway

5532559
google-chrome	firefox
i tested this with both google-chrome and firefox

5532587
post	get
you can just get the post variable and connect to your sql database

5532651
switching	screens
the problem when i m running into is when a user views the home screens which is cached clicks log in logs in and then returns to the home screens the login logout button doesn t know to switching

5532696
width	height
so this is why i need to define the height and width of my table-cell div too

5532696
width	height
i m at a loss as to why i cant set the height or width of this table-cell

5532714
stdout	stderr
also i want any messages printed straight to the terminal so i have stdout and stderr be none which causes them to not go to my python program

5532728
width	height
when i apply the resize transformation with smaller width and smaller height the size of the transformed image in bytes is larger than the orig image

5532728
width	height
the funny or sad part is even when i invoke the resize with the same width and height as the orig dimensions are not changed the size transformed image is larger than the orig

5532746
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
there you try parsing the morse code letters into a file but the problem is the for-loop is in the first iteration and then the whole while loops is executed therefore you re always placing the morsecode in the first position of the arrays

5532755
width	margin
#hornav can be whatever width you want 80 as it is now and if you want it to be centred you can reintroduce the margin 0 auto

5532888
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
for a text file create an inputstreamreader around your fileinputstream remembering to specify the encoding and then a bufferedreader so that you can read by lines

5532921
for-loop	arrays
your for-loop does not terminate before the arrays is exhausted

5532932
children	parent
what s happening is that you re matching any file element then applying templates to its parent dir which is matched by the default template for elements which applies templates to all of its children resulting in another match of the same file and starting an infinite recursion

5532951
hash	md5
set the password field to the md5 hash of some random input

5532960
outputstream	inputstream
the main part that s causing problems is code to tunnel an inputstream and an outputstream across a set of http connections so that each read and write turns into a separate post request

5532974
put	get
put it all together and you get

5532993
ant	maven
in the java world use maven or ant or maven and ant

5533012
children	parent
even better than applying an adaptive sort would be to sort the new children first using an adaptive sort as you are breeding the fittest parent first and so would expect to have on average the fittest children appear first then to merge them into the already-sorted list of parent

5533012
children	parent
you can merge them straightforwardly in o n time by walking the parent and child arrays in parallel and inserting children where needed

5533053
google-chrome	firefox
the method i am using works great in google-chrome but is slow in firefox and doesn t work in ie

5533087
jlist	jlabel
the above code gets an item in a jlist when you double click on it and sets a jlabel with settext and item.tostring

5533100
google-chrome	firefox
when i use colors there are not white edges either in google-chrome or firefox so it appears to be strictly a texturing problem

5533123
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
the problems i run into is trying to change the width padding margin etc of the cells to create a spacing generally warps the height width of the thumbnail

5533149
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
note that if you use google-chrome there will be some banding around an equator that in my opinion is a bug in math.random or just a low quality random generator works fine on firefox or safari but the same problem is visible also on android browser

5533154
dictionary	map
1 dictionary map lambda x x a x b

5533226
inherited	properties
the hasownproperty is there to make sure that you re only counting properties from the object literal and not properties it inherited from its prototype

5533259
ssl	https
use ssl encryption https

5533294
int	boolean	int	chars
which means everything except the primitive types int chars boolean etc.

5533294
int	boolean	int	chars
if you want to store them you have to wrap them in their corresponding object wrapper classes int chars boolean etc. so like

5533300
post	get
i didn t explicitly mark the action method as get or post so i assume by default it s post - hence the error

5533324
opera	firefox
however object.keys is not supported in ie8 and below opera and firefox 3.6 and below

5533333
post	get
indeed you would get send back to the edit page in this case what you could do if you don t want anyone to see querystrings is assuming you are using html.form to post the data

5533420
integer	fractions
doing this chops away the fractions part leaving you with just an integer left behind

5533431
octal	binary
this character set is very different from what we re used to using for binary octal base 10 and hexadecimal where the first character is 0 which represents the value 0 etc

5533448
int	chars
i wanted to know if there was a way to cast an array of int into an array of chars in java

5533461
imagemagick	mogrify
i have done some experimentation and found that you can get higher-quality images by using ghostscript to output a high-quality jpeg and then using imagemagick s mogrify command to resize and compress the image though that may be due to my limited knowledge of ghostscript rather than limitations of it

5533517
folder	directory
i want to keep the whole directory structure but want to move them to a different folder

5533521
wcffacility	castle-windsor
my project references the same versions of castle-windsor and castle.core that the wcffacility demo references

5533551
jobs	cron
since you mentioned cron jobs i m assuming you have ssh access to your server which means you don t need a browser

5533551
jobs	cron
these cron jobs can be executed via the command line as such

5533603
trac	bugzilla
the other is a bug tracking database like trac or bugzilla

5533604
children	parent
i suppose i could add every single field to the parent class and leave most of them null in my children but that seems really ugly

5533605
int	chars
with basic types like int and chars you don t have to explicitly allocate memory for them

5533660
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
if this is for an iphone app then viewdidappear or possibly viewwillappear will get called when the child view goes away

5533702
subclass	abstract-class
i don t want to make a new instance of the actual abstract-class you can t do that anyway but of the implementing subclass

5533704
ubuntu	linux
update i am using ubuntu linux 10.04

5533717
getter	setter
you could also implement getter and setter in the code below by synthesizing theaudio and using self.theaudio

5533726
implements	extends
you could make an abstract method that extends classes have to implements to construct a new instance

5533750
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
chances are that the uiscrollview methods that pass on the delegate messages use the private ivar to access the delegate rather than using the properties accessor each time

5533776
min	max
work out the difference between the max and the min datetime for the messages

5533796
post	get
either way as you can see i have no idea how to get that post_id in there from the post that the form is being submitted from

5533798
post	get
i m not sure how you got off the ui thread but to get back on you can use post

5533800
int	chars
i wanted to know if there was a way to cast an array of int into an array of chars in java

5533815
post	get
you will need to get the content of that page first extract the token value and include that in your post response

5533816
width	height
all points will be between 0 and screen width height origin is obviously width height 2

5533821
apache	nginx
if you don t want to use apache try using nginx lightweight easy to change etc

5533822
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the piece of code that i pasted above will display a checked box when the document is opened with a variant of ie it will render something else when the document is opened with firefox safari or google-chrome

5533883
cout	cin
the crucial thing is that std cout and std cin are tied see - this means that streaming operations on std cin will first trigger a flush on std cout

5533932
subtract	add
so wouldn t it work its way down to zero doing by subtract 1 then add 3 to each 0 3 6 etc

5533965
versioning	upgrade
i started on the free versioning integrates great with paypal and have since upgrade to the pro for other features

5533988
vbscript	jscript
the suggestion from microsoft is to update your applications to use the outlook object model instead but i can t find any examples at all of how i might use the outlook object model to open a compose window from either vbscript or jscript

5533991
hash	md5
i m working under the assumption that when you say hash you re refering to a cryptographic one like md5 or sha1 if you re talking about something else.

5533992
3des	aes
you should be able to use 3des in place of aes

5534031
post	get
you have a post with image uploads dependent on the post and you should get them deleted when a post is deleted

5534041
pull	push
the configuration variable eliminates the need for the option to git fetch and git pull in the same way that eliminates the need to specify with git push

5534099
hide	show
if i hide divs 1 to 4 but show div 5 then div 5 should appear at the top of the page

5534105
getter	setter
i used property and synthesize to define my getter and setter methods for fillcolor and shapebounds

5534123
versioning	upgrade
this will only upgrade minor versioning of rails 3.0.5 3.0.6 ...

5534136
hide	show
think about it the other way round - hide all your divs by default and then use the javascript to show them as needed

5534149
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it is working in firefox 3.6 but it not working in google-chrome opera or ie8

5534160
children	parent
the way we do it is to use lxml and determine the parent and children of every element

5534160
children	parent
if there is no text content difference in the parent and children then we have a set of rules that we follow to retain certain children while tossing the parent

5534178
post	get
the most straightforward way is to use nsmutableurlrequest to create the get or post request and then nsurlconnection to asynchronously send the data and receive the result

5534178
post	get
as for the server side of things you would have it accept a get or post just as you would with a web-based app and output data in an appropriate format

5534219
put	get
if i put name text and alt text in the html for the specific image i get no tool-tip popup

5534231
nstimer	nsoperation
but if you insist on polling you may as well use the nstimer directly rather than messing with a timer inside an nsoperation

5534267
mongoid	mongomapper
for the same reason i very much like mongoid over mongomapper because it leaves the developer the chance to use inheritance as a way of modelling something meaningful in the problem domain

5534274
requestfactory	gwt
i am using gwt 2.2 with requestfactory

5534285
mongoid	mongomapper
for the same reason i very much like mongoid over mongomapper because it leaves the developer the chance to use inheritance as a way of modelling something meaningful in the problem domain

5534315
uitableview	nsindexpath
- bool tableview uitableview tableview shouldindentwhileeditingrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

5534340
sorting	filtering
using this method should also provide things like sorting and filtering for free as well as easier maintenance depending on your viewpoint

5534348
hash	hmac
if you have placed any data in that cookie that would permit a third party monitoring the connection access to the site as your user such as say a simple un-salted hash of the user s password then the hmac is utterly useless

5534363
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested this in the latest versions of google-chrome and firefox using jquery 1.4 and 1.5

5534460
getter	setter
actionname paramvalue and paramname all have appropriately named getter setter inside the objectaction

5534496
single-quotes	double-quotes
this is because you re passing the split method a string double-quotes rather than a character single-quotes

5534507
hash	md5
that explains why this will get very slow on big files and probably is not feasible as a solution - i don t have any perfect alternative but an idea would be to only generate the md5 hash on the first 5 kb of data and additionally compare the file size - if both match assume they are identical

5534571
button	checkbox
i have a bunch of form inputs textboxex radio button checkbox etc

5534591
punctuation	words
the official question write a console application that inputs a sentence from the user assume no punctuation then determines and displays the non-duplicate words in alphabetical order

5534591
spaces	delimiter
by default split uses spaces as delimiter

5534597
junit	testng
and junit testng

5534662
folder	directory
simply copy your project on your server and set the domain directory pointer to the public folder

5534680
hide	show
i was only using the mapi.session stuff to hide image attachments so they can be show inline in the message body and not as files attached to the e-mail but this now seems to be incorporated automatically

5534685
udp	tcp
the wikipedia pages on tcp and udp are pretty good sources for learning more about the details

5534688
mouse	keyboard
override the wndproc with setwindowlongptr gwlp_wndproc ... so that the designer code can intercept mouse and keyboard input and use it to initiate a move for example instead of having the mouse input go through to the actual button code which would instead interpret it as a click event

5534688
min	max
but i think the designer is doing a bit of cheating here because usually windows only draws frames like - with titlebar and min max buttons that for actual top-level windows

5534688
move	drag
as the user clicks from control to control just move the drag handle windows to the currently active control

5534689
children	parent
the problem tends is much easier if you have pointers to parent nodes and not just to children mirko s code uses this

5534692
cos	sin
cos radians lng - radians -122 + sin radians 37 sin radians

5534866
mouseout	mouseleave
to do something when a user s mouseleave and element use the mouseout event

5534885
put	get
if you put the hover above the normal style it will get overwritten

5534907
gridview	detailsview
i have two pages the first it s a gridview that bind to dataset the second one have detailsview that bind to dataset that is used for editing and inserting

5534907
gridview	detailsview
upon insertion on detailsview page i want to redirect to gridview page

5534907
gridview	detailsview
with ms_ticket being the gridview page but the insert continue to return the blank detailsview

5534915
junit	testng
surefire has a few problems when you tell it to run both testng and junit tests

5534965
width	height
you can use the plugin found here which contains the calculatespacing function albeit it works on width not height so some modification may be necessary

5534979
dbcontext	objectcontext
it is related to efv4 and objectcontext api but efv4.1 with dbcontext api is just wrapper around efv4

5535068
junit	testng
as cedric said above surefire has some problems with testng and junit tests in the same project

5535068
junit	testng
i found that when running mvn test -x surefire was using the testng plugin instead of junit even though the actual test was a junit one

5535093
google-chrome	firefox
ps im using firefox 4 google-chrome 10.0.648.204 and ie8

5535116
addition	multiplication	subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
to find the product sub-array just substitute multiplication division for addition subtraction in the above algorithm

5535118
folder	directory
now this page has tag for the files and folder within this directory

5535130
onresume	onpause
when your app goes to the background looses focus for any reason you get onpause called and when it goes back your onresume will be called

5535165
opera	firefox
it works great in opera opera-mini iphone and a bunch of handhelds n70 motorola but it refuses to work with konqueror and firefox

5535183
google-chrome	firefox
currently indexeddb is only supported by firefox and google-chrome

5535199
serializable	deserialization
basically that s it you just need to create your datacontractserializer instance with that surrogate and use it for deserialization for serializable it won t matter for example

5535304
for-loop	loops
i have for-loop and within that loops i have used insert into command for 75000+ values

5535435
versioning	upgrade
indeed the best solution is to upgrade to a newer versioning

5535582
versioning	upgrade
these changes will not upgrade your store to a complete v2.3 versioning

5535582
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
if you wish to upgrade to a full v2.3 versioning perform only sql database changes and use the database with a new v2.3 installation

5535636
yacc	bison
they are the closest thing that c# has to lex and yacc or flex and bison if you prefer which are the proper tools for this job

5535640
put	get
if you run that transform in your input document assuming you ve put it into an actual stylesheet you should get a simple list of all of the package names as the output

5535643
avro	thrift
apache avro is a data serialization tool similar to protocol buffers and thrift

5535681
cassini	iis
when testing locally on cassini or local iis even with fiddler limiting speed on localhost to simulate network latency there is no problem in ie

5535681
width	margin
i ve added negative -1px margin for ie7 and width 1 for li elements of the menu fixed the ie6 menu jumping out problem but this problem makes no sense to me .

5535709
firefox	safari
it supports a hosts of features to make sure you re getting the page you want aka different agent headers to pretend it s an ie firefox safari android or iphone browser

5535733
mouseout	mouseleave
see this jsfiddle example showing mouseout and mouseleave

5535734
uitableview	nsindexpath
- uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tv cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

5535761
put	get
well if you want to try to get information back from the script then don t put the on the end otherwise if you don t want to output to a file but don t need any info from the script then instead of a file

5535773

5537522
sorting	filtering
the business logic part is then limited to processing of inputs and preparing generic retrieval and provide mechanisms for filtering or sorting while the templates determine how to filtering how to sort or how to paginate etc

5537522
sorting	filtering
i suggest that you use a proper object-relational mapping orm framework activerecord pattern see here on stackoverflow or in wikipedia that allows you to use generic retrieval objects that can be re-configured by the template to suit its needs such as the aforementioned filtering and sorting

5537542
width	height
set width and height if you want to scale it later

5537548

check the module width and height is set

5538005
post	get
this is implemented on the controller as an edit method which accepts get requests and an edit method that accepts post requests

this means you can visit the edit url and it will display a form for a get or save a form for a post

5538005
post	get
the post-redirect-get prg pattern seems pretty black and white because it essentially redirects every post back to a get action

5540312
opera	safari
if that s not an option and you re stuck serving a desktop site to mobile users then see if you can tweak your design so none of your blocks of text are wider than the mobile device s device-width 320px for many portrait phones you can use mobile-specific css to avoid affecting desktop browsers then mobile safari won t need to increase any font sizes and browsers which reflow text like the android browser and opera mobile also won t need to change your layout

5540544
svg	vml
raphaã l uses this to determine if it should render using vml ie or svg everyone else

5540565
pop-up	dialog
dialog is supposed to be used as pop-up of an application that runs in an jframe to catch the users attention and to pause the main application

5540658
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in google-chrome and opera but doesn t display the numbers in the drop down list in firefox

5540661
mdpi	hdpi
you can use various image folders dependending on the resolution of the device ldpi mdpi hdpi or xhdpi

5540673
portrait	landscape
you can mix in portrait landscape and other modifiers too

5540698
min	max
i have a big issue with a query in which i need to retrieve some max and min values related to each row

5540698
min	max
to simplify this query is being joined to another table but i ll only show the max and min queries

5540732
children	parent
it is essentially a flat collection of hierarchical data each item has parent and children properties

5540772
mvp	presenter
im trying out the mvp pattern and my presenter class i have setup unit test as follows

5540778
listview	gridview
as it turns out performance was pretty bad so i switched to listview and gridview but since there is no autogeneratecolumns available i need to somehow create and change the columns

5540781
put	get
i have a problem right now with codeigniter i use the rest controller library which is really awesome to create an api but i can not get put requests.

5540781
post	get
yet it works with the verbs post and get

5540803
vim	textmate
my question is some people i know prefer to use the good ol command line and it seems that they somewhat think of git gui as something that are for noobs something like people using vim looking down on people using ides like textmate or eclipse

5540804
background-color	transparency
alternatively you can just set it to transparency and then set a background-color after the 2nd gradient

5540804
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
to prevent you from going insane you can also use this mixin with sass which should work in firefox 3.6 opera google-chrome safari nightly builds and what will probably become the standard syntax

5540866
udp	tcp
streaming is best done using udp since tcp always delivers data in order if a packet is lost and must be re-send the application won t get any data until tcp has solved it

5540877
min	max
as for youre max min zoom you would need something like this before youre postscale

5540969
bazaar	git
mercurial tortoisehg and bazaar tortoisebzr are the dvcs i could think of other than git thats opensource

5540998
domparser	saxparser
i read about domparser and saxparser in java

5540998
domparser	saxparser
i have no doubts in domparser and people prefer saxparser than domparser because of the memory it takes

5541007
put	get	post	get	post	put
codeigniter doesn t support reading incoming put requests and if it s not essential i would stick to get post for your api as its probably not necessary

5541009
put	get
i have put this code on all the three classes to try something different but still cant get it working

5541021
width	height
of course you ll need to set the layout width height .

5541025
g++	gcc
i want to look at the code generated by the g++ gcc compiler on linux

5541028
temp	tmp
from the logs i see that the php command that eclipse launches uses a temp php.ini file found in tmp zend_debug session9211448873864684697.tmp php.ini

5541051
post	put
you re going to need to either post the file directly to step2 which you said worked just didn t have the logic of step1 and put your server-side file checking logic there or in step1 store the file somewhere on the server either save it to the file system store it in a database maybe store it in session which i don t recommend etc. where it can be accessed by step2

5541077
width	height
note that borders add height width to overall height width so you will always have vertical scroll even if the border is 1px thats 100 + 1px

5541128
coldfusion	verity
i am currently running coldfusion 8 with verity running on a k2 server

5541139
post	get
i don t have any code to show you right now reply back and when i m home tonight i can post something that should help but yuo will probably get better results placing your rotate code in an asynctask see the painless threading area of the dev site for more info

5541189
rss	feed
i m trying to parse an rss feed using javascript

5541220
int	boolean
that includes all int types + boolean

5541224

5541234
sorting	filtering
i want to create a service that has many parameters for sorting and filtering over 50

5541235
versioning	upgrade
we ll probably refuse from unicode support for now and will upgrade to the 1.0 versioning later

5541249
yesod	hamlet
in the yesod web framework we have taken the haml concept but used normal html syntax made dry- we call it hamlet

5541325
post	get
you can now post a keyword or a set of keywords to lucene get an id of document and retrieve the document from berkley db

5541335
post	get
i m guessing i would get the uitabbaritem view and drill down the subviews until i find it and then do the same thing as in the post above to get the icon out

5541335
post	get
i m hoping to get direct input from yonel as well to say thank you can t post a comment on that thread for the images from the map

5541340
hash	md5
i ve seen other approaches that attach a version number or md5 hash to a js src querystring

5541340
google-chrome	firefox
however my javascript is still getting cached in multiple browsers google-chrome firefox when i push a new version of my site

5541365
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
the question is how to configure ntlm in safari opera google-chrome

5541449
alarmmanager	appwidgetprovider
just set an alarm with an intent that your appwidgetprovider receives using the alarmmanager

5541456
bazaar	git
however with as much git experience as you have i think you would find bazaar limiting

5541456
pull	push
i would recommend starting them out without any branching just pull commit and push from master to origin

5541522
min	max
your min is 00 00 and your max is 24 00 not inclusive

5541522
min	max
if you require that lower upper you can represent 21 00 24 00 but you are still unable to represent 21 00 02 00 an interval that wraps across the min max boundary

5541532
pthreads	ucontext
note that the ucontext functions are listed as obsolescent in the two most recent editions of pthreads

5541548
client-side	server-side
also you can move server-side functionality to the client by the use of page methods which basically creates a javascript function out of your server-side method and allows you to use it client-side

5541560
integer	unsigned
refuses to compile because integer constant is too large for long type even though it should be well within the size limits of an unsigned long long

5541587
pthreads	ucontext
setjmp is portable iso c89 and c99 and ucontext obsolescent in susv3 and removed from susv4 pthreads 2008 is not

5541587
ucontext	longjmp
in practice if you used nasty hacks with setjmp longjmp and signal handlers and alternate signal handling stacks you could make these just about as powerful as ucontext but they were not portable

5541588
textview	imageview
you may add a couple textview and an imageview but if the horizontal space gets too small the two textview are going to start wrapping around independently wich is going to look weird

5541615
ubuntu	linux
i have a network of 100 machines all running ubuntu linux

5541636
temp	tmp
especially since windows automatically initializes the tmp and temp environment variables for you

5541667
post	get
i stumbled across this post which describes using a linked server to get around the problem without having to code a custom parsing routine

5541669
hide	show
instead of using separate show and hide calls use .toggle showorhide

5541783
google-chrome	firefox
for dose who are using document.write is not a valid dom procedure so in firefox and google-chrome if you use it in an xml xhtml strict with content-type as text xml don t work

5541790
pop-up	dialog
i want to have the keyboard show automatically once the dialog pop-up

5541790
pop-up	dialog
this opens the keyboards once the dialog pop-up and also closes the keyboard once i press the ok button

5541790
pop-up	dialog
dr i want the soft keyboard to be shown when my dialog with an edittext and a button pop-up focus on edittext

5541811
tcplistener	tcpclient
the tcpclient objects come from a tcplistener

5541837
uitabbaritem	uibaritem
uitabbaritem inherits from uibaritem which inherits from nsobject

5541837
inherited	properties
since it doesn t inherited from uiview i don t know that you re going to be able to get the information you want just with a properties

5541838
accelerometer	gyroscope
gyroscope measures orientation where accelerometer measures movement

5541852
int	double
javascript has no concept of int according to the standard all numbers are ieee double which means they have 52 bits of mantissa

5541887
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox 4.0 google-chrome 10.0

5541907
int	boolean
if for example default values would also be sufficient such as 0 for int false for boolean etc. then you can omit the null check and simply utilize

5541917
pull	push
what this means is that basic git pull and git push operations won t work since git assumes that without a workspace you don t intend to commit any changes to the bare repository

5541965
public	protected
the best approach for accessing package-level fields in legacy java code would be to write a class in java that wraps the existing class and which exposes the package protected methods and fields from that class with public methods

5542009
versioning	upgrade
if you can t upgrade to a newer versioning the workaround is to disable partial state saving as below in web.xml see also jstl in jsf2 facelets.

5542009
versioning	upgrade
solution is to upgrade to a newer versioning

5542018
internationalization	localization
reading your posting i think you are looking at internationalization i18 and localization l10n which are kind of separate

5542019
cout	cin
but given that a c++ solution is acceptable i d recommend cin string getline and cout for i o

5542030
cout	cin
but you can also use cin cout in place of the scanf printf you have there

5542034
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
json is supported on firefox google-chrome and safari i believe

5542064
direct3d	directx
there are better options - slimdx for example wraps all of the directx direct3d types including the dx10 11 interfaces

5542105
mouse	trackpad
using the trackpad on os x yields very similar effects to using a mouse wheel yet gives very different event values and yet the device difference cannot be detected by js

5542105
google-chrome	firefox
it has two flaws on os x firefox on os x will produce values 1 3 what they should be and google-chrome on os x will produce values 1 40 what they should be

5542105
google-chrome	firefox
suggestions for detecting and improving the behavior on firefox and google-chrome on os x are welcome

5542112
width	height
you could use a background image with the height of one line of text plus margin-bottom and width 1 pixel

5542116
subtract	add
in essence to get the subpaths to subtract when you add them together you need to draw them or rather construct them in opposite directions one clockwise and the other anti-clockwise

5542121
int	chars
try to log int and you will see that there are chars inside you cannot put in a url

5542129
post	get
using fiddler i was able to see that when items are being added to a marketing list it s done as a post not a get request

5542165
hash	salt
#1 do not store the password - store a salt hash

5542175
children	parent
i am teaching myself to program by making a simple core-data drill-down app with a uinavigationcontroller where you select a grandparent entity to see a uitableview of parent and then select a parent to see children

5542197
win32com	pythoncom
i am using win32com and pythoncom but the documentation for both is rather vague and i cannot figure out how to implement this

5542276
implements	extends
no you ll probably be better off by writing a base class that implements nsfetchedresultscontrollerdelegate which would probably be a uitableviewcontroller subclass and contains a nsfetchedresultscontroller instance and then extends your base class wherever you need it

5542282
put	get
when you put your code to make the ajax call you can get the url from the form s action but that depends on you

5542289
min	max
for a group by query you can have only those columns in the select clause which are either present in the group by clause or are aggregate functions such as min max avg count

5542292
hide	show
if i now click on widget 2 widget 1 s menu gets a hide event and widget 2 s menu gets a show event and comes up

5542311
toolbar	docking
otherwise i d suggest docking the toolbar on a separate line to the other tool bars or break things up a little with some popupmenu tools

5542344
maven	m2e
i m using eclipse helios with maven plugins m2e and maven integration for eclipse wtp

5542376
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it also has native border-radius rounding in browsers that support it opera 10.5+ firefox safari and google-chrome

5542378
profiling	debugging
try using the same profiling for debugging and build and run as debugging not release with the target set to your device

5542411
flot	fusioncharts
you could use fusioncharts or flot

5542421
hide	show
instead of a linklabelplayername1 and textboxplayername1 you will have a linklabeltextboxplayername1 and none of the show hide focus stuff will clutter your form code

5542425
bash	zsh
bash and zsh have array extensions

5542425
bash	zsh
but if you find yourself thinking that a bash or a zsh extension would be helpful for a script the correct choice is instead to rewrite in perl or python

5542435
boost	eigen	eigen	ublas
i haven t looked that much at boost ublas but eigen sure is nice and has good performance as well

5542448
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu is completely utf-8 based aware for some time now

5542468
hash	md5
the php session id is an md5 hash which makes it 128 bits in length

5542513
move	drag
i wanted to create a program that i could move one file to another directory im too lazy for drag and drop the program works fine and dandy it by itself

5542586
google-chrome	firefox
it worked for me using firefox 3.6 and google-chrome 10 but i have one test user who said it didn t work for him and he didn t even get to the allow and not allow screen and yes he was using firefox as well

5542610
folder	directory
i have to access one of the image in images folder in root directory

5542637
hash	md5
i set up an endpoint and printed out the request objects from a silent post as well as the _server superglobal - it does not seem that they send any identification other than the md5 hash set in the cp

5542654
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
as of jquery 1.5 the success callback function receives a jqxhr object in jquery 1.4 it received the xmlhttprequest object

5542654
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
however since jsonp and cross-domain get requests do not use xmlhttprequest in those cases the jqxhr and textstatus parameters passed to the success callback are undefined

5542664
client-side	server-side
the preceding code illustrates conversion from a server-side data type to a string which can be parsed and thus converted to a client-side object

5542665
width	height
each section fills the browser window with 100 width and height so when you click a menu link it looks as though you re sliding into the next page but it s really just one long page

5542665
width	height
in section 3 i have embedded a google map as the background with 100 width and height and a z-index of 1

5542686
versioning	upgrade
i never had the problem before but i recently upgrade to versioning 9.03 and also os x lion preview release 2

5542711
disk	ram
a ram disk is not always faster make sure you test different products with different

5542711
disk	ram
a solid state drive may even be faster than a ram disk which surprised me

5542793
awt	swing
bear in mind however that awt swing support amongst many other things is pretty much dead

5542822
hash	md5
the md5 hash returned in the silent post is a hash of a string that includes an md5 hash value set in security settings that presumably only authorize and you know

5542831
implements	extends
create class that extends observable and implements runnable

5542837
hide	show
and than use that to show or hide your item

5542844
folder	directory
but it doesn t find these dlls because the dll search path doesn t contain the test folder it looks for the dlls in the gac and the vstesthost directory

5542865
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in performing some cross-browser testing i noticed that my images flicker when the page is refreshed - but just with google-chrome safari - not with firefox or ie

5542865
google-chrome	safari
when rails serves the page it flickers in google-chrome safari

5542865
google-chrome	firefox
basecamphq.com flickers on refresh with google-chrome but doesn t or at least it does much less with firefox

5542873
put	get
if i put the ab.c in there and gcc ab.c i get bunch of errors because it cannot find the headers etc

5542901
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
i m using ajax to make a user control which contains a panel that contains label and radiobuttonlist or checkboxlist according to a condition

5542951
post	get
whenever the user requests a new page he needs to post or get this key as http parameter if the user wants to be identified as logged in

5542951
ssl	https
if you do it over ssl https it is probably more secure

5542961
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the demos now need a minimum of google-chrome 15 safari 6 firefox 15 ie 11 or opera 15

5542961
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
note if you need earlier browser support please ask as a previous version of my answer did work with google-chrome 12 safari 5.0.3 firefox 4 and opera 10 but i have updated it now that new browsers support prefix-free css3

5542988
ftgl	freetype
i use ftgl which builds on top of freetype

5542994
put	get
as the developer you should probably put on your waders and get involved asap.

5542996
bash	zsh
ctrl + s to forward search works in zsh for me but not bash

5542998
textarea	textbox
when i set the disabled property of an asp.net textbox control to false the final rendered html textarea tag sent to the browser includes an class aspnetdisabled attribute in addition to the disabled disabled attribute

5543092
administration	activation
after talking with some people on #couchdb irc it seems that they can t figure out out a way to do something administration like activation users that click on a email link with out using a backend process like a node.js server which keeps track of the _changes feed

5543138
post	get
--- snip to get post length under max chars...---

5543168
int	double	int	chars
if you specify other atomic vectors int double logical complex along with chars vector they will get coerced to chars

5543219
serializable	deserialization
makes json serializable and deserialization of complex types

5543355
ubuntu	debian
alternativly i could start django on startup but i would need a start stop script for ubuntu debian

5543363
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for browsers like firefox google-chrome safari etc

5543428
for-loop	loops
actually java automatically translates the first for-loop in something that looks like the while loops

5543472
google-chrome	firefox
where firefox and google-chrome treats elements with z-index document-wide in ie as you likely know z-index is based upon the parent s z-index first

5543472
google-chrome	firefox
the element its index is being compared with is not the parent div as it would be in firefox or google-chrome but the content inside the div the p element

5543582
hide	show
is it possible to hide the tab bar so that it normally doesn t show until the user touches the screen then the tab bar will with animation show up at the bottom

5543600
implements	extends
but there is one thing which named classes can do and anonymous classes can t implements more than one interface or extends a class and interfaces too

5543603
octal	decimal
others have covered the immediate problem â that you re accidentally treating a number as octal rather than decimal â but the deeper problem is that you re storing numbers as strings

5543624
client-side	server-side
it s not quite ideal because your server-side javascript probably has features that you can t guarantee will exist on the client-side unless you limit your users to say recent versions of firefox

5543624
client-side	server-side
if you re like me you don t want to limit your server code to js that happens to run in every browser so your server-side js and client-side js will be subtlety different

5543624
client-side	server-side
i m often frustrated when having to use a server-side language that s completely different from my client-side language javascript

5543626
dictionary	map
use a mutable dictionary or another relevant collection type instead of a map

5543641
folder	directory
now if i create the dated directory in the uploads folder and chmod the folder to 755 the upload works fine but if i try to chmod the uploads folder without creating the dated sub folder which i need django to do i am getting a permissions error

5543665
chown	chgrp
you ll need to either chgrp or chown the media directory to the same group as your python process and ensure you have at least g+rwx on directories and g+rw on files

5543667
webclient	webrequest
this is a limitation of silverlight which requires asynchronous network access wcf proxy calls webclient webrequest etc.

5543667
webclient	webrequest
i do not know if webclient webrequest in silverlight share this behavior

5543668
width	height
this removes the layout_height of your tablelayout to wrap_content and it removes the height and width settings of your tablerow because the children of a tablerow do not need to specify the layout_width and layout_height attributes in the xml file

5543690
int	double
because -1 and 9 are int so -1 9 is an int division with the result 0 which when cast to double is 0.0

5543700
width	height
you dont need the height and the width

5543700
width	height
create one class that has only the height and the width

5543704
folder	directory
in the directory list below if does not exist create it by right-clicking on target folder and choosing add system folder

5543707
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the solution provided on the jscrollpane demo site doesn t work for me either and i have tested in firefox google-chrome and safari

5543719
next	except
i works perfectly except it loads all the page layout with the next results not only the box div in my _user partial

5543720
margin	haslayout
this is a haslayout -related ie bug and a thorough treatment of it can be found at has layout negative margin bug

5543720
width	height
like position height and width -- yikes

5543763
ccscene	cclayer
have either a separate ccscene instance for each of your levels or a separate cclayer for each of your levels

5543782
post	get
question related to this post i think he is offline tho so i cant get any feedback atm

5543785
button	checkbox
after the user click on the checkbox to select the download files on the treeview then they can click the submit button

5543806
pull	push
i ve done this because i want programmers to be able to do a hg pull from the main repository but not an hg push any changes get pulled by an hg serve from their work and checked first before going back into the main repository

5543862
versioning	upgrade
i even upgrade jquery ui to the latest versioning 1.8.11 but that did not help

5543900
post	get
make a index action method in the post controller and then your app get your index view

5543929
selecteditem	selectedindex
nowadays selecteditem will be null at the same time as selectedindex is -1

5543942
google-chrome	firefox
this works -- i tested it in google-chrome ie8 firefox 4

5543984
dictionary	map
then read each language dictionary into your hash map

5543994
post	get
more likely it s looking at the -tag and determining based on that where if should make a post get request

5544032
versioning	upgrade
issue i see some sort of an artifact on chrome ever since i upgrade to the latest versioning 10.0.648.204 - the background on the video is no longer white the video used have white background

5544032
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
there is no problem with firefox safari opera

5544057
ssl	https
if i make a special for the login page requiring ssl and one without for the rest of the pages and i use form authentication with pointing to the login page i configured before to use ssl when the user requests a protected page the url in the bar isn t login.page it s the page requested but the body is login form and i can login without using https

5544068
ssl	https
of course there is an area to specify what url my facebook app should serve when an https connection is used but i don t really have the option of using this since there s no ssl on the host

5544068
ssl	https
it seems like more work than it is worth to set up the client with a free ssl cert just for a simple fb landing page but i m wondering if there is a way to force a user with an https session to be served http convent via facebook

5544155
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i have a build in progress which displays ok in opera and firefox but not in google-chrome

i was developing my gwt 2.2.0 application using maven m2e in eclipse j2se 3.6 with google eclipse plugin the newest version as of april 2011 and it mostly worked fine until bang

5544176
dbcontext	objectcontext
dbcontext api doesn t offer any function import like edmx and objectcontext api

5544178
getter	setter
2 the original setter is invoked because nhibernate just creates a proxy which calls the underlying getter setter

5544180
google-chrome	firefox
then i found jquery .ajax not working in firefox against rails 406 response works in google-chrome ie

5544184
width	height
use double qoutes around your height and width values and it is just a number the px does not have to be declared

5544221
min	max
i went to manage fields for this specific content type and removed the max min resolution for this content type and it worked

5544266
postgresql	mysql
if you re working with a decent database eg oracle or postgresql but not mysql the database will have a pretty good idea when it is going to be worse to use an index than it is to do a mergesort and will choose to do the right thing

5544296
ilist	icollection
do not implement ilist icollection or c# restriction only

5544296
ienumerable	icollection
in this case bitarray implements both ienumerable and icollection

5544297
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i get the following error in firefox 4 only not in firefox 3.6.16 safari google-chrome opera or ie

the current core packaging values are pom.xml jar maven-plugin ejb war ear rar par

5544315
heroku	engineyard
i ve ready some posts regarding the heroku or engineyard for rails3

5544338
int	chars
for c something like this would work or roll your own using int or chars arrays with a spot in the array representing a digit

5544343
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox do a nice job of not making elements that remain unchanged between navigation stay on the screen

5544356
put	get
i made the same for backend in apps backend lib myuser.class.php but using is_admin untill now everything is perfect just that in the backend when i m going to edit a job the sfguardsecurityuser in the session get lost why because the isauthenticated function that is called in this page is the located in apps frontend lib myuser.class.php so when i try to change the page i get logged out cuz isauthenticated function called is the located in apps backend lib myuser.class.php sounds rare but it only happens in the edit page of the jobs now i m stuck here hope you all understand me and to be more specific when i go to the job edit page and in the action i put a print_r _session i can see this piece

5544360
multiplication	exponent
to calculate powers use dihotomic algorithm which uses binary representation of exponent and reduces resulting number of multiplication

5544428
hide	show
so if the dynamic array changes it show the divs present in the dynamic array and hide the divs not present

5544430
button	checkbox
the intended behavior is that when the user clicks in the status textarea the div under the status textarea slides out revealing the submit button as well as some other checkbox

5544430
button	checkbox
if the user clicks anywhere else on the page except a link or any element that has the class prevent_slideup the div slides up hiding the submit button and any checkbox

5544430
google-chrome	firefox
this code works as expected in google-chrome and firefox however in ie when a link is clicked for the first time it seems that the element stored in var target is actually a div instead of an anchor

5544491
put	get
if i don t put double quotes around programfiles i get an error on the set

5544500
versioning	upgrade
you can upgrade to one of them or to any following versioning like xe

5544504
put	get
however you can t put them both back in the document flow because then you won t get the underlay effect

5544542
opera	firefox
also i tested this on opera 11 ie8 and firefox 3.6

5544561
mouse	keyboard
you should read the input mouse or keyboard dispatch the events let them process and than draw the screen again

5544566
ireport	subreports
i need to create a report where the number of columns changes based on the data being passed to ireport just like with a subreports

5544569
int	chars
reads when you dereference f and call it with a int you get a chars ie

5544569
int	chars
f is a pointer to a function which takes int and returns chars

5544593
inherited	properties
another solution im thinking about is making a superclass that holds a list of properties and then have factory and store inherited from this class that should make them share the index i think..

5544614
mouseup	mousedown
inside a mouse event handler mousedown mouseup mousemoved etc. you can ask the event for its locationinwindow

5544635
google-chrome	firefox
that is it displays the column names and a blank white area on firefox google-chrome and doesn t seem to display anything on ie6-8

5544707
gtk	motif
not only that but the same design has been chosen by windows forms .net gtk motif and various others

5544715
google-chrome	safari
i m using jscrollpane and i had some issues in google-chrome and safari with the height of the scrollable area

5544715
width	height
to make jscrollpane work i have to set height and width for any image inside the scrollable area

5544715
width	height
to avoid setting width and height manually i realized.

5544715
opera	safari
now calculates correctly the images styles and finally jscrollpane works in safari and opera

5544719
prepare	execute	prepare	pdostatement
in 2 you can use pdo to prepare pdostatement object and execute it passing arguments securely in second you can probably prepare this query and pass arguments but must read documentation how do this

5544721
google-chrome	firefox
ie-6-8 may not be liking the dangling comma at dataindex open_amount and any other syntax errors that firefox google-chrome would forgive

5544725
cpython	pypy
if so see panda3d numpy cpython and pypy

5544725
pyopengl	pyglet
use pyglet pyopengl with pyglet panda3d although you are writing in 2d you can still use a 3d engine or perhaps some other library

5544732
width	height
it won t solve your problem because width and height is calculated when the event is fired

5544732
width	height
if images are not loaded you re screwed width and height 0 or some pixels in ie

5544742
hide	show
call setlistvisible false to hide the list and setlistvisible true to show the list

5544807
allocator	stl
stl allocator follow the link for an introductory article on

5544807
allocator	stl
what stl allocator are and how to implement one

5544862
nsimage	nscursor
if one of the built-in cursors doesn t look how you need it to you can initialize a new nscursor with an nsimage and -set it to be the active cursor

5544864
put	get	post	get	post	put
also the content-type header is for specifying the media type of data sent to the server in a post or put request so you should just leave that one away for get requests

5544878
width	margin
i just noticed that you have the dropdowns wrapped in a div...you could modify that div the one with the class dropdown giving it a specific width 240px ish and that should center them since you ve already applied margin auto to that class

5544884
hash	md5
i am having a hell of a time trying to md5 hash this with php.

5544898
avaudioplayer	avfoundation
i would recommend avaudioplayer in the avfoundation

5544909
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
for example i ran into an issue using the tag - google-chrome and firefox worked like a charm but opera borked

5544920
uibaritem	uiresponder
if you look at each of their superclasses you will find that uibarbuttonitem inherits from uibaritem which inherits from nsobject not related at all to uibutton which from uiview and conforms to the uiresponder protocol

5544931
mp3	aiff
also - you don t want to use an mp3 for a sound you want to use a non-compressed file format i suggest aiff from experience because there isn t dedicated decoding hardware to support the sound decoding you re trying to do

5544964
width	height
if i remove display block - the caption shrinks to appropriate height but to small width

5544993
uiview	calayer
the uiview and the calayer s dealloc are both called but i can t tell for sure what order since the app using this has dozens and dozens of these cells - i guess i could change the nslog to display the cell s address in the console and match up a uiview dealloc and a calayer dealloc but i haven t bothered to do this

5545011
min	max
as to the second part of your question take the end value and use it as the start value of another slider you ll want to set that in the min and max values make the second start at the end of the first slider s max value

5545064
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is the same in firefox and google-chrome

5545076
uiactivityindicatorview	viewdidload
in your rootviewcontroller viewdidload method create and display a uiactivityindicatorview a spinner

5545191
free	malloc
the biggest mistake made with memory allocated by malloc is forgetting to free it when you are done with it

5545224
django	web.py
just really looking to develop a good build deployment strategy for python web applications written in mostly django web.py

5545230
implements	extends
the type parameter t of class bst is expected to extends actually implements -- thank you generics

5545253
int	chars
type casting will not change them in the slightest unless you change them to a narrower int type chars short

5545275
portrait	landscape
i am trying to give my uilabel dynamic height so that my layout of other labels looks correct in both landscape and portrait

5545275
portrait	landscape
in portrait my text wraps to the second line in landscape it does not

5545279
onchange	onkeyup
judging from your submitted code i m gonna assume it works but not for every key pressed because you need to use either onkeyup or onchange

5545296
onkeyup	onblur
unfocus is also not a valid event you are thinking of onblur but what you want is onkeyup

5545331
execvp	fork
i think i m doing all right using strtok to parse input and fork and execvp to run the processes but i m not doing all right implementing ncurses correctly

5545351
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
on each page i have a uinavigationbar with a uinavigationitem on set up through interface builder and set to take me back to my main view using the following code

5545376
post	get
i even tried changing post to get in insertdata and passing in the data manually

5545379
mp3	flv
don t get me wrong if you wanted to there are plenty of half-completed or basic mp3 encoding solutions out there as well as flv as referenced above but it s going to take invested time and effort to learn these file formats learn how these existing classes frameworks work learning to extend them and then stabilize and debug them

5545393
width	height
in your code as it is now in either orientation you will get the same width and height since you always pass a width of 300 to the sizewithfont method

5545399
accessor	properties
the reason works is that it is ruby s special syntax for properties accessor

5545431
free	malloc
just like you have one free statement for each element in the array plus a free for the array as a whole you should have one malloc for each element plus one malloc for the array as a whole

5545437
width	height
as far as i know you don t need to know the height and width of the final excel worksheet when populating a worksheet using php excel

5545508
children	parent
your treenode class keeps both a reference to its parent and its children

5545512
ubuntu	linux
the linux machine is running on ubuntu 10.04

5545533
for-loop	arrays
also if an exception is caught the next file in your arrays will be skipped because you have i++ in the catch block - you don t need that there because i will just get incremented again when execution returns to the top of the for-loop

5545565
min	max
i have been playing with min max array_values array_keys array_multisort

5545566
twos-complement	ones-complement
there are number of ways of doing that and the terms sign-magnitude twos-complement ones-complement and excess-n all refer to different way of doing that

5545596
prepare	execute
the first might be more commonly used because the documentation states that the typical method call sequence for a select statement is prepare execute fetch fetch .

5545599
atomic	compare-and-swap
iorefs and strefs are only safe in a multi-threaded setting when using atomicmodifyioref a compare-and-swap atomic operation

5545629
printf	fgets
look up fgets printf strings in c etc

5545634
children	parent
for this i started studying the van emde boas layout in a binary heap which led me to a blocked version of a binary heap where the trick is to calculate the children and parent indices

5545681
put	get
i could put all phone numbers in a listview and get the user to pick one

5545682
textarea	textbox
i have been successfully using onkeypress to determine whether or not enter was hit in a textbox or textarea but after adding a searchbar on me website i discovered that events like onkeypress are global ie

5545690
hash	md5
a simple method would be to use the md5 hash of all the sets of data for the record as your unique key

5545745
post	get
you should look at post redirect get to stop the resending of post data

5545752
content-disposition	content-type
i ve set the content-type to application vnd.ms-word and the content-disposition to attachment and specified the filename but no luck

5545767
hide	show
making the menu appear on hover is much harder because of the way popups steal focus you can show the menu but you can t easily hide it if they mouse over another menu

5545821
profiling	debugging
a good tool to debugging ef is the ef profiling

5545827
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the sites works and looks fine in ie safari and google-chrome but not in firefox and opera

5545827
opera	firefox
specifically in firefox and opera clicking the thumbnail picture or the title of the albums doesn t load the pictures in the left box as it should

5545837
filtering	grouping
in the project file we grouping the c++ files not only by h cpp but also by user-defined filtering so our project might look something like this

5545837
put	get
since our filters are always determined by the first part of the class name i was hoping to get away with only creating the .vcxproj file with message generation tool and modifying the .filters file to use wildcards to put the files in the correct filter

5545866
children	parent
the idea is to provide something similar to this caption bar across the top so the user can always see and interact with the currently selected object and immediate parent or children which may not always be obvious from the current view especially in 3d

5545880
folder	directory
if you go to the folder for default notebook location in windows explorer and create a directory it will automatically put a file open notebook.onetoc2 in the directory

5545881
ubuntu	linux
this question may be better suited to the linux ubuntu or whatever flavour of linux you have

5545889
children	parent
the parent will see that in an instant while it wasn t running both children died

5545904
integer	unsigned
the syntax to change the value of group_concat_max_len at runtime is as follows where val is an unsigned integer

5545917
swt	swing
while swt is nice gui its load time takes considerably a long period of time compared to netbeans swing

5545917
ubuntu	linux
apparently swing in linux at least on ubuntu 10.10 blows

5545934
cpu	processors
in order for the computer to tell the difference it has to be able to check the running process table at a point where a has terminated and b has not - if the os schedules removing process b from the process table immediately after process a then it could very easily be that no such code gets a chance to execute and so by some definitions it isn t possible for the computer to tell the difference - this sutation holds true even on a single core cpu processors

5545937
hide	show
simply hide all the child elements and trigger their show when the parent of an item is clicked

5545954
express	node.js
it is not a good idea to try to use express before learning node.js basics

5545956
post	get
if the view is supposed to be bookmarkable pass the person id as a get request parameter instead of a post request parameter

5545969
hide	show
you could by using jquery show and hide these links

5546056
client-side	server-side
that usually means that your client-side code actually is triggering all those individual requests but only the last one is completing possibly due to how your server-side handles simultaneous requests from the same session

5546083
versioning	upgrade
i m writing a c# application that upgrade client machines from one application versioning to another

5546132
ucfirst	capitalize
ucfirst simply capitalize the first letter of the string

5546139
uploadify	swfupload
i don t want to deal with flash sessions using swfupload and uploadify because i need to do uploads that only authenticated users can do

5546141
versioning	upgrade
the upgrade placed the new versioning in the usr local bin directory

5546159
folder	directory
rather than ask him to update his library version this is a software customer so i can t assume they ll be willing or able to change system files i would like to ship the appropriate version of libstdc++.so placed in a lib folder with the directory location of my code

5546203
width	height
set the viewbox attribute to encompass the area of the content in local svg coordinates you want to display but set the height and width attributes of the svg to the number of pixels you want it to be displayed as on the web page

5546257
firefox	safari
because we can t see the source code enable the developer tools in safari - preferences advanced show develop menu in menu bar - or use firebug with firefox or as standalone and use the error console to find what js is loading what s conflicting and the errors

5546270
width	height
this is not acceptable to the compiler to do a release it throws errors saying it can t parse the width height values

5546270
width	height
my flash files are being embedded on the web and i just need the width and height attributes defining the bounds of the flash content to be respected by the swf

5546270
width	height
so the width and height attributes are being explicitly set to numbers here

5546270
width	height
and to be clear it will work as expected if i set the swf meta tag to have width 100 and height 100 .

5546288
post	get
i ve seen several post related to this issue but still can t get the following to work

5546296
children	parent
this also means that if all the children of the same parent are of the same element type for example in the case of a table body whose only children are tr elements or a list element whose only children are li elements then nth-child and nth-of-type will behave identically for every value of an+b nth-child an+b and nth-of-type an+b will match the same set of elements

5546299
sudo	passwd
i am assuming this is because my script is using sudo which requires a passwd

5546344
getattr	subclassing
if swig s_ getattr _ functions for myclass could be customized then perhaps unknown attributes could be stored and loaded from an internal pyobject either by having swig subclassing myclass automatically or by having such an object already present in myclass

5546346
width	height
there doesn t seem to be width and height for text elements

5546368
implements	extends
in java each class can only extends 1 other class but it can implements as many interfaces as it want

5546376
for-loop	arrays
and perhaps it would be better to use the following expression in for-loop as it will guard you from possible different lengths of arrays

5546377
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i have a spring project using log4j on linux debian ubuntu and rhel

5546397
google-chrome	firefox
i m having a strange problem where my div background is not displayed in firefox and google-chrome but appears perfectly fine in ie

5546397
google-chrome	firefox
not sure if this is vital information but i also apply the area class on another div calling a different background image and that background image is displayed fine on all ie firefox and google-chrome

5546408
serializable	deserialization
my guess is that this doesn t handle the serializable and deserialization correctly

5546408
serializable	deserialization
if this is the case you ll have to handle the serializable and deserialization yourself

5546450
google-chrome	firefox
my problem now is it work only on google-chrome and firefox then when run in ie has this unknown runtime error

5546450
google-chrome	firefox
so when i click the link this content will load new data it works in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie inside the loaddata i have this

5546454
google-chrome	firefox
it does not appear in firefox or google-chrome

5546473
implements	extends
any class that extends an abstract class or implements an interface must implements all abstract and interface methods or else must be declared abstract

5546479
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i d like something that works in at least ie7 8 firefox 2 3 google-chrome and safari

5546487
jobs	cron
currently i do it in a really messy fashion by just scheduling two cron jobs like this

5546490
children	parent
there is no natural way for the parent container to resize dynamically to your absolutely positioned children because the children are outside of the flow

5546490
children	parent
if you insist on doing absolute positioning and need the parent container to match the height of the children you will have to resort to javascript

5546507
post	get
try this code on for size i might get some references wrong with those parent prev if you can t figure it out post the errors

5546516
super	abstract
these methods are defined as abstract methods in the abstract super class

5546516
implements	extends
if the parent class is abstract the extends class must implements any of those abstract methods in the parent

5546526
margin	height
after the read more is clicked you can calculate the height of the surrounding and add or animate the top margin of #barino_left_body to half the surrounding height plus half the height of #barino_left_body

5546588
g++	gcc
error is so g++ gcc 4.x treats the string as const void but how that msvc treats it

5546601
int	double
note the thresholding done above accounts for the possibility that the black-and-white image could be of type double with values of either 0 or 1 logical also with values of either 0 or 1 or an unsigned 8-bit int with values of either 0 or 255

5546631
g++	gcc
i have cygwin installed with make gcc g++ gdb

5546643
coff	omf
they are normally in the common object file format coff but they can be in the object module format omf too for older compilers

5546661
mouseover	mousemove
however i m not able to use the mouseover with the iphone and mousemove doesn t seem to work either

5546675
put	get
edit well im just trying to get the hash from a url via javascript then put that in a php script

5546687
notepad++	textpad
the easiest would be to do this with grep in linux or some program in windows that has a good search replace function like notepad++ or textpad

5546696
post	get
the parameters will be encoded into the url no post only a get for a script

5546733
width	height
if it doesn t you could switch to using a relativelayout and make the first element a button with this selector as the background and fill_parent for its layout width and height

5546759
google-chrome	firefox
to fix the problem i played with some relative positioning inside the containing div but this is causing positioning discrepancies between firefox and google-chrome

5546773
phpmyadmin	sqlbuddy
try installing an older version of phpmyadmin or try the sqlbuddy

5546815
folder	dir
note you will also need the markers found here and here - and place in a folder in the same dir as code called mapicons

5546843
google-chrome	safari
curl is able to post the request successfully and safari and google-chrome both run the application fine

5546855
post	get
i ll try and touch up the recursive functions and post what i get

5546913
int	chars
note that getchar returns an int and not a chars

5546928
width	height
full answer as metadata the width and height that get compiled into a swf are essentially suggestions

5546928
width	height
but when you display the swf embedded in a web page the width height metadata gets ignored entirely and the swf s size is determined similarly to all the other elements in your page by the embedding html css and so on

5546928
width	height
the height width metadata we ve been talking about is used as that size

5546958
width	height
set your swf tag to the proper aspect ratio in pixels and then use 100 as your width and height in the embed code on your page

5546984
uitableview	reloaddata
you could call the reloaddata method on the uitableview within that tableviewcontroller

5546996
acs	adfs
also just a small detail there s no synching between adfs v2 and acs just a trust relationship

5547011
fontfamily	font-size
it is likely geoserver not support tag because event i try to change font-size fontfamily or

5547014
jar	war
the project is one war and 2 jar projects

5547030
jsf	stripes
if you are actually up to it i suggest you to look into any of these frameworks prettyfaces for jsf and stripes

5547062
width	height
set your a tags as block give them a width float them then on page load iterate through them to find the tallest one then iterate through them a second time adding the necessary top and bottom padding to get them all to look the same height visually

5547073
super	extends
the nicer way extends djangotestsuiterunner and override setup_test_environment to call super and then create your legacy table manually in the test db

5547082
firefox	safari
i get the following error in firefox firebug but not in safari

5547091
organization	naming
sure it has integrated support for subversion but it s still just a svn client and the user still needs to know how to branch how to merge how to resolve conflicts what the conventions are for creating branches and naming tags and such in your organization etc

5547109
button	checkbox
so i have a application that uses checkbox and radio button to scan a computer for virus then have each anti virus create a log of its actions

5547146
expander	grid
i have a silverlight expander control which wraps a grid

5547309
min	max
for what you re describing you re going to be forced to select either the min or max zip code

5547414
width	height
you have given x 150 y 100 and height and width is 0.

5547414
width	height
you image s height and image s width is 0 right now.

5547434
versioning	upgrade
installed monodevelop ran it and upgrade to latest versioning 2.4.2

5547470
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it needs to be compatible with ie7 and above and of course all the good browsers like firefox google-chrome and safari

5547496
rss	feed
one of them gets its data from core data the other from an rss feed

5547496
rss	feed
i can get all of this to work nicely except with the rss feed based list view

5547619
google-chrome	safari
it looks like webkit is the only reliable engine that supports it google-chrome and safari

5547622
width	height
but it is true -- try moving all the width and height border attributes into css -- that s where they belong

5547649
super	self
it seems as though self within initwithframe of subclassview is still set to the super someclassview

5547673
google-chrome	firefox
i don t see any discrepencies between firefox and google-chrome

5550036
printf	fgetc
so basically i have a bug that is affected by the observer effect out of quantum physics when i try to observe the chars i get from fgetc via printf the problem early eof termination at 24 disappears but when i stop viewing it the error-catch statement reports early termination

onchange	keyup	keydown	keyup
you could keep the current page name action identifier in a session variable then use a javascript onchange load keyup keydown to request the current state of the user from the server

5557023
inherited	properties
i have create a class that inherited from bindinglist of t and i added a properties

5557031
put	get
so with blob what you put in is what you get

5557031
put	get
with text what you put may not be what you get out

5557046
postgresql	mysql
i run mysql on my local dev machine and have spent a little while updating some of my scopes to work in postgresql

5557057
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
this can be done because uinavigationcontroller is a subclass of uiviewcontroller

5557159
post	put
i have seen on other stackoverflow post where they had a large amount of dashes before some number then the put their form data

5557169
button	checkbox
i have to do a listview with checkbox and then display the checked and unchecked items when user presses the button

5557175
post	get
it seems to work ie i get separate comment thread per post

5557186
ironruby	ironpython
i think you would do better using .net compatible dynamic language like ironpython or ironruby

5557192
listview	gridview
for example choose listview instead of gridview

5557308
pop-up	dialog
don t try to pop-up a big dialog when your app is not in the foreground that would be utterly intrusive

5557462
udp	rtp
with rtp or live streams this happens a lot since udp will drop packets

5557486
postgresql	mysql
i was wondering if postgresql had a feature like sql_cache in mysql

5557486
postgresql	mysql
for example in mysql i can do a query like select sql_cache product_id product_name product_sku from products i want to know if i can do something similar in postgresql

5557497
portrait	landscape
in portrait i want to show four columns with six rows and in landscape i want six columns with four rows

5557547
put	get
but i don t know how to get the name field from the related table to put in the dropdown so i have the vendorid as the value and text

5557581
typedef	struct
in the struct vplist you have a pointer to a vpptr - one more reason to distrust such pointer typedef

5557592
min	max
if you want to limit it you can use min and max

5557628
int	double	int	boolean	int	chars
if you define an array of embedded types int chars boolean double .

5557656
memcpy	memset
so second memcpy should be replaced with memset instead

5557689
versioning	upgrade
upgrade are in separate sql files which can upgrade existing dbs from a specific versioning to a newer one run sequentially

5557720
thin	unicorn	apache	nginx
to achieve that level of flexibility you may need to look into some kind of reverse-proxy setup involving a stand-alone app server like thin unicorn or mongrel running behind apache or nginx

5557729
post	put
if none of this works post some additional code or put the website public somewhere where we can take a closer look

5557747
apache	nginx
basically what it is saying is that you should use apache using mod_wsgi to serve your django application and use a more lightweight web server like nginx to serve up your static content

5557747
apache	nginx
by separating your concerns you can configure your apache instance to be your dump truck handing the heavy processing and your nginx server to be light and fast like a racecar serving lots of little static files

5557747
apache	nginx
if you configure nginx so that it handles all web traffic you can reverse proxy all django requests to apache behind it and intercept all of the static files and serve those strait from nginx

5557785
hide	show
when the form gets successfully submitted just hide the form element and show the message which is initially hidden

5557785
hide	show
and then later just show the form element and hide the message

5557812
rss	feed
i m using asmx web services in sharepoint and had a need for an asmx method to correctly respond to a head request apparently the itunes store does a head request to your rss feed url before doing a get request to download the feed

5557823
google-chrome	firefox
this may force it to only show at that particular size in firefox as well as google-chrome and internet explorer

5557832
hide	show
i can hide show move and resize columns without triggering an alert

5557878
min	max
i tested on a table with exactly one blank row and specific orders that i could verify both an auto-increment field and a value that i checked by using min and max and access chose to return some other value as last

5557921
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this prevents the page from loading in a frame in ie8+ and newer versions of firefox opera and google-chrome the exact version numbers escape me at the moment

5557934
richfaces	icefaces
ajax is optional or if you could use a variant of jsf like icefaces or richfaces then the framework will do most of the heavy lifting for you

5557958
mvp	presenter
another good example is mvp - model view presenter

5557990
paradox	dbase
.idx could be paradox dbase iv or foxpro among probably others if it s an actual vendor s extension for an index

5557990
paradox	dbase
it s not access dbase paradox or dataflex just a check because it used .dat for an extension

5558000
min	max
if you set the min and max the same as the width normal wms will disallow resizing

5558018
post	get
when a movie is clicked i have a jquery live event to get the click post to the action get the data and then a callback function to take the data and place it in a modal pop-up

5558052
extendscript	jsx
i m trying to integrate a web service that serves png images into photoshop using jsx extendscript

5558116
google-chrome	firefox
this looks fine in ie7 google-chrome firefox but not in ie6

5558118
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox 4 among other applications now put some of their user interface in the title bar

5558132
post	get
i was using the httpwebrequest s defualt method value which is get and i should be using post for a few reasons including the conquering the length of the request issue

5558132
post	get
the alternative to the get method is the post method

5558141
spaces	linefeed
this will check to make sure the string isn t empty then runs a simple loop to remove the left-most character as long as it is either a cr chr 13 linefeed chr 10 or a spaces

5558141
spaces	linefeed
once the loop hits the first character that doesn t match the criteria it stops and you have the desired result of trimming all extra cr linefeed and spaces characters only from the beginning of the string

5558151
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

5558188
inherited	subclassing
my class wctreenode inherited from wcobject which is a subclassing of nsobject

5558190
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction circuitry

5558190
subtract	add
determine whether to add or subtract

5558195
width	height
solved the problem by adding a spinner in my xml with height and width set to zero

5558263
int	double
if you want to compare double and int it may be tough

5558263
int	double
one cast the double to an int and compare

5558263
int	double
two cast the int to a double and compare

5558343
post	get
then in the blackberry use standard http requests to send get post requests to the proxy page

5558374
int	chars
for example field user name is 32 chars or less age must be an int greater than 21 etc

5558391
junit	jsunit	put	get
as far as the actual testing library i would like it to be similar to n junit i know there is jsunit but it doesnt seem like it can be used in the way i want i did find a different version of jsunit 1.3 which can be used with ant but it seemed to be an awful lot of work to get it put into nant

5558429
georss	kml
a kmllayer adds geographic markup to the map from a kml kmz or georss file that is hosted on a publicly accessible web server

5558464
jax-ws	jax-rs
it is unclear to me if it is better to create a mule translator for the service which understands the protocol and delegates to generate an appropriate response or just create two class interfaces using jax-rs jax-ws annotations to the service

5558485
typedef	struct
there is nothing wrong with also defining your struct in that header file complete with typedef

5558549
post	get
however when i execute the ajax post method i get the following error

5558549
post	put
and i put a special flag in params to identify post from the ajax call

5558569
folder	directory
i wish to keep my resources in a folder within my project directory

5558591
google-chrome	firefox
i m too lazy to go looking at google-chrome and firefox s source to find out exactly what they did but it most likely includes custom handling for wm_ncpaint and wm_nchittest

5558592
google-chrome	firefox
it has to work in ie8 firefox google-chrome no ie7 or earlier

5558592
google-chrome	firefox
but i can not get rid of the horizontal scrollbar in firefox or google-chrome ie8 is ok

5558597
division	subtraction
well division is subtraction so yes

5558604
portrait	landscape
you may also want to put some buttons on the right in landscape mode and in the bottom of your layout in portrait

5558646
int	double
i would like to calculate 1.0-p n where p is a double between 0 and 1 often very close to 0 and n is a positive int that might be on the order of hundreds or thousands perhaps larger

5558667
portrait	landscape
when you click the button to open the same page in a new tab the orientation is wrong if you are not in the default mode android 2.2 the default mode or 0 angle is portrait in android 3.0 the 0 angle is landscape but once you rotate to the other mode and then back the orientation works

5558677
serializable	deserialization
however function serializable deserialization is unreliable because it is implementation-dependent

5558685
arraylist	treeset
i know i could just store the objects in an arraylist and use binary search to find the object but this wouldn t be as fast as just searching the treeset

5558695
thin	unicorn	passenger	unicorn	passenger	thin
you can also use passenger standalone as a replacement for the thin mongrel unicorn reverse proxy setup that bioneuralnet has mentioned

5558698
uitabbaritem	uibaritem
changing the title of a uibaritem superclass of uitabbaritem needs to be done before the item is added to a bar per apple docs

5558741
comparator	comparable
you should either implement comparable on your object or create a separate comparator class that you pass in at the time treeset is constructed

5558761
comparator	comparable
you got the answer about using comparable comparator but i thought i would add that you are right that contains does a binary search though you shouldn t need to know those details

5558773
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is not in my monitor s clear type settings since ie 9 in compatibility mode firefox and google-chrome all render text nicely

5558848
safariwatir	firewatir
watir has different many different drivers watir firewatir safariwatir chromewatir operawatir and now watir-webdriver

5558864
puts	gets
processor gets items from unprocessed messages processes them via a lambda function argument and puts them into a queue processed messages

5558871
portrait	landscape
i have an android application i would like to know if i can have 1 layout 1 layout xml file for both landscape and portrait mode

5558874
inline-functions	inlining
when there are pointers to an inline-functions internally by the compiler or externally by the programmer the inlining may not be used

5558880
folder	directory
in the case described in your comment you are including files under xfolder and only excluding files under the current directory since your exclude doesn t also specify xfolder so basically unless xfolder happens to be the current folder you aren t excluding anything

5558940
tostring	gethashcode
otherwise without these flags you will get all methods defined on the type like tostring gethashcode and even printmethodnames

5558945
ant	maven
a task to build and deploy your war file locally ant maven etc.

5558945
profiling	debugging
to debugging your project in intellij ce you ll need to spend some time setting up a run profiling to launch your application server

5558945
getter	setter
even with that stuff set-up you ll still be missing any convenience features specific to web development beans won t automatically show links to relevant xml configurations getter setter used for dependency injection will probably show unused method warnings etc.

5558951
ccscene	cclayer
yes create the menu in the - id init of ccscene subclass or cclayer subclass as the following tutorials

5558954
post	get
a get or post parameter named next by default though it is possible to customize

5559027
typedef	struct
in the second example the huffcode_ isn t even necessary since the struct type is already named by the typedef

5559027
typedef	struct
in very old compilers it may be useful to give the struct a different name than is used in the typedef

5559036
portrait	landscape
with this method you would use the same layout for both landscape and portrait

5559054
typedef	struct
a lot of the time in straight c people like to typedef their struct so that they don t look so ugly

5559054
typedef	struct
so they name the struct itself something ugly and the typedef something clean

5559069
integer	unsigned
in this case i m simply writing long unsigned integer sequence into a sequence of arrays and loading each array sequence into hdf5 as they are created

5559092
haskell	ocaml
most real-world implementation of probability dsl however use a more concrete representation such as a list of pair haskell probability library and ocaml hansei

5559132
des	aes
aes is the successor of des as standard symmetric encryption algorithm for us federal organizations and as standard for pretty much everybody else too

5559132
3des	aes
using a block cipher properly is not easy and it is more important than selecting between aes or 3des

5559146
min	max
so i want to find min and max values from these points set

5559183
pop-up	dialog
so i would like to check the ajax call from the tab and see if it is a validation error json response and if has validation errors stop loading the tab and pop-up a dialog box

5559188
rvm	bundler
in this type of environment not all ruby processes run under the same user so i think that s where things get unclear as far as rvm and bundler are concerned

5559202
int	double	int	chars
also among native types only the ones that are common the word common may not be correct here. to .net double int chars chars not chars etc

5559242
allocator	stl
of course in c++ the point quickly becomes moot for the actual storage volumes since stl containers vector list map et friends do their element allocator dynamically anyway 1

5559247
hide	show
clicking hide the others and show the new one

5559277
disk	ram
you then want to test with real world operation it s difficult to predict what combination of ram disk and network activity will slow you down

5559286
postgresql	mysql
both postgresql and mysql support it

5559289
hide	show
you could hide the non-target divs manually show below but i think hiding them all is a good approach

5559311
rss	feed
i was transforming an rss feed which uses the following date format mon 04 apr 2011 23 18 00 -0700

5559344
put	get
if you put in the listview either focusable or clickable views then the your onitemclicklistener won t get called

5559344
implements	extends
what you can do in this case is to implements a custom adapter just extends arrayadapter and add an onclicklistener to every view you provide for the listview

5559387
minimum	max
if the definition of order is the minimum number of keys of a non-root node then the answer to the max is unknown

5559407
pop-up	dialog
when a picture is selected a custom dialog pop-up

5559439
width	height
these methods work pretty much by giving the font a size of 0 so it occupies no height or width

5559465
lisp	scheme
i don t really use common lisp but i d do it like this in scheme

5559500
wordpress	joomla
and it can be argued that most of the cmss you will be connecting with wordpress joomla allow arbitrary execution of php code in the back-end anyway

5559520
trie	dawg
i would suggest that given your desire to also search through the stored string values you should consider whether either a trie structure such as a patricia trie or for even better memory amortisation a directed acyclic word graph refered to affctionalty as a dawg would work better

5559520
trie	dawg
if you specifically wish to retain an ordering of the strings with some lexicographical manner so you need only consider one character or code point at a time then the patricia trie is likely to be the preferable option implementing the ordering on top of the dawg would be problematic

5559526
width	height
basically you would start with a font height smaller than the height of your textview and then iterate or do a binary search through fonts of varying sizes until you find one that measures to smaller than the width of your textview

5559535
folder	directory
4 with everything you ve done you re head is back at and your index is as well but in your working directory you now have the changes from repo a that you ve been looking for as well as the potential for files outside of the wireless_dir folder

5559589
profiling	instrumentation
with the time profiling instrumentation make sure it s set to all sample counts rather than running sample times under sample perspective

5559703
opera	google-chrome
bug does not appear in my google-chrome or opera testing

5559710
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
otherwise i would need to write a for-loop to check each arrays indice and then somehow make a decision statement whether to go through loops and print take input

5559734
winpcap	pcap.net
in terms of winpcap the choice seems to be between pcap.net and sharppcap

5559773
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
on mousedown record your mouse position and line position and register a mousemove handler closed around those starting positions and register a mouseup handler to remove the mousemove handler

5559843
width	height
scale the image while preserving its intrinsic aspect ratio if any to the largest size such that both its width and its height can fit inside the background positioning area

5559843
width	height
scale the image while preserving its intrinsic aspect ratio if any to the smallest size such that both its width and its height can completely cover the background positioning area

5559927
cos	sin
so you want sin and cos not cos and tan

5559928
cos	sin
firstly you want cos and sin not cos and tan

5559948
maven	pom.xml
the maven release plugin is defined at the company level of pom.xml file which is parent of mywebproduct

5560008
pull	push
well i used to be able to push and pull with heroku but it just asked me to upgrade taps so i did

5560009
for-loop	arrays
which would work best initializer list or for-loop initialization since when an arrays is created each element of that arrays is automatically initialized to the default value

5560034
portrait	landscape
my app currently displays the launch image in portrait mode then switches to landscape so the image is on its side then launches the app

5560034
portrait	landscape
make it display it in landscape mode not portrait

5560056
apache	nginx
see how that all goes and only when apache itself looks not to be enough then look to using another server to handle media the preferred arrangement being to use nginx to handle static media with nginx also acting as proxy through to apache mod_wsgi

5560056
apache	nginx
using nginx in front actually allows apache mod_wsgi to perform better which using nginx on a separate domain will not

5560155
oncreate	ondestroy
only when you use oncreate to create a service you should worry about ondestroy

5560166
try-catch	exception-handling
tha catch keywork stands for the second way when you write some code that can maybe cause unexpected behaviour you can surround this code with a try-catch block just like the example above if the method call throw an exception-handling object of the type inside the catch clause all the remaining code in the try block will be skipped and the code in the catch block will be executed

5560173
width	height
and the reason i didnt get anything appearing on the screen was because the values for width and height werent actually set so when it set the projection it set it to 0 by 0 or something strange like that

5560198
uiview	subviews
maybe this isn t the most elegant answer but my solution was to make a uiview which is the size i want for the table view and then add the table view as a subviews

5560202
sorting	grouping
i then added a sort on the grouping on this calculated field which isn t shown in the report and gives the impression that those items with a date get ordered and the rest are left to the other layers of sorting which is correct

5560213
ubuntu	debian
in the debian and hence ubuntu package the directory usr local lib r site-library is created by the file var lib dpkg info r-base-core.postinst script -- and the relevant code is

5560213
ubuntu	debian
the r-sig-debian list is a friendly place for debian ubuntu questions like this and i recommend it

5560213
ubuntu	debian
edit also a fair number of more complicated packages are part of ubuntu debian so to get xml you can just to sudo apt-get install r-cran-xml

5560214
dictionary	map
i m not very familiar with hashmaps but i want to read the files from the dictionary into a hash map

5560224
apache	nginx
because this is heroku you cannot use apache or nginx configs

5560250
int	chars
your other hurdle is that the first chars of the serial is a string not an int so you would want to take the int of the first chars

5560283
strcpy	memmove
if you need this string at the beginning of the char array itself you can use memmove after the above code to shift the string over strcpy won t work since the ranges overlap

5560292
git-rebase	amend	squash	branch
you have free reign to amend commits squash them git-rebase branch around all of those ways that git provide to fix the inevitable oversights we make while developing

5560328
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this in firefox 3+ and ie8+ works but doesn t appear to work in google-chrome 5+

5560384
tablelayoutpanel	picturebox
assuming this is winforms and you have a bunch of picturebox es in cells of a tablelayoutpanel set each one s dock to fill and sizemode to stretchimage

5560394
disk	ram
in order to build these systems i am given 60 duo-core machines each with 1gb of ram 1.5tb disk

5560403
express	node.js
you can certainly do the exact same the other way around using standard node.js routing or something like express and an http client for ruby such as typhoeus

5560413
getter	setter
this creates getter and setter for you automatically making the class more extensible if you decide to change the way a property works perhaps you want to change it to always be calculated on the fly the public interface of the class does not need to change

5560414
google-chrome	firefox
although if we are discussing css there is a syntax for specifying hsl hsla for ie9 google-chrome firefox

5560424
post	get
when i request the get post method the response is 200 ok

5560445
getter	setter
that will make the synthesized setter and getter methods for your latitude property change your _latitude ivar

5560481
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have tested it in safari firefox and google-chrome as well as firefox on windows all of these work fine i hover over the links menu and it drops down

5560516
getter	setter
but if you misstated your request and want the latitude property to access the coordinate s latitude rather than the _latitude ivar it s a simple matter of writing custom getter and setter methods

5560522
accessor	properties
there is no magical bind in objective-c what you could do instead of synthesizing properties is writing accessor which is what synthesize really do at compilation in fact something like that

5560523
disk	ram
i am using a network of 60 core-duo machines each with 1gb ram and 1.5tb disk

5560525
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql can certainly handle the load and table partitioning might be desirable in this scenario as well since your dealing with time ranges

5560574
inline	inlining
the exception is if you have any anti-piracy code inlining that or even using macros to ensure it s inline can help remove a single point of failure

5560615
hide	show
so i wanted to hide the contents in div#content when search button is clicked and show again when reset button is clicked

5560625
listview	gridview
i have a listview gridview with multiple columns and so far i can sort it by column alphabetically but when i m sorting a-z empty strings show up at the top

5560655
spaces	delimiter
i am developing an application which requires a text box with auto-complete suggestions drop down for multiple words separated by a delimiter like spaces like the tags text box here in stackoverflow

5560656
hide	show
i have a scenario where i need to show a bunch of buttons only when any of a group of input fields contains a value and hide the buttons when all of the input fields are empty

5560656
hide	show
can t come up with an elegant way to do that other than by attaching some code to the focus event of the input fields to check their content and show hide accordingly

5560660
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this is happening on every browser ie google-chrome opera and firefox even in full screen 1680x1050

5560681
portrait	landscape
if the changes to the ui between portrait and landscape orientations are so drastically different that it wouldn t be feasible to adjust in code you may want to create separate xibs for each orientation and load the right one when the device changes orientation

5560710
width	height
get the height and width from the newly created label e.target.width e.target.height in the function listening to the creation of label

5560710
width	height
set the displayobjects in the above case canvas height and width to these values then proceed to add the sprite and textflow

5560714
move	drag
settable as a rate of in px sec- with the option to apply easing functions...there is a maximum px sec that the page can slide move drag

5560733
16-bit	64bit
another example is if the data type is .short 16-bit or 2 4 then each element of the array contains 64bit 2 6

5560754
google-chrome	firefox
if i do the same in google-chrome none scroll is created but in firefox the registration page has a frame in the bottom of the page - is created a horizontal scroll

5560837
post	get
now i need to get this data to post with the product_addtocart_form form so i can save their selection with the order and access it on the checkout page receipt

5560873
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the forum renders correctly in ie8+ firefox google-chrome and safari but not ie 7

5560911
google-chrome	firefox
the app still works in google-chrome firefox and ie8

5560935
portrait	landscape
i am writing an app that requires my program to know the difference between whether it is in landscape mode or in portrait

5560955
rss	feed
we re doing a site with user generated rss feed which can be viewed by other users who we accounts and are verified by the source user

5560958
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
objectinputstream expects a header in the stream that is written by objectoutputstream

5560958
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
as your sample doesn t really need objectoutputstream you may just want to not use objectinputstream

5560982
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
not sure why this fixed it but i moved my scripts to the bottom in front of and now it s working in firefox google-chrome and safari

5560983
portrait	landscape
according to the reference it can either be portrait square or landscape only

int	chars
int as if they are type signed chars by

5566318
fgets	getline
it s possible to implement getline but not the more powerful getdelim as a very fast efficient wrapper around fgets so if you re willing to do that as a fallback using getline doesn t really make your program any less portable

5566318
fgetc	getline
also of course both getline and getdelim can simply be implemented on top of flockfile funlockfile and fgetc

5566334

apart from what s already been discussed making ones a private static atomicinteger and adding a getter setter pair i made both members final which is always advisable if possible especially in concurrent code

5566421
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
my jquery script which does a lot of dom manipulation works smoothly in google-chrome expected runs very well in safari and not so badly in firefox

5566429
hide	show
an alternative approach would be to use a css media query to show hide content on your site when it s being printed

hide	show
if you do not return any data then hide a table that show the data and show a text field containing no corresponding data for the selected parameters

i don t know expect4j but i assume you can feed it a pair of inputstream and outputstream - then use getinputstream instead of setoutputstream here

5566624
goto	break
if by context you mean for example that the macro argument and or the macro body might contain a break or goto and hence needs to be inside the lexical scope of the caller then you can t use a functor or a lambda

5566700
int	chars
106 chars as long you don t care about int function and accept a float

5566714

here jsf will search for getter setter of the field elements in java.util.hashmap which doesn t exist and so the error

5566884

if it were me i d use a daemons scheduled job to fetch the mail - while you could write your own in php i d just use fetchmail and cron to get the email off the remote systemd then either mirror it in a local mailbox or feed it through procmail

5566896
datamapper	activerecord
to add to dave jarvis and jasonbar answers i usually have datamapper to convert between relational data and objects instead of using an activerecord approach

5567278
versioning	upgrade
have you recently upgrade from an older versioning

5567300
children	parent
one way to avoid using extra memory much extra anyway is to manipulate the tree as you traverse it -- as you traverse downward through nodes you make a copy of its pointer to one of the children then reverse that to point back to the parent

5567300
children	parent
when you ve gotten to the bottom you follow the links back up to the parent and as you go you reverse them to point back to the children

5567307
width	margin
if i shrink the width of the select it cuts off the selected option but leaves the margin

5567361

in particular interfaces members cannot be declared with the modifiers abstract public protected internal private virtual override or static

5567454
hide	show
i need to hide or show a div that have a slideshow inside

5567454

the idea is to give to the users a link for them to hide or show the div

5567454
hide	show
after the user clicks on the link to hide show the div i will like to call a second file

5567457
folder	directory
also it would have to be done recursively because the directory tree is somewhat deep and can also be subject to change at the lower branches so i would have to monitor the following at every folder level or alternatively monitor the modified time of the folder and then scan to find out what happened

5567457
folder	directory
it seems clear to me that keeping a database of the relevant file and folder information is the appropriate course of action on the query side of things but keeping that database synchronized with the actual state of the file system under the directory of concern will be the challenge

5567471
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode	tostring	referenceequals	referenceequals	gethashcode

5567834
memcpy	realloc
would realloc do memcpy in this case

5567865
hash	md5
there are also other hash functions but some are cryptographically broken md5 so depending on your situation you may or may not want to try them

5567901
switching	screens
on the first pass you draw to a and then switching the view to the a buffer which is painted on the screens

5567901
switching	screens
on the second pass since a is now the screens view you draw to b and then switching the view to the b buffer

5567901
switching	screens
you switching buffers because otherwise you would actually need a b and a screens buffer that is copied to from a or b

5567910
x86	64bit
it defaults to x86 so you ll run in 32-bit mode even on a 64bit operating system

5567919
memcpy	realloc
it wouldn t do a memcpy -- that s only necessary when the realloc size is larger and there s no room to expand

5567924
avd	galaxy
you can actually download a samsung component via avd that contains a configuration for galaxy tabs

ubuntu	linux
in linux ubuntu

5568347
post	get
yo dont need to post or get or anything enough a simple request

5568358
mouse	keyboard
maybe checking for whether it is locked or can a winform application tell when the mouse and keyboard is being used even when the winform is not the active window

5568358
mouse	keyboard
addendum i will assume that if the mouse and keyboard are not being used a person is not using that particular box so this would cause a false positive if the user is watching a movie on their computer this program will be used in an office setting so the possibility of this happening on a particular day is nearly zero

5568384
button	checkbox
my code for the checkbox button image like

5568388
auto-generate	edmx
the reason for this is that the xml formatted edmx file is always completely auto-generate when the model is updated or created from the database

5568391
onkeyup	onkeydown
use the onkeydown events to trigger each response and onkeyup events to finish them

5568400
oncreate	findviewbyid
in your oncreate method use findviewbyid r.id.my_fragment to locate the fragment placeholder

5568404
interpreted-language	compiled-language
remember that templating systems for interpreted-language have to take extra precautions to solve vulnerabilities you won t find with a compiled-language

5568412
memcached	apc
caching isn t really an option because most of the servers don t have neither memcached nor apc installed

5568415
mouse	keyboard
you can set up global hooks for the mouse and keyboard - wh_keyboard_ll and wh_mouse_ll - which will allow you to monitor user activity - as long as your user is not say watching a film and not touching mouse or keyboard

5568421
min	max	range	max	range	min
integer in the range min max

5568422
mouse	keyboard
the way i d think about doing it would be to write an application that sits in the background and listens for mouse and keyboard messages using the user32.dll and assumes that the user is no longer using the computer if it doesn t hear any after a certain amount of time

5568484
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this technique avoids the extra http request and is confirmed to work in recent versions of google-chrome firefox and opera on windows 7

5568489

5568526
mvp	presenter
it turns out that an activity takes the role of a presenter in the mvp design pattern

5568528
rss	feed
one note that probably won t matter to you is that without a server backing this up the content can t really send you back any info but it can get dynamic info that comes from say rss feed or wcf services hosted on the web

5568556
calloc	malloc
even better to use calloc instead of malloc

5568578
move	drag
but when i drag the clone the original div is move instead

5568590
postgresql	mysql
postgresql and mysql have many features in common but different ways of using those features

5568590
postgresql	mysql
for one example postgresql and mysql both support auto-incrementing id numbers but they use different reserved words and technologies to implement those id numbers

5568590
postgresql	mysql
if the postgresql file uses any of mysql s reserved words as a table or column name you ll need to guard it with backticks

5568635
ready	each
for a while my company had a branching strategy that said that each project got its own branch tested off of that branch and when we were ready to deploy to production we merged all the branches to be included in that release compiled and deployed

uiview	subviews
now iâ d like to add a subviews to an uiview accessing the array via an index

5568668
acs	adfs
acs is still labs so not many production systems have gone live so in terms of actual cases you will find more adfs - ping

installing rather than upgrading an earlier versioning is successful however if i upgrade i get the following entries in a verbose log

5568734
folder	directory
that includes the windows directory as well as the program files folder and any of the folder it contains

5568749
width	margin
i am in a situation where can t use padding to bring the width in because borders still go to the edge and i can t use margin because i need the background colour to go to the edge

5568766
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
savefiledialog and openfiledialog always uses last saved opened folder

5568784
mouse	keyboard
they will use the mouse and keyboard to interact with the page and any javascript is going to be a result of scripts that execute when the page is loaded or as a result of scripts triggered via events based on specific user actions

5568793
subtraction	addition
my requirements are lots of vector maths addition subtraction scale cross prod and dot prod also i need to be able to pass my vector as a float so that opengl can make use of it

in the grails url mappings i am trying to map by method type get post etc etc

5568985
django-registration	django-userena
any idea if there is an app like django-registration or django-userena which allows calling such methods without any hacking in the code

5569031
unsigned	short
using unsigned char saves on space in the design shown though it might conceivably save space if you kept track of the allocated length separately from the length in use but even then i d probably use unsigned short rather than unsigned char

5569031
calloc	malloc	memset	malloc	memset	calloc
the initialization loop for the allocated memory could perhaps be replaced with a memset operation or you could use calloc instead of malloc

5569062
client-side	server-side
you ll need some server-side code php in your case that serves as a proxy between the db and the client-side code

5569067
versioning	upgrade
in that case the answer to your question is upgrade to the latest versioning and use a place

5569127
centos	linux
the test environment is a basic server running linux with 128mb ram pentium iii 667 mhz centos 5.5 no emulation

5569176

rails 3.0.5 doesn t seem to destroy children of a parent object using accepts_nested_attributes_for unless the children are loaded

5569267
move	drag
i ve got a private method which allows me to simulate a drag drop event for any of the items that the player can move around

probably i am putting too much effort in it while i could just use a textview button edittext imageview that i can click on to create a datepick dialog

5569319
pull	push
i think option 2 sounds most sensible but i m not sure why you would need to set up a pull operation as well as a push

google-chrome	firefox
this is not required in google-chrome or firefox or even ie 9

5569465
gridview	entitydatasource

5569535
rbac	acl
however this need of access control is frequent named acl or rbac

5569587
post	get
if possible use the post redirect get pattern for the previous page

5569588
put	get
i currently have the following code to get a bitmap object strip the color and then turn it red which works but i need the darker elements of the image to come through as darker at the moment it s like somebody put a red film over the image which is almost what i want but need the blacks to be darker

5569621
google-chrome	safari
actually it s not just a part of safari since google-chrome has it too

5569621
google-chrome	safari
the web inspector is a part of the webkit engine used by safari google-chrome and if i m not wrong by the default browser in android devices

5569645
versioning	upgrade
there is a way to do this in the older versioning but you will be happier if you upgrade to the newest release

5569653
post	get
but it just so happens that itunes post distributed notifications whenever the track changes so you can listen for those and get the currently playing song info that way

5569663
typedef	typename
if it s a standard function object type it should have a result_type typedef which you can get at using typedef typename qf result_type result_type

5569685
min	max
if you want to find the actual signed value of each of these you can use the second output option from min and max

5569696

width	height
you re basing your measurements on the page s width and height close but aren t adjusting for any offset in that bottom left corner

5569809
equals	gethashcode
using the gethashcode equals method means that if two objects hash to the same value you ll be relying in their equals implementation to tell you if they are equivalent

5569831
for-loop	loops
i ve basically got a for-loop that loops through a bunch of classes does work one for checkboxes and one for radio boxes

5569857
min	max
you could do a group by with min or max to pick a value or you could do row_number over order by some_criteria partiion by your_key and pick the first row

5569937
mouseleave	mouseenter
another odd thing is that when the mouseenter does fire and the toolbar appears hideloveactions is always called when the mouseleave the div

int	double
t can be double string or int

5569950
width	height

because this is a salt hash it s even more difficult

5570037
swt	swing
you can create guis in both swing and swt

5570110
hash	salt
because you can t retrieve a password from a one-way hash like sha-512 the closest we can get is being able to generate the same hash from the same password and salt

5570110
hash	salt
using this code you should be able to generate identical hash for a given identical password and salt combination

5570134
post	get
i checked my apache s error log on my wordpress site and every time i update a post select post and click update i get this error

5570427
put	get
put a few debug statements in there until you get it working right

5570446
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
putting aside concerns about how to sign the requests without leaking the shared access key silverlight won t access the table endpoint because neither clientaccesspolicy.xml nor crossdomain.xml are present at the root of the table uri

5570471
hide	show
i would suggest having two selects that you show and hide

5570471
hide	show
show and hide of options sounds risky

5570471
hide	show
if show hide works in all browsers go for it

5570477

with more time and effort you could write an office vsto add-in that could automate the process for your endusers

5570542
memcached	apc
after that nothing prevents you from putting some caching mecanism in place using apc or memcached typically -- or even a reverse-proxy like varnish to avoid hitting the database too often with the same requests

5570597
int	boolean
there is still type checking though if you enter the value 1 you get the error message that an int cannot be converted into a boolean

5570607

i haven t tried praetorian s answer so if that works well then do that - otherwise use both the keyup and textchanged events to update the binding source

5570647
sdl	lwjgl
if you re looking for a game development library there s a pretty good one that recently came out -- the shaven puppy game library spgl that uses lwjgl lightweight java game library - uses sdl opengl made by the creators of revenge of the titans a successful 2d game coded in java using hardware acceleration

5570714

5570824

5570824
free	malloc
be aware that malloc operator new will often be stingy about giving free memory back to the os which will cause your program as a whole not to shrink its apparent usage over time

5570829
coalesce	nullif
if you include the nullif function inside the coalesce function it will work correctly for empty columns as well as null columns

5570871

gridview	radiobuttonlist
i have a radiobuttonlist in the dataitemtemplate of the aspx gridview

5570969
post	get
you can not detect f5 but instead should detect if the request is get or post

5570969
post	get
if you fill out a form and click submit and then do an f5 after that you will typically get a warning from your browser because it will do another post

5570969
post	get
thus an f5 might be either a get or post and you need to be able to deal with either

5570969
post	get
one way to keep your users from getting this message from their browser is to use the post redirect get idiom

5571287

5571334
itunes	entitlements
when you create a new provisional here you have the option of selecting ad hoc as the distribution method. after used this provisional on xcode project and target build setting and turned off can be debugged on the entitlements i then could install via itunes or via ota

onresume	onpause
maybe dleting the bmps in the onpause and ondestroy and recostructing them in the onresume if necesary

5571740
factors	matrix
the eigenvalues give the corresponding lengths of the major minor axis of the ellipse and so scaling the ellipse or the eigenvalues to the 95 tile is equivalent to multiplying the covariance matrix with the scaling factors

5571775
apk	dex
the problem was that the classes were not being compiled and translated to the dex file this is obvious to find because the apk just shrinks

applying sorting or filtering on the aspxgridview causes the page to refresh

5571905
getter	setter
there s no reason that you have to use the objective-c 2 style setter getter to manage your instance variables - as long as the instance variable is released within the dealloc method if indeed it s a alloced inited object etc. then there s nothing to worry about

5571905
getter	setter
bear in mind that prior to objective-c such properties and the whole property synthesize syntax simply didn t exist so you had to create your own getter setter if you deemed it necessary convenient

5571909
accessor	properties
so objective-c 2.0 came along and gave us the ability to declare properties with the language syntax and even generate the accessor for us-- lots of time and boilerplate code was saved

5571909
accessor	properties
the public ones appear in the .h file as properties but you can also create a private interface to your object in the .m file that declare your private properties so you can use the accessor inside your class

5571923
accessor	properties
in fact prior to v2.0 of objective-c there was no such thing as properties -- you had to write your own accessor and mutators for instance variables if you wanted to access them outside of the class

5571934
post	put
i don t know what the html structure of this page is but i would put the recent post list after the navigation links next previous post

5572306
mouseup	mousedown
call myrectangle.capturemouse in the mousedown event that way mouseup will be fired even if the mouse moves outside the rectangle check for ismousecaptured in the mouseup event to see if the mousedown actually occurred inside the rectangle and release it via myrectangle.releasemousecapture

5572331

int	double
if you want to compare an int with a double you will need to convert the int to a double

5572755
int	double
please be aware that this won t work the other way round as an int couldn t hold all the values a double can values will be round down

5572755
int	double
and double can hold values way bigger and small than int could

5572755
int	double
so please always convert the int to a double to prevent this to happen

5572755
int	double
but keep in mind that double differs from double as double is an object and not a primitive type so there will be more overhead when handling a double compared to using a double or int

5572768
put	get
i need to get the values from array b and put in array a in key k3 i am using this function to do this

5585729
preorder	postorder
i would guess that in your problem bottom-up is postorder and top-down is preorder

5585729
preorder	postorder
now the thing is that if have a tree t and preorder and postorder traversal generated node lists for it the root of that tree is the first node on the preorder list and the last node on the postorder list

5585729
preorder	postorder
you have two lists preorder and postorder traversed node lists

interpolation	splines
the answer is to generate points within a 40x40 or so box around the previous point and interpolation between them with a cubic splines

i have an app that leverages the touchjson objective-c library and i m running the instrumentation profiling for memory leaks and getting a leak in that source that i can t figure out how to fix

5586248

it seems like the easiest thing to do for your show hide navigation bar would be to add a uitapgesturerecognizer and set numberoftouchesrequired and numberoftapsrequired to 1

5586248
touchesbegan	touchesended
alternatively you could use touchesended instead of touchesbegan

5586248
hide	show
then in your touchesended you could check for the number of touches and only show hide if it s 1

5586255
mouseover	mouseout
the reason its doing that is because you have a .stop in the mouseover and mouseout

5586255
mouseover	mouseout
obviously it makes sense to have them there so what you should do is set the mouseover and mouseout events after the onload animations have finished

5586255
mouseover	mouseout
edit the elements move up slightly after the mouseover because they initially start with a margin-top of 10px but the animation sets it to 0px on mouseout

super	self
use isinstance to check your objects to see if they re instances of host and use super super hostlist self .insert ... to use the functionality of list rather than reimplementing it yourself

5586600

post	get
my questions is it possible to post this form using jquery but still using this format that s mean with the model and not get one value by one value like the sample below

this implies a size limit of floor n 8 -2 ceil h 8 -2 still for a 1024-bit rsa key with sha-256 as hash function h 256 this means binary messages up to 60 bytes

5586667

mkmapview	mapkit
mapkit is good at drawing region shapes on an mkmapview and corelocation is good at telling you straight distance from cllocation to cllocation but neither is exactly what i need

5586957
post	get
my guess would be that when the website gets the post and logs the user in it sets cookies on the response to indicate that the user is logged in and then requires those cookies on subsequent get s

5586957
post	get
this sets up a cookie store within the http context and you then use that context on get s and post s

this will allow any existing users to upgrade to the new versioning while new users will automatically get the newest versioning

5587339
factors	matrix
if you read the docs it says that you can also specify the zoom factors independently for the two axes which means you can upscale non-square matrix as well

5587339
interpolation	splines
by default it uses third order splines interpolation which i am not sure is best

5587369

5588612
inherited	properties
some architectures will treat nodes much like object-oriented classes where you have different classes of nodes that can inherited various characteristics of parent nodes - every type of node inherited the basic properties of its parent - an essay node might inherited the properties of a text-document node which in turn inherited the properties of the base node

5588630

atomic	interlocked
edit april 2017 i recently learned that when .net is running in 32-bit mode or in the wow subsystem the 64-bit interlocked operations are not guaranteed to be atomic with respect to non- interlocked external views of the same memory locations

5589515
atomic	interlocked
in other words to obtain 64-bit atomic operations in 32-bit mode all accesses to qword locations must occur through interlocked in order to preserve the guarantees and you can t get cute assuming that direct reads are protected just because you always use interlocked functions for writing

5589525
mongoid	mongomapper
i just wanted to confirm that mongoid and mongomapper can not be used in an eventmachine environment because they are blocking and thus defeat the point of using eventmachine in the first place and that i m not wasting my time writing these mappers

when i ve read hex value permissions from database for appropriate client i convert it to binary string where every digit 0 or 1 represents state of some permission flag

5596910

5597470
prepare	execute
if you want to pre-process the query using your parser you ll need to override the execute query and prepare methods in your class that extends pdo

5597470

agile	greenhopper
jira and greenhopper for agile are the tools of choice for me

5597565
setinterval	settimeout
the one case i can think of where you might want to use settimeout instead of setinterval would be when the work you re doing in the function called on timeout updatemessagecount in my example below takes longer than the timeout interval which would cause the next timeout when using setinterval to appear to be instantaneous since the timer is going to fire every n seconds irrespective of whether the function called by the previous timeout is still executing

5598186
mouse	keyboard
to display the menu all you need is the coords passed to you by wm_contextmenu or wm_rbuttonup these are of course not normal messages but something generated by the tray and you therefore don t have to deal with mouse vs keyboard

5598197
spatialite	proj
a good place to look at getting it compiled would be with the spatialite proj

5598554
teamcity	nant
i am using nant to run my builds with teamcity

5598581
nexus	artifactory
to properly fix this for your internal team you will want to set up a repository artifactory nexus or archiva

it works in ie and firefox but not in google-chrome so i tried opening google-chrome s javascript console to find the problem

5598690

if you don t explicitly set the height and width of a scrollviewer then it will take the height and width of the parent element

5598690
width	height
in this case it looks like scroll2 is taking the height and width of the dock panel which is why scroll2 scrolling isn t enabled

if you install testdriven.net one of the components called ncover actually helps you understand how much of your code is covered by unit test

5598913
intersect	contains

often you will do this in your view controller s viewdidload method or viewdidappear or even viewwillappear

5599158
gesturedetector	motionevent
you do not even need the gesturedetector just analyze the action and coordinates of motionevent it s very easy

5599245
post	get
depending on the params you want to pass in you may need to get fancier like adding your own jquery event listener which post the actual value of the checkbox to your ajax action but i hope this gets you started

5599246
width	height
i think this was happening because there was no float property in place although i can t understand why this was a problem if there were discrete values for height and width

5599306
apache	nginx
you have the entire nginx vs apache comparison

blogging software lives server-side so anything that you do client-side jquery would have to depend on the blog software s ajax capability

5599417
spreadsheetml	drawingml

5599547

5599561
boost	stl
i can t really use boost here so if it s possible with standard c++ stl allowed it would be great

5599562

textview	imageview
the problem is that the textview is always on top of the imageview and i would like to it be underneath

5599821
put	get
have put some code together for you but you should implement the font 8pin matrix to get realistic feeling

5599848
textview	imageview
the first component imageview should be placed in the linearlayout first before the textview

5599858
free	malloc
the main disavantage is that you will need to free all pointers that have been malloc -ed after you are done with them otherwise you can get a memory leak

5599868
for-loop	loops
in many cases it s as simple as putting a #pragma omp directive before a for-loop and that loops will be automatically multi-threaded

though you should probably not use this you can do this for ie firefox google-chrome safari and opera i admit arguments.callee is convenient despite the valid reservations expressed about it as would be arguments.callee.name if the function.name property were standard

5600128
client-side	server-side
obviously there are way around this - you should ensure you always have adequate server-side validation as client-side usually isn t enough on it s own

5600129
udp	tcp
you should absolutely do it that way use tcp and udp to accomplish different communication tasks. and you don t even have to use two different ports

5600131
post	get
they very likely are bots that read field names and create get and post requests based on those rather than using the html form like a normal human user would

5600181
udp	tcp
tcp connections can have timing issues at the os and network levels and udp connections have packet loss issues

5600181

so right now i have kind of an all-purpose uiviewcontroller that all of my controllers subclassing from but it would be neater if i could break that down and have specific controllers inherited specific behavior

5601144
getter	setter
thats because there really is no ivar named title and also no getter or setter pair

5601152
lxml	libxml2

quicksort	mergesort
one concrete advantage is that if at some point you want a different sorting algorithm then you can change quicksort to say mergesort in this single line without having to change it anywhere else

5601327
put	get	post	get	post	put
since most browsers do not support http methods other than get and post we mimic other methods like put and delete as follows

public	protected
the private and protected methods of a class aren t part of the public interface so they don t expose public behavior

5601783

5602229
hide	show
for that we implement a library for common tasks like show hide write and such things

5602232
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
you need to implement inotifypropertychanged on the class you re binding to and the list of items should implement inotifycollectionchanged like observablecollection

5602239
width	height
the height and width have been hardcoded for testing purposes but these are the actual image size

5602243
webkit	gecko
options for replacing it seem to be seems to be either packaging webkit gecko or build my own browser ontop of a html rendering component

5602243
webkit	gecko
i didn t like webkit gecko much because of the extra size it adds to the program

5602244
button	checkbox
these inputs may include text fields checkbox radio-buttons submit button hidden inputs hidden from the agent filling the form and more

i then tried to persuade my dos-based users to upgrade to unix-based systems in order to work with supported versioning of isql but only a few opted to migrate

5602718
onresume	onpause
however it might be simplest to toggle a value in sharedpreferences within the activity onpause onresume callbacks

5602725
webclient	httpwebrequest
use the .net classes that allow for retrieval of http information without ui controls namely httpwebrequest or the simpler webclient

5602805
mvp	presenter
the only benefit that i can think of that is specific to the mvvm pattern over mvp of which it is a variant is that in mvvm you do not need to explicitly attach a view to a viewmodel presenter as you would in an mvp implementation

5602805
mvp	presenter
bindingexpressions most importantly in mvp you would define an interface that represents how the presenter can interact with the view ixxxxview is a conventional naming pattern and when you create your presenter you pass in the view interface to it which is attached to the view instance

5602839
centos	linux
also i do not know what other operating systems this works on other than redhat centos linux so it may not be that portable

next on the hover or click event of item.name you ll use jquery to show or hide the popup

5602893
webclient	httpwebrequest
if you really need a browser control for example you re doing a web scraper requiring execution of javascript which you can t implement with a webclient or httpwebrequest try geckofx an open-source component which makes it easy to embed mozilla gecko firefox into any .net application

5602903
post	get
if your code varies from the example you will have to post it to get precise help

5602903
width	height
bitmap file size is a function of pixel width times height - they get bigger fast

5602906
post	get
i was going to create a script to get the data from the 3 textboxes and populate the hidden field ready for the http post

5602914
post	get
the way you may want to get around this is to do the full post back in an iframe or simply create a direct link to the download file even if that might be a ashx handler where you can continue to have similar logic to what you are already using

5602925
rss	feed
i would like to find something with a single sign on with existing application multiple sites rss feed and all be hosted from the same location

java.util.calendar java.util.date

5602950
getter	setter
so if you don t specify column it derives column value from getter setter

5602958
atof	strtod
if not it might be assuming atof or strtod should return an int and reading from whatever location functions that return integers normally return which will result in nonsense answers

5602971
udp	tcp
you correctly specify tcp or udp might break things if it s the wrong one

5602991
accessor	properties
but accessor methods are mostly boilerplate too so we use properties declarations to create them automagically rather than writing them by hand

5602991
accessor	properties
edit apple s memory management guide provides a lot of detail about what the accessor methods generated by properties do behind the scenes

5603136
coldfusion	railo
haven t tested this on railo but it should work on coldfusion 9 at least

5603144
accessor	properties
the properties s properties also give instructions to the compiler as to how to synthesize an accessor

5603144
ivar	subclassing
in init and dealloc access the ivar directly - you are interested in initialization and cleanup of the object s ivars and do not care about subclassing

5603144
ivar	subclassing	accessor	ivar
if a subclassing overrides an accessor direct access of the ivar could break designs

5603174
dbcontext	objectcontext
i also read articles about the solution of efproviderwrapper on jaroslaw kowalski s blog but it is based on objectcontext does not work for dbcontext

5603193
jobs	cron
cron_info display information about cron jobs

5603197
int	chars
given that your input expects chars you should be using a chars or int type ignoring possible utf-16 keyboard codes which given that you re on windows is likely

5603218
powerpc	i386
you can choose other... and then explicitly enter a list of architectures like powerpc i386 x86_64

5603250
super	implements
android also has longclicks longpress built in which work a lot like this minus controlling the exact duration of pressing but are super easy to implements

5603275
debian	linux
my linux distribution debian gnu linux 6.0 is been installed with openjdk which does not contain the sun packages

5603285
verilog	vhdl
for all that dont know them they take c code then translate it into some hardware description language like vhdl or verilog which then can be used to generate hardware usually it gets mapped to an fpga - but i am not limited to that asic as target would be fine too

5603289
width	height
and then you can set set contentsize cgsizemake width height

5603324

5603494
for-loop	arrays
in a lot of programming languages and their micro-optimizations i ve seen that declaring the length of an arrays within a for-loop has performance implications especially in php and javascript

5603526
pop-up	dialog
now what i would wish is to have the dialog pop-up after say 2 seconds insterad of immediately

5603564
filesystems	ntfs
how allocation is done depends entirely on the filesystems type fat32 ntfs jfs reiser etc

5603590
punctuation	words
i thought this would separate each words w and the specified punctuation

5603636
punctuation	words
if you want to be more permissive you should use unicode character classes instead allows letters numbers combining marks dash characters and the apostrophe for words and punctuation for punctuation

5603643
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

5603655
filesystems	ntfs
the behavior of an ntfs filesystems in windows may be nothing like the behavior of an ext3 filesystems in ubuntu for the same set of logical operations

5603672
for-loop	arrays
you don t need the second for-loop you just need to add the last number at the last position of the arrays

5603673
regression	least-squares
the obvious route would be to do a least-squares linear regression through the points

5603690
portrait	landscape
but its giving width as 668.0 in portrait as well as landscape

5603704
hide	show
then use jquery s toggle to show and hide again

5603705
width	height
it has a width of 300px and height 100px

5603732
oncreate	setcontentview
and add this line to the oncreate method right after setcontentview ...

5603803
getter	setter
in fact specifying getter setter like this is not really what tdd is for

5603803
getter	setter
the idea is to let a requirement drive the setter getter into existence

5603820
put	get
right now after i put the file in the folder i start with a loop until i get that file back so i can read the result

5603822
subtract	add
this basically says take the value from the cell above then add the value of the cell 2 to the left and subtract the value in the cell directly to the left

5603886
instances	transient
i am thinking of making it transient and caching the instances inside the viewbase so essentially inside a usercontrol instance.

5603900
rss	feed
the webcal protocol prefix is used to trigger an external protocol handler which is passed the url of the .ics file rather than being passed the downloaded contents of the file in much the same way feed is sometimes used to trigger external rss readers

5603936
inherited	subclassing
protected inherited means only derived and its subclassing knows it also is-a base

5603994
wordpress	joomla
there are lots of cmss available out there and most of them are good also but the three that always stand out are drupal joomla and wordpress

5603994
wordpress	joomla
joomla and wordpress are easier to configure but not as customizable as drupal is

5604019
width	height
example width height or left can be

5604019
width	height
specifically for example width height or left can be animated but background-color cannot be

5604062
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
ps you might want to try dotnetzip in lieu of sharpziplib

5604151
gtk	fltk
fltk is the easiest to pick up and can definitely accommodate your problem but gtk should also do it along with wxwidgets et al

5604193
expression-blend	silverlight
i developped a silverlight 3 application in visual studio 2008 and expression-blend 3

5604193
expression-blend	silverlight
some weeks ago i ported the app to silverlight 4 and upgraded my tools to expression-blend 4 and visual studio 2010

5604199
width	height
a way to just get the scale values might be to remove any transforms measure the computed width height of the element and then add them back and measure again

5604202
post	put
proposed solutions still did not work for me django 1.2.3 piston 0.2.2 so i ve tweaked joekrell solution and this finally works i m only using post and put but presumably you can add other verbs to the list

5604204
stdout	stderr
i discovered the bufsize argument but it doesn t say which of the 3 stdin stdout stderr files it s actually applied to

5604258
google-chrome	firefox
however in google-chrome and firefox 4 facebook is using something different and rewriting to

5604288
cos	sin
if you mean 1 cos 1 sin and 1 tan implementing these functions is a trivial exercise but dealing with error checking sin

5604368
client-side	server-side
that way it is automatically sent to your server with every user request so no need to build out a custom server-side api for receiving the state after a lost connection and no need to have any custom client-side code for sending the data to the server and still updateable even if the user has lost internet connectivity

5604368
client-side	server-side
note that because the state is always available client-side and sent to the server on every request there is no need to maintain any explicit copy of the state server-side unless you want to be able to remember the user s place even when they manually delete their cookies which is overkill in my opinion

5604374
wav	riff
riff wav files use little-endian byte order

5604439
floating-point	integer
you can check this by inspecting the underlying representation either in a debugger or by trace output you can access it by placing it in a union of the floating-point type and an integer of the same size

5604440
sml	scheme
this is entirely different from scheme or sml

5604440
haskell	scheme
in scheme the file is interpreted as being executed form-by-form but haskell s top level is only declarations

5604441
stdout	stderr
i discovered the bufsize argument but it applies to all of the stdin stdout and stderr files

5604442
g++	gcc
you ll need to compile that as c++ so rename your file to .cpp and make sure g++ is called to drive the compile link rather than gcc

5604481
ubuntu	linux
i am on linux ubuntu it is a vps

5604504
min	max	range	max	range	min
range min 0 max 10

5604514
freebsd	linux
i use gtk on windows because windows is my favorite development platform but in production code gtk is only used on unix linux freebsd platforms

5604540
postgresql	mysql
i am looking for a program to build a schema from the newly created database postgresql preferably with a beautiful design schemes such as a mysql workbench or change styles schemes

5604615
post	get
i did my homework and i read the spring reference guides googled for tutorials etc but it seems that converters are primarily a tool for converting data from get parameters and post queries

5604619
width	height
if yes just pass the data to the above function you will also need the width and height of your image to be converted correctly

5604692
google-chrome	safari
the following question s answer contains a code example distinguish google-chrome from safari using jquery.browser

5604710
put	get
have outside the loop a reference where you put the final result when you get it then after the loop return the reference content

5604757
google-chrome	firefox
i only tested it on firefox 3.6 and google-chrome 10 on mac

5604776
setinterval	settimeout
do not rely on settimeout setinterval or any other built-in utility for scheduling a function invocation to provide a high degree of accuracy or precision particularly when you are executing custom rendering code

5604780
coalesce	isnull
the coalesce or isnull function is require for count first nullable columns

5604845
cassini	iis
i reread and see that you are using iis instead of cassini

5604970
unsigned	short
utf8 is stored as a variable-amount of chars whereas utf16 is stored using surrogate pairs - and thus inside a wchar_t or unsigned short though incidentally sizeof wchar_t on windows is only 2 vs 4 on nix and thus you ll often need 2 wchar_t types to store the 1 character if a surrogate pair encoding is used - which it will be in many cases

5604980
many-to-many	many-to-one
in the relational model tables can be related as any of many-to-many many-to-one rev

5604981
many-to-many	many-to-one
in the relational model tables can be related as any of many-to-many many-to-one rev

5604987
button	checkbox
when there are no checkbox on the page and i try to click on filter button which calls this function i receive an error document.caldailyblock.selfilcheckbox.length is null or not an object

5605014
inherited	properties
if you decide to not use the base class and inherited - you can remove the base class copy the properties to each derived class and it will work

5605044
sorting	filtering
additional support optional is provided via ibindinglist provides 2-way binding and basic sorting etc ibindinglistview provides advanced sorting filtering etc icanceladdnew and iraiseitemchangedevents

5605049
pop-up	dialog
iam trying to open a pop-up login form in jquery modal dialog on click of a button in a asp.net page

5605049
pop-up	dialog
but the modal dialog is not coming as a pop-up window.please tell where iam doing wrong

5605051
entity-relationship	diagram
it includes a tool that creates entity-relationship diagram from the database schema

5605064
lemmatization	stemming
the purpose of both stemming and lemmatization is to reduce morphological variation

5605064
lemmatization	stemming
the real difference between stemming and lemmatization is threefold

5605064
lemmatization	stemming
stemming reduces word-forms to pseudo stems whereas lemmatization reduces the word-forms to linguistically valid lemmas

5605064
lemmatization	stemming
lemmatization deals only with inflectional variance whereas stemming may also deal with derivational variance

5605074
width	height
its resize the height and width depends upon the max width

5605131
jobs	cron
as of now i am running only one beanstalk worker thread for my project which handles both cron based jobs and real time jobs

5605131
jobs	cron
one worker is used to track the cron based jobs and one more to track the real time asynchronous jobs

5605142
min	max
i just noticed that the new standard defines min a b and max a b without constexpr

5605143
persistent	transient
use memcache to store newly added user urls and the task queue to periodically write that transient data to the persistent datastore

5605186
ready	each
now here each gateway has state like booting disconnected ready etc....so i have created state transition diagram for that but will there be any state transition for simulator as well

5605226
width	height
let s consider i only want to allow 4 lines in the following example you can t go higher than a height of 84 pixels with the given font in a given uitextview with a width of 200

5605239
translation	localization
it also makes it hard for the calling context to provide localization something i believe has no place in an exception - i hate attempting to translation before googling

5605270
punctuation	words
the issue is that i m trying to take an array of words remove any punctuation from the array and place the new words into a separate array

5605352
free	strdup
sometimes functions allocate memory you have to free after using them strdup

5605392
express	node.js
i ve got a node.js express server running with the jade template engine

5605402
portrait	landscape
what i have learned indicates that a portrait class must contain a property which keeps an instance of the landscape class

5605402
portrait	landscape
and when the device is rotated the portrait view instance must present the landscape view instance over it has a modal view

5605402
portrait	landscape
when the landscape view is the frontmost view over the window it will receive those rotate event methods and can resend to the portrait view which will continue managing it.

5605432
post	get
problem is that this works perfetly fine with get requests but not with post requests

5605451
post	get
according to this wikipedia article the post data would be converted to get which probably won t work for a file upload

5605516
sin	sqrt
h r 1-cos asin sqrt 2 r dr+dr 2 +r sin acos r-k r r -k

5605548
versioning	upgrade
i recently had my xcode upgrade to versioning 4 and i have an exc_bad_access exception in my code but despite setting nszombieenabled in the environment it s still showing the break point on the thread1 line

5605549
ant	maven
bundler is a gem which package all your project gem dependencies think of it as maven or ant if you are coming from java background

5605554
archetypes	dexterity
dexterity has gone this route but its not available for archetypes based content types or general classes like tools

5605605
children	parent
this can be achieved by having the view pass both the parent and the children to the list function in a particular order

5605605
children	parent
for the simpler case of only one parent the view may emit the parent entity followed by its children and the list function may go along the lines of

5605612
opera	firefox
this works on both firefox 4 and chromium 10.x but fails on opera 11.01 all running on ubuntu 10.10

5605612
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i don t have access to either mac or windows so i can t say how safari or ie will handle the display block on tr elements or even firefox and google-chrome running on different platforms

5605639
min	max
min and max are only constant expressions if you call them with constant expressions as arguments

5605652
width	height
i ve set each of the imageviews layout width and layout height properties to 100dp and 50dp respectively i ve also tried px instead of dp and i ve tried changing the imageviews max size but the imageviews continue to scale rather than staying at this fixed size

5605660
keydown	keyup
yes you can fire the keydown or keyup event on a textbox

5605694
width	margin
you should either 1 adjust the width you use in sizewithfont to respect the text view s margin or 2 use an auxiliary uitextview object to accurately compute the content size

5605710
memcached	apc
apc is primarily used for storing the bytecode into an os managed shared-memory segment but it also has an api for sharing anything you want between processes like a local version of memcached

5605714
for-loop	loops
i am trying to parallelize a for-loop operation which is sandwiched between two for loops

5605720
width	margin
i don t know about pure css solution but you can use javascript to dynamically count and adjust correct width of left margin while making the right margin a bit thinner - by size of scrollbar

5605726
apache	nginx
ssl is handled at the apache nginx whatever level

5605792
width	margin
if you insist on fixing something people have learned to live with it s going to have to be a dynamic javascript solution where you calculate your left margin and add the width of the scrollbar

5605819
matplotlib	scipy
here s an implementation with scipy matplotlib

5605824
int	chars
since the unicode range u+0080 to u+00ff is identical to the iso-8859-1 byte range 0x80-0xff the non-ascii chars can be encoded by casting them to int values

5605844
int	chars
where s is chars number is a variable int

5605950
richtextbox	textblock
i then have two controls in the ui a textblock and a richtextbox

5605950
richtextbox	textblock
the textblock is bound to the count property of the datasource whilst the richtextbox appends each new data value to its text string ie

5605950
richtextbox	textblock
if i disable the richtextbox binding the textblock updates very quickly cycling through the count

5605950
richtextbox	textblock
i understand the richtextbox may well be slow but why does it have to slow down the otherwise lightening fast textblock

5605969
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is working in firefox google-chrome and safari as it should but as you can guess not in that great pieace of microsoft software called internet explorer

5605985
aptana	radrails
i have installed the aptana aptana radrails version 2.0.5.1278709071-7k7w97fdk_sbcjt_y-tkcz0v4cxb

5606018
for-loop	loops
the index loops variable used in a generate for-loop

5606021
width	height
if you want a pure css option i believe an absolute positioned div inside the body with width and height of 100 overflow auto and right padding larger than the width of a scroll bar will replace the normal scrollbar without shifting the content to the left on long pages

5606043
onclick	onchange
i would suggest changing your event from onchange to a different event onclick

5606074
versioning	upgrade
but when i upgrade my visual studio versioning to 2010 sql server stops working

5606083
put	get
i need to get the cookies from a http response sent by a server and put it in the next request s header

5606084
getchar	getline
but getchar only consumed the y and leaves the buffered which your first getline call reads

5606158
sigkill	multitasking
i was experimenting with my app in the ios simulator when i found that it produces the sigkill signal when i delete it from the multitasking bar and then rerun it

5606174
width	height
since it will vary in size height and width of the items must fit the contents i can t use a fixed graphic

5606174
width	height
use a single background image bigger than any of the boxes will be in height and width using css to position them in the corners

5606190
opera	firefox
works in ie 7 to 9 firefox and opera tested by me .

5606190
google-chrome	safari
author says it supports google-chrome and safari too

5606193
awt	swing
since you are just learning applets why don t you start by creating a swing applet instead of an awt applet

5606246
getter	setter
it automatically adds setter getter to your code at compile

5606296
google-chrome	firefox
it does in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie8

5606296
google-chrome	firefox
it has to work in ie8 firefox any google-chrome ie7 and older is not important

5606334
hide	show
basically i m detecting the presence of css that hide ads and if i find it i d like to show a little message

5606337
memcached	apc
you can also think about splitting the big array into slices and then always retrieve the part you currently need from an apc or memcached

5606342
freebsd	linux	freebsd	solaris
i use vim because i can go fast and well in vim whether i am writing c++ or any other language on windows linux solaris mac os x or freebsd

5606360
hide	show
alternately show and hide the chosen axis as the shape changes direction at the limits of its travel

5606376
fltk	glui
cegui fltk glui so flat and gray

5606382
implements	extends
public class billingservice extends service implements serviceconnection

5606400
public	protected
if you add methods public protected or private because they make a failing test pass then you ve more or less achieved the goal of tdd

5606400
public	protected
if you add methods public protected or private because you just decide to violating tdd then your code coverage should catch these and you should be able to improve your process

5606412
firefox	safari
this works in firefox but not ie or safari

5606458
width	height
so a uiscrollview is designed to display content of an arbitrary width height and a uitableview provides an interface through which you can display a table of arbitrary length

5606459
inherited	properties
the beauty of wpf using the icommand interface is that you should be able to favor a more compositional approach rather an an inherited model and use an interface to share common properties

5606460
gif	png
now i want to know if there is any image format like png gif where such gradients could be stored in a more compressed way

5606460
gif	png
problem is converting from jpeg to png gif is not the right way and actually increases the size because the noise has to be losslesly encoded

5606473
put	get	post	get	post	put
the point is that http forms can only use methods get and post not put or delete

5606473
put	get
first if you get a put or delete there is nowhere to put the protect_from_forgery token

5606473
put	get	post	get	post	put
second since html forms can only use post and get if the request is a put or delete the attacker cannot use a html form to force or trick the user into submitting the request

5606481
portrait	landscape
however when i add the navigation controller it is added in portrait mode ipad is still in landscape but the navigation controller is flipped

5606526
serializable	deserialization
now serializable deserialization of enums works different than with other objects

5606538
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the animation seems to work fine in firefox and safari but when i ve tested it in google-chrome the text duplicates across the screen and just generally messes up in a weird way

5606543
apache	nginx
having apache as a reverse proxy wouldn t be much efficient and that s why nginx is popular in this scenario

5606543
apache	nginx
other alternative than nginx based reverse proxy can be as khez suggested mapping your subdomain to different ip address which will node.js program listen to or maybe use node.js itself as a reverse proxy for apache

5606549
maven	pom.xml
maven configuration files are typically named pom.xml and contain among other things all the dependencies for a project

5606566
backgrounding	multitasking
if you have pending network activity such as trying to logout you might want to use the multitasking call beginbackgroundtaskwithexpirationhandler to request a bit of additional time in the backgrounding to finish the log out process such as handshake with any network callbacks required

5606651
portrait	landscape
1 when the activity starts if the device is in portrait orientation i want to display a view that asks the user to please rotate the device into landscape orientation

5606651
portrait	landscape
i thought i could set my requested orientation to either landscape or sensor landscape but that doesn t work in the first case i get an upside-down screen depending on the original orientation and in the second i always get portrait orientation for some reason

5606665
super	self
super connection self .__init__ args kwargs2

5606737
hash	salt
hash and salt

5606775
asterisk	ivr
asterisk ivr server

5606775
asterisk	ivr
asterisk external ivr interface

5606794
config	ini
i was reading an article on php config files and xml files were the fastest outside the ini

5606795
gif	png
you can usually experience some good savings this way if you use png gif and force limits on the color palette

5606844
int	boolean
you can use sharedpreferences to save any primitive data boolean floats int longs and strings

5606882
django-cms	mezzanine
coming from the django world i d recommend using a third party app such as django-cms and mezzanine

5606907
multiplying	division
finally the last division by r is redundant as written since you multiplying by r at the same level just before

5606954
wordpress	joomla
if you are using any cms like wordpress or joomla or se then you have option to do that else you need to have an .htaccess file where you can write the code refer this links

5606975
joptionpane	jdialog
thus it should be a dialog type of window either a joptionpane or a modal jdialog and not a jframe

5606975
joptionpane	jdialog
regarding extracting the animal type information from the second window dialog if you call the second window as a modal jdialog or joptionpane which is really a specialized modal jdialog you will know exactly when the user has completed his work with the second window since your main window s code will start up right after the spot where you called setvisible true on the second window or called joptionpane.showxxxx

5607003
inherited	subclassing
finally the util module provides an inherited method to subclassing another constructor and inherited from its prototypes

5607011
qstring	qlist
in the qtcreator change signals slots context menu i can t insert neither signals nor slots that have parameterized arguments such as qlist qstring etc

5607015
min	max	range	max	range	min
for the following input types number range date datetime datetime-local month time and week which aren t fully supported yet use the min and max attributes

5607016
post	get
i wonder what happens if i have two machines that are load-balanced and one will receive the initial post and the other a subsequent get

5607061
min	max
secondly as a general tip if you want to find the min or max value in the entire matrix instead of calling it twice use min ima and max ima

5607073
mdpi	hdpi
android uses the three folders for hdpi mdpi ldpi

5607073
mdpi	hdpi
just drawable no hdpi mdpi ldpi

5607087
urllib	cookielib
you should use the cookielib module with urllib

5607096
folder	directory
on the iphone once it is installed you can t change this folder hence why you save it to the documents directory

5607096
folder	directory
nsbundle mainbundle doesn t give you the documents directory it gives you i think the .app folder though it might be the folder that contains the app documents and other folder

5607111
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
that s actually more like sorteddictionary than sortedlist given that it s a tree rather than just a list but it s probably the closest available option

5607129
implements	extends
i had the same problem but i managed to solve it when reading the source code of animationdrawable by implements my own animationdrawable class that extends animationdrawable and override the run method and add setduration method which allows me to set the duration as follow

5607192
py2app	platypus
for scripts that just print to stdout you might try platypus though it doesn t do the dependency-packaging stuff of py2app

5607207
calloc	malloc
i chose calloc because it zeros the memory which makes all those pointers null but you could use malloc and null them yourself

5607207
calloc	malloc
nb every call to malloc or calloc ought to be accompanied by a check to insure that the allocation worked

5607218
for-loop	while-loop
you should simply need a single for-loop or while-loop where you match the first variable in command against the rest of the values and check if their sums equal the target

5607236
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
of course transitions only work in firefox safari and i think google-chrome

5607240
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	iqueryable	icollection	iqueryable
much like we have linq providers for ienumerable iqueryable and iobservable it feels like we could should have a provider for something like iobservablecollection where iobservablecollection icollection inotifycollectionchanged or something similar

5607263
verilog	hdl
you have verilog hdl tags so assuming this is for synthesizable logic

5607340
post	get
since the get and post will propagate the cookie the queries for one user will always go to the same server

5607340
apache	nginx
apache s mod_proxy is a common choice though nginx is up and coming

5607352
ubuntu	centos
i m using small-footprint versions of ubuntu 904 and centos 5.5

5607364
vim	emacs
vi vim and emacs have somewhat of a learning curve but both are worth the invested time

5607373
implements	extends
you could extends it to take a message - but if you use the method as i do that is as a reminder that there is still something to be implements then usually there is no need for additional messages

5607383
firefox	safari
works perfectly in firefox safari and chrome.

5607415
haskell	scheme
haskell doesn t readily give you ways to introspect or execute call stacks so i wouldn t worry too much about that particular bizarre scheme

5607425
google-chrome	firefox
tested it in ie google-chrome firefox

5607466
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
if successful calloc malloc realloc reallocf and valloc functions return a pointer to allocated memory

5607479
gitolite	gitosis
when trying to set up either gitosis i understand this is deprecated for the git community per or gitolite it seems as though as soon as i set it up i have to be extremely careful because it seems everything is balancing on toothpicks

5607584
haskell	ocaml	ocaml	ada
finally with a strongly statically typed language like java ada ocaml haskell ... some mistakes can be uncovered at compile time and hence reduce the risk to provide an bugged program

5607589
spaces	delimiter
delimiter is spaces or comma

5607606
equals	gethashcode
the problem is that doesn t override equals and gethashcode which is what will use when trying to find an item

5607606
equals	gethashcode
in fact it will use the default equality comparer which means it ll use the implementation if the object implements it and fall back to equals gethashcode if necessary

unsigned	short
if you are using ieee-754 why not access the float or double as a unsigned short or unsigned long and save the floating point data as a series of bytes then re-convert the specialized unsigned short or unsigned long back to a float or double on the other side of the transmission .

5608411
jquery	simplemodal
since simplemodal is a plugin it depends on jquery try including jquery in your manifest before the other scripts

5608455

this allows user agents to represent other methods such as post put and delete in a special way so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested

5608628
post	get
implement post redirect get as per daz lewis s link to ensure that hitting refresh on the browser won t resubmit the form

5608628
post	get
finally add a hidden field session variable etc. as per matt greer and alison s suggestion so if something does get through - connection times out in between the post and redirect and user hits refresh on browser - you don t double-process it at your back end

my goal is to measure user and system time of parent process and all his children separately

5608988
post	get
the login page sends a post get request to a script that generally checks the username password combo against data in a database a database

5608997
width	height
i thought setting the height and width might change things

5609025
children	parent
the code will not work because it will increment it s own local copy of counter and quit leaving the version in the parent process all other children untouched

5609031
width	margin
#centercontent either needs to be the same width as the container div so that text will fill up that space 950px or it needs to have a margin 0px auto

5609110
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

5609112

it looks like you are using some version of gcc on some version of windows so i suspect all you need to do is provide -dwin_i386 to g++

5609148
google-chrome	safari
i ve been hacking at jquery isotope for awhile now and i am having an issue in google-chrome safari in particular

5609148

the layout renders out like this in google-chrome safari

5609148
firefox4	safari	google-chrome	safari

5609298
outputstream	inputstream
i have a general socket implementation consisting of an outputstream and an inputstream

5609362
move	drag
note that this finds the innermost window at that point you could use childwindowfrompoint starting from the desktop window to just get the top-level window if you want that. it s up to you to decide whether you want to update your ui at every mouse move throughout the drag or just when the user releases the mouse button

5609362
move	drag
note that you ll get mouse move events both during the drag and also if the user just happens to move the mouse pointer across your control perhaps on the way to some other control

5609362
mouseup	mousedown
the simplest way to tell these two cases apart is to use a flag in your control that you set when you get the mousedown and clear when you get the mouseup and only process mouse move events if that flag is set

5609390
width	height
the should be fixed by specifying the width and height of the images

5609451
jobs	cron
i have cron jobs that do the same thing hourly or daily and i don t think it s much of an issue

5609466
for-loop	loops
and i cannot initialize it before the for-loop because the values needed to be associated with it are in two separate for loops like i mentioned which are not nested

5609513
width	height
you can change the height and width to fit your requirements

5609528
for-loop	loops
while using python the most obvious way is usually the best way to do it so walking through your list in a python for-loop in this case will undoubtley be better than o nâ² loops in c with the cound and index methods

5609546
ienumerable	iqueryable
when you create a linq query it doesn t actually do anything with the source data yet it just builds up an expression of ienumerable iqueryable interfaces which build upon each other

5609556
httprequest	httpresponse
here is an example of how you can set this up mocking httpcontext httprequest and httpresponse for unittests using moq

5609573

you can use a conversion block to convert back and forth between binary boolean types and various int int8 uint8 int16 etc. or floating point single or double types

5609606
appfuse	spring
if you are starting from scratch i would further recommend you to check out tools like spring roo or appfuse

5609628
versioning	upgrade
also if infragistics offer an upgrade your project type functionality when you install a new versioning make sure it hasn t left stray references or using statements or incorrect variable declarations that reference older versioning of the componentry

i mostly use the design books to get an understanding of how i would build such a system and i use sources such as highscalability to learn about the architecture of various companies just look at the all time favorites tab on the right and you will see post regarding the architecture of youtube twitter google amazon flickr and even this site .

5609786
width	height
i want the textarea to have a certain width and height 80 10 but no matter what values i put in it s always the same size and looks like this

5609793

5609807
getter	setter
i think that i am a bit confused about ios property getter and setter

5609811
uiview	subviews
uiview retains its subviews so it s responsible for releasing them

5609813
folder	directory
i am thinking about developing a custome directory folder merge tool as part of learning functional programming as well as to scratch a very personal itch

5609892
tcplistener	tcpclient
i m using tcpclient and tcplistener along with the binaryformatter class to do the heavy lifting

5609892
getter	setter
all string properties on my objects are base64 encoded in the setter and decoded in the getter

5609918
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
storing a hash md5 or sha1 of the password preferably with a salt added and then comparing that to a hash of the entered password each time is a better approach

5609922
inherited	properties
my guess is that the hr tag has inherited a properties somehow

5609929
google-chrome	firefox
this works on firefox 3.6 ie 8 google-chrome

5609934
width	height
solved in case anyone has this problem the third and fourth values in the setselect params mean the second x and y positions not the width and height from the first point

5609935
post	get
i am new to php and i am wondering how to catch errors that occur when using get on post parameters

5610015
accessor	properties
the owner class must be the class that calls registerattached and must also define the static accessor methods get and set so that the xaml parser knows what to do when you try to set the attached properties on a dependencyobject instance

5610015
accessor	properties
so it s a little different because for an attached properties there usually isn t a wrapper any code access just uses the get and set accessor

5610016
int	double
just like a clr property if you ask does this object have a total property you know it cannot be a double now but an int later

5610052
folder	directory
by default eclipse copies all the non-java files int the source folder to output directory during the build

5610069
profiling	instrumentation
i m doing some memory profiling on instrumentation and i feel like i have code that seems to be doing proper memory management

5610110
children	parent
you might also look how measure and arrange another layout works in wpf beccause thats how parent positions its children

5610111
width	height
you can do that be giving your textarea a width and height ex

5610275
changelistener	listeners
i just started learning how listeners work and don t really realize how the changelistener works

5610353
folder	directory
ldap data is stored in the internal ldap folder within the domain directory

5610403
client-side	server-side
i ll try to leave the technical jargon aside and give a more generic response since i think you might be confused with client-side and server-side scripting

5610407
accessor	ivar
the compiler will generate a set accessor that assigns the argument value to the ivar as well as retains the source argument

5610432
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
objectoutputstream so that server will catch the image through objectinputstream

5610438
submit	submission
as for the form submission use ajax to submit data to the server to do an update and get a response back to change the link to edit or something

5610438
post	get
jquery post function receives that response and there s a check there if ispublished is true get the pop-up s opener window your main window and update the link to edit

5610448
hex	binary
computers convert binary data into the hexadecimal hex number system because

5610464
onresume	onpause
the activity reads this variable and then pauses the music in its onpause method and resets is when the call is done and the activity resumes the music in its onresume method

5610465
ostream	istream
the generated c++ class has functions to read write to stream serializetoostream ostream stream and parsefromistream istream stream

5610472
hex	binary
in order to convert a binary into hex you only have to build groups of for and do a substitution for each block

5610538
margin	height
so if you did actually want the footer to be 20px below the floats no matter what their height are you would put the 20px as a bottom margin onto the two floats so it the footer would clear via clearance rule 1 the floats with the required gap margin no matter which was float the longest

5610541
winpcap	libpcap
if you want to build way too much knowledge of your operating environment into your application you can always use libpcap or winpcap or similar tools to sniff the wire for incoming traffic but a this requires elevated privileges which is often a horrible idea b is really unrelated to most communication server tasks

5610543
many-to-many	one-to-many
the problem is that ef is not able to infer correctly the mapping because it doesn t know if visitors collection in location class is part of declared many-to-many relation or one-to-many relation it can t be part of both

5610543
many-to-many	one-to-many
my example defines that one-to-many relation doesn t have navigation property on location so ef now knows that it is part of many-to-many relation

5610570
decoder	encoder
i do not know any good movie encoder decoder system running in java

5610599
width	height

5610626
hex	binary
computers don t convert binary to hex any more than they convert binary to decimal

5610626
hex	binary
binary and hex are rather easily convertible because a hex character is exactly 4 bits one of 16 values 0-15 and two hex characters are 8 bits one octet

5610627
width	height
the following script will give the actuall height and width of the image.

5610644
jobs	cron
you probably don t have shell access and cannot get real cron jobs

5610647
put	get
now printf is a function that can get a variable number of arguments it parses the string which is always the first argument and decide where to put a value from the given arguments

5610647
next	except
if the arguments are pushed to the stack in function call which is the case most of the time than printf will see d and put the next int on the stack as the number and so on since you didn t assign arguments except of the basic string the data on the stack is not related to the function call it is related but it s not what you want

5610668
updatepanel	scriptmanager
don t use the ajax control toolkit asp.net ajax library updatepanel or the scriptmanager control

pop-up	dialog
the easiest way to find this in xcode4 is to run instruments cmd-i and in the dialog that pop-up asking you which instrument to use choose zombies

5610762
pop-up	dialog
then do whatever to cause the crash and you will see a dialog pop-up with zombie messaged

5610787
hash	md5
i m just doing this in my cms most systems would allow a filename of 255 characters and you could create a long md5 hash by using manipulations of the string

5610801
for-loop	loops
is unnecesery because when then for-loop finish working and for-loop-body doesn t call so remove this line and put instead of it close loops

5610818
iprincipal	iidentity
an iprincipal contains an iidentity that has a name an isauthenticated and authenticationtype properties

5610818
iprincipal	iidentity
when you access an application an iprincipal and iidentity are created and assigned to httpcontext.current.user and thread.currentprincipal to provide security information for any action that may be taken during the lifetime of the request

5610818
iprincipal	iidentity
since asp.net mvc is built on top of the asp.net processing pipeline the place where you would want to set your own iidentity and iprincipal is the same

5610837

5611321
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i m seeing a pause of between 0.5 seconds and 1 second between viewwillappear being called and viewdidappear being called on the presented table view controller

5611321

so i initially thought it would be mapped as two many relationships but as far as i can tell the name of the constant i am passing to the many method is used to create the getter setter which wouldn t work for me if i had two many relationships for the same type

5613179
getter	setter
then it s my understanding that i will then have getter and setter generated for the users property

5613239

i would probably need code but i am assuming you know the width and height x and y position of your objects and that they are rectangular

5613300
width	height
check if object 1 s y + height is greater than object 2 s y + height and that object 1 s x + width is greater that object 2 s x

width	height
i need to select a wallpaper from resolution of width or height from a table called wallpaper

5613511
width	height
you can use or here to get something with a certain width or height for example

5613523
width	height
if the type of your height and width field is numeric so i would save the width and height as int range -2.147.483.648 - 2.147.483.647 should be enough because it is not usually that resolutions have got any decimals then try to take the 1600 not as string as you do because here the 1600 is set in single quotianion marks but as number and delete the quotation marks

5613577
profiling	instrumentation
use time profiling in instrumentation to see which is the offending code

5613599

5613746
udp	tcp
the udp vs tcp decision will probably i say probably as i am not a professional game dev just a hobby dev boil down to the amount of traffic you expect to send receive the networking conditions the durability of the program in case of packet loss and the expected number of concurrent users

5613746
udp	tcp
then again some games might even use a combination of tcp and udp for tasks with different requirements in speed and reliability

5613796
ssl	https	udp	tcp
use an rpc protocol over tcp to setup a subscription authentication service it may be useful to read up on xmpp - do a one time authentication your best bet is probably x509 ssl https via wcf which would work like a passive ftp...connect to me server then i ll give you a new port to connect to where i ll as in me the server will be broadcasting media - then use udp as your transport mechanism for your video audio assuming that s what you re trying to do

5613809
versioning	upgrade
as always make sure to the read the change log and upgrade instructions when updating to a new versioning

5613820
portrait	landscape
but consider that this device can be easily changed from portrait to landscape modes and applications are expected to respond to that change

5613820
portrait	landscape
each of those recall would need to describe fonts differently in portrait mode and landscape mode

5613820
subpixel	retina
i m guessing that this is not too different from the thought process that led apple to eschew subpixel font rendering in favor of hoping that display technology increases pixel density to the point where it is no longer necessary the retina display on the iphone 4 being the first step in that direction.

5613884
profiling	debugging
each line of the debugging output both in the output window when running in a simulator and in the debugging console screen when viewed on a device will contain your debugging message the thread number on which the call was made useful for thread ui debugging and the date time of the log statement with a millisecond timestamp for performance profiling

it works fine for me using safari firefox and google-chrome

5614318
for-loop	arrays
if the api doesn t expose a way to count the total number of records including to get an arrays of the remaining records and count that you could use the php output buffering functions ob_start etc. to cache the data inside a for-loop counting to 8 and only print the results if the count reached 8 or more

5614322
tiff	png	png	tga
advise me an image loader library which could load such formats as jpg png tiff tga

5614351
hash	md5
i want to then send the bytes of a md5 hash of the file over the response stream

5614365
hash	md5
send the md5 hash first since it has a known length

5614373
hash	md5
assuming you can rely on the file not to change i would read the file once and compute the md5 hash set that as a header and then write the file out as the complete body

5614388
cfstring	nsstring
abmutablemultivalueref is a cftyperef so perhaps casting the result of abrecordcopyvalue to cfstring instead of nsstring would be the simple solution

5614405
int	chars
a c string is simply a null-terminated sequence of chars 8-bit signed int on most systems

5614405
int	chars
a wide string with chars of type wchar_t typically 16-bit int can also be used to hold larger chars values

5614420
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
the exact warning is naming conflict imagetitle conflicts with a method already on nsobject or nsmanagedobject

5614442
hash	md5
you can make the md5 hash a separate resource in your servlet namespace

5614442
hash	md5
your code that computes the md5 can do so while the file is being downloaded and write to the file system or store the hash in a cache possibly persistent.

you can use getter and setter

5614736
pop-up	dialog
one thing to note here is that if you donâ t provide a css class then the modal pop-up will not function like a modal dialog one will be able to interact with the controls in the back of the pop-up control so its imperative to provide a valid css class name value to the backgroundcssclass property

5614767
viewdidload	viewdidappear
also i m using viewdidload for doing everything tried viewdidappear as well but that didn t seem to work out as well

5614839

you need to wrap the image in a containing element and assign the width height and overflow to that

5614849
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu linux 10.04 and a pentium r t4300 processer if it matters

5614891

it might be better to add the eclipse folder should contain the eclipse executable eclipse.ini the plugins directory and the features directory

5614901

printf	strlen
when trying to compute how much memory is needed to concat two strings to a new block of memory it was said that using printf was preferred over strlen as shown below

5615181
printf	strcpy	printf	strlen	strlen	strcpy
one advantage would be that the input strings are only scanned once inside the printf instead of twice for the strlen strcpy solution

5615208
printf	strlen
if you only need to determine how big would be the concatenation of the two strings i don t see any particular reason to prefer printf since the minimum operations to determine the total length of the two strings is what the two strlen calls do

5615281

if you make your server accept cgi parameters for the width and height of the image and have your server perform the resizing then you can reduce the amount of i o and you can also implement the resizing in a language that can do it much faster using c or c++ with the opencv library

5615287
printf	strlen
the advantage that i can see here is that strlen null might cause a segmentation fault while at least glibc s printf handles null parameters without failing

5615287
printf	strlen
i wouldn t recommend using printf instead of strlen though

5615344
post	put
maybe i m wrong but if you take the formidable example replacing post for put should work

5615351
width	height
i know i can rotate the text with css but then i have to manually set the width and height of the header which is a bit annoying as the whole table will be dynamic

5615358
min	max
there are only signed integer instructions for compare and min max

5615371
put	get
you need to either enable the ftp layer and put in your username and password so that joomla can create new directories with the proper permissions or you need to get a host that runs php as a cgi

5615383
onstart	ondestroy
2 application class onstart and ondestroy for every time the app is started or killed

5615388
filtering	grouping
if i want to both change the database and render the change on the gridview at present i am forced to change ctype grd.datasource dataview .table cell values explicitly because i don t want to lose the gridview s state like which columns are grouping which grouping rows are open which columns are filtering etc

5615422
width	height
here s a snippet of code i ve used before to wait for an image to be loaded before trying to access its width and height

5615422
width	height
it s not really any additional time it just forces your code to wait for the last stage to complete to get the width and height

5615446
fadein	fadeout
i have tried putting fadein in the callback of the fadeout function and queueing the two animations but they still don t happen sequentially

5615505
background-color	transparency
try setting the background-color of your text to transparency and see what happens

5615525
onstart	ondestroy
2 application class onstart and ondestroy for every time the app is started or killed

5615525
onresume	onpause
if not you re welcome to rig up a service that is notified on each onpause and onresume does the bookkeeping to see if there are any live activities and if there hasn t been for x period of time does your leave the app logic then shuts down

5615536
width	height
i ve been using absolute width and height lately but that s causing problems in many instances

5615536
width	height
say i want the image s height to be the same as the height of its container but the width to be proportional in that sense

5615557
width	height
all you need to do is specify only image height and width will scale proportionally

5615561
printf	strcpy	printf	strlen	strlen	strcpy
for example if you had three strings rather than two and two or more of them overlapped it would be possible that strlen str1 +strlen str2 +strlen str3 +1 exceeds size_max and wraps past zero resulting in under-allocation and truncation of the output if printf is used or extremely dangerous memory corruption if strcpy and strcat are used

5615614
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am having a problem with my jqm form not working properly in mobile browsers ipad 1 safari android dolphin but working as expected in desktop browsers google-chrome firefox safari ie9 on win7

sdl	freeglut
you can easily use it with many popular window toolkits qt sdl freeglut jogamp gtk etc. and have confidence that your application will compile on other operating systems if you wrote it properly

5615774
onresume	onpause
you can track activity lifetimes using a variety of mechanisms including setting clearing sharedpreferences in onpause onresume or use a singleton with reference counting

5615789
getter	setter
you might be interested in implementing the idataerrorinfo interface on your viewmodel therefore implementing validation logic there instead of right on the properties getter setter

5615803
jobs	cron
the cron handler finds a list of specific jobs to run and creates a task queue event for each discrete task

5615809
post	get
stuff like this is usually done with a post request not a get request

5615814
post	get
however i think instead of fiddling around with mod_security rules its better that you figure out a way to send the code in a post var rather than get

5615888
getter	setter
i defined some getter and setter for this but getting some type error

5615938
implements	extends
just a class that extends broadcastreceiver and implements the onrecieve context intent method of it

5615945
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however in the browsers i ve tested google-chrome safari on osx firefox on win7 the answer is

5615948
hide	show
i have read that the ipad must use a uipopovercontroller to view the photolibrary however i have edited the code to make it the popover show but it does not hide when i choose a picture

5615995
folder	directory
eclipse simply has the tree view and when you click on a folder it lists all the sub-directories and files quickly cluttering the tree and making it harder to navigate to different directory

5615998
short	base
i have 4 objects novel short story non-fiction sci-fi all of which extend from a book base class

5616013

i simply want to be able to have a signed-in user be able to submit a submission and then have rails understand that there is a relationship between the current_user and the submission they just wrote

5616145
folder	directory
you will need to add the appropriate sub folder to your library directory which is just below the include directory options

5616156
ubuntu	debian
i m wondering if this is a bug or if i m misunderstanding something - i know ubuntu and debian have many differences perhaps this is just one of them

5616184
post	get
one problem i can see is that your ajax options in your razor view specify the get http method but the action filter on the controller action specifies post

5616210
factors	matrix
specifically i need only the right-hand side variables i need the output to be a matrix not a data frame and i need factors to be converted to a series of dummy variables

5616231
margin	height
so it should have an exact margin from the top and from the bottom at 30px and then the wrapper itself can expand related to the browser height but it will always be a specific distance from the top and bottom of the browser

5616263
margin	height
this will give it a 30px top and bottom margin and it will adjust with your window height

5616278
versioning	upgrade
the least amount of work probably would be to upgrade to a modern versioning of visual c++ and become a c++ developer

5616295
margin	height
one simple way is to put some padding on to simulate a margin on your and then make your 100 height

5616315
getter	setter
properties give you dot syntax the ability to customise the setter and or getter and the copy attribute for automatic copy on assignment but if you need none of these you can simply use the an instance variable

5616335
subtract	add
so if i can detect how many pixels the page has moved i can just add or subtract that to the location of the div

5616363
for-loop	loops
why is that the while loops returns a result of 1 through to 11 whilst the for-loop returns a result of 1 through to 10

5616379
getter	setter
define these classes as java beans ie just getter and setter no logic attached

5616401
for-loop	loops
the increment in a for-loop executes after the first loops

5616518
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter works but unfortunately mouseleave is called as soon as the user right-clicks

5616566
width	height
what must change is the uiscrollview contentsize which defines height and width for data inside it

5616566
margin	height
you can calculate it using each inside element s height and by adding the correct margin

5616571
hide	show
my goal is to show a series of embedded youtube videos on one page but allowing the user to hide or show any youtube video by clicking a button associated with a specific youtube video on the page

5616571
hide	show
for each iteration of the for-loop a youtube video will pop up with a corresponding button which will allow the user to hide or show the youtube video

5616571
hide	show
for example when there are two youtube embed codes uploaded two buttons are created but when i click either of the two buttons it will only show or hide the first youtube embed

5616598
put	get
i m trying to get an iframe innerhtml in order to put that in a div innerhtml

5616606
accelerometer	gyroscope
the bestfornavigation setting uses the accelerometer and gyroscope to offset this

5616612
hide	show
i haven t tested this but my assumption is that when your javascript executes to hide show that id it s only picking up the first id by that name that it finds

5616616
hide	show
you need to create unique id s for each div to show or hide ie

5616631
octal	decimal
what you re seeing is 032 is an octal representation and 32 is decimal

5616647
getter	setter
here s a simpler method which uses a simple getter and setter to marshal strings to enums

5616669
width	height
and it s actually for height but to make explaining simpler im just asking for the width

5616728
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this problem does not happen in google-chrome safari firefox or older versions of ie

5616730
post	get
this is because your topic_update method will treat as a get method where as you want it as a post method

5616735
put	get
the problem is that no matter whether i put bino sale cart or any of the other 36 icons in the sprite as the second class after the icon class i still just get the background image located at 0px 0px of the png file

5616735
google-chrome	safari
the weird part is that it displays perfectly in the dreamweaver design view but as soon as i go to live view or preview in google-chrome safari etc the icons all switch to the default icon instead of being shifted

5616764
post	get
if you are using any of the outdated browsers then this could be your problem otherwise you should post your code here on stackoverflow to get help

5616773
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i usually target ie 789 google-chrome firefox safari and opera and i haven t seen many browser issues that are specific to jquery or jquery-ui

5616811
profiling	debugging
to implement an external statistical profiling for python you re going to need some general debugging tools that let you interrogate another process as well as some python specific tools to get a hold of the interpreter state

5616821
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
for now this needs to be done on only the desktop environments which runs on top of x window system like gnome kde and xfce

5616832
put	get
you cannot get a number pad on ipad.you yourself have to put a check what the user has entered from keyboard if its not number show them an alert to enter numbers

if you re using addeventlistener use preventdefault on the event passed into it

5616958
tokudb	myisam
if you want to shrink your myisam innnodb s data usage by more than 5x then use tokudb

5616958
innodb	myisam	innodb	tokudb	tokudb	myisam
tokudb blows innodb and myisam out of the waters in specific situations but is not a general replacement db engine for everything under the sky

5617012
folder	directory
and inside the program files xamp php folder i noticed a pear directory

5617045
for-loop	arrays
to copy the content of an arrays to another arrays use the for-loop

5617045
for-loop	arrays
ps for a one-dimensional arrays you can avoid creating your own for-loop by using arrays.copyof

5617047
width	height
i used width x height dimensions of 320x480 and it is basically exactly what i needed

5617050
portrait	landscape
mine is still animating though from the initial portrait orientation of the window not settable to landscape in ib

advantage of having rds instance is you don t have to worry about backups and versioning upgrade

5617155
opera	google-chrome
after a one more day of brain storming i figure it out make the menu working flawlessly in google-chrome moz opera though it still have some issues in ie prior to 9 versions due to css3 support but the sliding position also worked in ie8 below.you can use pie to support it in ie8 prior i guess

5617221
inherited	properties
if task order and transmission all inherited from a base class like properties then you could expose a common method for getting the values you need

5617249
width	height
therefore if you dont set a height width the dimensions of div.sitemap and the ul are effectively 0

5617249
width	margin
since you are hard coding positioning anyhow you might as well just switch to floats and hardcode the width and margin padding instead

5617343
free	malloc
you should have as many calls to malloc as to free

5617343
free	malloc
here you call malloc in a loop which mean that you will have many more calls to it than to free

5617350
pull	push
these are repositories other than the one on your local disk which you can push your changes into so that other people can see them or pull from so that you can get others changes

5617373
put	get
a pattern would look something like but i cannot get that to work in and i am not really sure where to put it in schema.xml

5617448
pull	push
it tells git what to do with the local master branch when you do a git pull or a git push

5617448
pull	push
the default for git push and git pull is to work with the current branch s remote

5617455
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox google-chrome etc but ie9 doesn t display the shadow

5617492

5617605
installation	upgrade
i just upgrade my xampp installation to 1.7.4

5617611
width	height
if your string will contain more html with their own width height attributes you don t want replaced then you ll need a more robust solution

5617619
free	malloc
malloc error for object 0x4e226a4 incorrect checksum for free object - object was probably modified after being free

5617653
tostring	getter
edit for clarity i want to do this without asking objects for data by using getter or any other method like tostring which reveals the internal implementation of an object

5617709
width	height
the issue is that you re setting constant pixel values for the height and the width

5617716
width	height
pull the a element out of the natural rendering flow using position absolute and make it s height and width large enough to cover the area in question

5617719
client-side	server-side

5617788
formpanel	gridpanel
for ex i have a formpanel and a gridpanel when it s submitted it goes as a single json store into the controller

5617822
codeigniter	kohana
there are php frameworks like kohana derived from codeigniter which do this kind of mapping urls to functions and classes but this is very difficult and in your case it would be better to keep on using the addcustomer.php solution

5617875
int	double
as an aside the division in your sample code won t do what you want either - you should cast one of the operands to double if you want it to execute floating point division instead of int division.

5617901
postgresql	mysql
there s something not quite as nice in logilab.database but which works quite well supports sqlite mysql postgresql and some versions of mssql and some abstraction mechanisms on the sql understood by the different backend engines

instead of mod_python i would suggest you to use mod_wsgi as there are many wsgi-using frameworks like flask cherrypy bottle etc.

5618048
memmove	malloc	strcpy	malloc	strcpy	memmove	free	malloc	free	memmove	free	strcpy
at 1 you would be assigning the address of a memory address that has already been free you have to do another malloc to and then copy it with memmove or strcpy if you want to free best

5618053
width	height
you can compare the sreen width to the browser width or height

5618057
ubuntu	linux
it s defined in on my ubuntu linux system usr include time.h however the definition stretches back all the way to usr include bits types.h where __slongword_type which is what __time_t_type is defined to is defined

5618058
memcpy	malloc	free	memcpy	free	malloc
so either don t free best until you are done with match or you will need to malloc a new buffer and memcpy the contents from one buffer to the other

5618067
strcpy	malloc
yes you can malloc and strcpy

5618094
printf	strcpy
you don t need to use strcpy to copy best to match - you ll be better off freeing it after the printf or the last point that it is needed

5618166
equals	compareto
the contract of the compareto .. method is to return -1 -ve number when this object is smaller than the object passed as parameter 0 when they are equals and +1 +ve number when this object is greater than the other object

5618186
uiview	subviews
you could come up with a nib based solution by putting all affected subviews within a parent uiview and load just that parent view from a nib and then replace the parent uiview only but i don t recommend it

5618192
gmail	hotmail
i m using sqlite3 to try and find users who have an e-mail address that is either with gmail yahoo or hotmail

this is typically much slower than using native floating-point but google has a lot of cpu available and i bet only a tiny fractions of the work their search-handling machines do has anything to do with the calculator.

5618432
division	modulo
then at the end of the whole thing you try to add p2.x and i believe thats why you get the error cannot convert float nan to integer and not zerodivisionerror integer division or modulo by zero

5618440
setinterval	settimeout
btw since you are recursively calling settimeout you may want to use setinterval instead

5620399
public	protected
considering that you mention the constants being used somewhere else we can say that they should be declared in either the protected if they are to be used exclusively by derived classes or more likely the public section of the class

5620464
versioning	upgrade
i don t know your particular host but if they cannot upgrade you to a newer mysql you should try to downgrade your development server to run the same versioning as your production server - a lot of things have changed since 4.0 and catching them early might be a good idea

5620481
width	height
i can change only the height of the code via barheight property but not the width

5620619

5620766
opera	firefox

because i think latest opera mini and firefox 4 for android will not support css3 as much as web-kit browsers do

5620861
public	protected
anything declared in public can be used by any object within the class or outside the class variables in private can only be used by the objects within the class and could not be changed through direct access as it can chanfe through functions like friend function .anything defined under protected section can be used by the class and their just derived class

5621100
getter	setter
tip eclipse can generate compliant getter setter for you

declared properties fundamentally take the place of accessor method declarations

5621139
accessor	properties
when you synthesize a properties the compiler only creates any absent accessor methods

5621765
width	height
my experience is that large images that are resized via the html width height attribute tend to flicker in certain browsers

i presume that invocation of alertdialog triggers onpause method and the onresume should be called before activity is actually shown and ready for interaction with user

5621775
google-chrome	firefox
i get the same behavior in all major browsers google-chrome firefox ie which makes me suspect that i must be doing something fundamentally wrong here but i m not sure what it is

5622026
screens	tablet	screens	mdpi	tablet	mdpi
for tablet width xhdpi screens you could apply the same calculation multiply by 2 the dimensions of mdpi images 320dpi vs 160dpi

the broadcast should be displayed in a html5 page using the tag which support rtp and rtsp i think

5623937
hash	salt
normally you wouldn t encrypt a users password you d just hash it with a salt instead

5623942
hash	md5
you should only store a hash of the password sha is a good one don t use md5 and then when the user attempts to log in you hash the input and compare the two results

5623943

5623988
serializable	deserialization
that might still be too big for you in which case you ll have to roll your own for serializable deserialization though you could use the barton-nackman idiom to keep the code readable and still use a simply serializable function

5624012
put	get
i am trying to implement a lotto game on the ipod and i need to parse the actual lotto page to get the winning numbers and to put them in an array to compare them with the numbers that the user had entered and find out if he is a winner or not

5624026
equals	icomparable
you may want to update the equals code to see if the objects implement icomparable as well though

5624044
for-loop	loops
you will need to bind back to the type of model and use a for-loop not a for each loops in your view

5624112
mousemove	mouseup
just like what you have done with the mouseup you should set the mousemove on the document

5624134
stdout	stderr
in the meantime if you really want to discard stdout stderr it seems best on linux to invoke processbuilder on a command that looks like

this layout concept is similar to swing and awt layouts

5624473
udp	tcp
we do this a lot tcp udp serial other protocols

5624526

using an interface among multiple classes ensures that all subclassing have to implement those methods and thus the objects could be stored in an instance of the superclass to allow for dynamic programming

5624549
kindle	nook
it allows software programmers to build mobile applications for the iphone ipad and android devices including the nook blackberry os10 and kindle fire

5624554
post	get
if i now use a post request the parameters should get also populated to the action

5624554
post	get
get post parameters have nothing to do with the input parameters for the action

5624589
terminate	timeout
bash terminate on timeout file overflow while executing command

5624755
firefox	safari
this is what we see in safari and chrome. it looks like firefox is actually rendering the svg to the size of the canvas and then blowing it up with image interpolation to your cropped region

5624778
macports	homebrew
i recently converted from macports to homebrew and my previous macports imagemagick install was working fine

5624778

5624788
integer	unsigned
unrelated since c++ now has 65663 questions and so far 164 have been asked today that means that only just today the number of c++ tagged questions exceeded a 16-bit unsigned integer

5624825
oncreate	onstart
i have tried creating an if statement initially set to false around all the code inside of the overridden method but there is no way of knowing when to set it to true because the overridden method runs after the oncreate onstart and onresume methods everytime

i know how to do this with inputstream reader outputstream writer combo and array buffer but this time i m dealing with bytechannel s

5624863
tiff	png	tiff	bmp	bmp	png	gif	bmp	gif	png
also you can see that the abstract bitmapdecoder class in this example is assigned a jpegbitmapdecoder instance but you could get an instance of another decoder for your image type tiff gif png bmp and wmp are also supported

5624876
graphicsmagick	im4java
imo the best approach is using graphicsmagick image processing system with im4java as a comand-line interface for java

5624876
etsy	flickr
sites flickr and etsy

5624894
ant	maven
it is mainly used for them but you are confusing ant for maven

5624925

pull	push
then you can work on local branch fix and do push and pull without other arguments

5625038
int	double
cannot implicitly convert type double to int

5625039
postorder	inorder
insertion can be done iteratively but inorder traversal for dumping the results and postorder traversal for deleting the tree when done both require either recursion or an explicit stack

5625054
super	implements
the upside to this method is that it is trivial to implements and super easy to use from anywhere in your code

5625063
int	double
you say you want an int cast but you actually need to cast to a double

5625063
int	double
otherwise you need to change refurb_rate from a double to an int

5625069
int	double
refurb_rate int double totalrefurb totalunits 100

5625069
int	double
make sure you case the int to double otherwise 1 2 will equal zero instead of .5

5625073
vmware	virtualbox
in other words you run the x86 build of android in virtualbox vmware or whatever and dispense with the overhead of emulating an arm processor

5625086
profiling	debugging
a good way to debugging this is to run your program through the concurrency profiling in visual studio 2010

5625099
int	double
i don t understand your error because refurb_rate is a double and everything else is an int

5625103
vb6	vba
using the code the the following this article vba vb6

5625123
portrait	landscape
i will be beginning to port a portrait-only app to work for both landscape and portrait screen orientations

5625183
mouseleave	mouseenter
nothing wrong with that except that hover is actually two events in one mouseenter and mouseleave

5625183
mouseover	mouseout
so it looks like you ll have to use mouseover and mouseout which are quite a bit more complicated because of how event bubbling works

5625203
for-loop	arrays
you do have a problem with your for-loop - you re going go one past the end of the arrays which might be what s causing your segmentation fault

5625208
submit	submission
to stop the form from submission create an onsubmit handler that tells it not to submit

5625212
getter	setter
if you have a document class in your swf then rather than using parameters in the constructor create a public init method with your parameters or even use getter and setter

5625223
rfcomm	l2cap
you cannot do it over rfcomm spp - connecting to a2dp uuid is not enough - the profile connection profile level protocol procedures need to be done to implement a2dp - more over a2dp directly works over l2cap protocol and does not require rfcomm

5625262
fileoutputstream	filewriter
or opened by filewriter fileoutputstream its deleting the file

5625267

5625330
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine with firefox v4 but google-chrome v10 just shows the middle column

5625332
lisp	prolog
it can be done in all lisp dialects where this feature originated under the name eval as well as in prolog call 1 and any number of other languages

5625336
folder	directory
further investigation shows that if you add a directory containing your plist files as a folder reference xcode will not look inside it it will simply copy its contents into the produced bundle

google-chrome	firefox
if i navigate to the pages manually in ie google-chrome or firefox 4.0 i don t see any problems on the page and in the browser console

5625425
width	height
the width and height remain zero

5625434
for-loop	arrays
note that the for-loop is executed for array_length - 1 items not array_length items since arrays j+1 would be out of bounds in the last iteration

5625444
int	double
assuming that means exponentiation and that q is runtime variable use std pow double int

5625444
int	double
about the missing function and in fact pow double int wasn t removed in c++0x just the language was changed

5625533
put	get
put this part somewhere that won t get changed every tick

5625542
nstimer	nsrunloop
use timer cfrunlooptimer nstimer and run loop cfrunloop nsrunloop apis to accomplish this

what i did was implements my own appender which extends the appenderskeleton and takes the loggingevent object where the message returned by getmessage is my own object

5625674
ssms	sqlcmd
then put that in a file and run it with sqlcmd or open it in ssms

5625727
pascal	delphi
lennie s new approach is to use the phonegap framework whilst my approach targeting the next release of delphi employs the freepascal compilers and an opengl-based gui platform enabling full extensibility to develop android applications using native pascal code

5625756
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
since you are using big-endian shorts you could be using a datainputstream wrapped around a bytearrayinputstream and dataoutputstream bytearrayoutputstream on the other end rather than doing your own decoding

5625758
wadl	wsdl	post	put
you don t need wsdl nor wadl afaic documentation in rest could be plain text for developers schemas xsd rdfs...etc depending on the content types you use sitemaps for example a lot of links and post put templates for example to mimic forms in html

5625869
post	get
i am not sure at the moment what is causing the problem but if i ever get around to figuring it out i ll post that too

5625903
table-per-subclass	fluent
from all of the documentation i ve seen the use of a discriminator actually tells fluent to use the table-per-class rather than table-per-subclass

5625917
folder	directory
does anybody have a sample or no how to delete a lot of files and sub directory in a folder with threads and c# .net

5625923
free	malloc
for the compiler it s not safe to assume that individual malloc free pairs can be left out and their storage reused because their implementation should be outside the optimizer s scope

5625954
children	parent
i need to check to make sure that all certain elements that are children of their parent container have a specific class

5626000
classcastexception	runtimeexception
the runtimeexception you get is a classcastexception because the first is an array of int arrays and the latter just an array of ints

5626000
int	double	int	boolean	int	chars
so at compile time it could hold anything that is derived from object which is in fact every type in java except the primitive types long int short byte chars double float and boolean

width	height
i place the white screen which is actually a rectangle at 0 0 x and y coordinates respectively and my window is 800x600 width x height

5626222
passenger	unicorn
your best bet is to set up a handler as a rack application of some sort pretty much all ruby web frameworks or handlers are rack applications these days including sinatra and rails and then use passenger or a ruby server like unicorn set up as an nginx proxy

5626256
int	double
also the object it is storing to could be a string int double or float at the minimum

5626281

put	get
as you try to put in 11 04 2011 parsing this as long fails and you get the exception

5626697
mspec	nspec
mspec is also an option there has been a lot of work put into it but there are just somethings that are just simpilier in nspec you can build up context incrementally in mspec but it requires inheritance which can become complex

5626697
nunit	moq
bdd using nunit and moq

5626737
post	get
by the way so as not to plagiarize i did get the idea of using reduce from this post

5626778
min	max
i ve been doing research but everything i read leads to min max with a-b pruning as the only viable option

5626790
put	get
however if you put any html elements above the div container holding the map the elements on the map get all messed up- their positions do not shift properly within the browser window in response to the html elements added at the top of the page

onmouseover	onclick
you can get an idea on how to write onclick onmouseover events

5627030
int	double
while looking into efficient way to compute p q exponentiation where q is an int and reviewing the c++98 and c++11 standards i noticed that apparently the std pow double int overload was removed in c++11

5627030
int	double
in c++98 26.5 6 it has the double pow double int

5627030
int	double
obviously the pow double int version provides a nice opportunity for optimization so it seems odd that they would be removed

5627046

5627272
google-chrome	firefox
i tested the example in ie google-chrome and firefox and they all show the extra as text

5627278
int	double
has type double or an int type

5627278
int	double
so while the freedom is there to shuffle pow double int off to a separate algorithm most implementors i m aware of have given up on that strategy with the possible exception of checking for very small integral exponents

5627278
put	get
and in that event it is usually advantageous to put that check in the implementation with the floating point exponent so as to get the biggest bang for your optimization buck

5627307
int	chars
the function uses three arguments in c++ an unsigned int a const chars and a long

int	chars
it then converts that sequence of chars to the equivalent int value

5630091
int	chars
where isdigit is a standard library function that returns true non-zero if the chars value represents a decimal digit and valueof is a user-defined function that maps the chars representing an int 0 - 9 to the equivalent int value 0 - 9 i m not aware of a standard library function that does that for individual chars values

5631562
post	get
but remember that setting get post data will not overload current _get _post values

5631603

instead of using a background image on the body tag you should add a image tag right below body set the position to absolute and a low z-index and then have width 100 and height 100

5631826
portrait	landscape
how android radio button code but when changes from portrait to landscape selected possition appear

5631840
button	checkbox
so when you click the next button you can check whether the checkbox for review question is checked or not

5631850
accelerometer	gyroscope
coremotion would not help you much because it is an abstraction of the device s accelerometer and the gyroscope

it s not a guarantee but nearly anything is doable password files nis ldap kerberos samba active directory

5631923
webkit	gecko	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
inline mathml is also supported in html5 files in the upcoming versions of webkit safari google-chrome gecko firefox and presto opera

5631994

5632037
versioning	upgrade
see this stack overflow question core data migration across multiple versioning upgrade

5632040

since the switch to ef5 nqueries does no longer support compiled queries as it switched to dbcontext if you still would like to take a look take the 1.03 release source code which is still objectcontext based and supports compiled queries

5632071
serializable	deserialization
deserialization uses this number to ensure that a loaded class corresponds exactly to a serializable object

5632101

the problem here is that you are trying to use mysql while heroku only supports postgresql

5632213
folder	directory
go to the folder in which you want your external directory to apprear

5632287
hash	md5
the idea behind these lines of code is that we append all the values of a class model into a stringbuilder and then return the padded hash of that the java implementation returns md5 hash that are lenght 30 or 31 so the last line formats the hash to be padded with 0s

5632308
int	boolean
if you need you should create similar wrappers to deal with int boolean etc

5632320
jobs	cron
as others have said you can also set up cron jobs or scheduled tasks to automate the running of scripts at set times although i would suggest investigating a ci server like jenkins ci formally hudson that can either run tests at a set time or be triggered to run tests based on code commits

5632347
hash	salt
i suspect it was omitted from your example for brevity but you should probably hash your key from a good dose of salt

5632363
next	except
this all works well except for the slider to re-initiate after the first click next or prev doesn t matter

5632390
put	get
so calling get key on your key is going to return the value you provided with put key value

5632410
width	height
you can stretch your background to 100 width and height by putting your image in an tag and give it a z-index of -1 so it acts like a background and is behind everything else

5632410
width	height
if you do not want to break the aspect ratio just set either width or height and not both

5632452
equals	tostring
equals hashcode and tostring are public

5632465
google-chrome	firefox
it behaves as expected in firefox and google-chrome but fails in ie

5632485
hide	show
the main thing to remember when using the bbq plugin is that instead of manipulating the dom directly eg show hide things ajax loading etc you change the browser url fragment instead and then make the dom changes in the hashchange event

5632497
post	get
i am working with the httpexchange class and want to use the getattribute function to get the post parameters

5632548
svg	vml
if i used css i would set background-image for rectangles and background position but i have not found such possibility for svg and probably vml for ie

5632549
getter	setter
my relevant c# class contains the getter setter

5632586
setcontentview	findviewbyid
because findviewbyid searches in the view hierarchy set by setcontentview

5632600
implements	extends

5632632
hash	salt
here is a java code which computes sha512 hash of a byte array with salt

5632632
hash	salt
this works perfectly computes the same hash as the java code if i use the same single data the salt is nil in the java code

5632632
hash	salt
the problem is that if i want to computes hash of two nsdata there is a salt the second parameter in the java code is not nil

5632673
post	get
i am not familiar with this api but it appears that httpexchange.getattribute is not the method you would use to get post parameters

5632674
viewdidload	dealloc
you will see similar call in init dealloc viewdidload etc

5632674
viewdidload	viewwillappear
this is not the situation with viewwillappear animated or viewdidload etc

5632682
post	get
i think this post will be useful for you you can get this info from route instructions

5632745
postgresql	mysql
sqlite is a database storage engine which can be better compared with things such as mysql postgresql oracle mssql etc

5632745
postgresql	mysql
sqlalchemy can be used with sqlite mysql postgresql etc

5632760

5632767
uitableview	nsindexpath
uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

hide	show
if you have static collection of nodes and then you want to show hide them based on user accessibility then you should override isaccessibletouser

5632794
width	margin
also adding the margin to the inner div will give you better control of your layout because adding padding to a container can add unwanted width

5632809
width	height
also i only want the grayscale and i understand that the first height width bytes are grayscale data is this correct

5632869
jtabbedpane	jlabel

its working fine on ie and firefox but on google-chrome when i click on the close button which is there in the span to toggle it it does not work for the first time i click on it but works after first click

5632890
children	parent
i would recommend creating an abstract function in the parent that each of the children will implement with it s own logic

5632890
children	parent
edit since you are trying to iterate over all child objects i would recommend to create a base class that handles all the logic that needs to be implemented to all children and override it in each of the child classes that need additional logic and call the parent function inside it

5632914
getter	setter
what i think you wanna do is this when creating the new form send to the constructer the first form as an object then and make a setter getter or just make the thread public then you can access it from both forms as you requested

5632926
put	get
currently i execute a batch get for the 20 targets update the serialized value in each then execute a batch put

5632945

i have this script made with jquery which i am using to show hide divs on my page

5633007
move	drag
however i doubt that the sortable jquery library would work when using absolute positioning i must admit i ve never used it with absolute positioning it is likely that getting items to move out of the way when you drag something over them will be problematic

5633007
draggable	droppable
the jquery draggable and droppable api will help but you will need to do a lot more coding to ensure the items you move snap into position moving others out of the way when you drop them

5633050

super	self
in python 3 you don t have to and therefore propably shouldn t for simplicity explicitly inherit from object or pass the class and self to super

5636703
inherited	properties
you probably should have created your control to inherited from system.web.ui.webcontrols.dropdownlist then override rendering and add properties that you want extra this would allow you to something like the following

5636705
nsmutablestring	nsstring
if you were to use an nsmutablestring instead of an nsstring you d see funky behavior that would probably not crash but wouldn t print what you expected

he used to develop for linux but instead of coding directly in ubuntu he shared the drives with samba and used visual studio to edit the files

5636891

note the capitalization of the variable names because two of the keys in your array are capitalize

5642280
width	height

5642364
width	margin
the nav is floated left and has a negative margin the same number of pixels as the width which effectively makes it slot into a zero-width space

5642364
width	margin
it has a left margin the width of the nav so the content avoids hiding underneath the links of the nav

5642378
getter	setter
you could use javascript getter and setter

5642418
folder	directory
5 i have always been a bit reluctant on having spaces in directory names so i would copy the ext folder to the root of c somewhere for testing maybe something like c phpexts

5642456
width	margin
one variation i use with these layouts is wrapping every column with an extra inner div and setting the margin or padding on this div and nothing else this will make the width and positioning calculations a lot simpler you ll see if you check it out

5642465
min	max
clearly this will result in the min for each column to be -1 the max will be 1

5642473
getter	setter
if you made any alterations in the setter getter methods in any class in the hierarchy look closely at those methods especially if you used a primativevalue method

5642473

5642504
keydown	keyup
to simulate a keypress you would need to simulate a keydown and keyup event which would be what you specify in the msg field

5642504
keydown	keyup
use 256 for keydown and 257 for keyup

5642504
keydown	keyup
wparam and lparam are message-specific so for keyup and keydown wparam would be the key code see this page for the hexadecimal codes and lparam contains other miscellaneous information see this page

5642504
keydown	keyup
for example you can use 0 for keydown and 65539 for keyup

5642533
mouse	keyboard
where events are things like the mouse moving the keyboard being pressed and timers going off

5642547
min	max

you can program the indesign scripting api using vbscript or vb6 or vba or vb.net and ado activex data objects to write to a database

5642732
subscript	superscript
my point is that i think your goal here kerned superscript subscript text boundaries with normal text is going to result in worse layout not better

5642732
subscript	superscript
superscript subscript or normal it s all about the point size and font

5642767
width	height	titlebar	window
the width of the window includes things like the border and the height includes things like the titlebar

5642767

5643141
folder	directory
you just need to make a folder called public in the same directory as your ruby file and place your js and css files there

5643161
getter	setter
normally i use the beanstyle with getter setter for any objects

5643161
getter	setter
for example if having getter setter makes an object bigger for 5bytes per method and instance then this would dramatically add up in total with millions ob objects

5643189
getter	setter
the method implementations of getter setter are stored with the class of which there is only one in a given classloader

5643189
getter	setter
regarding performance i doubt it would be significantly slower to call simple getter setter

5643189
getter	setter
i would definitely first implement with the getter and setter and then if you find it is too slow you could potentially do away with them

5643190
getter	setter
getter and setter methods shouldn t make the objects larger just the class that represents those objects

5643190
getter	setter
it s unlikely going to matter to your performance to have getter and setter methods especially since the jvm should optimize that out

5643207
getter	setter
a getter and setter will add a small amount to the size of the class

5647705
getter	setter
because attributes instance variables generate getter methods and if rw also setter methods out of the box you should do this

5647774
superclass	subclassing
well you re trying to assign an object of a superclass type to a reference of a subclassing type and of course that s a compile-time error because it might not be valid

5647784

hide you add location button as soon as dialog is show on screen

5647893
getter	setter
in my opinion what ever marginal overhead there may be with using setter and getter is outweighed by the clean and more easily maintainable code that would most likely be easier for any .net developer off the street to pick up and run with

5647919
accessor	properties
obtaining a properties value using the get accessor would have an observable side effect

5647922
mouse	keyboard
i found out it will work if listview.activation is set to oneclick but thi is only for the mouse i want the same with keyboard arrows too

5647942
google-chrome	firefox
please the following website in google-chrome and firefox you will see the difference

5647947

5648020
versioning	upgrade
since i upgrade my monotouch to versioning 4 i have problems with the .xib.designer.cs files

5648071
post	get
this can be somewhat lessened by using the minvariance thus ignoring anything below a certain threshold but then we get even worse effects with incorrect falloff see my other post

5648137
apache	nginx
we have nginx sitting in front of apache with django deployed

5648149

i have only tested on ie8 firefox google-chrome

5648207
setinterval	settimeout
donâ t pass a string to setinterval and settimeout just pass the function itself

5648269
jar	war
this can be done by either putting this jar file inside your war file in web-inf lib directory or simply by copying it to tomcat lib directory

5648323
postgresql	mysql
limited services available it currently only supports postgresql and redis so if you want to use mysql memcached mongodb etc you are out of luck

5648373
gridview	repeater
just like we have pagesize property in gridview that allows us to switch back and forth between pages isn t there anyway i can incorporate the same functionality in a repeater

5648397
folder	directory
if mysite folder is within htdocs then you can access it using if htodcs is your home directory

5648449
inherited	subclassing
this is a real improvement over inherited for this kind of object because they are used by the core framework and you don t have to convert a nsstring object to your subclassing when you want to call your custom method

5648470
for-loop	loops
the redrawing doesn t happen at least until execution returns to the run loops and that can t happen until your for-loop finishes

5648479
int	chars
the cases when it makes sense to write binary are for other types than chars an array of int

5648509
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried this in google-chrome firefox 3 and 4 and opera with the same non-updating results

5648566
onclick	onfocus

if i start my application directly and later on attach a debugger to it like visual studio 2010 sharp develop 4 mdbg delphi 2007 windbg everything works fine

5648782
getter	setter
this way you can just use a single getter no one setter is required

5648814
hash	salt
on the server remember to hash and salt the passwords preferably using bcrypt

5648874
put	get
you would put such files not in the drawable folder but in your assets folder and you can get an input stream to these files just by using

5648910
hash	salt
javascript on client-side creates a cryptographically secure hash of the user s password and the salt

5648910
hash	salt
hash is sent to the server you can then retrieve the password from the database create a hash using the salt for the session and the password from the db and check if it is the same as the one sent from the client

5648929
hash	salt
i m using sha-512 to hash my passwords with a salt ofcourse

5648937
addition	multiplication	subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication
a simple c++ calculator program to calculate addition subtraction multiplication and addition.

5648965
getter	setter
you have to have a look at setter and getter theory

5649015
dlsym	dlopen
i m using the dlopen dlsym dlclose set of functions

5649034
client-side	server-side
the best way to do it is by using json a format for communication between server-side and client-side

5649040
qpushbutton	qwidget
i want to connect this qpushbutton to the promoted qwidget

5649040
qpushbutton	qwidget
for example i have a function on my promoted qwidget class and i want to call this function when i click the qpushbutton located at the mainwindow.ui

5649052
content-disposition	content-type
if the content-disposition header is used in a response with the application octet-stream content-type the implied suggestion is that the user agent should not display the response but directly enter a save response as... dialog

5649064
hash	salt
once you have the password you retrieve that users salt and hash password from the database

5649064
hash	salt
you take the submitted form hash it with the user-specific salt then compare it to the pre-hashed password from the database

5649064
hash	salt
in that case you should simply assign each user a unique salt hash their current plain-text password + salt and store that as their new password

5649067
google-chrome	firefox
for google-chrome and firefox add these to the css

5649072
jtextfield	jtable
there is jtable in selectcontactsfrm file to show the contacts.when user select a contact from jtable and when he she press ok button selected values should be copied into taskfrm.java s jtextfield

5649092
instances	transient
normally this indicates some problem with the serialization along the way it s supposed to return the object and all it s non transient instances variable with the values set on serialization

5649097
uicontrol	uibutton
while uibutton can take transparent images as backgrounds and uicontrol can have custom views the hit area of these is always square

5649114
ienumerable	iqueryable
so in design time the actual sequnce iqueryable or ienumerable which the call should be run against is unknown

5649131
division	multiplication
second reason is that with the sieve you only do multiplication not division

5649131
addition	multiplication
if you do it cleverly you only do addition not even multiplication

5649131
division	addition
and division has larger complexity than addition

5649131
division	addition
the usual way to do division has o n 2 complexity while addition has o n

5649137
division	addition
the first difference is that division is much more expensive than addition

5649150
width	height
if it s the dimensions you want to change then it could be as easy as changing the width and height parameters of your embed code or loading the swf into another one and displaying it behind a mask that shows only the parts you want to show

5649150
width	height
the width and height of an swf are coded inside it and could be changed with some editor like a hex editor

5649158
getter	setter
the object is mirrored by a myobject class which has getter and setter for all the variables which are of different types and will be accessed by various other classes

5649178
width	height
for a wpf application i have a user control myusrcntrl with height 300 and width 300

5649190
hash	md5
i would like to convert hash md5 sha1 etc into decimal integers for the purpose of making barcodes in code128c

5649234
mouse	keyboard
don t undervalue your display keyboard and mouse

5649292
public	protected
public protected virtual or

5649309
subclass	abstract-class
this differs from a generic class because an abstract-class knows something needs to happen but it does not know what that something actually is the subclass knows

5649328
button	checkbox
i am working on a app which has one button and a listview with checkbox one per list item and functionality required that whenever i click on this button checked items from list should be removed

5649328
button	checkbox
i saved the state of checkbox in my custom listview adapter using boolean type arraylist and trying to access it in my main activity but the problem is whenever i click on button its not removing the checked items instead its removing the items of exact amount as checked items from the bottom of the list

5649365
goto	break
continue goto break are first words that thoughts us not to use

5649371
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
the 2nd loops body executes only if an element in an arrays isn t empty while the first finds an element of an arrays that is empty and tells the for-loop to continue

5649385
children	parent
a client can have many children but can only have a single parent so it s a many-to-1 relationship

5649406
goto	break
i use continue or sometimes break or goto in the middle of the loop but always put it all on one line so continue cannot accidentally be separated from if and always provide a comment of the form if â we re done.

5649421
width	height
if you want to extend and compress the height and width of your usercontrol then make the parent controls and and don t assign any height and width to your controls present inside usercontrol

5649508
put	get
any user opening word will then always get a different instance of word and will not see what you have put on the document unless you have saved it and they open the saved document

5649533
getter	setter
i m not sure to understand how could be implemented setter and getter for these 2 properties to refer to the private ivars

5649536
put	get
if i put there just item i get result

5649556
for-loop	arrays
if i try to remove the markers in random order the first one is removed but then the others just stop working the listener still works but it seems like the for-loop doesnt find the other markers in the arrays

5649648
mouse	keyboard
mouse pad and keyboard pad with wrist rests necessary for long coding sessions

5649657
prepare	execute
normally you d prepare a statement and then you d only send different values when you execute it inside of loops

5649674
cakephp	yii
it takes long to set up and you can import the zend library functions in pretty much any other framework including cakephp and yii

5649761
mouse	keyboard
you do not want to keep it so busy that one core is burning 100 load for the main thread that s going to be perceptible by the user when the ui thread starts responding sluggishly to mouse and keyboard input

5649775
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
in the modern runtime used pretty much everywhere at this point you don t actually have to declare the ivar at all -- if you synthesize accessor for a properties and there s no matching ivar the runtime will provide one

5649775
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
finally properties with dynamic rather than synthesized accessor don t necessarily need an ivar at all -- you re providing the accessor in this case so you re free to derive the value of the properties however you like

5649835
width	height
you can change the width height to match the size of your background image

5649864
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you stick with ienumerable or iqueryable then you are hiding the nuances of the entity framework behaviour from the client but still getting the advantages like lazy loading and deferred execution

5649869
width	height
what i want to happen is the two button areas to not do any height growth but would allow width growth

5649879
put	get
but nuget wants to put the associated files in scripts which would get way too messy

5649937
min	max
skor means point sure means time --- max point min time multiple order

5649937
min	max
but skor max value and sure min value and userid must be only one as you see there is 6 userid 2 i want the only max value

5649942
width	height
to shrink images that are too large simply insert the width and height attribute along with your image source and a alt along with a id

5649973
webrat	cucumber
i love running something like cucumber webrat capybara locally to hit every url exposed in the app to make sure the basic stuff is working ie

5649984
min	max
this is assuming you want the max and min per user not on the same record row

5650014
freemarker	velocity
if this kind of design is hard for you try freemarker or even something like velocity although i don t recommend it to force you to do this

5650058
background-color	transparency
but be aware that setting the background-color to transparency sometimes gets wonky in ie

5650068
expression-blend	silverlight
it will feature a timeline similar to the flash authoring tool and expression-blend a silverlight dev tool

5650078
hide	show
you could consider to render show hide components conditionally in the server side by the rendered attribute so that the generated html output is less large

folder	directory
the queues are either defined in active directory or as text files in the system32 msmq storage lqs folder for public and private respectively

5650135
opera	firefox
dragonfly opera or firebug extension for firefox or any other good javascript debugger

5650145
free	malloc
if you really do want to store items larger than 1mb you can recompile memcached with an edited slabs.c power_block value or use the inefficient malloc free backend

5650166
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

5650206
managed	loaderlock
menu item open up the managed debugging assistant item and uncheck the box next to the loaderlock label

5650212
managed	loaderlock
the loaderlock is a known bug with managed directx

5650212
xna	slimdx
the better workaround is to switch to a supported directx library such as slimdx or xna

5650348
hide	show
one thing you can do is hide the use visibility hidden as not to mess up the layout at the beginning of the process and show it at the end

5650366

5650458
pull	push

5650500
inherited	properties
if you cannot inherited from a singleton class you might as well have implemented that class using only static methods properties fields and events

5650543
int	double
described anything exact . to convert int or double

5650580
post	get
the request verb type is post rather than get

5650668
vsto	add-in
i had the same problem when deploying a new version of our vsto word add-in

5650668
installation	upgrade
after fiddling for 2 hours i found out that the installation folder url that you set in the properties of the solution where it upgrade from is case sensitive and stupidly needs to be the same case as the initial installation url

5650705
for-loop	loops
the foreach loops in the code doesn t compile while the commented for-loop works fine

5650715
yesod	happstack
you could build a website using warp the yesod team s web server heist the snap team s template system and acid-state the happstack project s persistence system

5650715
yesod	happstack
for the most part i think the choice of snap vs yesod vs happstack is less an issue of features and more one of personal taste

5650718
folder	directory
just to clarify .net has no function to delete all files in a folder at once and leaving the directory

5650788
google-chrome	firefox
do the following to get the layout the same in ie and google-chrome and firefox

5650797
ncover	dotcover
i have some builds that use ncover for test coverage analysis and some that use dotcover

5650797
ncover	dotcover
i merge the ncover dotcover summary report into the ccnet log but the item that i need to pull out into the ccnet coverage statistic is different depending on the tool because the format of the reports are different

5650797
ncover	dotcover
if i just list both sections inside the statisticlist the second one always wins so if i list dotcover second builds that use ncover have their coverage stat set to zero because the dotcover stat can t be found

5650797
ncover	dotcover
what i want is for the stat to get set to the ncover stat if it exists or to the dotcover stat if it exists

5650824
imagemagick	libjpeg
this means that you would need to use and compile a native library such as libjpeg or some full-fledged package such as imagemagick in order to support reading from various images formats

5650858
post	get
i have the class ready to accept the post data passing it into the methods to validate and finally add to the database but not sure what the correct protocol is to get it there in the first place

5650887
getter	setter
setter getter method will override

5650900
projectile	angle
offset weapon_ofs offset ft_float|ft_array 3 projectile start offset relative to eye and view angle

5651007
google-chrome	firefox
also check in the google-chrome console or firefox firebug to see if the error is getting thrown in those browsers as well

5651008
ienumerable	iqueryable
the following orderby defines a query on this list which is an ienumerable and not an iqueryable anymore

5651048

5651266
ubuntu	linux
duncan so far i ve been successful using clozure common lisp under both ubuntu linux and windows 7 xp so if you re looking for an implementation that will work anywhere you might try this one

5651362
memcpy	strcpy
i used memcpy because it may be slightly more efficient and it means human readers won t see strcpy and start worrying

5651363
mouse	keyboard
xp or newer version i would like to be able to conduct a remote controlled session not too fancy by controlling mouse movement and keyboard input through feedback from a remote server

5651364

5651781
children	parent
as already noted there is no resizing event and children scale with their parent expected behavior

5651781
children	parent
scale changes on the parent change its whole coordinate space so if you want your children to stay the same size and stay in the same place relative to the parent s 0 0 point you need to apply the 1 scale to their x and y positions also

5651826
public	protected
means if you extend all the public and protected methods are available in your derived class and you can create object of derived class and can use methods with derived class s object

nsis	izpack
if your project is not based on the netbeans platform you need to use an external installer builder like izpack or nsis

5651900
client-side	server-side
the reason is because all server-side processing will take place prior to client-side

5651928

at first i thought i would need to use an actual streaming protocol such as rtp or rtsp but it seems like it maybe better using a custom javascript player that takes the mp3 file in via http

5655623
mp3	m3u
i also looked into m3u files but this seems to require a complete mp3 file although i m not clear on it

5655690
octal	binary
octal and hexadecimal map quite conveniently lining up exactly with the binary bits

5655690
integer	unsigned
if you want to hold an actual number it s best to use signed unsigned integer long etc

5655697
google-chrome	firefox
you will see that in firefox even the smallest letters still have a shadow while google-chrome rounds down the em value to zero and the first two paragraphs have no shadow

5655697
google-chrome	firefox
px firefox will display smaller and smaller shadow while when google-chrome goes below 1px it suddenly displays nothing

5655724
implements	extends
i am implements the class which is extends itemizedoverlay

5655820
serializable	deserialization
i m trying to do some serializable deserialization stuff with a custom exception type

5655846
hash	md5
i m not sure why you are checking the length of the string against an md5 hash of the string here but assuming is the number from the user you can just do this

5655895
free	malloc
you need to malloc memory from the heap and return that and then free it later

5655902
free	malloc
instead you should use malloc and free it once it is done

5655955
jobs	cron
i ve looked at delayed jobs and cron jobs but i don t know enough about it to know which route i should take

5655969

but i want the same action to trigger if the user doesn t use the mouse and instead is using keyboard keyup keydown to select from the menu

5656028
keydown	keyup
it doesn t do that by default which i hoped it did but that doesnt seem to be the case so i want to assign the same action for the keyup or keydown event but i dont want to write or copy paste the same code over again

5656041
radiobuttonlist	requiredfieldvalidator
it looks like you re using webforms so you don t need to touch jquery you could accomplish this with a requiredfieldvalidator one for each radiobuttonlist and you re all set

5656050
for-loop	arrays
you can do this n times in your for-loop and to write to an arrays and then send that off to your fft

5656055
floating-point	fractions
this is due to the finite precision of floating-point representations of fractions numbers

5656057
vmware	virtualbox
if thats the case and the linux only stuff is going to bite you use vmware or virtualbox to run local linux instances and install the ide inside those and just make sure they have goobs of ram to deal with it

5656057
chown	chmod
autobuild.php runs svn update and gets the latest code changes as well as does any chown or chmod file permissions stuff and resets any server specific config files config.php

5656076
client-side	server-side
however this may be challenging to maintain server-side if there are many potential values of item1 and item2 and expensive to retrieve client-side

5656140
width	height
the reason you want to do this is that your width and height are maximum allowed dimensions that the manager can occupy and if you try to call setextent with dimensions larger than it you will most likely get an error in your console saying that there was insufficient room to layout

5656154
crypt	hash
you would have to generate the crypt hash for the password

5656164
portrait	landscape
i m creating a image gallery with dozens of landscape and portrait images on a single page

5656249
repo	egit
i m looking for a way to see though egit to the whole history of my current git repo

5656345
entity-relationship	diagram
option two would have only one row per item cleaner than option one in this regard but having two fields on one table that both reference the company table doesn t smell right and it s messy to draw in an entity-relationship diagram

5656395
for-loop	loops
i am able to do this using a foreach loops but i only need to access the first 10 objects they are sorted so i am trying to use a for-loop

5656422
width	height
in our case the document was extended past the page width but it can easily be modified to accommodate the page height

5656442
min	max
with standard b-tree indexes join complexity is o min n m log max n m

5656510
subtract	add
i add to or subtract from xpos for movement

5656587
folder	directory
also thought to make it in iis virtual directory for every part or application to use its own bin but also never use its own bin folder especially in convert virtual directory to application

5656633
width	font-size
you can use jquery to check the length of the string and guess at a suitable font-size check the rendered width and then adjust again if necessary

5656638

5656651
firefox	safari
other browsers such as safari and firefox have no problem

5656681
children	parent
the last thing is that if the joins are performance critical between the parent and the children you should use abstract inheritance

5656697
ubuntu	debian
if debian ubuntu you will want to install the build-essential package via aptitude for make and friends

5656708
min	max
this will need to do 2-4 passes through the list two to find the max and min values and up to 2 to find the values to remove if they both happen to be at the end of the list

5656708
min	max
you could reduce this to one by writing a python loop to find the max and min in a single pass and remember the index of each so you can delete the items by index after the loop

5656708
min	max
however min and max are implemented in c so replacing them with python code would probably result in lower performance even if it allowed you to reduce the number of passes

5656758
libxml2	libxslt
specify the libxml2 and libxslt dirs

5656770
libxml2	libxslt
if youâ ve got libxml2 and or libxslt installed in a nonstandard place read as â œnot opt local usr local usr or the standard ruby directoriesâ you can use command-line parameters to the gem install command to grease the wheels

5656770
libxml2	libxslt
note that by default libxslt header files are installed into the root include directory but libxml2 header files are installed into a subdirectory thereof named libxml2

5656774
post	get
i have a form that post data on click of the submit button an ajax function is called which should get the php processing page

5656803
width	height
you create a cgrect by calling the function cgrectmake x y width height

5656803
width	height
of course you are going need to set unique values for x y width and height for each button or they will all overlap

5656816
integer	unsigned
from what i understand the pdword type represents an unsigned integer 32bit

5656828
width	height
i have a series of divs which may vary in height thought they will generally be the same width

5656906
integer	unsigned
pdword is a pointer to a 32-bit unsigned integer

5656920
integer	unsigned
so it s a pointer to a dword which msdn also says is an unsigned 32-bit integer - in other words a uint

5656931
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome run the validation instantly

5656947

the format of each email hash is the crc32 and md5 hash of the email address combined with an underscore _

5657337
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
furthermore since i m already writing a book here you don t need to cast the return from malloc or calloc or realloc or anything else that returns in c and doing so can cover up problems

5657354
hash-collision	key
by default in the case of a hash-collision a state-city pair already exists a single bucket for a key stores multiple entries which can be searched sequentially using the hashtable java api

5657375
free	malloc
probably the simplest way to manage those issues is to malloc a structure for each thread initialize it pass the pointer to the thread and let the thread free it when it s done with the data

5657423
gif	png
png jpeg gif

5657460
boost	stl
my feeling is a lot of the work that goes into boost libraries is making them work with other libraries stl

5657484
hash	md5
the advantage of doing this over just using a md5 hash is that these are guaranteed not to collide with non-named-based uuids and have a very very small possibility of collision with other name-based uuids

5657517
hash	md5
the advantage of doing this over just using a md5 hash is that these are guaranteed not to collide with non-named-based uuids and have a very very small possibility of collision with other name-based uuids

5657541
folder	directory
since movefileex only works for moving directory inside a volume and copyfileex only works for copying file not directory shell object s moveitem is the only option for me to move folder cross volumes

versioning	upgrade
assuming you found a way to reliably profile your application keep in mind that it will all go out the window should you switch to another jdk impl ibm to sun to openjdk etc or even upgrade versioning on your existing jvm

5657689
free	malloc
you must free memory allocated by malloc when you are done with it

5657694
hide	show
in explorer there is a shell extension that hide the details of how the gac and native images work and just show you a prettier ui

5657751
querypath	phpquery
but i would be lazy here and resort to phpquery or querypath it seems a one-time operation so you don t need to watch out for performance

5657760
terminate	timeout
so the state of thread in your example at the moment the timeout has expired will be anything that is not terminate which is why the timeout occurred as opposed to join returning naturally in which case thread would be in the terminate state - of course thread could almost immediately transition into the terminate state just after the timeout happened

5657801

5657892
postgresql	mysql
i would suggest postgresql mysql or any db relational or not see mongodb but don t think pyqt supports it yet but you can use any python lib with pyqt nicely

based on this principle i do not see a reason why you would need to migrate to another versioning of hibernate if you only upgrade the driver

5658019
maven	cargo
i am trying to work out how to force the version of cargo that maven or more specifically cargo-maven2-plugin should be using

5658238
children	parent
the ids need to be unique such that when all the children are finished the parent can reap the children and then collect the data

5658238
children	parent
when the parent finds that all the children are finished it uses storable to read back in the files into a hash and use the hopefully unique as the key

5658240
superclass	subclassing
the errors i m getting indicate that although the method is being called from the superclass it s calling the subclassing s version of the method

5658263
webclient	webrequest
it uses webrequest rather that webclient but it is from microsoft and should be a good example

5658381
post	get
if you are interested in patterning your restful api after twitter s then i suggest studying the way twitter has organized their api resources see the method docs under the links in the right sidebar here how they support different resource formats by changing the extension like .xml or .json of the requested resource how they version the endpoint and which verbs are supported per resource for example how the oauth request_token method supports both post and get methods

5658423
width	height
just set the sizes attribute to the specific width and height and mobile safari should match it up correctly

5658424
ubuntu	linux
tomcat is a service in linux as well so in ubuntu you have to start tomcat in order to access it

5658425
xcodebuild	xcrun
while you wait on apple the only solution i can offer is to use xcodebuild and xcrun as part of a command-line shell script where you would know if you are archiving or not

5658455
width	height
just set the sizes attribute to the specific width and height and mobile safari should match it up correctly

5658455
width	height
you can see the various width height values from the link you posted too

5658505
memcached	apc
if you must do this every second even though like others i would advise you against making a call to the server that frequently look into something like memcached or apc to make the request trivial in nature

5658515
mouse	keyboard
i tried to set mouse keyboard event handler on combobox but it only works on the combobox s textbox not in the dropdown list

you should free only those pointers you got by malloc and one good rule to remember is that the number of frees must correspond to the number of mallocs

5658912
pop-up	dialog
when i click on button jquery dialog pop-up but it enables browsers scrollbars too

5658987

this works great with browsers such as google google-chrome and firefox 3 i have not tested 2 yet

5671079
implements	extends	super	extends	super	implements
note that the feature i m trying to implements is easily obtained if i invert the order of type parameter declarations thus changing the super constraint to extends

5671202
actionscript	mxml
i think what your are asking is how to keep your actionscript files separate from the mxml files that contain your designs

5671202
actionscript	mxml
create a script element on this mxml file and set the source to the relative path of your actionscript file

5671202
actionscript	mxml
the external actionscript is treated as if it were the method definitions for the class generated by the mxml

5671202
actionscript	mxml	mxmlc	compc
when a flex project is compiled using mxmlc or compc those are the compiler programs for flex applications and component libraries respectively mxml files are pre-compiled into actionscript class definitions

5671202
actionscript	mxml
if you add the -keep-generated-actionscript directive to your compiler options in flash flex builder ant command line compile command the compiler will leave the generated classes that compose the actionscript class derived from the declaritive mxml files in your project

5671202
actionscript	mxml
having actionscript defined in a script block in your mxml is not mixing logic with presentation

qtcpsocket	qtcpserver
you must extract qtcpsocket object from qtcpserver with nextpendingconnection call when the newconnection signal was emitted

in your example you have specified the top and left positions of each rectangle within the canvas but you are missing the width and height properties on the rectangles which is why they might not be displaying how you want

5671912

one use case would be a little app that allows user who wants to convert decimal to octal .

5672639

the spec says when it could potentially apply return-value-optimization or nrvo to an lvalue by the rules it sets forth the implementation is required to treat the expressions as rvalues and use move constructors if available and only if it couldn t find a suitable constructor it should use the expression as an lvalue

5675106
maven	pom.xml
referring to the question only create executable jar-with-dependencies in maven i can t just alter the packaging-setting to pom.xml because it will also prevent the assembly-plugin from adding my classes to the jar file

rss	feed
the resulting rss feed should be based on the large rss feed

5675894
super	self
self and super work quite differently self means the calling object at runtime while super means the superclass of the class where the method definition is

5675894
super	self
in both cases they are specifying where the search for a method should start in the case of self the starting point is determined dynamically in the super case it is known at compile time

5675894
super	self
class parent has a method two which calls one on self and super

5675894
super	self
hopefully you now can apply inheritance self and super to your example

5675940
filesystems	ntfs
if you can rely on the filesystems being ntfs you could tag all your folders with an alternate datastream check if such a stream is present while reading the list .

5675971

when i post a message in fiddler i get the error

5675982
switching	screens

1 if you need foreign keys relations on db level use innodb else use myisam

in java you can do it directly via parsedelimitedfrom inputstream and writedelimitedto outputstream

5676047
google-chrome	firefox

5676163
away3d	papervision3d	tweenlite	papervision3d	tweenlite	away3d
if you want to use 3d use papervision3d or away3d but that requires some studying and getting to know the libraries as where tweenlite is easily accessible and used

5676173
innodb	myisam
myisam table locking so innodb can handle more concurrent requests

5676173
innodb	myisam
innodb is transactional so inserts will generally be slower than myisam

5676173
innodb	myisam
innodb is more reliable than myisam

5676173
innodb	myisam
myisam is faster than innodb for reads myth

5676173
innodb	myisam
myisam tables have smaller footprints than innodb ones myth

5676173
innodb	myisam
however not many people will mention innodb clustered primary key indexes and how a well designed innodb table will easily out perform an equivalent myisam one because of this

5676185
concave	convex
that s because your polygon is not convex - the top right corner is concave

5676198
width	height
so i thought of editing the image but i want to edit the image in correct composition correct height width ratio so that image doesn t looks odd

5676198

5676386
prepare	execute
you will notice that for prepare statements the php.net list of functions is available at even functions such as - execute

5676393
pull	push
on the central server you create a bare repository and on you re local machine you clone from that repository push and pull from that repository often through ssh

5676401
post	get
now as i understand it the client app has to have a post method to post the stream to the server and then i should have an aspx page on the server to decode back the stream i get from the post and formulate my xml file and then save it inside the folder correct me if i m wrong

5676435
maven	m2e
m2e is an eclipse plugin that integrates maven builds

5676441

here s dir for my models folder

5676468
ienumerable	iqueryable
i ve few doubts regarding how shared ienumerable and iqueryable is accessed in multi-threaded application

5676503
folder	directory
what this means is that while the applet or web start application may have full read write privileges on the machine because the executables are running from a low integrity directory they are only allowed access to files and folder that are low integrity as well

5676573
int	chars
you can t simply cast a chars to an int

5676630
pull	push
this branch is the one that you push and pull between your private repositories

5676630
pull	push
now you work on the new wip2 branch instead and that s the one that you push and pull between your repositories

5676640
ienumerable	iqueryable
then it doesn t matter if the iqueryable ienumerable is thread-safe

5676680
prepare	execute
i could write the tests for every module in a way that is initializes the applications state to a pre-defined state and then execute its tests but having to clean and prepare the state would be quite an effort

5676699
post	get
but i think the best your going to get if you don t want to use any client-side technologies like javascript or flash is to let the user upload a file with a normal post and then somehow maybe in your session remember the files that the user uploaded or just save them to the database as they come in

5676708
fast-forward	merge
that means that if this doesn t turn out to be a fast-forward merge there ll be a merge commit added in the git history and that can only be represented by a single commit in subversion

5676709
width	height
width and height are 10 and 10

5676721

5676895
stdout	stderr
a windows subsystem process one with winmain will not have a stdout stderr or stdin unless it was specifically given one on launch

5676895
stdout	stderr
if launched in that way it will have both a stdout and stderr which will both go into the named file

5676895
stdout	stderr
on the other hand a console subsystem program one with main will by default have a stdin stdout and stderr all set to the console

5676908
width	height
and of course move the fixed width height from the textview to the tablerow and leave the textview to wrap_height

5676932

5676965
post	get
next should be a post param not a get param

5676991
put	get

post	get
i have written code use a digital certificate to get cookies from a secured url to in turn post data back to another url using the retrieved cookies and same digital certificate

5677263
post	get
the get works and cookies are retrieved the post comes back with an error 500

5677289
post	get
but post increment requires a lvalue which is a variable with a name but a++ returns a rvalue which cannot be incremented thus leading to the error message you get

5677355
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
following code worked for me on firefox ie 8 google-chrome safari and iphone

5677367
zlib	libpng
you must use some other libraries addons libpng zlib loadpng

5677367
zlib	libpng
loadpng is bundled with allegro from version 4.3.10 but you need libpng and zlib installed in your compiler

5677374
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
following code worked for me on firefox ie 8 google-chrome safari and iphone

5677411
jobs	cron
if your getting more then 1 from your request then your exponantially creating more cron jobs

5677412
width	height
the measuring phase will set the desiredsize property not the width height properties

5677412
width	height
the width height properties are used to give an element an explicit size versus auto-fitting to it s content via the measureoverride

5677412
width	height
you shouldn t be setting the width height based on the results of the measure or arrange phase as these properties are used by the measure and arrange phases to determine the best size

5677412
width	height
the width height may not be valid sizes

5677412
width	height
the general rule of thumb is your panel should not touch the width height minwidth minheight etc type properties

5677413
jar	manifest.mf
see the manifest.mf in side jar

5677436
x86	mips
the current version of windows embedded compact supports intel x86 and compatibles mips and arm processors

as you notice in myobj i have a car instances frequently be used in different functions in different subobject test use subobject

5677553
clang	llvm
you may be able to do this with the c-language front end clang to llvm

5677562
button	checkbox
if you are using eclipse and google plugin for eclipse then use the blue new web application project toolbar button and make sure the generate gwt project sample code checkbox is checked in the new web application project wizard

5677591
hash	salt
if you re using hash salt them

5677591
hash	hmac
to use straight hash use hmac

5677605
ubuntu	freebsd
as for modifying the web server s environment i did that on a freebsd server where you just add a script with the environment vars you nedd inside usr local etc apache22 envvars.d and i suspect you could achieve the same on ubuntu editing etc apache2 envvars

5677623
getter	setter
what actually happens is that the attributetypeids and producttypeid properties are bound to the relevant request parameters and the getter setter simulate producttype and attributetypes properties

5677681
getter	setter
i have left out the majority of the setter and getter of the entities

5677686
cpu	processors
if a thread is truly cpu bound it will only slow another thread if they are both executing on the same processors core

5677709
google-chrome	firefox
i was able to get this working like a charm in google-chrome and ie9 but in firefox 4 i m getting constant flicker as it redraws the canvas

5677746
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
there are plusses to the way google-chrome safari do it like this which will look good on google-chrome but poor on firefox 4

5677758
typedef	struct
in the .h i define 2 typedef struct say ts1 and ts2

5677794
children	parent
using your parent node loop through all the children

5677810
google-chrome	safari
so the normal flow of events that happens when browsing to this server is that the web browser both safari and google-chrome prompts the user to select a certificate and retry the operation

5677821
codeigniter	pyrocms
i have been used doctrine with codeigniter but is not the same thing to integrate with pyrocms

5677883
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
you can also use getelementbyid to get a specific node much quicker than any array search could ever be and getelementsbytagname to get all elements of a particular type

5677893
versioning	upgrade
if their versioning is too old i present them with 2 options upgrade or quit

5677913
google-chrome	firefox
using response.outputstream.write does indeed work however the video player in both firefox 4.0 and google-chrome cannot seem to determine how long the video is

5677913
google-chrome	firefox
firefox s counter just increases as the play time goes on while google-chrome shows a completely random time

5677914
put	get
this is grat for multiple languages because you are able to put the strings.xml in a country-code ending value folder like values-de values-en or values-fr in order to get the right string based on the phonesettungs

5677943
button	checkbox
if you mean that you don t want multiple checkbox from a same logical group to be checked at one time you should use radio button instead of checkbox

5677966
nunit	mstest	mbunit	mstest	mbunit	nunit	xunit.net	fsunit
fsunit currently supports nunit mbunit xunit.net and mstest vs11 only

5677996
portrait	landscape
my problem is that i m animating a ball on the screen in portrait mode but now i want do to the same thing in landscape mode

5678019
goto	break	multiplying	addition
it has the advantage that you can break out of multiplying nested control statements more easily than with break as was proposed by someone and in addition to what goto provides has a status indication that can encode the reason for what went wrong

5678023
prepare	execute	prepare	bindparam
you d like to have a look at pdo s prepare statements pdo- prepare pdostatement- bindparam pdostatement- execute and pdostatement- fetch

5678036
folder	directory
you can use nsuserdefaults the documents directory or one of a few other folder in your app s directory hierarchy or core data

5678036
iboutlet	ibaction
iboutlet and ibaction ibaction and iboutlet are typedef s for void

5678069
prepare	execute
after you ve prepare it you can execute it multiple times just changing the values

5678070
post	get
access the data using http get post methods

5678074
width	height
so i am trying to insert an image to a page with javascript with 50 of its width and 50 of its height

5678114
google-chrome	firefox
and it works very fast in firefox and google-chrome

5678150
cassini	iis
website works fine in cassini and even on our windows 2003 server with iis 6.0

5678153
width	height
first of all if you re setting a width and height you should also include display block

5678153
width	height
but more importantly when you express a width or height as a percentage that s a percentage of the parent element so if the parent is 1000px wide the image will be 500px wide regardless of what size the actual image file is

5678164
width	height
the css you ve got means that the width and height should be computed as half the size of the parent container not the image itself

5678164
width	height
the eerily knowledgeable å ime vidas points out that setting the width or height attribute should make the right thing happen with the size being reduced appropriately to maintain the aspect ratio

5678187
strcpy	strdup
delete the text _crt_insecure_deprecate fopen_s from that line and you will no longer get the security warning when you use fopen but it will remain for strcpy strdup and those other possibly dangerous ones

5678189
fink	macports
it might be in macports but it might not be or in fink i don t know

5678204
carrierwave	paperclip
you can use or paperclip or carrierwave gems

5678221

a guid has 128bit length a long only 64bit you are missing 64bit of information allowing for two guids to generate the same long representation

5678222
debian	linux
also that problem reproduces only on linux debian 5.0

5678279
google-chrome	firefox
the edit-server extension for google-chrome or it s all text extension for firefox are both two great alternatives to having emacs or fetchmail download huge quantities of mail to a machine you don t want the mail on

5678294
x86	64bit
the solution i got is to compile as x86 and then run it as 32 bits application on the 64bit machine

5678301
post	get
there is an old php feature called magic quotes where php would automatically escape any post get data to make it easy to insert into a database

5678349
admob	inmobi
i have set up the sdk key for adwhirl admob and inmobi

5678400
sorting	grouping
for small grouping of top bottom elements the sorting is rarely called a few times in the beginning and then less and less often over time

5678547
lambda	first-class-functions
for example microsoft .net has lambda and delegates no relation to objective-c delegates while the most generic names are probably anonymous functions or first-class-functions

5678578
apache	lighttpd
the backend will most likely be implemented in python using wsgi on apache or lighttpd but that is still open for discussion

5678588
bellman-ford	floyd-warshall
when that happens shortest path algorithms bellman-ford johnson floyd-warshall would detect the existence of such negative cycle and fail but no other useful information is produced

5678592
google-chrome	firefox
i noticed on google-chrome firefox and ie to have those images at different positions

5678657
equals	tostring
although the parse should succeed the value of tostring on the resulting enum instance is not defined and may not equals textarea as your assertion is expecting

5678658
implements	extends
most mx class drawing methods were implements incorrectly with private methods doing most of the drawing and this makes extends those classes difficult

5678670
tablet	galaxy
in one edit text i am setting onkeylistener so that when i enter 5 numerics in edittext it will accept n do next process but in samsung galaxy tablet it is not working i am using these lines of code

5678700
cvs	svn	cvs	rcs
the command you are likely looking for is svn update -rnnn however without some background on svn odds are excellent that you ll misuse it as svn is very like yet in some ways different than the old school cvs rcs sccs like systems

5678715
docx	xlsx	xlsx	xlsm
the add-ins need to know the file format as they are only to perform their actions when the format is one of the newer compressed xml-based formats docx xlsx xlsm pptx etc.

5678715
vsto	add-in
so my questions are in a powerpoint vsto add-in

5678738
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
if you are using the synchronous method nsurlconnection sendsynchronousrequest returningresponse error you need to wrap it in a nsoperation so it doesn t block the main ui thread

5678768
portrait	landscape
this should return the propery bounds of your screen 320x480 in portrait 480x320 in landscape and check against those values

5678776
folder	directory
if the repo-browser doesn t get to the path specified it ll get as far as it can recursively in the directory until it finds the problematic folder a folder that for the youngest revision does not exist

5678802
width	height
so i have a bunch of elements that need to have a specific width height and padding and need to be centered within their parent element

5678802
width	margin
i don t know how many elements there will be so .pages can t have a defined width so margin auto

5678811
ant	maven
but if you still want it you can always make your own custom check for checkstyle or a custom maven plugin ant task

5678841
actionscript	mxml
as yaba said it allows you to check or uncheck remove actionscript styling when building a new mxml skin by copying another skin class

5678862
filtering	grouping
i ve subclassed groupprincipal to include the whenchanged attribute and i m using that currently after i pull my full list of grouping to filtering the list

the book does not address how this is implemented nor does it mention the potential uses except for one trivial example next paragraph

5678995
shim	polyfills

i have a tabcontrol .in one of the tabitem i have a user-controls that contains a datagrid which has canuseraddrows true

5679034
rvm	bundler	macports	homebrew
the command line and your shell tdd homebrew or macports git instead of subversion gems bundler rvm rspec or some other testing framework etc

5679034
vim	textmate	vim	emacs	emacs	textmate
they just use a simple text editor textmate vim emacs and debug using the console

5679070
integer	unsigned
nsstring length returns an unsigned integer

5679075
next	except
if in your mind s eye you ignore the dim and compare what s left you ll find vb and c# pretty similar except that c# does it the wrong way round you can guess which language i grew up with and like c puts the type first or uses var and the name of the variable next

5679079
superclass	subclassing
also when you are using data components and retrieving a collection typed as a superclass with subclassing instances you will need to add this setting to the bean reader

5679162
vbscript	jscript
i don t know whether there are tools to do this but it s not too hard to write a tool which will perform the syncing you want using a combination of sql and script for example vbscript or jscript

5679169
switching	screens
i use screens but am willing to switching to tmux if it and only it has this functionality

5679179
google-chrome	firefox
the text is vertically centered on google-chrome and firefox but on ie 7 and 8 the baseline of the text is centered instead so it is several pixels higher than in firefox .

5679261
onmousemove	mouseevent
function onmousemove e mouseevent void

5679281
ant	maven
the solution to your problem isn t ant it s maven

5679281
hudson	bamboo
on top of that it mixes great with a continuous integration engine like hudson bamboo and teamcity which builds a project every time a file has been committed to your source control system and then updates all dependent projects automatically

5679295
google-chrome	firefox
this is in both google-chrome 10 and firefox 4

5679375
udp	tcp
after i am capturing udp packets in c# successfully i will be sending them over a tcp connection to my server at which i need to send out the udp to the destination and then transmit the response back to the client machine that is capturing the packets and then send the response to the program as if it was directly from the server in question

5679375
udp	tcp
i need to create a network driver that captures all of the udp traffic generated by all the programs on my computer send it to a dedicated server in which i would have coded a server daemon to translate the tcp to udp and send it to the original destination

5679385
getter	setter
i have to write separate getter and setter methods

5679411
width	height
alternatively you can use the fillrect x y width height with a width of 1

5679417
width	height
though the parameter works as x y with width height as opposed to p1 to p2

5679456
width	height
i have tried setting the width and height as follows

5679456
width	height
but the bitmapimage returns zero values for the width and height

5679474
cas	opensso
i am a little confused about ldap cas shiboleth opensso and their relationships

5679502
udp	tcp
remember that the sockets api is an abstraction over a number of different protocols including unix filesystem sockets socketpairs tcp udp and many many different network protocols including x.25 and some entirely forgotten ones

5679511
folder	directory
each iphone application has its own home directory containing library and documents folder and a tmp directory for storing temporary files

5679531
width	height
however rather than trying to manually set the width and height simply set the stretch property to none and the image will always be it s original size

5679589
switching	screens
basically the problem i m having is that i cannot get both the animations to work in the same application when the application is loaded up the first animation works but when the user clicks on the switching button they only get a blank screens instead of the second animation

5679671
svg	vml
it s a javascript library which can draw directly into the browser using svg or vml for ie

5679693
children	parent
i want to get all the parent that don t have any children

hide	show
i have a control that has a label on it that i would like to hide or show based on a global menu item for all instances of my control

5679747
for-loop	arrays
not sure if its possible to do with a for-loop and mixed associative arrays but foreach does work just fine

5679778
width	height
like mentioned in one of the comments your height and width are incorrect

5679809
rspec	capybara
see there first for rspec and rspec + capybara

5679819
for-loop	arrays
you would need to do it using something like assigning array_keys to an arrays then using a for-loop to go through that etc.

5679837
put	get
but when i try to put it into practice it i get error saying that the getcontext attribut is undefined

5679893
int	chars
you should map the function read x int to each of the elements of the string as a list of chars

5679963
post	get
so it would be helpful if your javascript would keep track of when the browser last received an update from the server so when it asks for a new update it can send in the get string of the url or via post the last_updated_timestamp of when it last received an update

5679966
atof	strtod
qi comes with a benchmark that compares the performance of std atof std strtod and boost spirit qi double_

5679966
atof	strtod
unlike std atof std strtod and boost.spirit will let you know whether or not the input was valid

5679982
ubuntu	debian
i don t have a debian system nearby but on ubuntu there is a package vnc4server that provides the features you need

5680016
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
if still animation is not smooth then please use viewdidappear method rather than viewwillappear

5680021
submit	submission
you re probably much better off intercepting the submit event and iterating over each timesheethours html-represented element and assigning the name as a mask and then submission the form

5680030
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome the request type at server is post but in iceweasel firefox it is options

5680043
int	double
use double constants 32.0d instead of int for all of your math

5680080
hide	show
how to show hide column in a grid panel

5680098
post	get
when i post to the server the data goes to the server but i am not able to get the response

5680098
post	get
i then do a jsonp get call immediately after the post finishes with that same src key and it fetches the result

5680101
width	height
as an example when i set this faux canvasrect 10 10 40 20 dp internally it actually sets the canvas.left canvas.top width and height dps and canvasrect itself still remains at its default of 0 0 0 0

5680101
getter	setter
think of it as sort of a coercevalue but on the getter side not the setter

5680101
width	height
width and height dps which

5680101
getter	setter
anyway as i said the dp setter works great but if i did want to put in the getter i m not sure i can think of any other way except to wire up all those change notifications for the related dps

5680107
stateless	stateful
that way the domain objects are still stateless but can implement domain logic using stateful beans

5680120
google-chrome	safari
in terms of websockets availability native websockets version 03 is supported by google-chrome and safari

5680120
opera	firefox
version 03 is also supported by firefox 4.0 and opera 11 but is disabled by default

5680145
post	get
to get a good general overview concerning pip and virtualenv see this post

5680176
atof	strtod
atof may be faster than strtod on one platform and slower on another

5680179
viewdidappear	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
the loadview and viewdidload methods get called but the viewwillappear and viewdidappear methods don t get called

5680207
min	max
each bit represents each day from min all the dates to max all the dates

5680212
stdout	fflush
fflush forces the stdout internal buffer to be fflush to the screen

5680221
for-loop	arrays
it s entirely possible to use a for-loop to iterate over a multidimensional arrays

5680221
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
you create a for-loop to iterate over the outer arrays then inside that loops you use another for-loop to iterate over the inner arrays

5680221
for-loop	loops
generally when you use a for-loop loops will look something like this

5680221
for-loop	arrays
an arrays with keys 0 2 and 3 is not because it jumps over 1 this doesn t work well for associative arrays i.e arrays with text as keys - for example because these arrays won t have keys with the numerical indexes your for-loop will produce

5680221
for-loop	loops
for example if you could use any loops but a foreach then it would be a lot simpler to just use a while loops than to try to bash a for-loop into doing what you want

5680226
pdfsharp	itextsharp
silverpdf looks to be inspired based-on itextsharp and pdfsharp but it doesn t use an identical class layout by any means

5680227
collabnet	svn
our svn server -- collabnet is part of the name that s about as much as i know -- allows us to put users into groups and then to assign permissions to each group at any level of granularity

5680315
stdout	fflush
the stdout is a line buffered stream by default this means you need to explicitly fflush it

5680315
stdout	fflush
you can explicitly fflush stdout via fflush stdout

5680322
mouseup	mouseenter
many of the video triggers are inside of if-then or select case statements in code behind so i m not exclusively using simple wpf events such as mouseup or mouseenter

5680338
eiffel	racket
as a user of racket who is unfamiliar with eiffel i m wondering why a contract system would have anything to do with oop and inheritance

5680338
eiffel	racket
if you re coming from eiffel maybe my c c++ slant on racket contracts won t be helpful but i wanted to share it anyway

5680361
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the iphone app was built using a container viewcontroller uinavigationcontroller which presented the user first with a custom viewcontroller uitableviewcontroller that pushed a custom viewcontroller uiviewcontroller based on row selection

5680361
uiviewcontroller	uipopovercontroller
in the ipad app i am presenting the user directly with the custom uiviewcontroller with no container controller and then allow selection of different options via a uipopovercontroller

5680406
width	height
this was based upon the debug output of this admittedly crude test activity combined with a theme with no title bar android style theme.notitlebar and a single-view linearlayout with both height and width set to match_parent the one created when creating a new android app

5680411
convertview	expandablelistview
method assign an expandablelistview instance to the convertview and return it

5680423
children	parent
if children was in a parent class then you can simply use

5680423
children	parent
however if you need to bind to the children of multiple parent you can do the following

5680426
superclass	subclassing
make your subclassing a direct subclassing of uicolor and then import the superclass or the entire kit in the .h file

5680441
decoder	encoder
i have a good wbxml encoder and decoder implemented in java for android for my app corporate addressbook

5680441
folder	directory
look in the wbxml folder you will need both the wbxml and the activesync directory

5680459
children	parent
i have a class node with a self referential mapping children backref parent representing a tree in sqlalchemy and i want to select the entire tree

5680461
children	parent
what i would recommend regardless of whether a parent can have multiple children is that you use an anonymous type as the data source for the combo box and populate that type using linq

5680462
children	parent
the parent has to care for it s children

5680462
children	parent
the parent must raise the error throw an exception return an error code etc. if it still has children and can t be deleted

5680488
activemq	rabbitmq
i ve done some research into activemq rabbitmq and hornetq but i don t see an obvious way to implement this

5680533
fitnesse	dbfit
we don t use stored procedures but dbfit is a useful add-on to fitnesse that can do that

5680539
width	height
to use this though make sure you have a width height specified on the box

5680540
width	height
usually overflow auto should work if there is a set height width

5680540
width	height
the key to overflow with css styles is the height and width have to be determined by the browser in order for it to know when to start overflowing

5680549
children	parent
in your case when the parent is being destroyed say in its finalize method it can see if any children still exist and throw an error if there are

5680549
children	parent
if the parent maintains a list of children you might simply throw an error in the parent s finalize method if the list is not empty

5680561
jobs	cron
the problem comes in play for cron jobs which don t execute .bashrc

5680564
mp4	webm
the type attribute holds information about to the video format ogg mp4 webm and additionally the codec used in the video container

5680568
stdout	stderr
popen may work as long as the program doesn t need to write to stdout or stderr as that will be lost

5680642
hide	show
you can use javascript to show hide it or if you decide to use a link to a whole article page

5680652
gridview	entitydatasource
there is a navigation property from i have a entitydatasource and a gridview

5680654
hide	show
you can use jquery javascript library to show hide the required form fields dynamically like this

5680667
textview	imageview
e.g. i want a button a textview etc and then my imageview somewhere in there.

5680721
membase	couchdb
in short membase scales better redis offers more features but membase recently merged with couchdb and will gain its mapreduce and querying functionality in the near future

5680731
jobs	cron
if you need to do more than set some environment variables then you re going to need to put your source usr local rvm scripts rvm either in the cron specs as you have in your question or you ll need to wrap your cron jobs in a cron runner something like this

5680745
min	max
i think looking for the max would probably be best but that is just my gut feeling and it could be shown that min is best

5680784
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome also has a console but it doesn t have firebug a firefox add-on used for web development

5680785
google-chrome	safari
safari has built-in dev tools similar to google-chrome however they need to be enabled

database migrations - rather than using the t.database_authenticatable helpers we wrote individual add_column and rename_column statements so that we didnâ t run into any duplicate column or index errors that youâ ve see and so so that we could reuse our salt hash passwords within devise without having to modify how the gem works

assume the current location directory is default web folder and the file executed is index.jsp which is in the web folder

5687292
g++	gcc
you were probably compiling with gcc instead of g++ or xl_c instead of xl_c++ etc.

5687346
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
for quick in-line stuff use the uisegmentedcontrol when this is more of a new context or there are too many options use a nested uitableview control that you push from your uinavigationcontroller if there are only a handful of options you can just dedicate a couple of rows in your uitableview to the radio options and run it yourself

5687363
width	margin
i think by slicing he means starting a new line it is true that adding float left to everything with the appropiate width will indeed induce a new line what should happen if something needed to be of a negative margin or float right it would break your markup you should check out your knowledge of tree structure in html and avoid using floats where not necessary instead use margins relative positioning or absolute pages designed all in float are hard to appear correct in all major browsers as different broswers treat float irrespectively

5687372
onresume	onpause	onstart	ondestroy	oncreate	ondestroy	oncreate	onstart
this will cause the activity to go into onpause onstop and on somephones even ondestroy then oncreate onstart onresume

5687741
sortedmap	sortedset
the sortedmap and sortedset implementations in the standard java api either use a and call its compare k1 k2 method or assume the keys implement and call k1.compareto k2

5687741

here is a comparator implementation which works on any comparable objects so you could use it maybe internally as an adapter for the comparable variant

5687786
breadth-first-search	dijkstra
it s just breadth-first-search which is equivalent to dijkstra s when all edges have weight 1

5687873

this code in firefox works and option smoothly fades out after is clicked but in other bowsers ie9 opera google-chrome this does nt work - here you can check this out

5687879
udp	tcp
then you create a server with udp server inside the firewall on one side and tcp client on the other which will encapsulate udp traffic in tcp and send it to the your other server outside of the firewall that will do the opposite

5687886
sessionfactory	servletcontextlistener
the approach is to create the sessionfactory in the contextinitialized method of the servletcontextlistener and to store it in the servletcontext

kerberos	ntlm
i want to support single sign-on using ntlm or kerberos within our activedirectory-backed domain

5688080

please provide known-working code under sinatra or rack that shows how to use ntlm or kerberos on the server-side authenticating with activedirectory presumably via net-ldap

5688104
width	height
the reader should return me a buffered image with height 220 and width 200 or height 205 and width 188 if it ignores white fields around the image

5688104
width	height
but what it does is it returns me a image of height 155 and width 174 what is absurd because i triple checked and the frame 12 is height 220 and width 200

5688115
width	height
for example i make a div and gave it width 320 and height 480px then join from iphone blabla.html

i saw the fadein fadeout and fadeto functions but i don t think these would work

5688444
carrierwave	paperclip
in the throws of coding now so can t attest to reliability from rails side but my research led me to carrierwave over paperclip

5688473
hash	salt
this is why things like salt and nonces work well because adding few bytes to the initial string which by itself might be weak short or predictable like passwords changes the result of the hash to something completely different and unrelated to the original

5688504
screens	hdpi
if you only have an hdpi image in your resources and you re viewing it on an ldpi screens depending on your settings android may scale it downward in which case you ll have a slightly reduced quality image that should display around the same size

5688504
screens	hdpi
the other way around ldpi on hdpi with scaling you ll have a noticeably pixelated image on your hdpi screens scaled to the same size

5688504
screens	hdpi
hdpi you ll need a larger image to take up an inch of space on the screens than you would for a low density screens

5688523
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
a hdpi image on a ldpi screens would appear larger than the same image on a mdpi or hdpi screens

5688523
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
a ldpi image on a hdpi screens would appear smaller than the same image on a mdpi or ldpi screens

5688555
getter	setter
again you must correctly set up each property getter and setter accessibility type nullable etc

5688555
inherited	properties
it will most probably be about some complex properties navigation properties or inherited

5688583
icomparer	iequalitycomparer
you either have to implement your own icomparer or iequalitycomparer as i recall i may be off and base it on a specific property of the object

5688588
hash	md5
good hash functions do provide good distributions see md5 sha etc...

5688759

if the number is really huge in a sense that the number of digits is greater than the number representable by the mantissa of your floating-point number then your floating-point number is always an integer

5692467
decimal	ieee
for example the ieee 754 double-precision format has a 52-bit mantissa which is sufficient for about 16 decimal digits

5692467
int	double
if your numbers have 20 decimal digits then any attempt to squeeze such numbers into a double will result in rounding effectively turning your numbers into int

5692467
int	double
if you are referring to 64-bit long long datatype then it automatically means that your numbers are so large that they ll never have any fractional part when represented by a typical double type they will always be int if represented by double values

int	double
double has a greater value range than int

5693478
int	double
that standard says that double has a 52-bit mantissa which means it can represent any int up to 52 bits long without loss of precision

5693480
int	double
because double can contain larger numbers than int or long

5693480
int	double
same reason there s no implicit cast from double to int

5693500

if you want to use a left join you ll need to put your condition on the join otherwise it ll crate an inner join and the rows that have null in won t get returned.

5693969
children	parent
basically in as3 we have a proper display list where we access children and parent through specific methods used to traverse the display list

5694018

5694260
public	protected
if it was protected or public in class a then yes it will be called if it is not overridden in b

5694298
inherited	properties
this is one global disadvantage for all columns used to support conditional mapping table per hierarchy inherited and independent associations - they can t be exposed as properties

5694336
innodb	myisam
this doesn t happen in myisam tables but with innodb you have the power to prevent it using transactions

5694388
google-chrome	safari
please note this is only tested in google-chrome safari which it looks fine in and mobile safari on the ipad 1st generation which it looks choppy in

5694393
gif	png
should i just convert png into gif

5694402
firefox	safari
it works fine in other browsers including mobile safari but for some reason firefox is having none of it

5694411
jobs	cron
then you could still run the script every minute and then have an email script that looks for the mail table to see if there are pending messages that need to be sent run as a stand alone cron job - thus the work load is completely separated as the jobs should run in parallel

5694498
nsstring	nsdata
retrieve the content of file based on requirement nsstring nsdata nsmutablearray etc

5694514
printf	getchar
it works because all the functions used in the code - scanf printf getchar - are declared in stdio.h

5694516
sorting	filtering
let s say i have a div that will contain a view from an admin panel perspective of users - there will be a list of users along with options to choose how many to display at a time sorting options what page to be on filtering etc.

5694527
salt	md5
however you should not use md5 and you should use non-ascii salt

5694546
ienumerable	ienumerator
this list has the ienumerator ienumerable interfaces implemented

5694550
hash	salt
you ll still store a hash and a salt and you can pick your own hashing algorithm but you ll take care of dictionary attacks rainbow attacks and a variety of other problems

5694553
hash	md5
and instead of md5 you are better off using either sha256 or bcrypt hash

5694568
firefox	safari
in safari and firefox

5694618
minimum	max
for the generated values to be constrained to 10 digits in length it means the minimum generated value must be larger than 999999999 and since an int has a max value of 2 147 483 647 smaller or equal to that so

5694696
onresume	onpause
isactive is a boolean that keeps track of whether this activity is active - it s set in oncreate and onresume and unset in onpause

5694696
onresume	onpause
i ve been looking into a broadcast intent - i ve seen an example on how to send back such an intent to the main activity but the problem is that the listener has to be registered unregstered in onresume onpause - and asynctask is a separate thread

5694722
public	protected
because if you have public or protected in super class then you cannot have a more restrictive access modifier in the downwards hierarchy

5694774
put	get
if you put a foreach loop running on a separate task you get all the iterations running sequentially but you can run other code in parallel with the entire foreach

5694780
post	get
it s probably the case that when you view the page source it s not sending the post data so you get all the records back

5694803
mongodb	bson
the bson object id s generated by mongodb drivers are highly likely to be unique across collections

5694825
post	get
also to get ride of the whitespace one can collapse everything from for post in site.posts to endfor onto a single line.

5694830
uiview	calayer
specifically i want to know how to use opacity calayer subclasses to replace the backing layer on a uiview

5694840
ienumerable	ienumerator
typically calling getenumerator on an ienumerable will return a new instance of ienumerator for your class but your actual list implementation contains all the state for the enumerator

5694843
int	double
in the example foo should be partially specialized for t int and t double with only one template definition

5694843
int	double
but it should be for t int and t double with only one function definition no code doubling

5694855
width	height
setting width and height equal i got ellipses that were about 20 taller than wide

5694935
opera	google-chrome
i am writing a google-chrome extension that synchronizes with opera link but i keep struggling with oauth

5694952
expression-blend	silverlight
expression-blend on the other hand is the go to tool if you want to do wpf silverlight frontend

5694975
geocoding	geocode
you will see this pattern used a lot in javascript for asynchronous operations - the second argument to geocode is a callback function which gets invoked when the potentially expensive and long-lived geocoding operation finishes

5694975
geocoding	geocode
just like you ve found out in your geocoding example - the call to geocode returns immediately without a result and works in the background invoking the callback function with the actual result sometime later

5694979
post	get
so your connection will be through http protocol via post and get requests

5694992
implements	extends
you also have to extends your main activity class to implements the view.ontouchlistener interface and add the necessary method at the end of your class

5695009
serializable	deserialization
you can actually try to write custom method to detach the whole object graph but as you said it was asked 500 times and i haven t seen working solution yet - except the serializable and deserialization to the new object graph

5695034
flann	surf
i just want to match surf s from a query image to those with an image set by applying flann

5695040
width	margin
you can do that by setting a fixed width to the child div such as and setting left right margin auto

5695043
versioning	upgrade
additionally you ll probably upgrade your third party libraries to newer versioning so that you don t have to port those yourself

5695081
codeigniter	kohana
i ll be writing about kohana 3.1 and main advantages i ve seen over codeigniter 2 so far

5695081
symfony	kohana	kohana	yii	codeigniter	yii	codeigniter	kohana
before kohana 3.0 year and a half ago i used codeigniter zf symfony cake and tried many others at the moment trying to do yii only because i have to

5695081
codeigniter	kohana
kohana doesn t use any of the old code meaning 2.x or codeigniter s in the current version

5695081
fuelphp	kohana
i ve seen fuelphp which seems to be more like a mashup of ci2 with kohana than a ci2 branch though i have to say it definitely has potential

5695081
memcached	apc
caching library with drivers for most popular caching techniques apc eaccelerator file memcached sqlite wincache and xcache

5695096
width	height
as i can see from the snippet you already pass context in the constructor new targettrainer this width height

5695111
width	margin
the preferred way to do this would be to set the width of the child div and set the left and right margin to auto

5695111
width	text-align
if you are not sure about the width of the child you can also assign text-align center to the parent div

5695115
put	get
this way you don t have to put it in the get string and maintain it for the user although i suppose you could do that as a backup

5695124
versioning	upgrade
you might want to upgrade to the latest versioning of idea laclojure java 6ux and clojure 1.2 should work fine make sure idea knows where to find your clojure jars and which jdk to use sounds like you know how to config a usable idea setup so you re good there and make sure you have bp s only in expressions that can be evaluated

5695139
ati	nvidia
if you want to run your program on both nvidia and ati chipsets then opencl will make the job easier

5695139
ati	nvidia
for example on ati cards you ll want to manually vectorize code using float4 int4 data types or accept a nearly 4x performance penalty while nvidia works better with scalar data types

5695143
post	get
you could call your get handler in your post handler

5695174
matplotlib	chaco
as an alternative to matplotlib the chaco library provides nice graphing capabilities and is in some ways better-suited for live plotting

5695260
google-chrome	firefox
one more thing to note is that i am receiving the same weird behavior in firefox google-chrome and ie

5695311
stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush	stderr	fflush
in this case i would avoid redirecting or testing for values in stdout or stderr since the access to those streams is not threads-safe in a way that output buffer may not be appended and fflush as possibly predicted

5695326
post	get
i get the null response with httpresponse response client.execute post

5695333
width	height
however when content expands beyond the browser window s height or width the sections don t seem to expand like i would want

5695575
int	chars
integral-type arguments like chars are automatically promoted to int

5695613
int	chars
for values of type chars the promoted value is of type int

5695614
folder	directory
the command yiic.php webapp var www vhosts domainname httpdocs appname successfully creates the directory with the corresponding appname in the desired webroot folder

5695614
folder	directory
since the framework folder obviously has the necessary rights to write the demanded files into the webroot i double checked that all the files are created as expected i suspect it must be some sort of issue that comes from the webroot not having the needed access to the overlying framework directory

5695632
children	parent
it seems you cannot access the children classes static members in the parent s static method s code

5695640
folder	directory
i m trying to move my wordpress wp-contents directory outside wordpress site root folder

5695695
implements	extends
let s say that class2 extends another class1 and that class2 needs to implements a certain interface

5695764
profiling	debugging
memory profiling exists but inspecting the internals of applications beyond your control may be difficult because usually you need debugging symbols and or instrumenting to let a tool to know when and for what object memory was allocated afaik ms offers checked builds of windows but not office

5695768
superclass	subclassing
when you subclassing a superclass you are specialising the superclass

5695768

over the course of x days i pull from upstream edit and push to origin

5695827
profiling	debugging
i do know i can walk the stack in a safe way via the profiling or debugging apis but neither of them are fast

5695885
mouseover	mouseenter
hover mouseenter mouseover

5695913
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
create a nsbitmapimagerep from the nsimage and use coloratx y to get the color

5695930
post	get
rather than set deleteim to the post variable check its set first as if you dont check it you get no value if its checked you should get checked

5695965
width	height
because the height of the image changes with the width i need to the div of text to move up and down so that it stays over a particular portion of the image

5695969
udp	tcp
on the foundation you have either udp which is unreliable but incurs almost no overhead but very well suited for broadcasts and tcp which is more reliable therefore has more overhead but is easier to use

5695971

i have a problem here to any time i put to this ballontip it ever get to be only 5 seconds

5696075
jar	war
both war and jar are zips

5696075
jar	war
so converting a war to a jar would not be useful because as the war contained a web the converted jar will also contain a web so trying to run it as a program will cause an error

5696078
free	strcpy
the strcpy function forgoes memory management entirely therefore all allocation needs to be done before the function is called and free afterward when necessary

5696078
strcpy	strncpy
strncpy works similarly to strcpy except that it allows you to pass an additional variable describing the size of the buffer so the function will stop copying when it reaches this limit

5696083
pop-up	dialog
i would use jquery ui dialog to handle the pop-up windows and have a form tag within each pop-up that uses its own mvc controller using ajax i prefer the jquery ajax command

5696103

dired	ido-mode
the basic problem here is that while there s a read-file-name-function which ido can attach itself to there s no read-directory-name-function ido-mode has no explicit support for this feature of dired and there s nothing about the read-file-name invocation i could figure out that ido-mode could hook onto

5696153
mouse	keyboard
in addition if the user does not appear to be using the computer no keyboard or mouse events are occurring then the system does not count this time towards the timeout

5696188

you have to implement these four methods touchesbegan withevent touchesmoved withevent touchesended withevent and touchescancelled withevent in the view that holds the button

5696346
screens	tablet
that will reduce the battery consumption of the worst part of the device the screens specially in the amoled phones and tablet

5696356

i m trying to add to the path the bin folder inside wherever the makefile directory is

also you don t have to use your own subclass or write accessor just to access a managed object s attributes and relationships

5696469
google-chrome	firefox
here is a solution for google-chrome and firefox a modified kbx extension that targets the latest version of apps

5696473
put	get
i d imagine that you could put together a solution using ucma 3.0 to build a lync application to control a conference and get access to the video stream then stream that to the silverlight clients using iis live smooth streaming or something similar

5696482
min	max
straightforward solution with plain scala and anonymous lambda without any mappings folds double. min max value and so on

5696516
put	get
to put this into context what the call to response.redirect is doing is telling the client browser to issue an entirely new request a get request that is for an entirely new resource manclothes.aspx with a query string parameter

5696535
vim	emacs
graphical not vim emacs etc and will run in gnome fedora 14

5696535

i send receive both tcp and udp packets so i need to be able to calculate the size of these packets including their respective headers

5696623
udp	tcp
for both tcp and udp

5696672
udp	tcp
you cant send tcp or udp without an ip header so that must be accounted for as well

5696836
profiler	gprof
the profiler seems based on gprof and here are some comments about that

5696841
webkit	gecko
as this page points out you can use drawimage to draw the gif on the canvas and at the moment it ll draw the current frame from the gif in gecko and webkit -- but not in opera and also not according to the spec so it s not a good idea to rely on this behavior

5696902
puts	gets
it basically gets the user ids of friends and puts them in an array so i can check if the field matches any of the user ids

5696975
decimal	ieee

5697009
aggregate-functions	sum
group by should only be used if you have an aggregate-functions in your select such as sum or count

5697246
post	get
post which will never reach that else statement at the bottom so you dont get a httpresponse

5697246
post	put
the other thing that looks strange is even if you fix your indents you show the registerform initially and after the post request you put the data from your registerform into a gradeform if that doesn t validate you show pass your gradeform to your template

5697340
width	height
consider finding the sizes from the parent and calling onresize width height

drawimage	todataurl
i am storing the state of a canvas using the todataurl method and i am also trying to draw it on a canvas using the drawimage method

5697939
put	get
due to the above-mentioned subtleties it is generally a good idea to put an tailrec annotation on methods that you need to be optimized both in order to get a compile error but also as a hint to other developers maintaining your code

5697944
for-loop	loops
the reason that there s lots of waiting at the end of loops is that some of the threads are done well before the others and they all wait at the end of the for-loop for quite a while until everyone s done

5697989
sqldatasource	formview	sqldatasource	objectdatasource	objectdatasource	formview
the formview is inserting a record via the default sqldatasource or objectdatasource etc... and then you are calling another insert via the executescalar method e in your code represents the datasource you are using

if what you want is a copy - you need to allocate memory using malloc and then actually copy the values using strcpy if it s a null-terminated string memcpy or a loop otherwise

5698369
powerpc	i386
they are built as 32-bit i386 and powerpc using a deployment target of os x 10.3 so they will run on all apple systems shipped that support any version of os x 10.3 through 10.6 and should run on os x 10.7 when released

5698369
powerpc	i386
the most important thing is to build them as universal builds with -arch i386 and -arch powerpc

5698400
lme4	nlme
the r code is at the same place and for longitudinal data it seems to be generally considered wrong these days to just fit ols instead of a components of variance model like in the lme4 package or in nlme which to me seems to have been wildly overtaken by lme4 in popularity recently

5698401
directwrite	direct2d
and there is no telling when other browsers will add sub-pixel rendering to text in the future -- in fact ff4 already uses direct2d but may not be using directwrite

5699837
pop-up	dialog
i want to have a pop-up dialog with ok cancel and two spinners

5699950
submit	submission
the isset method on the submit button is unreliable because internet explorer will not send the submit button as a post variable if the user presses the enter key to submit the form and thus your code will not detect a form submission

5699982
distance	polygons
my hypothesis is that since each face of this difference effectively corresponds to a face of one of the polygons the separation distance is the shortest distance from 0 0 to the md and you apply this to the corresponding face on the polygons

5700016
width	height
height and width however will not

5700037
mouseleave	mouseenter
hover is a shortcut for hooking up functions to mouseenter and mouseleave

5700037

5700149
atomic	interlocked
there are native instructions in most cpus that provide you with the atomic interlocked exchange and add instruction so you want that instruction to be used to implement your function and i expect that the easiest way to achieve that from within c# would be to make the win32 api call

5700221
versioning	upgrade
i d recommend to upgrade c3p0 to the latest versioning currently 0.9.1.2

5700249
cassini	iis
i was testing my application with cassini and i thought that if i set it up locally in iis i will have the same issues

5700250
goto	break
it would be better if you cut and pasted the code so we can cut and paste it into an editor but basically the line before goto label_19 needs to go where the break line is

5700250
goto	break
the if statement following the break needs to become an else if and the goto label 22 can become a break or move the conditional that leads to goto label 22 into the for-loop as in my previous answer into the for-loop

5700260
packets	multicast
multicastsocket and its joingroup are about receiving multicast packets

5700260

because uiimagepickercontroller derives from uinavigationcontroller which derives from uiviewcontroller you can check out at handling view rotations in the uiviewcontroller doc to see if that info helps

5700540
vbscript	jscript
i think the options for the e are either e jscript or e vbscript

5700584

5701160
post	get
make sure you send the data with post method so you get enough space to send a big number of name

5701196
width	height
i think this is what you are looking for - your container should be overflow hidden your graph would be contained in some thing with a width and height and beyond that you just need to calculate a constraint box which is going to be the .offset of the container adding the extra space by the calculating overflowed portion i.e

5701196
put	get
put it all together and you get

5701218
rss	feed
i have wcf rest service returning xml rss feed

5701469
minimum	max
let me tell you you that while deleting a node you need to replace it with either the max node in left sub tree or the minimum node in the right sub tree

5701469
minimum	max
if you want to delete the node 90 you need to take care that you replace it with either 80 which is its max node in the left subtree or the 92 which the minimum node in the right sub tree

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
then you can do works in ie firefox safari google-chrome ++

5701768
put	get
so to get a clean data path you need to also put the pty tty in raw mode

5701768
stdout	stderr
there is no distinction there between stdout and stderr that is a userspace convention

5701768
stdout	stderr
so you will always see stdout and stderr mixed when using a pty tty

friend	member-functions
if you want to prevent others only non-friend classes and functions from copying while allowing friend and member-functions to copy then second approach is the way to go

5702219
friend	member-functions
if you want to prevent everyone friend non-friends member-functions from copying then first approach is the only correct solution

5702219
friend	member-functions
note that the second approach does not prevent friend and member-functions from copying that is from calling the copy-functions

5702242
goto	break
it doesn t break the 2 good ways to use goto

5702254
config	ini
most config files are ini files format name value n

the point of salting password hash is that the salt should be different for each stored hash

5705512
hash	salt
that way an attacker can t use a single precomputed hash dictionary against all the hash he d need a separate dictionary for each salt value

5707967
oncreate	ondestroy
if everything is in one activity just open database and cursor in oncreate and close in ondestroy

5707968
public	protected
looking at the public protected interface of the class there s only one redeeming quality it implements the non-generic iequalitycomparer interface

5707968
comparator	icomparer
we recommend that you derive from the comparator t class instead of implementing the icomparer t interface because the comparator t class provides an explicit interface implementation of the icomparer.compare method and the default property that gets the default comparator for the object

5707974
width	height
i would appreciate if someone can provide code examples for controls in absolute layout so i can get the same output on all phones and set height and width so that they are same in phones with different resolutions

5707994
width	height
for canvas you don t actually use style to determine its width and height

5708082
typedef	struct
note that you could typedef the union as you have the struct

5708126
for-loop	arrays
the batchupdate completes without throwing any exceptions and the subsequent for-loop prints nothing as every item in the inserted arrays returns -2 success

5708163
postgresql	mysql
databases - mysql postgresql i will likely be using one of these two databases for my projects

full join gets all records from both tables and puts null in the columns where related records do not exist in the opposite table

5708550
min	max
basically i need to be able to take the sum count max min etc of a column only including rows satisfying a particular condition without needing a work column for each condition it s easy enough with a work column just have a column containing if condition column 0 and then sum count whatever it

5708555
serializable	deserialization
serializable and deserialization code should be matched up so that they can be examined and altered together

5708560
int	chars
when windows nt added support for unicode int the early days when it was assumed that unicode would use 16-bit chars it did so by creating a parallel version of its api that used wchar_t instead of chars

folder	directory
if you want to completely remove any bindings to mercurial for a directory containing a repository you can just delete the .hg folder in it

5708677
codeigniter	fuelphp
there are some that integrate it with doctrine i would recommend you look at other php frameworks that have a built in orm one that is somewhat similar to codeigniter in approach is fuelphp

5708679
int	double
on a modern cpu if you restrict your int values to the range +- 2 52 then using a double will be barely less efficient than using a long

5708679
int	double
the double iee754 type has 53 bits of mantissa so you can easily represent the 32-bit int range and then some

5708713
division	multiplication
a division for example would have to be rounded down and a multiplication would either have to be checked for overflow or masked down to fit in the integer range

5708715
processors	hyperthreading
in a numa memory architecture which have been relatively mainstream in x86 since intel hyperthreading and amd opteron there s an ideal group of processors which can efficiently access a particular region of memory and all other processors will pay a significant penalty to access that range

5708716
rtp	rtsp
this is the simplest approach as you don t need to host an rtp rtsp service on your pc

5708716
rtp	rtsp
it s also the most universal as all network providers should allow your client to use http but use of rtp rtsp isn t guaranteed

5708723
clang	llvm
the llvm compiler 2.0 uses the clang front-end to parse your code and generates the compiled output using llvm

5708724
mongoid	mongomapper
morphia mongomapper mongoid to name a few

5708727
clang	llvm
clang is a front end which parses c c++ and objective c code and translates it into a representation suitable for llvm

5708727
clang	llvm
llvm gcc was an initial version of a llvm based c++ compiler based on gcc 4.2 which is now deprecated since clang can parse everything it could parse and more

5708732
clang	llvm
some people might refer to clang or llvm-gcc incorrectly as llvm which may cause some confusion

5708732
clang	llvm
clang is a whole new c c++ objective-c compiler which uses its own frontend and llvm as the backend

5708732
clang	llvm
each of these approaches plain gcc gcc + llvm and clang have their advantages and disadvantages

5708732
clang	llvm
the last few sets of benchmarks i ve seen showed gcc to produce slightly faster code in most test cases though llvm had a slight edge in a few while llvm and clang gave significantly better compile times

5708737
integer	unsigned
unsigned right shift converts its operand to an unsigned 32-bit integer while the rest all other shifts and bitwise and or convert their operand to a signed 32-bit integer

5708905
simplecursoradapter	spinner
i have an android application with a spinner control that is backed by a database using a simplecursoradapter

5708920
for-loop	arrays
the program will check and with the 5 values from the arrays i have and print out numbers that are larger than what the user put in in this case which is 17 i use a for-loop to do this

5708955
installation	upgrade
i would suggest sql server compact edition - it s free file based requires no extra installation and this also gives you a nice upgrade path since it also supports entity framework

5709028
gridview	checkboxlist
i currently have two web controls one being a checkboxlist and the other a gridview

5709028
gridview	checkboxlist
the gridview s data configuration has a parameter in it s query which is linked to the selected values from the checkboxlist

5709050
post	get
that said you should either try with mime encoding or try to get a hang of post requests

5709158
rar	zip
to be sure the actual class exists in the swc you can open the swc with zip rar program and look in the inclusion xml for the line

5709169
int	chars
declaring a pointer of type or instructs the compiler that a later attempt to dereference it using the unary operator must yield a result of int chars or mytype respectively

5709170

i create a directory named js in my media root then create tiny_mce and copy scrpits from tinymce tiny_mce.js is in this directory to this folder

5709287
processors	hyperthreading	cpu	processors	cpu	hyperthreading
it would be good to know what physical cpu this is but i m assuming from your phrasing about logical processors that there is 1 physical socket 2 cpu cores and hyperthreading is enabled giving you 4 logical processors

5709287
processors	hyperthreading
this sharing can take place at different levels for both hyperthreading and multicore processors alu execution resources cache at different levels etc but in broad terms physical cores in the same socket won t be affected much by what the other core s is are doing and logical cores implemented by hyperthreading will be hugely affected by what their hypertwin is doing

5709287
processors	hyperthreading
the results you got -- on processors a and b being intentionally ambiguous about which 2 processors those are you get double the performance of a alone but on processors a and c you get approximately the same performance as a alone -- sure sound like hyperthreading is the difference where a and c are hypertwins in the same physical core and b is in the other physical core

5709287
cpu	affinity
i would run task manager keep an eye on loads on each cpu before you run your test to get an idea of how much else is going on and where windows schedules it then run your test again a few times for different combinations of cpu affinity and see if you can confirm or deny this theory

5709381
prepare	execute
i have been looking for a working sollution that can do what mine does but is better prepare for compatibility issues technically i want to decide what part to update based on the parameters so when the original page is rendered i dont know yet what to write to execute and render attribute

5709485
postgresql	mysql
it s pretty easy under postgresql and can be done under mysql argument under 5.5 afaik

5709533
postgresql	mysql
point to make also is that heroku uses postgresql by default even if you ve included mysql gem

5709544
getter	setter
so maybe the object will be car and have a setter getter for door colour wheels

5709549
post	get
i think it could be useful blog post get more out of your content content modeling and data stores

5709554
proficy	historian
the powerful compression algorithms of proficy historian enables you to store years of data easily and securely online which enhances performance reduces maintenance and lowers costs

5709554
proficy	historian
you can configure ge intelligent platformsâ s proficy historian without the active maintenance and back-up routines that a traditional rdb requires

5709554
proficy	historian
popular options are proficy historian from general electric or osisoft s pi historian

5709567
post	get
i ve experienced the issue of a scrollview starting off scrolled down slightly the solution was to post a runnable which called the animateto 0 0 method to get the list to scroll to the top

5709573
rjava	jri
c program files r r-2.9.2 library rjava jri

5709646
mdpi	hdpi
all i would say is that obviously romain guy is correct about using drawables to keep xml files in and then moving image resources into the relevant mdpi hdpi and ldpi folders the only time i d go against this is when you wish to target 1.5 devices

5709659
free	malloc
i can see it malloc and free the view as i open and close it

5709671
viewdidload	viewwillappear
correction the above code should be in viewwillappear rather than viewdidload

5709685
pop-up	dialog
you can either create a pop-up or a dialog

5709690
flowlayout	jsplitpane
i expect to be able to slide the jsplitpane s slider bar to the left beyond the edge of the buttons compressing that jpanel and have the flowlayout wrap the buttons to a second row

5709726
ccscene	cclayer
use two cclayer objects gamelayer and hudlayer as child nodes of one ccscene gamescene

5709749
querypath	phpquery
this is performance-wise not the better choice but easy to do with phpquery or querypath

5709770
children	parent
here is one possible solution which basically tracks the popups child windows and injects them as automation children of the parent page

5709784
google-chrome	firefox
i also tried google-chrome n firefox they don t have the border as in ie9

5709827
portrait	landscape
the uisplitviewcontroller is going to resize the view controller to its own content size which for sure in portrait mode not sure about landscape off the top of my head is going to be 768.0

5709870
stdout	stderr
i m redirecting stdout and stderr in a perl script with

5709875
post	get
this blog explains how this is done and a follow-on post that shows how to get window borders

5709890
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
and this gcal works perfectly in google-chrome and opera just doesn t display at all in firefox

5709918
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql seem to be equally supported from what i ve noticed

5709930
profiling	benchmarking
maybe try profiling different parts of the code with the benchmarking class

5709977
client-side	server-side
rather use both server-side and client-side validation or simply server-side alone

5709982
stdout	stderr
the only way i can think of is to fork off a subprocess which sends back everything via pipe think io pipe or something like ipc open2 - either way you still redirect your stderr to stdout in the child and then in the parent write the stuff you get in the pipe to the log file - this allows you to open the logfile when you first have data

5709988
spaces	linefeed
it seems to be spaces or possibly even a linefeed

5709988
spaces	linefeed
this seems to fix it outputting spaces and or a linefeed but the value is still lost

5709989
pop-up	dialog
1 the user clicks the edittext a timepicker dialog pop-up the user selects the hour and minute and the edittext text is set to the time picked

5710068
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you should probably put the viewdidload code into viewwillappear as the bounds of everything may not have been set in viewdidload before viewwillappear

5710095
postgresql	mysql
this is standard sql92 syntax so will work in any db that supports that including postgresql mysql and sqlite

5710107
int	chars
the logic is simply to process each chars into it s int value adjusting for position within the string

5710126
folder	directory
i tried editing the buildinfo.properties file to change the publish path to home but all that did was create a literal home folder in my project directory

5710131
int	chars
for each one add to the counter you re keeping - the value to add is the int value of the chars

5710143
nas	qnap
the next steps will be to optimize performance and logic as this script runs on my nas low cpu and memory performance qnap ts-219p

5710154
int	chars
in c c++ and java strings are made up of chars that can individually be treated as int usually one byte thanks to ascii

5710154
multiplying	add
we know now that we re reading in a new digit so we multiplying the previous value by 10 to shift the value over and then add in the digit

5710175
mdpi	hdpi
50sp looks right on 240 hdpi wvga800 30sp looks right on 120 ldpi qvga and 160 mdpi hvga

5710177
width	height
box-shadow will not really work gecko firefox and other browsers add the length of the shadow to the object and therefore create and overflow horizontally if you set the object to have full width or height

5710208
post	get
i need to get the time elapsed and post it through my php file so that it gets saved in a table that was created in our mysql database

5710217
drjava	bluej
in some java ides bluej and drjava for example the user can open an interaction window where java expressions and statements can be typed in

5710221
textview	simplecursoradapter
you supply the ids of the textview widgets and the corresponding column names from the cursor in the simplecursoradapter constructor

5710231
google-chrome	firefox
true basic http authentication is not currently supported but i got it working now for firefox and for google-chrome

5710267
postgresql	mysql
at the same time i want to migrate my database from mysql to postgresql

5710267
postgresql	mysql
basically i want take the data from the mysql database and i want to fit it to the new schema in the postgresql database

5710267
postgresql	mysql
the new tables in the postgresql database consisted of joined views from the mysql database

5710280
debian	linux
i m using debian linux so that should simplify things a bit

5710285
inherited	properties
therefore your mvvm must inherited from dependencyobject and then you can create a dependency properties that can be animated

5710287
ftp	telnet
such as ssh ftp passwd telnet etc

5710323
postgresql	mysql
you can use a database abstraction layer to handle the differences between mysql and postgresql but for the most part you re on your own

5710342
hide	show
i have a form where i show hide fields dynamically using jquery depending on some radio buttons

5710395
width	margin
this works by centring the lhs of the element using left 50 then centering the element by using a negative margin of exactly half it s width

5710426
free	malloc
trying to free a pointer not returned by malloc d or already free d

5710443
ubuntu	linux
the code i ve posted above works beautifully when the server is running on arch linux or ubuntu

5710448
folder	directory
approach #2 will automatically add new folder files as they are added to the directory tree

5710475
nsurlconnection	nsurlprotocol
when you would like to display an iad you can send your pause notification this will cancel the nsurlconnection but not the nsurlprotocol which will remain open and loading and thus your webview will continue to appear as if it were loading

5710475
nsurlconnection	nsurlprotocol
then when the add is finished you can send a resume notification much the same except in this case any active nsurlprotocol handlers receiving the notification will create new nsurlconnection using the range header to resume where they left off

5710475
nsurlconnection	nsurlprotocol
if you want a timeout then it should be in the nsurlprotocol handlers nsurlconnection

5710481
free	malloc
memory allocated with malloc will persist until you manually remove it with free

5710481
free	malloc
in general try to write your free calls the same time you write your malloc calls

5710481
free	malloc
maybe you have a foo_init function that calls malloc and creates associated contexts from an api then you pass that context into other routines that operate on that data and then you need to place the free calls into a foo_destroy or foo_free or similar routine

5710481
free	malloc
perhaps this memory is being returned too soon perhaps some pointer is being free ed two or more times or you re overwriting your buffers that malloc sizeof nav_str call is a little worrying

5710522
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
you don t need the dataoutputstream here and you must create the objectoutputstream before the objectinputstream otherwise you get a deadlock

5710532
google-chrome	firefox
yes it sucks for sure but you ll usually find that when you get it working in ie7 and then test in firefox ie8 or ie6 - it s pretty close or the differences are an easy fix compared to testing in say google-chrome and then double checking in ie7

5710668
ubuntu	linux
i use source insight in windows but now i use ubuntu and i can t find a version of source insight for linux

5710691
width	height
i need a way to calculate the width and height values of an image when resized to 1024px

5710691
width	height
the largest value of the image height or width will be resized to 1024px and i need to figure out the remaining width or height value

5710691
portrait	landscape
this needs to be dynamic as some images will be portrait and some landscape

5710693
google-chrome	firefox
if on a localhost i would suggest using firefox or google-chrome and installing firebug for mozilla and google-chrome gets a default

5710696
portrait	landscape
i am trying to display a custom uiview on top of all other views making it modal that works correctly in both portrait and landscape

5710696
portrait	landscape
it seems that mainwindow is always in portrait regardless of what the actual device orientation is so even when i am in landscape my custom view displays upside down as if it was in portrait mode

5710696
portrait	landscape
my question finally is how do i correctly add my custom view to the main windows so that it is correctly orientated in landscape as well as portrait and still displays over the entire screen

5710705
udp	tcp
ok to start you re using a udp socket where websockets use tcp

5710714
width	height
the values of width and height at the end correspond to the width and height of the image

5710801
width	height
it will choose the largest possible size less than 1024x1024px that has the same width height ratio as the original image

5710898
postgresql	mysql
it s basically a middle-man between mysql and postgresql and will be able to handle all the differences between them

5710922
mp4	h.264
i use the code below to play an mp4 video h.264 aac codecs from a url the url is perfectly fine no redirect 404 or anything

5710942
cout	cin
it seems the benefits of modularization and templates would be a no-brainer even if you couldn t use your cin or cout

5710946
dao	facade
so on the server side you have the dao and facade layers

5710951
.htaccess	httpd.conf
add this to your .htaccess or httpd.conf file

5710973
min	max
first build a query go get your min id and max urgency

5711055
width	height
just guessing you set a height for the buttons but not a width

5711065
move	drag
when i open the dialog i have a set of functions that query a drag drop event on a calendar if it is a multiple event then i need to make the dialog not modal and allow further interactivity with th calendar to move another event

5711132
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
the problem is that your code loops through all indices of the arrays using a canonical for-loop which is fine

5711144
for-loop	arrays
the last iteration of your for-loop is referencing one past the end of your arrays so you get an arrayindexoutofboundsexception

5711158
nsmutablestring	nsstring
if you really need to modify an instance directly you can use an nsmutablestring instead of an nsstring

5711160
nsmutablestring	nsstring
nerver use nsstring for string manipulation use nsmutablestring

5711160
nsmutablestring	nsstring
nsmutablestring is the subclass of nsstring and used for that purpose

5711160
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the mutable subclass of nsstring is nsmutablestring

5711174
int	chars
currently i have my java object defining this field as a string and the database mysql is an int padded to 4 chars laborcode int 4 zerofill

5711206
put	get
you could put a get param on the image like

5711219
client-side	server-side
you re trying to combine server-side scripting with client-side scripting here

5711253
x86	64bit
there is no way to make a direct and unconditional jump to an address with a displacement greater than 2gb on any x86 32 or 64bit

5711315
rss	feed
am working on a news paper project but without rss feed so i was compelled to make it s feed programatically using php so i have 2300 process of processing pages and inserting in mysql the results of the processing

5711316
int	double
in your manufacturer class you re calling the superclass constructor with an int string int and double

5711316
superclass	subclassing
the getinventorymethod exists in the superclass and is not private so you can call it from the subclassing like this

5711350
rss	feed
usually rss feed implies that you put there just a subject and some text snippet

5711350
rss	feed
i d create rss feed as simple xml file so it is not necessary to load data from mysql on every hit users do

5711411
boost	stl
first stl s and boost s smart pointers are available on windows and there s nothing wrong with using those

5711438
children	parent
work with parent and children

5711442
onresize	onload
use the onload event of your iframe and the onresize event of the window to resize the iframe to the required size

5711463

5711659
setinterval	settimeout
there is no way to delete an object only to let it become unreachable in which case the gc may reclaim destroy it if it feels like it -- however both setinterval and settimeout will maintain a strong reference to the callback which 1 will fire the callback even if the callback and or myevent is not strongly reachable elsewhere 2 may prevent other objects from being eligible for reclamation if they are reachable via the callback

5712406
width	height
but it doesn t help at all for width and height

5712406
width	height
a possible solution would be to use snipmate for the snippet use for the image s path capture the path and feed it to some command line utility fill the width and height attributes with its output

5712438

5712546
jar	manifest.mf
this is the task of the jar plugin which provides a way to indicates in the manifest.mf the main class of your project

5712608
width	height
you should specify in your main mxml the width and height of your application even though it contains but a clickable image

5712608
width	height
and nonetheless in your html you should have both your object and embed tags to have the same width and height and you should specify a value to your embed tag s align attribute as well eg

5712608
width	height
to set the html object s width and height based on your flex button s size you should update your application mxml code as follows

5712608
width	height
these values width and height are passed to the javascript function onflashappinited which you should also update

5712925
post	get
what i d do is acumulate them in an array but you can t pass an array to the server so at the time of passing that array just transform the array in a serializable string you can pass it by get or post whatever you want and deserialize the string at destination

5712964
put	get	post	get	post	put
rest isn t limited to crud and the put get post delete methods are not necessarily the same as create retrieve update delete

5712980
wadl	wsdl
wsdl wadl is not mandatory for restful webservices

let s get back to the webservice scenario if you want to invoke a webservice located on a webserver which uses ssl and https there is a problem

5713208
hide	show
think about using different charts in your modal popup that you hide or show based on the popup you re using

5713216

ubuntu	linux
first my present amd machine is running ubuntu linux with 6cpu-core and ps -ef gave

5713517
getter	setter
after that and now coming back to your question first of all you generate stored procedures for your getter and setter

make the script runnable as root via sudo with no passwd really trying to hide the passwd in your code doesn t really help with security

5713762
restrict	shared
alternatively set up a script via x inetd which reads a shared secret and a username from stdin and runs adduser as root restrict connections to localhost and set up your php script to communicate with this via sockets

5713772
tesseract	tessnet2
if you don t want to reinvent the wheel i suggest you use tesseract an open source ocr in c++ or tessnet2 which is a .net wrapper around it

5713772
tesseract	tessnet2
i had the same approach as yours grayscale then thresholds etc in .net then i adapted a bit tesseract tessnet2 is a wrapper around tesseract 2.0 not 3.x which is the actual version to have a good interface for ocr output then i have good results

5713909
stdout	stderr
still captures only stdout not stderr

5713909
stdout	stderr
if i execute stderr actually goes to dev null and only stdout is printed in terminal

5713910
prepare	execute
use odbc_prepare to prepare an sql statement and odbc_execute to pass in the parameters and execute the statements

5713962
stdout	stderr
here you are capturing the stdout of sh which is not the stderr of cmd

5714007
factors	matrix
the matrix is coerced to character if there are columns of numeric and character or factors

5714056
profiling	debugging
btw you are profiling a release binary and not a debugging one aren t you

yes there are several ways in nhibernate to query the database plain sql hql icriteria queryover and nhibernate.linq

5714117
macports	homebrew
i installed homebrew and after it continued to give me warnings about having macports installed i uninstalled that

5714119
boost	stl
also i don t have access to most of the standart libs no boost stl etc..

5714148
sse	avx
for example with clever use of sse or avx you could process the neurons in chunks of 4 or 8 and use a multiply-add instead of two separate instructions

5714150
unix	bsd
you didn t mention what os this is running on - if its linux unix bsd then you could just use sed to change all the absolute links and grep to find the relative ones which you ll probably need to edit by hand

5714169
hide	show
my problem is that i want to show some sub-folders or sub-elements contained in one parent folder that i may want to hide filter

5714169
children	parent
if i filter the parent folder then children folders or elements contained are filtered by default and i am not able to show them in my tree view

5714194
children	parent
if you filter the parent the children are filtered by default

5714194
children	parent
if you want only few of the children to be filtered then you should set the filter on that pattern only - not on the parent

5714247
coff	omf
to include glew in borland it is first needed to convert visual studio coff lib from coff to borland builder omf lib

5714309

for-loop	arrays
my arrays s for-loop currently results in numbers like 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 ....to 1000

5714343
button	checkbox
attach to the mousedown event on the checkbox control and see if the right mouse button was clicked mousebuttons.right and store it in a variable like currentcheckbox which you then can reference

5714431
google-chrome	firefox
the following can draw two arcs easily using svg and it works on firefox or google-chrome

5714449
hide	show
you could also use show and hide instead of the dn class

5714457
hide	show
i think it s pagination you re after but perhaps using the jquery columnize or columnizer plugin would work then you could tweak to show hide the columns created

5714467
google-chrome	firefox
i see two javascript errors on your live page in both google-chrome and firefox

5714477
google-chrome	firefox
the demo is here and is working on google-chrome and firefox 4

5714484
serializable	deserialization
so these objects need to contain logic for usage in the first process in the second process as well as serializable and deserialization logic

5714520
try-catch	exception-handling
why doesnot outer try-catch handle this exception-handling

5714537
getter	setter
if the property is implemented with an synthsize command the compiler will create getter and setter methods for you and it will make sure the getter retains your property

5714544
width	height
to estimate the body s height i could get the client s window s width then roughly guess how many lines the body occupies

5714556
width	height
therefore to enlarge the tile by one pixel on the screen we would need to add 1.0 scale to the width height

5714564
accessor	ivar
i believe that this doesn t make any real difference to the implementation however it s a nice way for you to be able to ensure that your public accessor are separate from the private ivar

5714567
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
they can present their views in multiple ways modal the new view slides up and covers the previous view in a tab of a uitabbarcontroller or as part of a navigational hirachy with a uinavigationcontroller

5714582
postgresql	mysql
i am not aware of node.js library for virtuoso as you have for mysql postgresql and the like

5714582
redland	jena
connections to virtuoso for querying the quad store can be made via http using the web server vsp or sparql endpoint or using any of the data access interface we have drivers providers for which include odbc jdbc ado.net oledb or rdf data providers jena sesame redland and others

5714607
n-gram	words
n-gram will tell you what is the probability that words is meaningfull

5714639
hash	md5
looking at the form it has an onsubmit call to a javascript function which takes the username and password and encrypts them into some kind of hash maybe md5 plus a little extra bits and bobs then saves them in further hidden fields in the login form

5714669
chown	chmod
if you can avoid them in the dangerous places rm chmod chown ... so much the better

5714670
next	except
my problem at the moment is next i added facebook request dialog and everything goes well except for one thing when a user gets notification the links goes to canvas page not to fan page where i would like to go...

5714672
post	get
now if i done this comparison it returns false because _post atloriginal values are strings the are passed trought get post from client and oldatlpos values are integer

5714703
flex	robotlegs
i m trying to build a flex application using the robotlegs framework and don t know how to deal with the creation of mediators - onregister being called only after the creationcomplete event of the view component

5714708
google-chrome	firefox
my site appears fine in firefox google-chrome but load it in ie tested in 7 8 and none of the background images load

5714720
thunk	trampolines
local classes are used to create trampolines functions usually known as thunk

5714770
maven	pom.xml
then i created the pom.xml file to enable the maven dependency in that i have given the groupid as projectname and artifactid also as projectname

5714821
quicksort	mergesort
in worst case quicksort will have o n 2 where mergesort will be o n log n

5714878
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort and mergesort are the first two

5714878
quicksort	mergesort
as jan said mergesort has always a complexity of o n log n and quicksort is up to o n 2 in worstcase

5714895
quicksort	mergesort
yes both quicksort and mergesort are divide-and-conquer algorithms

5714895
quicksort	heapsort
quicksort and heapsort and can be

5714901
quicksort	mergesort
the implementation details of the underlying data-structures would also be a factor such as efficient random access needed by quicksort and the mutability of data-structures would have an effect on the memory requirements particularly mergesort

5714978
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested in google-chrome ie6+ and firefox and this approach seems to work in all of them

5714999
post	get
using firebug you can easily get the post data for the login page and use it to create a webrequest and login to the forum

5715001
directwrite	direct2d
the second point of the original answer is no longer valid either because its now possible to share d3d11 backbuffer with direct2d and through it draw text with directwrite

5715016
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
so in viewdidload of rootviewcontroller inside uinavigationcontroller of recententrysplitviewconntroller how can i show uinavigationbar promp

5715044
pull	push
but when you can clone push pull that is publish to different repos which can have different purposes in themselves then master can play a different role from repo to repo

5715084
nsstring	nsdata
your response may be uint8 but you don t need to copy it into a as your already have it in a cfdataref assuming the you pass in really is a cfdataref if it isn t you have other problems... - a cfdataref is toll-free bridged with nsdata you can just cast from one to the other and you can construct an nsstring directly from the bytes in an nsdata

5715177
width	height
and if you find out what to use for fill_parent hint try -1 then you may use those constants for width and height

5715184
entities	entitymanager
i have two entities person and order being managed by jpa hibernate entitymanager

5715215
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort has a bad worst case while mergesort is always o n log n guaranteed but typical quicksort implementations are faster than mergesort in practice

5715332
coldbox	coldspring
their relationships are best managed by some sort of bean container service locator of which i believe coldbox has its own another example is coldspring

5715380
glut	sdl
anyway if you want things to be really easy instead of glut sdl etc

5715391
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it with firefox 3.6 google-chrome 10.0 and internet explorer 8 and it seems to work fine

5715394
rss	feed
i ll assume the rss feed are in date order anyway so the newest one is first

5715437
put	get
that way you can get the best of both worlds a simple way to see a persons email-address without using joins and a flexybility when someone decides to put every email address he ever owned into the app

5715442
put	get
if you put the limits in the branches of the union you only get the first 50 entries among those who were already within the top 50 of their persona kind which might be different

5715461
dpkg	aptitude
aptitude upgrade dpkg or apt-get install dpkg if you don t have aptitude

5715473
versioning	upgrade
update 05 04 13 final comments after two years i was able to work again on the system with the problematic greek character delta and was able to draw some final conclusions about the problem so first i upgrade the versioning of jasper we were using to 5.x and still experienced the problem

5715473
versioning	upgrade
so my suggestion is still true any people having this problem upgrade your jasper versioning to 5.x but also re-export your font extensions through ireprot 5.x

5715483
mouseleave	mouseenter
i am using mouseenter and mouseleave instead of onhover so that the append isn t happening a million times however i am still having an issue with people entering and leaving their mouse multiplte times on the div

5715488
dpkg	aptitude
get the .deb for dpkg and install it but you should really be doing it via apt-get or aptitude

5715499
min	max
it has a couple basic properties for setting max min values performing steps and setting the value directly

5715613
inherited	properties
another very important reason why this is also a bad idea is that when you parse this file you will need to resolve inherited properties yourself

5715613
inherited	properties
one of the major technical design aspects of the iis6 metabase is properties inherited

5715613
inherited	properties
for example if you re collecting script maps then this is an inherited properties

5715613
inherited	properties
unless you ve explicitly set the scriptmap or perhaps the defaultdoc or some other inherited properties on a site virtual directory or application then you ll need to walk back up the metabase tree to find this value

5715637
websphere	ibm
i configured ibm websphere portal 6.1 on was7

5715658
min	max
in the group clause you have to write all the fields that aren t in the agregate count max min

5715684
public	protected
then i can happily insert mock dependencies via the protected constructor and test all the public methods via the inheriting class

5715756
getter	setter
there is very simple solution add field version with getter setter pair

5715760
folder	directory
assuming that domain1.com and domain2.com are on the same local network then rather than using mod-rewrite i would suggest creating symlinks to the shared image folder so that they are accessible in each of your sites as if they were a local directory

5715777
inherited	subclassing
if you use a sti cti entity as a many-to-one or one-to-one entity you should never use one of the classes at the upper levels of the inherited hierachy as â œtargetentityâ only those that have no subclassing

5715783
int	chars
comparison between chars is normal chars order comparison between numbers is normal int order and comparison between a chars and a number places numbers before any chars except

5715798
width	height
has width 320dp and height 50dp

5715831
octal	decimal
im writing a program to convert a four digit octal number to a decimal number

5715856
nsmanagedobject	nsvaluetransformer
i ve written a custom nsvaluetransformer to map between the bound nsmanagedobject tag nsset and the nsstring nsarray of the token field

5715898
getter	setter
you could also possibly use an aop compiler to weave in a version filed getter setter or annotation into build domain model

5715931
width	height
i have stackpanel created in design xmal which has auto height and width

5716013
superclass	subclassing
so a reference is expected of the type cat but we are providing a reference for a superclass of type cat rather than a subclassing as it says in the definition above and this is allowed but with limited functionality unless you do a cast

5716024
submit	submission
that is - it will provide validators filters layouts but it also provides client-side jquery ui widget ajax submit and submission handling

5716048
folder	directory
hey i got the same error.in my case i d made a directory named web-inf apparently the name of the folder has to be mandatory in upper-case web-inf

5716078
screens	tablet
automation code will be triggered only if there are any automation clients like screens reader tabtip in tablet pcs etc running in the machine

5716093
octal	decimal
hello im writing a program to convert a four digit octal number to a decimal number

5716100
free	malloc
the malloc implementation will go through the list of free memory physical memory we will call it free list and find an appropriate chunk that is greater than or equal to 4 bytes

5716104
int	double
the non-const member is perfectly valid to call here and the double to int conversion is just as safe

5716110
cos	sin
i found the following bit of code in the aforge.net framework library and it shows additional cos sin operations being done that are not being handled in your code

5716122
button	checkbox
once the user clicks the saveattendance button i want to add all the studentid s displayed in the gridview along with adding the status of the checkbox weather they are checked or not into the attendance table fields studentid and present respectively

5716129
parsley	robotlegs
i m not expert in robotlegs i m actually a parsley addict however if you re using a mediator pattern that means that your mediator has direct access to the view itself

5716140
width	height
you d have to use absolute positioning to have elements overlap each other but then you can t have the elements adjust width and height to their contents

5716161
stdout	stderr
backquotes capture stdout not stderr

5716161
stdout	stderr
system will dump both stdout and stderr to their parent s settings

5716172
kohana	yii	cakephp	yii	cakephp	kohana
later you can also try kohana yii cakephp zend etc

5716226
width	height
this is fixed height and width header whereas i want it relative to the screen size

5716337
put	get
my problem is i get an error when i try to put it in isolated storage

5716337
put	get
however i only get this error when i try to put it into isolated storage

5716359
put	get
when i add layouts they get put on the bottom of each other or off the screen

5716366
filtering	grouping
the database then automatically appends filtering to user supplied queries to filtering out what can t be seen from the security grouping

5716382
post	get
allows variables to be set by either an http get or post which can pose a security risk since your site will presumably use one or the other

5716394
exponent	modulo
the modulo and the private exponent are the private key at least in a simplified way

5716394
primes	modulus
with rsa it is customary to include a few other parameters in the private key such as the two or more primes factors of the modulus

5716394
exponent	modulo
these extra parameters do not offer more power the modulo and private exponent are enough to compute signatures and decrypt data but allow for a faster implementation by a factor of 3x to 4x

you should also look at mysql prepare -- this will ensure that only 1 statement is execute and prevent additional sql vulnerabilities

5716627
calloc	malloc
a rule of thumb is that if you need more than a few hundred bytes allocate it dynamically using malloc or calloc instead of trying to create a large auto variable

and iirc there is no settings in x86 forcing the use of the range of 64bit double

5716851
hash	md5	int	chars
if for example the session id is an md5 hash to avoid having to deal with large 160 bit int that these values represent just strip the chars from the string using for example

5716869
union	distinct
if you want the columns to be of xml type you need to add type and use union all because the xml data type cannot be selected as distinct because it is not comparable

5717037
mousemove	mousedown
i digged its source and found two functions named downselector and moveselector getting invoked on mousedown and mousemove respectively

5717037

5717184
for-loop	loops
if you re going to use loops s index inside for-loop and this won t be required by others in next lines better declare the variable with var so you ll be sure x is for-loop s index initialized with 0 while the other one if other x variable is available in this context this will get overwritten by loops s index - that s you ll have some logical errors -

there are no public or protected members in these internal classes

5717379
installation	upgrade
if the installation type is not the same the upgrade is not performed

5717396
organization	naming
honestly i believe namespacing wouldn t repleace a right class naming scheme because namespaces are an organization thing while classes are part of what your program does

5717443

it s working very well in ie but in firefox google-chrome and other web browsers it gives me only 3 text rows and if these rows are full i need to start scroll

5717785
calloc	malloc
you can dynamically allocate a target buffer using malloc or calloc this is actually the preferred method since the buffer can be resized as necessary unlike a vla

5717791
integer	unsigned
image data in matlab is typically of type uint8 meaning each pixel is represented as an unsigned 8-bit integer spanning the range 0 to 255

5717791
int	double
assuming this is what in is when you perform your sum operation you will implicitly end up converting it to type double since an unsigned 8-bit int will likely not be big enough to hold the sum totals

5717811
portrait	landscape
i need a view controller on ipad to share two modes one in portrait and one in landscape

5717831
for-loop	loops
they can t be equivalent because in your first code only one loops is iterating the for-loop which checks the if-else statements at each iteration of row_index

introduce properties into the class with the accessor desired which doesn t give you access at design time directives can be applied to the aspect at design time to determine which properties to inject though

5718066
equals	gethashcode
also in case of composite id we have to override equals and gethashcode and all this seems to be overkill for such a simple task

5718122
ienumerable	ilist
an ienumerable does not give you the same features that an ilist

5718122
ienumerable	ilist
unless your stuff is an ienumerable that is also an ilist your code won t work

5718155
ienumerable	ilist
while every ilist is an ienumerable not every ienumerable is an ilist

5718158
multiplying	division
also note that in order to prevent the integer division from truncating your result you need to multiplying first and then divide

5718162
versioning	upgrade
i m using an old versioning of lucene lucene 2.4.1 i cannot upgrade

5718166

5718327
rss	feed
it has a nice menu with options to validate css html both local and remote and rss feed

5718328
children	parent
make a lookup table that has two columns that are keys to the events and have a parentevent|childevent layout so if your parent has 3 children his key is listed 3 times tied to different children keys

5718369
inherited	properties
all the controllers i push onto the navigation controller inherited from a base class that in viewdidappear adds a couple of uibarbuttonitems and sets the navigation controller s toolbar uinavigationcontroller.toolbar properties to be visible

5718376
post	get
if it works with get you can redirect to another action after handling post and there you can set the repspose header

5718419
hide	show
there are probably better ways to change this by playing with the hide and show events but this suits my needs

5718442
folder	directory
directory but it doesn t create the .svn folder for the project like it s supposed to

5718476
firefox	safari

anyway it is too expensive to upgrade every engineer s versioning of ms ms-office just for this one little feature of onenote

5718511
ant	maven
ivy for old projects which have complicated and established build process in ant - the conversion to maven may be real pain

5718511
ant	maven
ivy is dependency management only and adds basically just some ant tasks you are still in ant where maven does lots of extra stuff packaging deploying site generation etc.

5718535
post	get
hope this helps and please post back if you get this working and it looks at all reasonable

5718553
min	max
fitting a rectangle over all the points is pretty much a trivial affair sort them all get the min max and voilã

5718629
min	max
to find a best-fit rectangle over a set of points and with the assumption that all points in the set need to be within the rectangle all you need to do is find the min max in both dimensions

5718629
min	max
one way to do this would be to sort the points by their x dimension and take the first and last as the min max in that dimension and then repeat the process in the y dimension to get that min max

5718629
min	max
this wont give you the tightest fit on the set of rectangles because it won t ensure that one side of the rectangle is collinear with at least 2 of the points for that you will need the rotating calipers algorithm that bart kiers suggestes but it is a much faster algorithm since the rotating calipers does esentially the same as i have described here but then rotates the rectangle until one of it s edges lines up with 2 of the min max points

5718675
hash	md5
i would have guessed that ci would have implemented it better include the md5 hash to cover both the sessionid+timestamp when encoding them in the session record

5718681
spweb	spsite
you need to delete the spsite spweb instance if it is a new object

5718747

5718886
ostream	istream
i have this code in my header file and ive got loads of errors on the ostream and istream lines

5718887
accessor	ivar
as mentioned this is setting the ivar to be separate from the accessor

5718887
ivar	subclassing
the usual reason for separating the ivar and the property is to prevent collision in a subclassing

5718887
superclass	subclassing
this way subclassing can create a variable named window without colliding with the superclass window since it is actually _window

5718888
post	get
can i just use .val to get the value and then post this

5718918
ostream	istream	std	ostream
note all the standard types like istream ostream live within a namespace called std

5718930
ostream	istream
it s not clear to me the context this code appears in but the error suggests that these declarations appear before ostream and istream are defined

5718938
width	height
thanks it helped a bit...however i still missed some other properties as grid thickness but i solved it by inserting a row column with 1px height width to double the gridline and the qtablewidgetitem setbackgroundcolor was also helpful

5718947
width	height
rather than setting each image height and width i did so through css

5718947
width	height
since my width was a fixed width i set that but set the height to 100

5718947
width	height
this caused the box to not expand to fit the height and width of the images within

5718947
width	height
i imagine setting the width and height the box holding the images was sized right off the bat

5718950
pop-up	dialog
pop-up an alert dialog with 3

5718969
for-loop	loops
to use a while loops instead of a for-loop note that as a looping construct while is an alternative to for rather than to if it is necessary to step through the iterator manually

5718987
mouseover	mouseout
mouseover and mouseout fire every time the mouse cursor hovers over another element or no longer has a direct line of sight to the element for which it fires

5718987
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter and mouseleave on the other hand fire whenever the mouseleave the bounding box of the element

5718987
mouseout	mouseleave
try using mouseleave instead of mouseout

5719010
hide	show
in that slot create your new window and show it then hide the main window

5719013
portrait	landscape
regardless of all this i would suggest either allowing both portrait and landscape for both or only allowing portrait

5719072
post	get
i also tried changing the type to get instead of post but to no avail

5719085
post	get
android allows you to sent data in get and post method.

5719095
post	get
right now it looks like this is the only way in which i can get the json document to appear in the result of the post request the result variable

user can give id width height and description rectangle and then i write it to a file

5719187

getter	setter
i have the threadpoolmanager inherting from threadpooltaskexecutor in order to give it access to the getter and setter methods of the thread properties such as

5719318
post	get
the closest that an asmx service will get to rest is that it can be configured to permit a get or post request in which case it will return plain xml with no soap envelope

5719366
google-chrome	safari
i am using font-face to embed some fonts and everything works just fine on google-chrome safari etc

5719385
uiview	subviews
i thought it would be by just adding a uiview subviews underneath the uitableview which would then expose it when the tableview is dragged too far but this didn t work

5719436
mouseover	mouseout
if you want to do something different after hovering try binding to both mouseover and mouseout

5719465
width	height
the screen maintains its width but shrinks the height resulting in a narrow stretched image

5719471
hash	md5
on the particular file i m testing the php and python md5 hash strings are as follows respectively

5719482

5719563
google-chrome	firefox
the animation worked fine in google-chrome 10 and firefox 4

5719595
for-loop	arrays
if you re going to have a particularly large form you may want to look at using arrays and a for-loop

5719607
client-side	server-side
the server-side control is rendered using a combination of client-side javascript code and html

5719612
post	get
you can read more about http get vs post here

there are two sets of persistence annotations entity and table - jpa annotations in package javax.persistence and hibernate annotations in package org.hibernate.annotations

5719738
folder	directory
i m also not sure why it s calling the epd64.framework directory -- the module folder and contents are actually contained in library frameworks python.framework ... site-packages

5719752
google-chrome	firefox
this works on all browsers to expand the div vertically and also displays the horizonal width correctly on firefox google-chrome and ie7 8

try doing a or the same for just your get and post

5719836

edit apologies all - when i said it was working in safari that was a typo - i meant firefox

5719868
google-chrome	safari
here it is being broken in google-chrome same behaviour in safari

folder	directory
also i d like to download the project into the workspace directory and then currently it makes a bunch of folder based on on the server

5719920
stdout	stderr
all its standard io stdin stdout stderr operations will be redirected to the parent process through three streams getoutputstream getinputstream geterrorstream

5719921
keydown	keyup
i also get repeated key events for normal keys in keydown and keyup without difficulty

5719952
post	get
everything works fine when the user clicks the button but when the hit enter it seems the form is trying to submit through the html not through the jquery and you get taken to where the form should post

5719978
post	get
second you need to be able to go to your script and using a certain method like get post variables rest soap etc be able to call your function

5719999
textview	imageview
in my listview each item consists of imageview and textview

5720045
cvs	svn
those icons are typically used for version control like cvs or svn

5720057
put	get
this works fine normally but when i put the code in a function and call it i get the following error

5720100
superclass	subclassing
after some debugging i determined that the classify call is returning widgets bugs or sprockets bugs so when i call all on it it appears to be running against the superclass instead of running against the subclassing

5720146
width	height
there s nothing in my as3 code that modifies the scaling width or height of any of those fields

5720179
implements	extends
for most of the clojure constructs that allow you to implements interfaces or extends classes the sanest way - especially if you don t own the class - is to use closures to capture state

5720202
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
if it s a very deep inner loops however and you need to squeak out every last nanosecond my experience has been that with release build code a for-loop indexing over an arrays is measurably faster than a foreach loops with a slightly smaller performance loss for using delegates with linq vs

5720256
post	put
post with http put rails will expect a post object to edit thats why you see only post in the url underline it goes as a put request

5720461
rss	feed
think of taking an rss feed and only keeping track of the article dates and nothing else

5720471
post	get
i have tried the suggestions in this post but i can not get windows authentication working with iis express in vision studio 2010

5720522
serializable	deserialization
i decorate the method in the interface with this attributes and i need the type information in order to perform serializable and deserialization on the incoming and outcoming messages

5720548
hide	show
so if you have a gif show once the image has loaded it will hide it

5720551
for-loop	arrays
so i need to use expressions and a for-loop for filling the arrays but since this is my first c# project that is a bridge too far for me

5720566
folder	directory
keep in mind that aspx files or razor files that are just asp.net pages should not be in the views folder as mvc apps are configured to refuse serving up files in that directory

5720598
nexus	artifactory
i would add a maven repository to your environment such as artifactory archiva or nexus and deploy to that using ivy

5720598
jar	war
if it s a war i would use cargo but if it s a jar it really depends on what s executing the jar - you might need some sort of file copy scp etc

uitableview	nsindexpath

5720641
entity-relationship	diagram
as i mapped it out the entity-relationship diagram became a bit overwhelming

5720655
inherited	properties
my first thought was to create a base class that inherited from webcontrol and implements the new properties and methods but without multiple iheritance that would mean an inability to also derive from say textbox

5720664
uilabel	nsstring
data dynamic variable data that is converted into a nsstring type within a background thread displayed within a uilabel or nslabel on the main thread

5720676
lz77	lzw
this question may not be strictly limited to the lzw algorithm and may cover other implementations of lz77 and lz78

5720676
decoder	encoder
if the output of the encoder is streamed one code at a time to the decoder then the decoder can work with each code as it receives them

5720676
decoder	encoder
but if the encoder writes all the codes to a file the compressed file and then later that file is fed into the decoder then how does the decoder know where one code starts and another one begins

5720682
getter	setter
without manually defining getter and setter or using property other objects can t see or change the ivars

5720737
put	get
however when i hit my action with a parameter that i would expect to be put into the map i get the following error

5720778
hide	show
this would allow you to find the total number using php and you wouldn t need to make the third query if you simply output the contents of all the comments to the page using css to hide those that you don t want initially show and javascript to show them when the user clicks the view all link

5720800
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
wrapping the i o streams with objectinputstream objectoutputstream would again end up blocking things

5720845
post	get
ultimately the best fastest way to get the comments count is to store them within the news post table your almost caching the count query to the comments column

unusual combination of setinterval and settimeout

5720955
setinterval	settimeout
never use a string as the first setinterval settimeout argument

5720960
width	height
from gmaps4rails setting map width and height

5721007
setinterval	settimeout
to set up a poll on a fixed interval use setinterval or settimeout

5721037
for-loop	loops
however i am not aware of the best way to loops over this correctly so for me i might just load the product in the for-loop and not set the attribute to select all

5721169
width	height
then call your method myfunction string height string width string description

5721173
free	malloc
internally alchemy emulate a processor it seems to be an x86 proc and have a library that replicate some of the core c lib such as malloc free etc.

it is a small utiltiy which you can hide and show with a nsstatusitem

5721287
getter	setter
basiceffect has getter and setter for the world view and projection matrices but the shader itself keeps a single worldviewproj matrix which is why fails

5721288
versioning	upgrade
to detect a versioning upgrade store a copy of your versioncode in a preference

5721325
cvs	svn
finally the transition is easy because git can be used with a central repo just like it was a much faster version of cvs or svn

5721333
udp	tcp

width	height
this workaround assumes that you know can retrieve the width of your columns and the height of your grid cell renderers the dp size set in your layout xmls

5726182
tabitem	contentcontrol
when you press a certain key on a contentcontrol tabitem it focuses on the content

5726236
int	double
added the return and the cast to an int average returns a double

5726251
children	parent
in qt widgets resize themselves by emitting signals to their parent and children

5726261
websphere	ibm
i am trying to run the sample code from ibm sample code link to connect to websphere application server v7.0 through a jmx client

5726265
disk	ram
the idea is to save on disk access-time ram is roughly 100 times faster in theory

5726273
qgraphicstextitem	qtextdocument	qgraphicsview	qgraphicstextitem
i m using qtextdocument together with qgraphicstextitem to show a formatted text in a qgraphicsview

5726287
hide	show
i want to show hide the edit and delete buttons based on the value in the type column

5726292
google-chrome	firefox
this is not browser dependent as the same versions of google-chrome and firefox on all operating systems have these differences

5726297
concave	convex
the polygon might convex or concave and the position to cut might vary from each other

5726395
maven	pom.xml
plugins provided through maven master pom.xml your build use try

5726441
int	chars
in each location of the array store int numbers not chars

5726526
sorting	filtering
so the process is server will first do the sorting on particular criteria on vector and then filtering it using binary search

5726572
put	get	post	get	post	put
i am writing a nautilus script that currently uses curl to get post put to a rest service

5726587
sorting	filtering
one other idea is to use sqllite and let it manage storing sorting and filtering your data

5726588
getter	setter
in the parentpage i have a field iscancelbuttonclicked and its getter and setter

5726589
width	height
use relative values where is the top left corner of the image and the bottom right corner width and height similarily representing a fraction of the image size

5726657
portrait	landscape
when the layout changes from portrait to landscape or vice versa how can i detect when the orientation change event finished

5726683
inherited	properties
the idea behind this is to construct entities that will inherited from item with additional properties set

5726753
ppl	tbb
note that i answered a similar question with a performance slant on the msdn forums for the ppl and remember that syntax and semantics of task_group structured_task_group parallel_invoke and parallel_for parallel_for_each are consistent between the ppl and tbb

5726776
portrait	landscape
note with android 3.2 api level 13 or higher the screen size also changes when the device switches between portrait and landscape orientation

5726864
put	get
they get disfigured and its a mess.also i have put up a bitmap image on the background.upon moving the calculator the background image also

5726874
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s working in google-chrome and safari but not opera or firefox haven t even attempted ie yet

5726887
portrait	landscape
for landscape and portrait mode you can use different xmls incase u need to display your screen according to the orientations

5726910
post	get
i tried to get him to post it himself

5726929
gilead	dozer
pure dtos dtos with dozer and gilead use are described in details here

5726956
google-chrome	safari
but when i tested the same on google-chrome safari

5726956
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
and when i created the css for google-chrome its working on safari but not on mozilla firefox

5726967
children	parent
so i managed this by introducing a relationshipbuilder class which i used to keep track of the parent and children of a relationship without actually creating it

5726988
ubuntu	debian
emacs 23 running on various environments including debian and ubuntu

5727006
bonjour	avahi
it worked fine when we installed bonjour service on our machines and avahi on linux machines add .local partionname they will work only in same subnet address else it wont

5727019
innodb	myisam
myisam keeps track of the row count while innodb counts

5727026
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested in opera google-chrome safari firefox ie5.5 epic script fail ie6 ie7 ie8 ie9

5727044
hide	show
first i hide the tab bar then i show the translucent action sheet and immediatley after that show the tab bar

5727100
mouseleave	mouseenter
normally mouseenter and mouseleave events are microsoft based events jquery make them useable in all browsers using other function to create this effect.

5727100
mouseleave	mouseenter
so check jquery source and see how mouseenter and mouseleave works

5727100
mouseleave	mouseenter
as i said before it is not the basic function that only runs on ie but a simulation that acts just like mouseenter and mouseleave events by using other javascript functions.

5727103
ienumerable	iqueryable
can the following loop be implemented using iqueryable ienumerable or lambda expressions with linq

5727108
button	marquee
that said everything else about the dialog works including moving it clicking on my close button and drawing the marquee thing inside the listbox with the mouse

5727189
width	height
try setting the horizontalalignment and verticalalignment of the stackpanel to stretch and ensure that the stackpanel doesn t have explicit width and height set

5727233
sorting	filtering
does she need only filtering or also sorting

5727240
width	height
you can add or remove classes or recalculate height width with javascript on stop event

5727277
config	ini
the saved form should be textual data like the above to be usable in normal config files like ini or the registry

5727277
qsettings	qdatastream
hmm i looked at the qsettings source code and it just has hard-coded handling for some common types and then used qdatastream for the rest

5727281
ironruby	ironpython
like ironruby ironpython

5727281
ironruby	ironpython
yes at least you can with ironruby ironpython

5727297
hide	show
it will also hide show members or classes based on inheritance hierarchy

5727323
tabcontrol	tabitem
in my application i have used wpf tabcontrol i want to handle click event of the tabitem

5727349
google-chrome	firefox
requires special handling rather than having it just work as it does in firefox and google-chrome

5727351
google-chrome	firefox
the application is working fine in both firefox and google-chrome

5727381
qiodevice	qdatastream
the qdatastream class provides serialization of binary data to a qiodevice

5727381
serializable	deserialization
which will be responsible for serializable and deserialization of data

5727430
width	height
when i use above code the cardwrapper has height 0 and width 0

5727430
width	height
i can only see the home page when i set height width of cardwrapper to some value

5727474
opera	firefox
this works fine in ie8 firefox all versions as far as i can test opera etc but doesn t work in ie7 or previous

5727495
actionscript	mxml
i am using flex 4.1 actionscript not mxml

5727568
int	double
while using exponential operator in c# the compiler was reporting operator cannot be applied to operands of type int and double

5727609
mongodb	bson
maybe i don t understand your question directly but mongodb already stores everything using bson

5727717
inherited	properties
but when looking at inherited xml attributes from class android.view.view the properties android scalex android scaley are still available

5727754
accessor	properties
this protocol provides a mechanism to set values of object properties based on the names of the properties represented as nsstring s rather than calling the accessor directly

5727754
accessor	properties
in order for it to work you need to have defined your objects with accessor that follow the naming conventions easy enough using properties

5727761
uinavigationbar	uisegmentedcontrol
and that view got a uisegmentedcontrol right on uinavigationbar

5727787
wincrypt	cryptoapi
i have signed a data in windows using wincrypt cryptoapi pkcs_7_asn_encoding | x509_asn_encoding and in linux i have x509 certificate and the signed message which i have to verify

5727871
ubuntu	linux
for example the following code produces a linker error on windows compiled both with vs2010 and gcc but compiles successfully on linux ubuntu gcc

5727878
int	boolean
or use the color int rgba boolean hasalpha constructor for convenience at the cost of performance

5727906
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave
for a javascript solution you were close but typically you d use mouseover and mouseout or use mouseenter and mouseleave but not mouseover and mouseleave not usually

5727906
mouseover	mouseout
in this case i d probably use mouseover and mouseout but only act on events actually triggered by the element in question not bubbled ones

5727925
width	height
i have a problem regarding jfreechart.createbufferedimage width height info

5727925
width	height
i am creating a jfreechart in java and showing it in jsf page like this jfreechart.createbufferedimage width height info

5727925
width	height
right now i am passing width and height as hardcoded attributes

5727925
width	height
but i want the width and height should dynamically set accoding the cleint screen resolution in jsf page

5727936
hash	md5
if you really want to do something simple then assuming you ve got a record of the api keys you ve handed out i would write the client script so that it makes an md5 hash of the key with another bit of information on the form - a username for example lets call the hash string the request key and the username the username and i d include an identifier for the partner which we ll call partner_id

5727939
google-chrome	firefox
however when we run this in our client test environment which is identical to our local env. it works perfectly for firefox but not for google-chrome and ie

5727939
google-chrome	firefox
never reaches google-chrome or ie but it does for firefox

5728082
portrait	landscape
result is retained but landscape xml is not used instead portrait xml is used for both orientations

5728090
next	except
this works fine except that when the user selects a row it does not highlight - it only highlights when the user lifts off their finger so you briefly see it highlight before transitioning to the next view

5728158
g++	gcc
so as long as you target the same instruction set object file format and use the standard c++ abi which is now the default in gcc g++ you should be ok assuming of course that the standard c++ abi is actually standard and properly implemented by most modern c++ compilers that run on linux which seems to be the platform you re targeting

5728166
onclick	onchange
i process event onchange for input text and onclick for button

5728166
onclick	onchange
i would like onclick to be processed after onchange completed

5728166
onclick	onchange
and as a result onclick is processed not every time after onchange

5728200
ivar	subclassing
the way to fix this is that you need to remove the bodies when their corresponding sprites are removed from their cclayer by either subclassing ccsprite to add an ivar that points to b2body or by wrapping both objects i.e sprite and body in another class

5728273
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in ie safari google-chrome it works without problems but in firefox it shows only the html5-player with a x in the middle

5728300
folder	directory
i ve set the bugtraq prop-set properties on files and directory including the root svn repository folder but they aren t automatically added for new project check-ins commits

5728374
versioning	upgrade
1.348 cause we have that versioning running on another machine i then got the option to install as windows service which i did and then i upgrade to newest versioning my case 1.398

5728437
opera	firefox
for firefox and opera you need theora+vorbis+ogg - though with the newest versions of these browsers webm is working as well

5728437
mp4	webm
basically you will always need mp4 + ogv + webm to make your videos work on all plattforms

5728448
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
navigationcontroller is the instance of your uinavigationcontroller which is used by all the controller in your navigation stack uiviewcontroller

5728454
audiotrack	audiorecord
i m using audiorecord and audiotrack classes for record and playback respectively

5728534
super	implements
super k which means some unknown type that s a base type of k super class of or interface implements by

5728610
put	get
if i create a component helloworld i can put it on main if i create a component mycomponent and do the same i get this error

5728630
post	get
basically i m trying to see if there is an option to choose get or post while calling sendredirect

5728644
uiview	subviews
in my uiview i added uiscrollview as subviews and in uiscrollview i added uibuttons

5728667
voip	sip	voip	rtp	rtp	sip
i would like to initiate a jingle rtp and or sip rtp call from to the public voip network

5728667
voip	xmpp
it would be nice like the xmpp gateway to use my native voip desk-phone or soft-phone talking with my facebook frinds

5728785
ggplot2	lattice
i have tried using ggplot2 and lattice graphics but haven t found anything that suits my needs

5728836
jar	war
hi i tried to develop an application using ipc in websphereportal using two different war files.am trying to transfer one bean object for that i have placed one jar file in .. websphereportal portalserver shared app

5728908
int	double
nstimeinterval is a double not an int

5728936
width	height
based on your most recent answer i take it you don t need the footer to be full width only sticky though yours isn t and also i presume you know that your version will only work if you know the height of the foo - not so important content as you need the that height to set the top co-ordinate for the sidebar

5728936
width	height
the footer s not full width but you can make it look like it is by putting a background image on the html element i have a plain dummy image in my fiddle but it s not showing up anyway you would make an image the same height color as the footer with the 1px border built in

5729010
post	get
i keep seeing weird behaviour in our logs where urls that should normally only be accessed via a post request are called via get

5729100
decimal	ieee
the third line displays the data with the maximum useful precision - an ieee 754 64bit floating-point number has slightly less than 16 decimal digits of precision so all those digits of the literal in math.h are pointless perhaps they can be seen as future-proofing against a possible future redefinition in a format with more precision

5729113
temp	tmp
one solution is to write to tmp linux or temp windows

5729150
hide	show
first of all you can set credentials in generator.yml to show hide links to actions and object actions based on credentials

5729193
move	drag
so if you click drag a corner the size changes accordingly and if you click drag inside the selection it should move the selection

5729212
int	chars
i think that you should use the getchars int int chars int

5729238
fancybox	colorbox
i would recommend either fancybox or colorbox

5729271
put	get
i somehow need to put kill-compilation into a ignore-errors with emacs 23.2 to get it to work when no process is running

5729317
post	get
right ok to update where i am i checked in firebug and on the external server and the reason why i m getting a 405 error is because i m doing a get rather than a post

5729333
getter	setter
in fact it is better if you use the getter and setter instead of array access on magento objects because it allows other developers to provide overrides in a conventional way

5729361
uicontrol	uibutton
if you re just trying to handle simple taps on the button i suggest you use - void addtarget id target action sel action forcontrolevents uicontrolevents controlevents for more info on it look into uicontrol of the uibutton otherwise my way would be to subclass the uiscrollview add a delegate for touches and pass them on to it but it s messy and i wouldn t use this unless extremely custom behavior is needed

5729383
put	get
if they are equal put it in the new tree and get the next values from both iterators

5729402
kohana	yii	cakephp	yii	cakephp	kohana
you could use frameworks like kohana zend cakephp yii which all uses this pattern

5729428
tunnel	vpn
the ways to make this harder go beyond wcf - access lists for ip addresses vpn tunnel etc

5729453
width	height
sorry better take off both the width and height from the field

5729495
ssl	https
use an ssl certificate and send the login over https from your ajax form

5729505
int	chars
but remember every chars within source should be convertible to an int

5729506
prepare	execute
besides the advantage of escaping value when using bind value in pdo is there any difference in performance when using bind value with multiple values prepare the statement once but execute multiple time with different values instead of a single insert statement like

5729517
ssl	https
there is no reason to do any encryption in javascript or php as the appropriate solution is to use ssl https

5729531
int	chars
if you subtract 0 from the chars it will give you the correct int

5729561
google-chrome	firefox
this link works great with google-chrome and firefox 4 bquadint drmonod

5729573
width	height
the device height and width need to be set you can use ipad specific styles to achieve this so that it doesn t break your other browsers

5729577
folder	directory
note that it uses os.makedirs instead of os.mkdir which means that it will also create the root folder if necessary as well as allowing the subfolder paths to contain intermediate-level directory if desired

5729591
width	height
s ellipse width 20 height 20 includein collapsed

5729591
width	height
s rect radiusx 10 radiusy 10 width 80 height 20 includein expanded

5729593
width	height
and i don t want to give fix width and height to any element

5729612
jar	manifest.mf
jar cvfm javaappdemo.jar manifest.mf c javasamples myapp

5729612
folder	directory
pls tell me i want to create a jar and i have to bundle the files in my project directory to that jar files when i extracted the jar i got my project folder but when i run my jar i got the above exception so i got confused where the loop hole is present

5729628
width	height
hi the easiest way and that s how i do it is to give maximum height width to the overlay

5729632
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox will fill in these names so you won t need to parse it

5729638
activemq	rabbitmq
if you don t need synchronous calls then you can probably look at messaging -- jms activemq or rabbitmq

5729640
slideup	slidedown
note that when stopping the animation i had to explicitly clear the height because it could get left in an intermediate state by slideup slidedown

5729658
put	get
you can get the size of your videofile.if you want to put check according to the size that is possible or you can get the duration by using mpmovieplayer class but for that you have to get the full video file .i dont think so you want to do this so its gud if you can put a check according to the size

5729680
qgraphicsview	qwidget
i used qgraphicsview instead of qwidget which made the development much easier

5729680
qgraphicsview	qwidget
qgraphicsview already handles a lot of user interaction so i didn t have to bother with reimplementing qwidget mousemove events etc

5729680
qgraphicsview	qwidget
plus the performance was much faster than on qwidget because of qgraphicsview optimizations

5729694
jar	war
in maven project you can build jar automatically using maven war plugin by setting archiveclasses to true

5729742
width	height
my guess is the backgroundview gets strechted automatically but you could make sure the image isn t stretched on that view by setting a width and height

5729757
hash	md5
the idea is that an md5 hash of a string is normally shorter than the string itself and the index lookups on the hash are hence more efficient than those on the strings

5729758
folder	directory
i need to add as link a complete directory structure that lives under my solution folder but not under any project folder

5729770
maven	pom.xml
we have a large project consists of 300-500 modules which are organized by maven 3 i have divided it into 10 sub-projects so each sub-project have a root pom.xml

5729827
width	height
note width and height matters

5729844
dbcontext	objectcontext
the problem with dbcontext api is even worse because dbcontext api doesn t offer methods to change state of independent association so you must revert back to objectcontext api and use objectstatemanager.changerelationshipstate

5729844
many-to-many	one-to-many
any other solution is about loading the old object from db first and merge changes into attached object - that is what i do all the time and you will have to do it once you start to work with many-to-many relations or deleting in one-to-many relations

5729866
ubuntu	debian
i ve tried to install rails on ubuntu and debian 4 times each but i got all kind of errors you can imagine

5729866

or any tutorial to make this work on ubuntu or debian

5729871
put	get
as noted all of the above works fine in higher versions of nvcc and i m working to get those put onto the machine in question but i d be interested to see what i m missing

5729966
hide	show
can you help me to hide the location service popup window at the time of application start in iphone and ipad.it will show only once for an application at the time of first deployment.i think it is the reason of alassetlibrary which i used for retrieving images from photo library

5730028
folder	directory
the directory contains a boost folder which contains the header files as well as library specific folder

5730034
put	get
if i understand correctly you would like to get for a particular article having as id articleid the list of all the tags not just those it has and put a checked to true if it does have it false otherwise

5730036
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if i m not mistaken all of the browsers supporting text-shadow support css transitions in theirs most recent versions opera safari google-chrome firefox

5730040
google-chrome	safari
why is simple html css being read differently by the traditional browsers ie mozilla google-chrome and safari

5730091
hide	show
if you want to hide buttons you can use view.setvisibility and dynamically show and hide the buttons when your state changes when other buttons are pressed

5730094
nullreferenceexception	targetinvocationexception
to be clear the error is manifesting itself as an xamlparseexception which contains a targetinvocationexception which contains the nullreferenceexception

5730129
parsley	robotlegs
you should read up on application frameworks as well like parsley robotlegs and swiz

5730157
addition	multiplication
as to the logic tends to be vaguely associated with multiplication and || with addition if you use zero and non-zero to represent false and true respectively the operators have equivalent semantics

5730162
associativity	operator-precedence
see operator-precedence and associativity

5730186
google-chrome	firefox
i can t speak for firefox but this is simply the way that xml is handled in google-chrome

5730197
cdr	cons
so in fact i think you want do1 to be myfunction cdr data cons car hello list1

5730235
carrierwave	paperclip
i would suggest using carrierwave or paperclip which simply store a reference to the file stored either locally or on something like amazon s3

5730245
versioning	upgrade
an alternative could be to keep propel but upgrade the versioning

5730267
width	height
in my monotouch app i call uiscreen.mainscreen.bounds to get the width height of the screen

5730267
width	height	portrait	landscape
when i first start the app in landscape mode the width is returned as 768 and the height 1024 ie portrait

one viable way is to define an array of callbacks into which each component portlet actually will be pushing its own callback and then have global ready callback scan the array and run each callback

5730312
put	get
this is what i have so far at the moment if i put it slightly downwards the other image will get over the dogs image

post	get
any performance differences will be insignificant as far as the server is concerned but browsers do not cache post requests and rightly so so therefore if you wanted to be able to allow the server to respond with 301 not modified if someone makes 2 subsequent calls to the same url then you need to use get

5735420

for sending it post or possibly put is correct

hash	md5
md5 is a hash function and will most likely give you a unique identifier per url

5736983
hash	md5
i say most likely because you get a 128-bit hash from md5 and the likelihood of a hash collision is on the order of 2 -128 about 10 -55

5736983
hash	md5
if you need smaller identifiers you can chop the result from md5 down to a smaller number of characters but you could potentially significantly increase the chance of a hash collision depending on which characters you take

5737382
min	max
you could then compare against common integer sizes and use the corresponding max min preprocessor define

why aren t they the same under the covers is there some difference in performance which i know that a c++ data structure is optimized for or why would the .net dictionary actually be a linked list under the covers and the c++ std map then a red-black tree which to my knowledge are completely different data structures used for entirely different purposes mostly

some believe that a data class just getter and setter is a code smell and it could be but a data class can be easily justified by using it to counter another smell called primitive obsession

i would strongly recommend that you test the site in other browsers such as google-chrome and firefox

5744240

as there is no inverse method of distancefromlocation which would allow you to give a distance and retrieve the min and max latitudes and longitudes associated to the current user location you need to perform the computation on the server side

5744772
min	max
so the solution would be to send the user s current location latitude and longitude to your web service make him compute the max and min latitude and longitude associated to your distance a square will be easier to compute and implement than a circle for the service stations

5745255
temp	tmp
the script runs for about 8min and the temp archive grows and while checking the filesize the last listing showed the tmp file was 2120011776 in size and then the tmp file disappears and the php script falls thru the logic and executes the code after the archive create

5745750
draggable	droppable
there are draggable droppable and sortable plugins

5745800
getter	setter
i m not sure there is a way to know that but to make your life easier you can create a category for each core data entity and add new setter and getter that match the actual type of your attributes

5745800
getter	setter
on those setter getter you have to make the data conversions and invoke the generated core data setter getter

5745805

5745957
width	height
we have a config file which stores partner settings indexed by partner_id such as the width and height of the widget and we thought about storing the partner s environment in here but not all calls to the server would be made by a partner so we would still need another way to trigger the environment for other calls and select the correct db

google-chrome	firefox
have reproduced this issue using development server locally and intermediate server running apache+mod_wsgi with firefox 4 and google-chrome 11

5746548
put	get
quick and dirty solutions i ve found is to put the text into a text object in a movieclip and then get the value but i dont like it

5746588
width	height
since you apparently can t set this on facebook you should simply wrap the page you re loading in a wrapper div and set the height width and overflow properties there

5746611
google-chrome	firefox
i use google-chrome for development as i find it runs faster than firefox and ie so it is a bore to guess where the icons are

avro	thrift
i am looking into proto buff thrift and avro to get away from the nfs thing

5746715

just put it in a known subdirectory and manipulate __file__ with os.path to get the path to pass to subprocess

5746720

5746730
put	get
i don t know offhand whether or not scrollview allows both horizontal and vertical scrolling at the same time or whether you d have to put a horizontalscrollview within a scrollview or if that s even possible...but this should get you the correctly sized imageview

5746753
lisp	scheme
i don t know offhand what common lisp or scheme use

5746757
equals	gethashcode
note that my response to your other question mainly criticized the use of a thusly modified equals together with gethashcode for use in a hashtable - that just won t work which is a good example why it s problematic to override equals in a way that breaks its contract

5746773
folder	directory
most responses fall into seperate test projects within the project foler myproject and myproject unittest or a mirrored directory structure with a unittest top level folder

5746823
post	get
the server i have written can handle get and post methods

5746891
postgresql	mysql
also consider that if your main reason for using access is just so you can use access as a user-friendly gui tool for forms reporting you could still store the data in less restrictive database derby sqllite mysql postgresql ms sql server etc and then connect via odbc from access to the database. this would allow you to deploy your java application on linux your database wherever makes most sense and still use access to connect to the database from windows

5746910
apache	nginx
i would rather use apache for this site but i am fine with nginx

5746917
getter	setter
yeah as3 getter and setter are already flexible enough to make it easy to write difficult-to-follow code by making them unexpected side effects and this idea would just make it even more confusing

5746917

the whole point of a getter or setter is to provide a controlled public access point--there is no need to call a getter or setter from within the class that has access to the private members

profiling	instrumentation
the sampler instrumentation and the time profiling differ in the way they gather data

5751684
profiling	instrumentation
the time profiling instrumentation and the

5751684
profiler	shark
time profiler gathers backtrace data in the same manner as shark from

5751684
profiler	shark
note time profiler and shark can yield inaccurate backtrace data if the

5751684
profiling	instrumentation
in regards to profiling an opengl es application you ll want to look first at the various statistics that you can enable in the opengl es driver instrumentation

5751732
xna	spritebatch
i am trying to draw a rectangle shape in xna using spritebatch

5751744
google-chrome	firefox
update 2 i am so surprised that in firefox or google-chrome defining the click handler actually works for pressing enter with nothing entered as well

5751744
google-chrome	firefox
so looks like firefox and google-chrome build that intelligence in

5751747
getter	setter
in fact if you set a breakpoint in the getter or setter of the customnestedvalue property of the nestedusercontrol you ll find it will never hit when binding in xaml

5751758
matlab	s-function
if this doesn t work for yout the next easiest thing to do is to use either an s-function written in matlab or a matlab function block

5751788
filesystems	ntfs
the 5th byte should have the filesystems code which is 07 for ntfs

5751806
width	height
not 100 width height

5751808
client-side	server-side
edit now that i ve seen your example you have to realize that you re changing your paradigm from server-side to client-side programming language

5751827
hash	salt
if you just concatenated the salt and the hash then an attacker can simply remove the salt and use a rainbow table

5751829
hash	salt
the salt should be part of the hash calculation

5751833
hash	salt
hash password + salt

5751833
hash	salt
if you concatenate the salt after the hashing the concatenation is easily reversible and doesn t add any difficulty in reversing the hash on the password with rainbow tables

5751833
hash	salt
that said some systems do both django stores salt hash salt+password in database

5751834
switching	screens
this is not the case with the embedded player controls but the user can easily switching between embedded and full screens modes so you can t really use this to maintain no status bar when the controls are shown

5751836
hash	salt
actually it s salt + hash salt+password salt is part of the hash computation - but you must also keep it in the clear

5751874
bmp	png
i almost forgot to mention it is possible for a jpeg or png file to be encoded as a bmp but this is not common

5751898
gif	png
png jpeg and gif are the supported formats

5751960
put	get
i am trying to put a structure named holder into the heap by using the following code but i get a segmentation fault when i try to use memcpy

5751971
width	height
to ensure that this works even if the image has been scaled it s svg right you would need to multiply the position to which you scroll by the ratio between the total width of the svg and the width of the dot drawing as set by the size graph attribute same thing for height

5751978
free	malloc
btw i always forget to mention that - when you allocate memory using malloc don t forget to free it later

5751981
vb6	vba
in vba or vb6 i do something like this

5752030
for-loop	arrays
the idea is to have one function that uses a for-loop on the arrays and calls that function in the params for every element in the arrays

5752062
nsmanagedobjectcontext	nsmanagedobjectmodel
you will create instances of nsmanagedobjectmodel nsmanagedobjectcontext and nspersistentstorecoordinator

5752084
profiling	debugging
create install the development profiling make sure you have the correct bundle and device list set and set code signing for debugging to use that profiling

5752103
free	malloc
plus you shouldn t be using malloc free at all and avoid using new delete where it s not necessary

5752104
free	malloc
in addition there s no requirement for a c++ implementation to even use the same memory areas for malloc and new so it may be that you re trying to free memory from a totally different arena something which will almost certainly be fatal

5752106
free	malloc
mixing new with free and malloc with delete could cause a catastrophic failure at runtime if the code was ported to a new machine a new compiler or even a new version of the same compiler

5752110
free	malloc
now if you allocate with malloc and free with delete the info delete expects won t be valid and you ll end up with a corrupted heap

5752122
inherited	properties
this is a properties of the form itself you ll need to set this on every form in your app unless you have some sort of inherited structure setup

5752142
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu debian based distributions and you really want to use mysql

5752147
width	height
how can i calculate font width and height especially non-fixed width font with some bold italic style

5752158
updatepanel	scriptmanager
for every page that requires your scriptmanager such as using updatepanel control simply have that page inherit from scriptmanagerpagebase and you ll get that functionality only when you need it without having to duplicate code

5752171
children	parent
recursive step the immediate children of the current parent become the new current parent

5752172
post	put
with a little tweak you can use the class you linked in your first post put the throttle and reset in a static class

5752182
ant	maven
the exact name depends on whether you re using the command line ant or maven

5752205
prepare	execute
what i do now is prepare the update statement then loop through all the possibilities and execute each

5752218
move	drag
i want when treenode is adding to treeview the ui do not lock form can move by drag ...

5752226
pull	push
with ssis you can basically create packages that are scheduled to run at whatever interval you want and push the relevant data to the main server push not pull

5752230
multiplying	add
what you can do is left shift the hex-digit stored in a byte by 4 places alternatively multiplying my 16 and then add the 2nd byte which has the 2nd hex digit

5752237
pull	push
when i push via ssh to my repository the prime hub is successfully mounted and the pull command is executed

5752238
superclass	subclassing
if you want to access behaviour thatâ s specific to the subclassing and hasnâ t been defined by their common superclass you canâ t escape from doing some sort of checking

5752238
superclass	subclassing
polymorphism is usually related to behaviour defined in a superclass or interface that can be overridden by subclassing and the system knows which behaviour is appropriate according to the actual object type

5752312
post	get
isset to ensure the get post variables are set

5752324
int	chars
i want the database to get the int alone but if i give chars also it is getting entered

5752333
keydown	keyup
to summarize you ll want to either target the keydown or keyup event and check for the keycode property of the event object that is generated

5752364
int	chars
make sure the column in your sql table to store the contact number is an int and not a varchar chars

5752377
width	height
you can see this in the inspector timeline view most scroll events result in a repaint of window width x some small height but occasionally there will be a full-window repaint

5752408
qwindow	qwidget
i am implementing a popup window by inheriting qwidget with flags qt qpopup | qt qwindow

5752448
width	height
i tried giving width height and fill property but still getting the same result

5752461
google-chrome	firefox
content in firefox 17 disabled by default for google-chrome in firefox 20

5752464
getter	setter
but there can be other scenarios too where referring to your ivars as self.ivar instead of _ivar can be helpful such as when you are using custom setter getter instead of the default synthesized ones

5752472
autodesk	3ds
it also is the most powerful with complemented tools with superb autodesk 3ds max maya integration

5752586
free	malloc
even if new calls malloc to get its memory there may not be a 1 1 correspondence between the new delete and underlying malloc free behaviour

5752586
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
someone may overload new or link in a debug version of malloc realloc free either of which could break if you re not using the functions properly

5752586
free	malloc
not all heap implementations allow you to free a pointer that s been shifted from the value returned by malloc

5752649
put	get
it seems silly to use nsstringfromclass to put the class in the dictionary and then nsclassfromstring to get the class again

5752668
iwa	adfs
turns out the adfs website that performs authentication of users this website gets setup in iis during the installation of adfs v2.0 is by default configured for integrated windows authentication iwa

5752668
google-chrome	firefox
apparently most other browsers don t support epa yet which is why firefox google-chrome continually prompt for credentials in a loop

5752669
nstextfield	nstableview
i d then change the name to tableview with the intention of having the iboutlet be connected to an nstableview but i ll forget to change the nstextfield to nstableview

5752691
switching	screens
however when i switching it to landscape mode the pdf is too large and goes off of the right side of the screens

5752702
stdout	stderr
i want to start a child process and read its stderr but so far i can t read anything at all using subprocess.popen even stdout

5752702
stdout	stderr
i m trying to use subprocess.communicate to read from stdout and stderr

5752702
stdout	stderr
anyway how can i read stdout and stderr from a process started with subprocess.popen

5752715
qstatusbar	qdialog
you can add the resize grip by calling qdialog s or qstatusbar s function setsizegripenabled or directly in qtcreator form designer

5752715
qstatusbar	qdialog
i didn t use it myself but you can check the qt source code on git for qstatusbar or qdialog

5752734
vb.net	vb6
the style was common in vb6 with optional parameters but imho and according to microsoft in vb.net overloading is usually more elegant than optional parameters

5752736
stdout	stderr
you need to specify the stdout subprocess.pipe and stderr subprocess.pipe when you create your popen object

5752743
stdout	stderr
read data from stdout and stderr until end-of-file is reached

5752789
post	get
first of all if you re saving large data better to use post rather than get

5752827
macports	homebrew
but you can also use macports or homebrew or do it yourself

5752883
folder	directory
to check the folder directory has been created inside your application bundle .app right click on your .app file and select show package contents

5752883
folder	directory
now check if folder directory appears in your .app file

5752883
folder	directory
as a side note an easier way to add a folder directory to your .app bundle is to add folder instead of group in your xcode project

5752883
folder	directory
as a result you ll see a blue group folder instead of the usual yellow group folder for your html directory in your xcode project and building the .app will create html folder inside your .app bundle

5752885
folder	directory
but my download show a complete path of my site folder directory

5752898
portrait	landscape
but it thinks it has for example if i use this when in portrait mode then the whole view is too short if i then rotate it to landscape the height is made even shorter

5752906
for-loop	arrays
i always assumed caching the length of an arrays in javascript is a good idea especially in the condition of a for-loop because of the expensiveness of calculating the length of an arrays

5752968
glassfish	weblogic
in order to reduce reload times should i move to a more advanced web container like glassfish sorry i can t afford a weblogic or websphere here. or anything

5752969
onclick	preventdefault
preventdefault is not working on div onclick i tried preventdefault and stopimmediatepropagation also nothing works please see the below sample

5752991
google-chrome	firefox

5753018
subtract	add
allowed moves add or subtract 1 from any of the 4 digits in any order you cannot add to 9 or subtract from 0

5753018
subtract	add
you cannot add or subtract from the same digit twice to get from 1000 to 3000 you cannot do 2000 - 3000 as youâ ll be adding 1 twice to the first digit

5753045
ant	maven
ant task is suitable to be used within automatic building or continuous integration system like maven or jenkins

5753067
inherited	properties
my thought is to inherited from print class and allow additional string properties which would hold the tranlation and alow to create print class from it in the background i heard that automapper library might be helpful with this

5753084
toolbar	tabs
when browsing the add-ons manager about addons in firefox 4 the toolbar and urlbar are hidden when tabs on top has been set

5753084
hide	show
or whether it must hide and show the urlbar and toolbars in listener of window-mediator

5753091
firefox	safari
in safari and firefox the cached length was consistently about 2x faster than the non-cached version

rather i want to a background service or whatever that continuously listening mic if it detects some voice then it should record it let say max length of recording is 1 min and on voice recording finishing either there is no input or 1 min recording completes then it should play it automatically

5753163
scheme	racket
there are many cross-platform scheme implementations namely racket formerly plt-scheme chicken gambit-c guile

5753163
scheme	racket
disadvantages are run-time type checking racket support compile-time weak standard r5rs as it does not include modules utf8 networking and so on and programmer usually have to stay with chosen scheme implementation forever

5753625
draggable	droppable	versioning	upgrade
however it still renders in ie9 mode and the ie9-incompatible javascripts a very old jquery versioning and a similarly old jquery ui draggable droppable versioning which i can t simply upgrade for reasons that do not matter here don t work

5753628
int	double
actually i plan use int double and two enum types as t

yes exactly - you have the same product installed same upgrade code but from an earlier versioning

5753662
cos	sin
it should support + - sin cos

5753669
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
to read the file i use a bufferedreader in combination with an inputstreamreader and fileinputstream

5753806
autoresize	scrollbar
now what happend to me some times is that the autoresize from facebook doesnt work correctly on some browsers so it miscalculates the height and you still have a scrollbar on the right side so because of this scrollbar your content becomes too large and you also get an horizontal scrollbar

5753806
margin	height
here the height i choosed is 900 but you have to set your own height the height of your iframe content + some security margin like 50px or so

5753810
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i changed from uiviewcontroller to uinavigationcontroller in the mainwindow.xib

int	chars
the second thing is what data type c use to store this symbolic constant which is not a chars enclosed in single quote nor an int or floating-point number

5753840
folder	directory
rmv also makes incredibly easy to remove a ruby version and all its data since it installs everything in a folder within your home directory

5753853
jar	war
say if you re developing a web service a web application consuming that service and a library that both the service and the webapp uses then with a single and not even long or difficult ant file you can build them create the aar war and jar files and deploy them all in their correct places eg

5753859
super	self
ther are only six keywords that are reserved in smalltalk true false nil self super and thiscontext

5753865
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
note that the position of the fileinputstream is going to be a multiple of 8192 because the bufferedreader is using a buffer of that size

5753880
put	get
for my project the get data is dynamic so i can t just put a set url in the php proxy and i dont understand php well enough to figure out how to get the get data into the proxy url.

rpm	yum
for yum rpm based linux distribution this should be something along

5754186
hash	salt
i think you re looking to salt and then hash your passwords

5754618
getchar	kbhit
if you d rather not block waiting for getchar to return you can use the linux version of kbhit

5754631
gprof	google-perftools
i suspect that it s the constant locking unlocking of the mutex that is the main culprit here i ve tried to profile the problem but neither gprof or google-perftools has been very cooperative either introducing extreme instability or plain refusing to gather any data att all this could be me not knowing how to use the tools properly though.

5754643
google-chrome	firefox
i tried the code in firefox 3.16.6 and google-chrome 10.0

5754833
width	height
it has two parameters the height and width of your component

5754833
width	height
you can then write an algorithm to size and position your children based on the component s height and width

5754905
ant	maven
there are few build tools which can be used for build automation and the most interesting i found were ant and maven

5754907
typedef	typename
typedef is just a typename alias for the compiler

hash	md5
the content of inputfile is a 40 character length sha1 or md5 hash

5755315
portrait	landscape
i get that error while compiling not sure why but another problem which seems to be coming from it is that the orientation of the simulator is landscape which is what i ve intended however the x y positions of the screen cordinates still think they re in portrait so the simulator shows up in landsacpe but graphics are drawn as if it were in portrait this is what my info.plist looks like

5755328
put	get	post	get	post	put
my fix to this is to use get for get requests and post for all the rest post itself put and delete

i have a blog folder in my root directory that contains the wordpress

5755355
width	height
in my app widget i have a linearlayout whose height and width are set to fill_parent

stretchblt	bitblt
you might want to try using stretchblt instead of bitblt

5755413
justmock	typemock
justmock of telerik the alternative to typemock which aims to be typemock but the beta was full of bugs

5755413
justmock	typemock
but typemock was launched in 2006 while justmock still was beta in 2010 there was a glaring gap although telerik has good marks

5755456
try-catch	exception-handling
my guess is that your jms client is failing somewhere in its initialisation probably when calling setclientid but your code is mis using a try-catch clause to catch and ignore the exception-handling

5755507
post	get
obviously you would also have to request the page file and get and post parameters

5755516
invokelater	invokeandwait
note that invokeandwait will throw an exception if it is called directly from edt invokelater will not but it is still not recomended to do so so the code that may be called from both edt and side thread should be written as follows

5755578
multiplying	add
often i will convert the characters in the name of the app to ascii values add them up and depending on the value possible multiplying by another number to get it into the 1024-65000 range

5755618
superclass	subclassing
again it is not designed for general extension but you could write a subclassing whose constructor calls the super constructor then uses more reflection to replace the superclass s value of map with an instance of your new map

5755621
implements	extends
public class myclass extends listactivity implements onclicklistener

5755628

5759075
accelerometer	gyroscope
i want the application support to be as low as possible so my preference would be to read the values from gyroscope first if the device has its hardware iphone 4 or get the values from accelerometer iphone 3g 3gs

5759075
accelerometer	gyroscope
i would like to write a rotationmanager class which would handle interacting with either gyroscope or accelerometer its internal operation will be abstract for the rest of the application

5759090

you can usually take advantage of matrix and element-wise arrays operations to avoid using a for-loop to perform certain computations on the resulting meshes

5759308
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
it seems to me that the main point of subclassing is to be able to override the methods which get called automatically during the life cycle of the controller viewdidappear viewwillappear willrotatetointerfaceorientation etc

5759308
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
therefore there s no point in subclassing uiviewcontroller unless i m going to use one of the standard means of creating a viewcontroller hierarchy uinavigationcontroller uiviewcontroller presentmodalviewcontroller etc

5759554
width	height
check divs with # 1 and #2 which seems to loose height and width setting

implements	extends
you should look at the source for the pig classes that extends loadfunc and see how they implements getnext

5759730
inherited	subclassing
however you can really just put somebaseclass there because anything that is an instance of a subclassing of somebaseclass is by inherited also an instance of somebaseclass
