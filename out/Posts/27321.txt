width	height
i say to some extent because some images s aspect ratio are wrong and leave blanks at the edge of the screen when i resize them some at height and some at width

width	height
my idea to solve the problem is this each image will leave a blank when resizing to the width of the browser or the height of the browser

12007422
fractions	radix
we do not usually think of it but there is a â œradix pointâ to the right of this numeral â œ11010.â we only need the radix point when we have more bits to the right of it which represent fractions

12007422
integer	radix
as an alternative you can think of this as an integer â œ1â then 23 bits with no inserted radix point making a 24-bit binary numeral but the exponent is adjusted by an extra 23 so subtract 150 instead of 127

12007422
rational-numbers	floating-point
an important property of floating-point numbers is that they cannot represent all real numbers even in a finite range of course or even all rational-numbers

12007443
crypt	salt	crypt	hash	hash	salt
what confuses concerns me is simply why crypt given password admin generates a different hash even using a static salt

12007443

12007591
pop-up	dialog
you could also make the form a dialog pop-up

12007606

12007631
min	max
i tried to fix it using the max and min of graph scale but so far i am unsuccessful

the correct way to set a minimum or maximum or constant for that matter width height on a splitview is to set those things on the views individually

12008230
children	parent
so far i have not been able to print only the children of the current parent when on level 1d

12008230

12008236
strdup	malloc
the strdup function actually calls malloc for you and you only need this construction if you want to modify the string at a later time and don t increase its length

the first half of that style is for browsers that support the max-width and max-height properties -- google-chrome firefox opera and safari

under linux you can use nio for stdin stdout and stderr because they are tied to certain character devices which can be accessed as files

12017580
scons	autotools
asn1c in particular generates dozens of header and source files that must be able to work together and the actual set of files generates depends on the contents of your asn file there s also the fact that none of these are especially easy to maintain - cmake and autotools have their own huge set of scripts that you need to manage for them to work and waf and scons require that anybody working with them has decent knowledge of python i don t to work with them.

12018144
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i had the same problem today and it turned out that in apache configuration in httpd.conf the allowoverride was set to none and therefore the .htaccess could not be read

12018147
children	parent
the layour_gravity is used to place the children relative within its parent bounds the relativelayout doesn t have this attribute

12018147
children	parent
which tells them to position aligning the top of the children with the top of the parent relativelayout

12018210
int	chars
the fact that the small int that fit in a chars are often interpreted as codepoints in a particular chars encoding space is secondary

12018212
children	parent
i have a problem that whenever i load a parent entity user in my case and put it to cache all it s children in an owned relationship are cached as well

12018212

jvisualvm	jprofiler
there are lots of ways to get a heap dump starting with simple tools like jmap to more fancy stuff like jvisualvm or even commerical tools as jprofiler

12018758
hide	show
as for your second question the simplest thing to do to get a momentary showing window to print some data to screen is to use a texbox or a textareal or anything else that allows to show text... and play with the setvisible true setvisible false to show hide the widget

12018760
treemap	treeset

in short assume the full area is in the rectangle subtract off the four segments in the external half planes then add any the areas in the four external quadrants discarding trivial cases along the way

12018960
inherited	properties
however if an object doesn t have a hasownproperty method it s probably just as suitable to use the in operator as the object likely doesn t have an inherited scheme and all properties are on the object that s just an assumption though the in operator is a common and seemingly successful way of testing for dom object support for properties

12018965
leaflet	proj
i m using leaflet for a proj and i d like to bind events on my markers with jquery on

12018974
dictionary	map

skip-lists	trie
other alternative to using trie in this data structure is indexable skip-lists

12018980
getter	setter
also notice how item is private and that there is now a getter and setter method to access it

12018980
getter	setter
my post grew so long that i lost track of why i wanted to introduce getter and setter

now the item field has effectively been overridden since all access to it is done through the getter and setter and those have been overridden to point at the new field

12019139
width	height
this allows you inside your css - to detect layout trigger javascript events when layout changes and position your css elements based on width height of the screen

12019156
width	height
for html tables specify the width and height using html attributes rather than css styles

12019156
width	height
modern versions of outlook ignore width and height styles

12019165
put	get
i ask because the datastore docs say the get and subsequent possible put operations are wrapped in a transaction to ensure atomicity

12019173
int	double
thus a convolution between two sets of base 1000000 migits that are 10000 migits in length 60000 decimal digits will overflow the point where a double cannot represent an int exactly

implement your own irq1 int 9 isr to receive keyboard input and manually store the scan codes and chars in the bios data area and update the states of the alt control and shift keys in the bios data area

12019582
width	height
the canvas element has two attributes to control the size of the coordinate space width and height

12019582
width	height
the width attribute defaults to 300 and the height attribute defaults to 150

12019661

12019829
int	chars
you can use atoi function to convert chars to int

12019830
cpu	processors
it achieved full cpu utilization but several exceptions were thrown because a hypothesis the processors was running through each string too fast and sometimes the same processors object would be applied to different strings simultaneously

12019830
cpu	processors
i m even more sure of my hypothesis that the processors are working too fast because if i provide longer input say whole text documents instead of 10 word headlines i get full cpu utilization without any exceptions thrown

12019854
bazaar	git
use git-bzr-ng a bidirectional bridge between git and bazaar

12019874

12019904
for-loop	loops
the example of a for-loop that you give is not the usual way of using for loops in python because the for-loop is not a numerical construct as it is in most languages but a way of applying a loops body to each element yielded by iteration of the collection given

12019908
explode	implode
i d also add that if you re looking to get an output of value1 value5 you shouldn t use explode but rather it s duel implode

int	chars
3 the unsigned modifier prevents the compiler to propagate the chars 8 bits sign to the int other bytes usually 32 bits ie the 24 most significant bits since an int is returned

12020057
int	chars
thus any chars where code would be 127 for unsigned chars or negative for signed chars is returned as is eg unsigned chars 200 is returned as int 200

12020058

add setter and getter for username and password in your registrationbean class

12020093
int	chars
1.before the arrival of java 7 it was because we could use the int and chars for switch case and as they were primitive so it had to be

12020126

a switch works with the byte short chars and int primitive data

12020126
int	chars

i have created the uiwebview but want to know the best way of capturing the files when they are linked to in the webview and then download them to a specified folder in the documents directory

12020413
min	max
this is a simple script that will produce the output you wanted though it does more than your requirements state as it also checks min max for columns 2 and 3

12020413
min	max
i am using list util to get the min max values which is purely convenience

12020420
stderr	fflush
is unbuffered or immediately fflush i o going to stderr

12020424
width	height
it should have coordinates width height etc

12020493
getter	setter
the easiest and ide-independent way to do it is to encapsulate your variable behind a setter getter pair and add a statement to your code watching for setting the value null

12020497
put	get
i considered using file open put get but msdn recommends against this since it is much more inefficient than serialization

12020536
allocator	stl
first you have to remember that the stl is completely built on os routines the c standard library and dynamic allocator

12020545
put	get
however i want to put a where clause into this as well but i get the error unknown key where

12020584
getter	setter
create a getter and setter so other classes can set themselves as delegates

12020593
alertdialog	progressdialog
what i m doing for this is show the progressdialog then try to connect with the server if it throws exception then i show alertdialog with error message

12020593
alertdialog	progressdialog
but its not working the code throwing exception when i call alertdialog immediately after progressdialog

12020593
alertdialog	progressdialog
i also dismiss the progressdialog then start alertdialog but doesn t work

12020598
profiling	debugging
demonsterdebugger great for debugging and cpu profiling

12020601
integer	unsigned
even with the 2-bit element encoding can easily fit that in a single unsigned 32 bit integer 0x6b6bae

12020647
hide	show
you can use the status to hide the article from readers or show them the last approved state

12020649
doc	rtf
when the user fills them in you then sanatize them and pass them to the report via these extensions and you can output excel pdf word doc rtf etc

12020653
serializable	deserialization
in those cases second property is not included in serializable but is recovered during deserialization

12020672
pull	push
what i mean by the git pull origin master is that the most solution ppl mention is to do a pull before push for example

12020680
google-chrome	firefox
tested with google-chrome and firefox

12020699
width	height
the header responds to width changes and it takes up about 500 px of height and its supposed to fit into certain areas of the background in my case an illustrated scroll but when i resize the window and the header contracts the sprites move eventually getting out of the scroll placement

12020731
min	max
when you say you want the id for the state you are going to have to make a choice about which id would would want max min etc

12020750
fadein	fadeout
your fadeoutnav is calling stop true which if done while fadeout or fadein are working will leave the style s they have applied to the element

12020751
google-chrome	safari
this only appears to happen in google-chrome and safari and in mobile safari as well

12020753
int	double
but of course this doesn t really work because numeric isn t the supertype of things like int and double it s a typeclass

12020765
put	get
interestingly things get even worse when you put null on the right hand side of a not in predicate

12020773
put	get
about the lock if i put the lock away i get dozens and hundreds of connection is closed or connection is already open errors because the open function just get s a connection from .net s connection pool

12020773
next	except
except that it s on the assignment of the connection object that it hangs next line is marked green

12020800
prepare	execute
but still there is almost zero chance that the attacker will execute malicious query via sql-injection as doctrine2 uses pdo prepare statement with parametarized query

12020801
google-chrome	safari
this only appears to happen in google-chrome and safari and in mobile safari as well

12020804
width	height
i need to calculate the width and the height of a uibezierpath

12020817
isotope	masonry
notice that this is not the same as masonry or isotope which allow lower images to cross over the edges of higher images

12020837
implements	extends
2 implements runnable is the suggested way because if you extends thread you can t extends anything else java doesn t support multiple inheritance

12020850
put	get
take that and put it outside of your while loop so it doesn t get recreated every cycle

12020867
versioning	upgrade
second addendum i have just upgrade to aptanastudio versioning is 3.2.1

12020890
shadowing	named
you have a script named base64.py which is shadowing the stdlib module

12020892
portrait	landscape
ok so i want to have 3 view and all of them landscape but i want 2 of the to be in only landscape and i want only 1 of them to be in portrait

12020905
range	minimum
they will contain respectively the minimum and the maximum value of each score range

12020906
bottle	flask
i ve looked at a lot of python web framework server options flask bottle static and tornado among them

12020935
int	chars
as the other answers have mentioned the int operation will crash if the string input is not convertible to an int such as a float or chars

12020947
put	get
i have to put this code inside echo instead and i can t get it to work

12020972
apache	nginx
of ssh-ing into the machine and changing the nginx apache location virtualhost configuration

12020990
pop-up	dialog
launch a pop-up dialog in your implementation of onreceive

12020998
cpu	processors
as to why you seem to be taking 8 seconds to be charged one second -- there are other things going on within your system consuming cpu time that you would like to be consuming but you must share the processors

12021000
versioning	upgrade
i ve upgrade php to versioning 5.4 using this guide

12021025
typedef	struct
in c struct header and the typedef header live in two different name spaces

12021051
try-catch	exception-handling
but you have to remember to add the try-catch block because the newinstance method will only know if the referenced class has a default constructor when it tries ti instantiate it at runtime and if it doesn t have there will be an exception-handling

12021064
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i ve downloaded google-chrome firefox opera safari and ie to test the app but i want to make sure it works fine on previous versions of these browsers too

12021066
jobs	cron
i use cron to kickoff my scheduled jobs on unix servers and the windows task scheduler to run them on windows servers

12021072
matplotlib	scipy	scipy	scikit-learn
i installed the scipy superpack and can use all the packages -- including scikit-learn and matplotlib -- in the python interpreter and through ipython

12021122
clang	llvm
clang was still young and buggy when apple began the transition away from gcc s compiler and toolchain so llvm was built as a back-end to gcc to facilitate its eventual replacement

12021122
clang	llvm
eventually llvm and especially clang were mature enough to replace gcc outright which provided an amazing speed boost to compiling and a bump in the quality of the machine code output though many argue that gcc still produces better quality code at the expense of speed

12021167
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox and not google-chrome

12021171
zoo	xts
i am familiar with the zoo function rollapply which allows you to do rolling computations on zoo or xts objects and you can specify the rolling increment via the by parameter

12021216
pypdf	reportlab
the usual references are reportlab or pypdf

12021248
google-chrome	firefox
just encountered this problem streaking up my screen on google-chrome but not on firefox or ie

12021283
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that setting the background to the tr works well on firefox and opera but on google-chrome the gradient is applied to each cell

12021288
jtextfield	jpasswordfield
now i wanted to use the same setup for my jpasswordfield since i thought that jpasswordfield inherits from jtextfield i could do the following but that has been a big disaster

12021294
stdout	stderr
the problem may be that the process may write to stderr or stdout and you are not reading from it and it blocks

12021313
rbenv	homebrew
what i did was uninstall rbenv via homebrew and reinstall it

12021314
button	checkbox
basically i have a button delete selected which is disabled as long as no checkbox are selected

12021314
button	checkbox
as soon as the user checks a checkbox i d like to bind a click event-handler to this button

12021353
int	chars
you don t want that you want a conversion from chars to int

12021358
int	chars
the way you are using reinterpret_cast you are trying to read a chars as an int and they are not the same size

12021359
zoo	xts
i temporarily coerce to zoo for the rollapplyr to make sure the rollapply.zoo method is being used as opposed to the unexported rollapply.xts method then coerce back to xts

12021362
width	height
i am looking into getting and setting the bounds or just the width of some window just the width as some window seem to have to have a specific aspect ratio so i think setting it to a specific width and height may not work if the aspect ratio isn t correct

12021372
put	get
onloadfinished seems to get called sometimes with a dead cursor - if you put a test for isclosed on the cursor you get passed you ll find it s closed in one in some large number attempts

12021411
int	chars
type like a float to int or unsigned chars to int

12021411
int	chars
cout tries to print an unsigned chars as an ascii chars code so converting to int via is the right thing to do

12021414
opera	google-chrome
the transition when mouse over works well in google-chrome and opera

12021427
keydown	keyup
the beep occurs at keydown not at keyup

12021429
hex	binary
c in hex is 12 in decimal is 1100 in binary

12021462
versioning	upgrade
eclipse generally has major problems when you upgrade java or adt versioning in my case anyway and the best solution for me has been to wipe everything out and start over

12021506
hex	binary
thus you can convert this to its binary representation by simply writing the bit-value for each hex digit

12021506
hex	binary
since we know each byte is always exactly 8-bits each hex digit converts to its own 4-bit binary representation

12021506
int	chars
a bitvector is usually a simple data type int chars etc.

12021550
bash	zsh
unfortunately arrays and associative arrays are not covered by posix.1-2008 and as you have found there are some annoying subtle differences between bash and zsh

12021550
bash	zsh
- notice that i use a few different tricks to do introspection in zsh and bash

12021561
hide	show
show hide formatting symbols

12021561
subscript	superscript
superscript and subscript

12021561

you may want to look into fgetcsv and fputcsv

12021604
libstdc++	libc++
on my system using gnu s libstdc++ and llvm s libc++

12021608
portrait	landscape
i have an xib with two ipad views one portrait one landscape

12021618
multiplying	multiplication
mathematically left shifting is the same as multiplying a number by a power of 2 but as the operation is done only by shifting it is much faster than doing multiplication

12021681
background-image	background-size
now just use the background-image and background-size properties to color the appropriate part of the row

12021686
twig	smarty
you can look around in the sparks directory there s multiple sparks that integrates numerous template engines like smarty or twig that could be tweaked to create something like this

12021700
post	get
your php page should return data based on the parameteres passed via either a get or post request

12021724
equals	gethashcode
implement equals and gethashcode

12021734
versioning	upgrade
an earlier than versioning clause in conflicts prevents dpkg from upgrading or installing the package which declares such a conflict until the upgrade or removal of the conflicted-with package has been completed which is a strong restriction

12021760
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this works in google-chrome and safari and is broken in firefox 14 and maybe earlier

12021774
google-chrome	firefox
all of this works fine in google-chrome but in firefox and ie they ignore the padding at the bottom for some reason

12021774
google-chrome	firefox
for some reason when i used the padding with the form it reads it correctly in firefox and ie and google-chrome

12021794
width	height
this page generates a css that outputs what height width and device-height width + orientation the browser using as parameters

12021794
width	height
the orientation was correct the width height and device-width height were the same for both orientations

12021809
allocator	stl
first you have to remember that the stl is completely built on os routines the c standard library and dynamic allocator

12021824
ggplot2	lattice
according to mr grid is much more user friendly way of creating grid grapics so i think it is worth learning and things such as lattice and ggplot2 are built on top of grid

12021825
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the uitabbarcontroller is loading and showing different subclasses of uiviewcontroller

12021866
google-chrome	safari
i see it in google-chrome and safari i haven t tested other browsers yet

12021872
stdout	stderr
as michael pointed out the first problem is that you re using two different streams stdout and stderr and that one is buffered while the other is unbuffered

12021872
stdout	stderr
then to make it atomic call flockfile f at the beginning of your function and funlockfile f before you return where f is replaced by whichever of stdout or stderr you choose to use

12021876
user-controls	tabcontrol
i m trying to bind a value from a dictionary set as an itemsource of a tabcontrol to a dependencyproperty of a user-controls which is held within my tabcontrol.contenttemplate

12021886
flask	pyramid
i ve looked at pyramid and flask but their documentation talks mostly about translations and not number formatting

12021887
std	ostream
however i want to output to a file using ofstream rather than the std ostream and when i pass an ofstream instance as kind of expected i am getting an error

12021904
std	ostream
std ofstream inherits from and can thus be used in place of std ostream

12021925
hide	show
i needed it to have different buttons for show hide and to hide if another div is asked to be show also i needed to place my a tags away from my div tags as well as add and remove the class active

12021936
width	height
however you may be able to scroll it explicitly by fixing the width height of the iframe and setting overflow auto on the containing div

12021953
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i ve found this problem in google-chrome 21 firefox 14 ie 7-9 safari 5 on pc

12021982
webkit	blink
first note that webkit blink based browsers set a max preflight cache of 10 minutes

12021982
put	preflight
next note that it is impossible to avoid a preflight on put delete requests

12021982
post	get
on get post avoid custom headers if at all possible since these still trigger preflights

12021999
flask	pyramid	flask	django
django is an all-in-one package while pyramid and flask give you more flexibility

12022031
width	height
i have a somewhat-temporary solution manually call -setsize on each image representation dividing the pixel height and width by the screen s scale factor

12022032
post	get
if you really want two pages you can send a post or get parameter to tell the page to show all links or only first ones

12022056
for-loop	loops
try using for-loop instead of while loops where the range will be from 0 to length -1

12022058
width	height
also for some reason it fills up the entire display even if i use static width height

12022104
google-chrome	safari
i then played with the font sizing and settled on 4.15em which showed no white edges in safari or google-chrome for mac

12022105
post	get
as you can see basically this block just tries to get post data and if it can t it redirects back to the edit page with an error message

12022108
post	get
if i try to post a cookie with curl i get a http_code 500

12022121
subtract	add
if you start at zero and add 1 for every clockwise path and subtract 1 for every counterclockwise path the filled areas are all of the areas that have a non-zero number

12022172
versioning	upgrade
but as gregg mentioned i would not do it grails is tested with a specific versioning of spring and you make get some unexpected results and behavior if you upgrade spring

12022204
jobs	cron
my webserver is running cpanel and has a cron job module in it providing a gui to add remove edit cron jobs

12022204
jobs	cron
problem i need to create a large number of cron jobs more than 100

12022204
jobs	cron
the current problem with cpanel s cron gui is that there will be no organization in the cron jobs

12022204
jobs	cron
if i have 5 related cron jobs added seperately admist 100 other unrelated cron jobs it will get harder to find these cron jobs in the long list of cron jobs

12022204
jobs	cron
or is there an alternative gui with better features like folders or the ability to move cron jobs up and down the list

12022205
hide	show
i want to hide the top actionbar that i have as an overlay on touch and then show it again on another touch

12022210
lisp	smalltalk
smalltalk and lisp are well known for this kind of thing

12022221
jobs	cron
each one of the cron jobs calls a php script that calls 10 other php scripts

12022240
client-side	server-side
here s what happens client-side and server-side

12022242
cvs	svn
i have previous git and svn experience but no cvs experience

12022243
post	get
one of the values in the post array that i get from paypal is something that i am passing through to keep track of the transaction number

12022243
post	get
the problem if i fake the input by pointing a form with some inputs to my listener everything works fine but if i get a real post array from paypal the database doesn t run

12022244
dns	spf
what s needed is to update the txt dns record to include the spf entry for google mail

12022263
gtk	gdk	gtk	cairo	gdk	cairo
i have already cross-compiled all of the build dependencies for gtk atk cairo gdk pixbuf and pango and installed them to usr i686-w64-mingw32

12022273
post	put
will the post be made via https or do i have to put an absolute url like

12022283
margin	height
i m thinking now that the 39 might have come from the 15px margin of the old fb-button + its 24px height

12022283
margin	height
i think i can get around it by simply setting the height to be 39px and not having a margin

12022301
int	double
as in the previous example it might require two type conversions on the scalar say you multiply by 5 it will then convert 5 into a double which will then be converted back to int to match the signature of

12022301
int	double
again this is not the generic t of the class template but the current instantiating type int double ...

12022318
folder	directory
i have created a webservice directory in my mvc web application s root folder and created a webservice named myservice.asmx

12022336
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox both has this problem

12022374
addeventlistener	onload
i tried using the onload and addeventlistener function but to no avail.

12022379
addition	multiplication
no -- a bit-field will frequently be considerably slower than a bare unadorned int because if you do something addition or multiplication that might overflow the designated size the compiler will typically insert a bitwise and instruction to ensure that the result fits in the specified size

12022379
put	get	multiplying	multiplication
e.g. if you multiplying two 10-bit numbers and put the result in a 10-bit field the multiplication may produce up to a 20-bit number so the compiler will normally produce the 20-bit result the use a bitwise and to get the 10 least significant bits for the result

12022381
hide	show
check if its consumed else toggle or whatever to show hide action bar

12022384
post	get
i am trying to post the variables login credentials but unfortunately it is not giving me the after-login page the page that we get after successful login presently the code is like this

i put a breakpoint at the beginning of tableview cellforrowatindexpath and it never get there

12022435
getter	setter
when declaring a module that extends dojo stateful the pattern for getter and setter is to defined _xxxgetter and _xxxsetter which will be manifested as .get xxx and .set xxx

12022456
textview	imageview
one way to do something like that would be to use a lot of imageview for the icons and the on off switch and then create textview with custom fonts for the textual stuff depending on what you d like to use and position all of these elements using a relativelayout as is described here

12022483
entities	entitymanager
this will save you quite a bit of coding to fetch child entities while the servlet filter handles opening and closing your entitymanager

12022492
appkit	nsapplication
- nsapplication nexteventmatchingmask untildate inmode dequeue in appkit 44 0x00000000987881f3 - nsapplication run in appkit 45

12022562
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you are calling findviewbyid before you have called setcontentview which will not work well

12022602
int	double
a type class is a collection of types rather than a single type int and double and rational are all types belonging to the type class num

12022608
multiplying	add
the luhn algorithm starts from the right end then multiplying every other digit with 2 and add the result

12022625
google-chrome	firefox
they maintain their own cookie-store so those cookies don t end up in the browser - the same way that cookies from one browser firefox don t show up in another one google-chrome

12022632
width	height
sorry 100 only apply to width does not apply to height you can try a jquery approach instead

12022632
margin	height
with this unless you have a padding margin on the side bar the height should be okay

12022636
mdpi	hdpi
did you forget to delete the default app icon in the ldpi mdpi and hdpi folder

12022653
width	height
i need to know the width and height of the current instance of carrierwave

12022659
rsa	dsa
i always get sun rsa public key and never dsa

i know that rsa is much widely used than dsa but i suppose to see at least 1 dsa key in my set

12022668
mouse	keyboard
i am assuming that players will either have a controller or a keyboard and mouse touch might work as well but tweaking is needed

12022714
int	chars
i do not understand what adding an int number to a unicode chars does

12022730
post	get
when i print the array within post list page post-list.php i do get the returned terms so i can confirm that it works

12022768
google-chrome	safari
when i test this on firfox things are pretty fine but safari and google-chrome almost die to perform the same operation

12022768
google-chrome	safari
the queue can contain any number of items but for google-chrome safari it is not more than 20

12022786
min	max
the slider is created to have the min and max values set from 0 - to the duration of the video so that the slider can only ever have a value that can correctly pick a time frame in the video in question

12022789
int	boolean
change the way that you removed the tapped item by adding this to protected boolean ontap int index

12022799
gif	png
when i upload an image to fb it has image png type or image gif

12022809
int	boolean
you can use the array_walk or array_walk_recursive function in php to cast the boolean to int before encoding the json

12022885
int	chars
when adding a chars and an int the chars gets converted to the int value that represents the chars code

12022885
int	chars
the int is then converted to a chars and then to a string

12022934
hide	show
that way you can hide show rotate animate accelerate etc so much easier

12022934
awt	swing
and it will all be tons faster than with swing awt

12022943
imagemagick	minimagick
you have to install imagemagick rmagick or minimagick

12022958
int	chars
i use int in the example as you can t use a chars as backing type for an enum.

12022963
fpdf	fpdi
from the website fpdf has to be version 1.6 or below to work with fpdi

12022969
client-side	server-side
server-side database driver and or a client-side cache that implements

12022980
tcpdf	fpdi
as of version 1.2.1 fpdi can be used with tcpdf - a derivate of fpdf.

12022984
textview	imageview
however if you are setting the textview s contents programmatically you will need to do the same for the imageview s content description

12022986
uilabel	uibutton
use the hidden property of uiview uitextfield uilabel and uibutton are all subclasses of uiview

12022994
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
but i m also not sure that i am doing this in the right place since i ve seen approaches that involve viewdidappear viewwillappear willanimaterotationtointerfaceorientation etc

12022997
textview	imageview
or create your own listview that has imageview and textview in each row

12023012
uilabel	uitextview
go to the .h file for the view controller and make an iboutlet with the data type appropriate for your control uitextview uilabel etc.

12023042
min	max
you can make the array start and end with any min max values and you can create as many in-between values as you need to achieve the desired accuracy

12023076
rss	feed
it then accesses an rss feed to render the annotations which i have created in a static xml file and placed in the same directory as the .swf

12023076
rss	feed
the rss feed contains coordinates title description and an icon to be used as the map marker

12023079
int	chars
you ran into trouble because you assigned a chars to a position in an and thus used the int representation of the chars

12023079
int	chars	int	double
because of this calls to did not fail which it always should as the double of any digit never can have more than two digits and half of them have only one because double the int representation of the digit chars s all have three digits

12023082
folder	directory
another longer way might be to get an url to the tmp directory by first getting the document directory and stripping the last path component and then adding the tmp folder

12023084
terminate	timeout
somehow thread.abort does not work will try to figure out how the interop threading stuff works rather than creating a managed thread you can create a native thread using createthread and terminate it after a timeout

12023159
inherited	properties
you can always add another element inside the container to contain your multi-select and have it inherited the properties of the parent container

12023172
screens	tablet
then if i run my app on a device 320x480 phone the advert banner appears on the top but if i run my app on a android tablet 1280x800 the advert banner appears centered horizontally and vertically - at the center of screens

12023225

from what i understand i should be casting out rays by my camera s width height and maybe increase the amount of rays depending how far the camera sees

12023273
typhoeus	httparty
typhoeus and httparty are two good ones among others

12023347
int	chars
this is well-formed but reinterprets the unsigned chars as an int object which isn t guaranteed to work possible issues range from invalid alignment of the storage to incompatible sizes - 1 byte vs 4 bytes

12023382
google-chrome	firefox
cors works perfectly in my application right now for google-chrome firefox

12023395
width	height
i am setting the width and height properties of the canvas so i can t see why it would perform differently in the visualbrush versus if i simply added it into a grid or some other layout container

12023406
super	extends
wrt your question on extends the class the super statement must appear as the very first statement in the constructor

12023426
ssl	https	public	protected
what i want to achieve is to have a set of public views controllers bound to my http endpoint and a set of ssl protected controllers bound to my https endpoint

12023441
jboss	weblogic
basically you create a keystore generate sign store the keys and based on the alias the container jboss tomcat weblogic or websphere will load the appropriate keys during initialization

12023444
getter	setter
i can t really advise the best way to solve this but i think you will need to start by making the foo fields private and providing getter and or setter for them

12023448
multiplying	add
create separate methods for the operations i.e add int x int y multiplying int x int y etc..

12023455
git-rebase	amend
i ll assume separate branches the point of doing a git-rebase is that you are reordering the commits on one branch to be appended to the end of the other branch if a conflict now occurs then you need to amend the commit as if it had been coded after the other commit if that means a function doesn t see the light of day then so be it

12023479
google-chrome	firefox
have a look at my dummy site google-chrome or firefox only

12023507
scrypt	pbkdf2
if you want to secure average quality passwords not in the top 1000 most common passwords or single words from few most commonly spoken languages then password key stretching is your best bet scrypt bcrypt or the standard pbkdf2 are good choices

12023588
nmock	moles
use a mocking framework like pex moles nmock etc

12023622
width	height
so can use toggle instead of animate but toggle also adjusts height and width as part of its effect

12023624
filtering	grouping
the collectionview acts much like a view in a database in that it is kind of like a live snapshot of the actual data which you can grouping sort filtering etc

12023646
width	height
i am trying to add an image to the end of the page grab it s height and width and use these values to calculate what the height width of another image on the page will be this is for an online equation editor i m building

12023646
width	height
i am setting the height with css and would like the width to scale automatically for me

12023646
width	height
i m guessing this is because i m dynamically loading these images and then trying to grab the height width

12023646
width	height
i would like the height to be 50px and the width to scale correctly to that height and then place those values in the new_element_height new_element_width variables

12023751
google-chrome	firefox
i have a website and everything works perfect in google-chrome but in ie and firefox i lose my content padding when the browser resizes below 800px

12023848
inherited	properties
if you really want to avoid doing that you could create a new class that inherited from regex and then sets a pattern properties in the constructor as follows

12023866
children	parent
in fact you stated that children have pointers to their parent but that is not true for any immutable tree

12023866
treemap	treeset
treeset and treemap take advantage of specific trees whose insertion deletion lookup algorithm makes them good data structures for sorted data

12023876
getter	setter
the readonly is telling the compiler to only create a getter method for your property not a setter method

12023876
getter	setter
if you want the compiler to automatically create both the getter and setter

12023885
post	get
the issue here is that you are attempting to access post ed variables in a method that will only handle get requests

12023885
post	get
if you need to access a variable from either request.args get or request.form post and you don t need it to be set use the get method to get the value if it is there or none if it is not set

12023887
x86	64bit
on intel amd architectures 64bit apps have access to more general purpose registers versus classic x86

12023906
comparator	comparable
then parent could simply define all comparator and all parent types would be comparable

12023912
width	height
we don t waste space to store file names for video clips which is why we don t use a real file system and instead we go flat file and we just track offsets frame information fps frame type width height etc time recorded and camera channel

12023934
put	get
what i m initially trying to do is to get a series of numbers from a string and put them into an int array

12024017
textview	imageview
you will need to create a custom listview adapter that provides a custom layout with an imageview and a textview

12024034
jobs	cron
the fifo scheduler got stuck somehow in between and therefore a lot of jobs got piled up which i had scheduler through cron

12024043
min	max
when the normtype is norm_minmax cv normalize normalizes _src in such a way that the min value of dst is alpha and max value of dst is beta

12024077
put	get
my prefered one would be to get an triangle image that fit s your needs then put it via css above the input field

12024112
width	height
the problem is that i dont know the width height but i want to display the images without writing them to some temp file on disk

12024133
puts	gets
i would like to test if a method in this case puts gets called when i include the foo module into a class and call bar

12024148
profiling	debugging
for example i can find name of functions by profiling this app with intruments and i have no idea how to erase it even after i have set option to turn off generate debugging symbols of xcode

12024154
width	height
you shouldn t have to write anything to disk you just need to read your binary into something like qicon so that you can use qts methods to get the width and height of the image

12024168
strncpy	malloc
instead of using the simple assignment you need to allocate space for using malloc and use strncpy to make a copy of the name

12024171
put	get
you are supposed to get the mscordacwks.dll from the machine where this dump was captured and then rename it to the one expected by windbg put it then into windbg folder usually

12024262
folder	directory
upon adding the zxing-all-in-one.h file to my plugins folder and barcodescanner.js to the www directory everything is fine

12024282
for-loop	arrays
using for i in data is fine if data is not an arrays if it is an arrays you should use a standard for-loop not a for..in but since you re using jquery anyway you might as well stick with unless there is a performance concern

12024295
hide	show
using display as an html attribute will not hide or show content

12024302

string is one as is int double and the other numeric types

12024451
put	get
with connection pool you just get an connection and put it back the pool will manage all connections it opened and reuse them

12024457
hash	md5
my first idea was to use the md5 hash of the input file as the keys in a shelve database

12024469
int	double
also you may want to cast it to double or float to make it a floating point division to prevent truncation of the fractions part because right now is an int division

12024479
post	get
so when a browser makes a http request to a server it is in the form some headers get post cookies host user agent etc..

12024484
post	get
i m trying to upload a file to google drive using http header and curl post and i get a not found returned from google error

12024485
post	get
you can use the or to get either a get or post to get these

device not per app you need to share those 32 with rest of the system and audiotrack is used internally beneath soundpool

12024803
post	put
from your post i see that you tried to use a constant value i put this xml content copy-paste and a parameter t_contentssp.parambyname xmlfile

12024833
int	chars
that are int constants enumeration constants chars constants sizeof

12024833
int	chars
an int constant expression shall have int type and shall only have operands that are int constants enumeration constants chars constants sizeof expressions whose results are int constants and floating constants that are the immediate operands of casts

12024849
int	chars
type chars is an integral type not much different from int in this context so a const chars object initialized by 0 is also a null-pointer constant in c++ but not in c

12024867
int	chars
it s taking advantage of the const you put in there and seeing that its value is actually an int 0 chars is an int type

12024867
int	double
if you put double in there as with many other non int types

12024870
tax	shipping
the current free flex2 shipping module has a bug that causes an incorrect tax calculation on the shipping amount

12024870
tax	shipping
my home country canada requires a different tax rate to be applied within the domestic market depending on which province i am shipping to

12024870
tax	shipping
the first function call extracts the shipping total the result of the tax calculation performed at the beginning of the checkout process from the array d

12024870
tax	shipping
the current implementation of all shipping modules is to return a static tax rate

12024870
tax	shipping
unfortunately prior to my requirements for flex2 variable tax rates there was only one tax rate per domestic international zone allowed - and this was set manually during configuration of the shipping module

12024870
tax	shipping
it was ok in the past to simply extract the tax rate after the fact from the static configuration files of the shipping module

the client then compares the password entered by the user with the hash salt password obtained

12025032

getter	setter
i initially thought that interfaces would be fine eg readonlyobject with getter and writeonlyobject with setter and object implementing both of them but the problem is that writeonlyobject interface would be easily reachable by any class that uses readonlyobject

beside that i m not convinced that writing interfaces with only getter or setter is a good practice

12026295
many-to-many	one-to-many
if you remove one of the collections ef assumes by convention that your relationship is a one-to-many relationship which doesn t have an intermediate table but only a foreign key in one of the tables in contrast to the model with two collections where ef creates a many-to-many relationship that has an intermediate table

12026295
many-to-many	one-to-many
however you can override this convention using fluent api and tell ef explicitly that the remaining collection belongs to a many-to-many relationship instead of a one-to-many

12027577
screens	tablet
only for the gridview it shows the gridview and the imageview both correctly but in that case the gridview takes up all the corresponding width which makes the dialog as width as the screens of the tablet changing width of the parentview to match_parent doesn t change that

12027655
getter	setter
but i think you re better off giving the parent s a variable a getter and setter and set or get it from the child or parent as needed

12027667
superclass	subclassing
however a neater way to have the potential for multiple subclassing to set the variable value and it be used by the superclass is to have the child classes set the value you want and then have the superclass reference that variable possibly using a getter that the subclassing has set the value of

12027674
hide	show
now i need to show hide span when focus blur in textarea box

12027714
hide	show
i had the information display on the same page as the form in a show hide div

i suspect the css are not being loaded in firefox google-chrome due to to the following meta tag

12027943
width	height
you can specify width and height with exact measurements though you probably won t want to do this often

12027943
width	height
more often you will use one of these constants to set the width or height

12027943
width	height
in general specifying a layout width and height using absolute units such as pixels is not recommended

12027958
google-chrome	firefox
funny thing is - it works perfect in firefox but doesnt work at all in google-chrome

12027969
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it isn t even supported by firefox 14 though it was reintroduced in firefox 15 due to compatibility reasons and still works in google-chrome safari and opera

when i highlight mine it keeps the same thumbnail and height and stretched the width of the text to two columns

12028210
youtube	vimeo
i have the same meta tags as vimeo which does the same as youtube so i m sure i have everything setup correctly

12028251
punctuation	words
basically all that normal tokenization has to figure out is for example whether punctuation should be part of a words like in mr. or separate like at the end of a sentence

12028263
inherited	properties
it s also a bad idea to use inherited to dry properties - these unnecessary abstractions should be avoided

12028307

not only that you can also also put some epic music from youtube when the program is done looping for ubuntu debian

12028315
bottle	flask
make it run in the browser using flask or bottle

12028354

12028362
put	get
if i put the mathresults above the while loop i obviously get the same result 10 times

12028362

12028378
fossil	git
2 the default fossil workflow suits our projects perfectly and more git ish worksflows are possible when needed

12028378

12028464
min	max
i have a max angle and a min angle and also a unit vector pointing in some direction 2d

12028474
hash	salt
the point of a salt is just to add extra hard to guess data to the value you want to hash

12028474
hash	salt
one common solution is to just prepend append the salt to the text you re going to hash

12028474
salt	md5
for example if your hidden value was password and your salt was a random number between 0 and 255 the thing actually stored in your database might be md5 123password 123

12028474
hash	salt
so it doesn t really make sense for the salt operation to be irreversible as it s already hash which is kind of irreversible

12028475
multiplying	multiplication
by multiplying image 1 by image 2 using point-by-point multiplication we get a transformed image

12028487
min	max
left and right column have a fixed width and my center column changes its width in between max and min width specified as the browser width changes or screen resolution changes

12028493

google-chrome	safari
everything is working fine except for validation of checkboxes in safari and google-chrome

12028580
mdpi	hdpi
depending on your image -- specifically whether it still looks good scaled down automatically -- you could just provide hdpi and xhdpi versions and android will automatically scale them at run-time for ldpi and mdpi respectively

12028613
mdpi	hdpi
now you need to put them in the respective folders of ldpi mdpi hdpi and xhdpi in res drawable of your project

12028624
width	height
so you can have a device which has let s say 400 pixels width and height and the screen has a diagonal of 5 inches

12028626
post	get
i am creating a browser extension which post to salesforce chatter using rest api.once i get the access_token from oauth user agent flow i can not make call to rest services from javascript due tobrowser same origin policy.i do not want to use a server as proxy since i want to make the extension purely client side

mouseover	mouseout
everything works perfectly but i also have an included js script that is loaded on window.load which changes the table based on mouseover mouseout onclick etc

12028719
min	max
you can then check if this angle is between your max and min angles provided they are also defined with respect to the positive x -axis

12028734
width	height
so if you have an imageview of size 300dp x 200dp width x height and the screen density is 320dpi the image size in pixels should be

12028768
put	get
this works but it seems awfully indirect if you put the cursor elsewhere you might get a lot of entries in auto-complete list forcing you to search for variable

12028769
wordpress	vbulletin

bufferedreader	printwriter
the problem appears when i m using println method form printwriter and readline from bufferedreader because readline reads line but lefts n on stream and that causes problem i m not 100 sure that that is the problem after i try to use byte stream to transfer files

12029089
int	chars
this means that after reading your first int there is still at least an end of line in the input and the attempt to read a chars will return it - hence no wait for input

12029102
screens	hdpi
to support alternative screens such as an emulated wvga i have successfully placed higher resolution images in the hdpi folder and it works

12029102

integer	unsigned
but there are different ways to actually store those samples in memory - signed integer unsigned integer floating point and so on

12029322
hash	salt
you donâ t need to manage the salt yourself bcrypt takes care of that and includes it in the password hash string

12029322
hash	salt
youâ ll get something slightly different if you run it since a different salt will be generated but you can see that the password hash includes the salt

12029382
public	protected
so if the constructor which takes int array as an argument will be public or protected the class will no longer be thread-safe because the content of the array may change the same way as the safepoint class someone may change it during the constructor execution

12029485
children	parent
the state column in the parent table should change to valid if one of its children in the child table has its approved column set to true

12029485
children	parent
it is expected that the system would have a few thousand parent each with around 5 children

12029504
width	height
so you can get your image coordinates before moving it and you can compute measure of movement in your ontouchlistener class.now if x coordinate of your image plus horizontal movement that you computed be greater than device width or y coordinate of your image plus vertical movement that you computed be greater than device height your image not move

12029524
apache	nginx

q1 yes it will need to build up a b-tree of nodes that contain not only 1 int 4 bytes but a chars 40

12029733
google-chrome	firefox
this happens every time i try to publish the site and it happens with google-chrome 21.0.1180.79 m or firefox 14.0.1

msg	eml
i haven t seen any objective c libraries for either but mimetic is a free c++ library that can do the job for eml files and presumably mime-compliant msg files

12029753
children	parent
the two basic ideas are updating the data in the parent when a child value changes or summarizing from the children at query time

12029753
children	parent
you have to read all the other children in order to set the value in the parent

12029753
children	parent
in all probability the children and the parent will each fit on one data page

12029843
int	chars
the newly created objects currently have two attributes an int and a string representing a single word roughly averaging 10 chars

12029844
getter	setter
if you want to modify the inner object itself you ll need to write methods in the interface with getter and setter this also more or less breaks the spirit of the pattern but might work for your case

12029860
int	double
your comparator should have pointers to the beginning of both your arrays double and int

12029891
superclass	subclassing
in java the superclass constructor is executed before any of the code in the subclassing - both before instance variable initializers and the constructor body

centos	linux
first i needed to re-create the vm using the correct os it is linux - centos 5.8 and in my case 64-bit

12029900
getter	setter
yes properties are nothing more than a convenient way to create getter and setter but they also communicate something to the user

12029929
int	chars
you can use md5 filename and then use the first 8 chars and convert them to an int

12029953
jqgrid	datatables

12030035
getter	setter
the getter is the same as the property name while the setter has the prefix set

12030104
width	height
optionally your form may have already some dimensions set through css so in that case you don t need to set width nor height within fancybox and autosize should be set to true

12030149
folder	directory
you must take the css folder or file and put it in the root directory not the application directory

12030214
google-chrome	firefox
and here is a picture of this issue in both firefox and google-chrome

12030249

invoking the put or get method results in an access to the corresponding entry assuming it exists after the invocation completes

12030361
width	height
the inner box width is static 95 i understand this is not necessarily static but in the context of the height you ll understand but the height is set to auto to reflect the height of the content text

12030390
for-loop	loops
the continue statement causes the for-loop to ignore that link and move on to the next iteration of loops if the href is not set on that link

12030393
width	height
for the fillrect method if i give big values for the width and height i noticed they won t be applied such an example

12030393
width	height
is there any limits for the width and height

12030466
trie	tree
you might store them in a binary tree an implicit patricia trie like so

12030573
apache-poi	docx4j
if you are just using pptx you might find it easier to use docx4j since with apache-poi you ll probably also need to get xml beans working on android

12030581
rss	feed
what you could consider doing to avoid importing previously imported feed is created a field in you db for example id_unique add any constant variable from each feed to this field for example the date time from the rss feed then you could either validates_uniqueness_of id_unique in your model or add a method to find_or_create by id_unique

12039102

using both swing and awt for your applications is common practice what you were warned against is using both swing and awt ui components

memcached	apc
i want to enable memcached php apc mysql caching and http caching

12040366
awt	swing
swing shares quite a few classes with awt and uses some of the same implementation - note that javax.swing.jcomponent the base swing component class actually inherits from java.awt.component the base awt container class

12040366
awt	swing
it s actually not that much of a problem to mix swing and awt if you are careful

12040366
awt	swing
you risk getting a very different look and feel if you mix awt and swing ui components

12040366
awt	swing
swing components are lightweight rendered by java while awt components are heavyweight implemented as components in the host platform - this means you will have problems if you put awt components inside swing components the other way round is fine

i ve written a web app that uses features that make it incompatible with ie and require minimum versions of firefox and google-chrome

12040421
google-chrome	firefox
i m worried though that changes to the way google-chrome or firefox declares it s user-agent might break my regex

fadein	fadeout
the animation i want to do are fadein and fadeout depending of the situation

12040624
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that for some reason the browsers tested on google-chrome and firefox think that i don t really mean it when the browser-window is not wide enough the outer columns are cropped and width-setting ignored therefore the real content is sliding under my divs and become completely unaccessable

12040636
google-chrome	firefox
i need something that can work in both google-chrome or any other webkit browser and firefox

12040690
width	margin
you just need to define a width for the main div so the margin can center it

12040690
width	height
you also need to put a div right before the main div closes to clear the months so the main div has a distinct height width

12040733
vbscript	vba
this is vba code formatted to mostly work with vbscript though i could not get this block to transfer properly

i have tried setting the image width and height to 100

12040835
google-chrome	firefox
it runs way better in firefox than in google-chrome - i think because of optimizations google-chrome is trying to do

12040835
google-chrome	firefox
notice how the floating images don t update with the page position in google-chrome like they do in firefox

12040835
google-chrome	firefox
i m looking for suggestions for making this as smooth in google-chrome as it is in firefox

12040870
getter	setter
here is my bean minus the getter and setter

i just upgrade to ios facebook sdk versioning 3.0 and having problem with sbjson

12041083
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that ie and firefox position the image differently than google-chrome does

the only possible security consideration for post over get is that information won t be leaked in the http referrer to sites that are linked to from the page

12041105
postgresql	mysql
if they do you will be able to store those strings into a real database postgresql mysql or even sqlite3 so you don t have to have an independent server

you almost certainly want to run virtual machines on something like vmware or virtualbox to really test multi-machine stuff

12041271
stdout	stderr
if you need to handle stderr you ll want to pipe it to stdout i believe

12041292
min	max
db.collection.getindexes should give you the parameters used to construct the index - the min max bits field will only ever apply to the 2d field

the post form is fine its just the dialog thats the problem and how to get the data across agian to the php script

12041350

width	margin
now the problem is i want the content width to be fluid but the margin and padding to be of fixed width as below

12041607

then a filtering first followed by grouping on the result would need to be split up into two calls

12041634
width	height
i cant quite seem to get it working but what i want to do is to be able to have something attached to my mouse then when i mousedown unbind the click but then rebind it to moves the width and height instead of the top and left

mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
mousemove mousedown to unbind and then rebind mousemove the on mouseup unbind mousemove again

inherited	subclassing
if you were modeling gen-spec in an oopl such as java you would use the subclassing inherited facility to take care of the details for you

12041890
inherited	subclassing
unfortunately the relational data model does not have subclassing inherited built in and the sql database systems donâ t offer any such facility to my knowledge

12041890
superclass	subclassing
note that in this diagram cricketer is both a subclassing and a superclass

12041899
verilog	hdl
as you learn verilog try not to rationalize the hdl you write as code because it is a different style of thinking

12041925
put	get
so in order to get back a tiledsprite or animatedsprite from a spritesheet you have to know how much columns and rows it can be hardcoded somewhere it had before being put into the spritesheet since texturepacker won t give you that kind of information

12041928
getter	setter
you can wrap a getter and a setter in an object of an anonymous class implementing a simple interface

12041947
width	height
it does not mean that you have to have square images just that an image must not have its width or height exceed 2048 again 4096 on newer devices

12041953
numactl	smp
the problem is that numactl does not recognize the two nodes it sees it as one big smp machine

much more disturbingly i have a large grid of jenkins tests running the exact same code with many versions of numpy matplotlib python and scipy and none of them raise this exception

12041989

in my example i don t wish to expose max directly to the user meaning i don t want the user to change it using .mywidget option max value or but at the same time i want to expose min

12042009
mvvm	delegatecommand
i think you will find that a lot me included of people that write wpf applications using the mvvm pattern will use some variation of the delegatecommand and as evidence i would offer that most of the mvvm frameworks offer an implementation of such

google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome or ie9 if the user tries to click the register button on an empty form the error messages show up fine

12042099
ready	each
my personal choice though is if its internal functionality models or controllers alike that aren t ajax ready i tend to use the underscore method with a couple comments under or above each function to give me an idea

12042104
post	get
usually corresponding to get and post

12042156
google-chrome	firefox
the code above works in both firefox and google-chrome while the shorthand does not

12042266
width	height
based on the windows height width

12042266
width	height
but the essence of what you may want to do is get the width height of the window body

12042266
width	height
and then use that couples with the width height found to make adjustments so it doesnt run off screen at any given point less thats what you want

12042268
post	get
although this is not a good solution in this case there must be a way to get it working without scrolling i will post it as a workaround

that is it will show and hide it s own tabs but for some reason when clicking the second tab it changes the status of all the tabs

12042306
highcharts	highstock
easy upgrades this wrapper will be the only code that will require modification in case of any breaking changes in highcharts api after upgrades or even if one decides to move to a differnt charting library altogether even from highcharts to highstock can be exhaustive if your application uses charts extensively

12042319
width	height
the inverse of the width or height in pixels is the offset from the current texture coordinate that you ll need to use here

12042319
width	height
i pass in the texelwidth and texelheight uniforms which are 1 width and 1 height of the image respectively

i also tried to create my own modal blocker by adding a 100 width height uicomponent to the top level application and then displaying my popup on top of that

12042425
hide	show
however it is recommended to merge the two pages together hide loading bar and show main page as you will have less problems.

12042492
portrait	landscape
solution i put the same code except for exchanging the instances of portrait and landscape into willanimaterotationtointerfaceorientation and that fixed the tiling issue

the codes work in firefox and google-chrome but not ie

12042763

i wish to expand to use the new horizontal space and reduce the vertical with the 6 interior scrollviews retaining their height however also taking advantage of the increased width

12042811
for-loop	loops
but the for-loop and while loops doesn t work

12042839
stdout	stderr
if you re on mac os or linux you can use standard redirection and a simple shell call if you want to capture the stdout and stderr to a variable in your script

12042839
stdout	stderr
simply redirects stderr in the command output to stdout which is captured when the program runs

12042839
stdout	stderr
if you want to redirect both stdout and stderr to the same file for later use

12042857
for-loop	loops
i m trying to implement a javascript for-loop in which a php variable is counting phpvar++ each loops

12042873

12042995
int	chars
they are both int but they have a chars between them

12042995
int	chars
i cannot use getline with its delimiter because it assigns data to a chars array which i do not believe i can convert to an int without another library

12042995
int	chars
i cannot use a while loop with get and peek because again i do not think i will be able to convert a chars array into an int

12042996
post	get
what you can do to get the count of post for all users is

12043104
ubuntu	linux
here is the difference with the li s getting the background color in chrome on linux ubuntu

12043107
qabstractbutton	qtoolbutton
completely rewrite qtoolbutton in python so it would subclass qabstractbutton and make the modifications

12043108
hash	salt
making sure the salt is unique is easy - you could just hash together the username and the time when the password was last changed

12043108
hash	salt
it s more common and more secure to only store a hash of the password and salt

12043109
rss	feed
if you look at the source of a pinterest rss feed like you will see that within the tags is the url for the pinterest image along with the pin s title tags and a relative link to the pin on pinterest

12043425
int	chars
internally however strings are represented as lists of int representing the code points for each of the chars in the implementations internal encoding

12043447
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout only fires once you want to use a setinterval

12043486
gridview	rowdatabound
you need to set your colors on the event of onprerender and not on rowdatabound so set the event on gridview

12043550
pyramid	cherrypy
cherrypy or pyramid or some micro framework seems better

12043557

this odd approach to add the property name as the key and into the restrictions is related to the fact that restrictions have no getter and setter for property names

12043854
move	drag

interbase	firebird
this would be a handy generic udf for mysql and bring it something that it has consistently lacked in comparison to firebird interbase which they call events not to be confused with mysql timed events

12043867
interbase	firebird
the timed event feature of mysql on the other hand is something that firebird interbase lacked the last time i looked at them

therefore you may use explode function to convert string into array of substr

12043978
mp4	h.264
generally what i ve done is run ffmpeg once on the source file to get it to sort of the base standard say a higher quality h.264 mp4 file this will make sure your other jobs will run more quickly if your source file has any issues since they ll be cleaned up in this first pass

12044132
put	get
this resource can be accessed by either get or put requests

12044154
getter	setter
what i don t like about the getter and setter methods of the two string member variables is that locking on singletoninstance can make a thread trying to access mstringb wait until a thread that is manipulating mstringa releases its lock

12044154
getter	setter
would you create two member variables like â and in myclass and use them in the synchronized block of the getter and setter methods of mstringa and mstringb respectively

12044155
google-chrome	firefox
the below example catches both errors when run in google-chrome and firefox as well as if i use devtools in ie9 and set browser mode to ie8 or ie7

fastcgi	scgi
cherokee afair allows both to start fastcgi and scgi application or connect to independent one

12044238
fastcgi	scgi
nginx - does not start applications at all however for fastcgi currently not the best for comet streaming because of buffering so scgi would be better with nginx assuming you are using latest nginx version

12044238
fastcgi	scgi
small note scgi is a protocol that is very similar to fastcgi but significantly simpler

12044301
jboss	weblogic	jar	war
with this one i can manage deployment on jboss weblogic websphere for ear war jar

12044305

12044396
folder	directory
so currently i have two loops running within another i don t know if this is like taboo or something d but what i m aiming for is if the number of files in a directory pages are more than in another directory posts i want it to delete the corresponding files in the pages folder

12044396
folder	directory
all the files in the pages folder are numbered and every time there is a new text file in the posts directory there is a corresponding page created in the pages directory with the same number ie 12.txt will create 12.html

12044407
for-loop	loops
since i want to loops over the keys of a map i first copy the keys into a vector vec_keys and the i run the parallel for-loop over the elements of vec_keys

google-chrome	firefox
it has click and arrow key navigation enabled so you can see the stark differences in speed between ie8 and firefox google-chrome etc

12044470
google-chrome	safari
you probably want to this in google-chrome or safari as the developer tools are better on them in my opinion

12044480
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
in firefox google-chrome and safari you ll is getting of hello

i also added in flexible width and height so that it would rotate properly

12044620
pdfsharp	sharppdf
i looked at sharppdf pdfsharp and it seems this library is only for generating pdfs from scratch not saving docx as pdf

12044626
width	height
you will need to set a width if you use this i believe so also add the width you can set your own width to what you require same for height

12044702
crypt	hash
i try doing phpunit md5test from the tests crypt hash directory and get the following

12044727
folder	directory
then run through the second directory and use in_array to determine if it s in the last folder

12044735
folder	directory
for example if your compiled code is in mycode com somedomain someproject mymainclass.class then you will execute the java command from the mycode folder like this again take special note that the directory structure is the same as the package declaration

12044769
cpu	processors
you are probably seeing 50 cpu usage because you have a dual core processors

12044955
pow	math.h
i can t use pow from math.h because i need a constant expression

12045046
instances	transient
so trying to bind to these transient class instances wasn t really sensible on my part - i would have to keep 96 instances of that class around

functions like mempartinfoget require part_id in the manual it states that malloc uses free lists of system memory partition

12045083

12045089
udp	tcp
don t think of it as udp is faster and tcp is slower because that s just wrong

12045089
udp	tcp
if you have to reassembly multiple udp packets into one you should probably use tcp

12045099
post	get
here s how it works you use the server url create a nsurlrequest assign the proper http method post get etc and other necessary request headers then you would call on nsurlconnection to get the response and the server data

uiview	subviews
this is all being run from a subclass of uiview with the uiimageview as a subviews

12045115

background-color	transparency
the css filter will change the elements to have opacity of 80 and i only want background-color to be transparency

instead of using wrap_content you can specify a view s width or height using dp density independant pixels try changing wrap_content to 50dp or whatever value that suits your needs

12045324
hash	md5
generally you will store an md5 hash on the original binary and check the md5 against new versions to see if they are the same enough md5 can t guarantee a 100 match

12045366
hash	salt
you could salt the ssn hash which will mean that if someone runs a brute force crack against your table they will have to do it once for each row rather than be able to get all the rows at once

12045371
getter	setter
i ve tried to use getter and setter to do this but i think the problem lies in that there is no persistant variable so the first block of code is always called

12045412
debian	mint	debian	linux
i ve tested it on my computer linux mint debian edition and it seems to work perfectly

12045432
children	parent

post	get
i found one blog that discusses the issue of post redirects being converted to get s and resulting in errors which is exaclty what i was experiencing

12045604
hide	show
so if one is clicked it will show the div associated with it and hide the others ect

12045707
hide	show
and as i already mentioned for a tab type interface where you d need to make groups of elements appear disappear at once you can just show hide a div that contains all the elements for the current tab

12045707
hide	show
the child elements will show hide with their parent

12045707
fadein	hide
also with jquery .show and hide or other animation methods like fadein and .fadeout you can add some nice transitions between your tabs

12045711
getter	setter
now let s say we want fubar to have a getter and setter or in other words become a c# property

12045722
width	height
a brute force way that seems to work in some browsers for getting the height and width a little before the full image has loaded is to poll the loading image for the existence of .width and height

12045722
put	get
if you go the route of an onload handler and your image tag with the .src specific is in the html of the page the only way to make sure you get notified when it is loaded is to put an inline image handler so the handler is installed from the very beginning

12045730
ssl	https
this is becuase its https ssl

12045738
getter	setter
however if it s just a basic getter setter with no extra logic you can just write

12045740
getter	setter
if there s no logic in the getter setter use an auto-property

12045745
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
some of the changes include using println rather than printf s n ... which is just clearer and using an enhanced for-loop instead of manually tracking the position in the arrays in a loops

12045768
getter	setter
if you name your private variables starting with lower case you can right click on them and have vs generate your getter setter code for you

12045772

viewdidappear	viewwillappear
viewwillappear and viewdidappear are not called in newviewcontroller_iphone

12045940
multibyte	substr	strlen	substr
the application uses various php string functions such as strlen strpos substr etc and my understanding is that i should switch these for multibyte string functions such as mb_strlen mb_strlen mb_substr etc in order for multibyte characters to be handled correctly

12045983
pull	push
so i followed your steps to push a tag on one eclipse and then pull it from another eclipse instance

n-gram	words
after some research i found that i can use either the bag of words approach or n-gram approach to represent a document as a vector

12046214
g++	gcc
you need to use g++ instead of gcc

12046214
g++	gcc
generally speaking gcc is for compiling linking c while g++ is for c++

i had a handy mysql database configured and ready so i just added each event from the queue to the database

12046359
git-merge	git-rebase

12046388
implements	extends
i have a list of objects and those objects extends from a class you can also do it with interface and implementation i do it with extends for other reasons in common and that class have a method public view getview and the in all the classes that extends from the father class or implements the interface you override implements the method and add the code necessary to make that page look like you want then on the adapter you only need to have a list of objects of any of the classes that you created and depending on which type each of those objects are they will create the view passed to the viewpager

12046418
width	height
the issue there is that you can get the width and height after onwindowfocuschanged but if you try to add some views in it then you can t get that information until everything have been drawn

12046471
google-chrome	safari
this works in safari and in google-chrome

12046493
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
first of all the tags are new in html 5 which is not supported by ie so they will not work in internet explorer they should work fine in firefox 4+ google-chrome 3+ safari 4+ opera 9+ and any other html 5 enabled browser.

12046497
google-chrome	firefox
and as mentioned it work on firefox but not on ie and google-chrome

12046522
spaces	delimiter

12046595
google-chrome	firefox
t return data in ie but does in firefox and google-chrome

12046651
pull	push
better yet instead of running them on a loop where an exception could kill all of them push each query as a job in a queue and have a subsystem that pull jobs form the queue and query google analytics

12046675
width	height
i have a map of a specific area with about 1600 km width and 600 km height and i will cover this entire area -which is not a straight shape like a rectangle or a square- with 1 km x 1 km square grids

12046685
int	chars
and will the assignment of int be more efficient then assignment using chars for the same chunk of memory since i would need to loop 4 times as many times if i use chars versus int

12046710
imagemagick	wand
you can easily do that using wand a simple binding of imagemagick for python

12046724

12046778
google-chrome	firefox
configure firefox google-chrome profiles to silently download files

12046802
adplus	cdb
...otherwise adplus with the -pn option might be making cdb attempt to reattach to the already crashed process...which it can t because a debugger is already attached

12046802
put	get
put up taskmanager and see if you ever get multiple instances of your application showing up if you do then you might have to use the -p pid option instead to get adplus to monitor the right process...not ideal as you have to have started the process first in order to get its pid

12046832
mouse	keyboard
it s like i need to trigger a repaint using the keyboard or mouse - the setneedsdisplay isn t doing it - but i don t understand why

12046848
google-chrome	firefox
for me it s broken in google-chrome 21 and fine in firefox 14 on windows 7

12047119
inherited	properties
then make-sure it has no other properties not even the inherited properties and all it defines is a background-color

12047119

12047234
post	get
i read on another post that someone was able to get this to work by creating a custom webview class and overriding stuff in there but i can t seem to get ondoubletap to fire no matter what and double tap zooming is still happening regardless of this

12047236
google-chrome	firefox
i have developed a website where the back button does not always go back to the previous page when using ie - no issue with firefox or google-chrome

12047314
musicbrainz	freebase
for example we import data from musicbrainz clean it up and match the topics against existing topics in freebase to avoid duplicates

12047660
inherited	properties
the css clean properties has the following values left right both inherited none

12047678
width	height
the problem with this is if the images are different sizes then space will be wasted because the 3d image has to have the width of the widest image the height of the tallest image and the depth would be the number of images

12047710
stdout	stderr
probably the stuff you re interested in is being sent to stderr rather than stdout

12047726
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
everything is fine users can type into the inputs ok except when i .append a row where an input cell has a value when an extra margin appears to be added above the input destroying the alignment of table rows this happens in google-chrome and safari but firefox is ok

the major upgrade works fine with per-user installation scope when installing the newer versioning with the same per-user scope

12048977
stdout	stderr
your current code is sending both stdout and stderr to dev null so i m kind of curious as to why anything is printed at all

12048977
stdout	stderr
the syntax means duplicate stdout descriptor 1 as stderr descriptor 2

12048977
stdout	stderr
in effect stderr is made into a copy of the current stdout

12048977
stdout	stderr
if you put first then stdout is first redirected to dev null and then stderr is pointed at the current stdout dev null

12048977
stdout	stderr
but if you put second stderr will first become a copy of the current stdout the normal output stream before stdout is redirected

12048977
stdout	stderr
so the command s stderr prints to the tty or the interpreter as if it came from stdout while stdout is silenced

12048994
stdout	stderr
time command prints result to stderr not to stdout

12048994
stdout	stderr
you should reroute stderr to stdout to achieve what you want

children	parent
the order_line rows have no columns useful for searching - they are just children of the customer_order table so this query would have to read every order_line row in the database and join it back to the parent and there should always be one then apply the where clause condition

12057493
haskell	ocaml
many if not most of scala s advanced features do also originate from either haskell or ocaml so they are already there and don t need to be translated

12057516

to do this you can map the folder on z where they are as a virtual directory in iis

12057871
nginx	lighttpd
the best solution for now is to do some rewriting via nginx lighttpd

12057872
versioning	upgrade
and you can encode versioning data to support upgrade merging a lot easier

12057883
children	parent
basically you add the event aggregator to your dependancy injections and then your parent would subscribe as a listener to the event and your children would publish the event

12057883
children	parent
the nice part about this is that the children have no concept of who is listening and the parent just knows it has an event request to handle

getter	setter
it throws an attributeerror on setting badprop not because it doesn t yet know that badprop is a property rather than a normal attribute if that were the case it would just set the attribute with no error because that s now normal attributes behave but because you haven t provided a setter for badprop only a getter

12065716
getter	setter
if all you re doing in your getter and setter is redirecting read write access to an attribute of the same name but with an underscore prepended then by far the simplest thing to do is get rid of the properties altogether and just use normal attributes

12065716
getter	setter
python isn t java and even in java i m not convinced of the virtue of private fields with the obvious public getter setter anyway

12065716
getter	setter
if you later discover that you need to run some code whenever an attribute is read written you can make it a property then without changing your interface this is actually what descriptors were originally intended for not so that we could start writing java style getter setter for every single attribute

12065716
getter	setter
if each attribute has independent custom behaviour then there is no more efficient way to do this than explicitly providing a getter and a setter for each attribute

12065716
getter	setter
if you re running exactly the same or very similar code in every single getter setter and it s not just adding an underscore to the real attribute name and that s why you object to writing them all out rightly so

if you rely on hooking events up to the keydown keyup events to track the state of the keyboard...then this may not be so accurate

12076468
keydown	keyup
that s becuase you are relying on the message pumping to process and dispatch those keydown keyup messages....they may be delivered after the real keyboard state has changed again

12076468
keydown	keyup
also because when your bit of code that is interested in the keyboard state is running usually on the ui thread ...the keydown or keyup can t interrupt you...as they are dispatched on the ui thread too....that s why using getkeyboardstate or the keyboard.iskeydown should be used

int	chars
a typical 4-byte int is then 8 hex chars like 0xdeadbeef

12081598
hex	binary
base-16 or hex notation is convenient because you can fit four bits in exactly one hex digit making conversion to binary very easy yet not requiring as much space as a full binary notation

12081598
hex	binary
converting back is easy as well group your binary digits by four and use the table to make hex digits

12081607
int	boolean
note that with option strict specified this will actually be an error option strict on disallows implicit conversions from boolean to int .

12081635
postgresql	mysql
although your solution work fine with mysql i failed to make it work with postgresql as it s sequence based

12081681
post	get
external tools like google analytics uses javascript with a tracking image the retrieval of the image is a way to simulate the post request but it s just get anyway in combination with a cookie to track only unique visitors

int	double
i have looked at the int convert --to-- vector vector double page and saw an example of a simple vector at the last response but i am still having difficulty understanding the question

12081779
hex	binary
you can convert binary to hex by grouping from the right 4 bits at a time and converting each group to the corresponding hex

12081779
hex	binary
the conversion from hex to binary is even simpler since you can simply expand each hex digit into the corresponding binary for example 0xa4 - 1010 0100

12081810
bash	zsh
the notation is unique for bash and zsh

12081810
bash	zsh
this will work in bash ksh93 and zsh and has been around slightly longer

12081816
google-chrome	firefox
tested on google-chrome 21 and firefox 14 same problem

12081888
hex	binary
as been written in other replies converting between binary and hexadecimal is comparatively easy 4 binary digits 1 hex digit

12081888
hex	binary
converting between decimal and hex is more involving and at least to me it s been easier if i have to do it in my head to first convert the decimal into binary representation and then the binary number into hex

12082028
children	parent
the expand button shows all children of that row all of which share some common data with the parent row

12082028
children	parent
goal drag children between parent

12082028
children	parent
so far i have the table with expanding subrows but i can t wrap my head around how to make the children draggable between parent

12082089
builtin	getcwd
php has a builtin function getcwd that does this in a single line of code

12082104

so extends former comet servers to support websocket is the natural evolution that all of us vendors have implements

12082174
folder	directory
also the package help states note that stray files in data source directory such as .dbf may lead to suprious errors that accompanying .shp are missing. the .zip folder has the following a.dbf b.prj c.shp d.shp.xml e.shx

12082182
equals	gethashcode
however the compiler creates the anonymous types actually it s just one type with exactly two properties named sid and cid as well as providing implementations for equals and gethashcode that join will use in its implementation

12082247
plot	heatmap
i am not 100 sure if your data is in a matrix and you want a heatmap type plot

maven-antrun-plugin	pom.xml
i use the maven-antrun-plugin in the pom.xml file to call the target in the build.xml file

12082249
maven	pom.xml
if i choose the packaging as pom.xml then maven will not generate any packaging but it won t compile the src files as well

12082278
width	height
i have set images to a height and width of 100px using css but i would like the height and width to change to 400px when i click on the image but i also want it to animate the change

12082303
min	max
what are the min and max of this value

12082320
base-class	subclassing
since you re using subclassing of entity this will slice the object and only copy the base-class part

12082396
udp	tcp
in any case if this is a video stream you should probably be using udp instead of tcp

12082396
udp	tcp
udp communication requires much less overhead than tcp due to the number of messages exchanged

12082396
udp	tcp
in my experience udp based code is generally less complex than tcp based code

12082429
google-chrome	firefox
when i am opening my html file using ie firefox google-chrome i can see my graph properly

12082447
mp3	ogg
ff doesn t actually play mp3 files but instead plays ogg files

12082447
mp3	ogg
if the demo songs in the above corrected example code from lloyd works but when you change the mp3 path to an mp3 file on your server and it doesn t work then make sure your server has the mime type application ogg without quotes

12082447
mp3	ogg
the server will see the mp3 file in the code and play it as if it were an ogg application file

12082448
xdebug	xhprof
you can use debug_backtrace to check out where your file is included from other utilities can be xhprof or xdebug

12082645
google-chrome	firefox
tried on firefox and google-chrome

12082654
viewdidload	viewwillappear
to solve your problem set the textlabel s text in viewdidload or viewwillappear

12082654
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i believe this is fixed in ios 6 but it won t be backwards compatible so if you want to support ios 5 still you ll have to use viewdidload or viewwillappear to update outlets which i think is better to do anyway

12082705
post	put
json requests are handled with respond_with as well but unlike the html requests actually return the requested resource and perform the requested action in the case of put post and delete

12082711
google-chrome	safari
this is the behavior in google-chrome safari

12082742
profiling	instrumentation

12082863
fadein	fadeout
i see that it uses the easing option in its fadein and fadeout calls which i know is not supported in 1.3.2 so i tried stripping out those parts but still no luck

12082888
ember.js	backbone.js
i like marionette as a higher-level framework than backbone.js itself but not as complex as ember.js

12082902
folder	directory
just to get this out of the way if at all possible i d like to do this without nesting them all inside a directory with the app s name inside the app s static folder it feels redundant

12082914
capitalization	uppercase
first we need a way to fix the capitalization of the first word lowercase the whole thing if the first letter s lowercase and lowercase everything but the first letter if the first letter s uppercase

12082914
punctuation	words
secondly we want to treat punctuation as completely invisible it shouldn t uppercase the following words

12082919
pop-up	dialog	nsopenpanel	nsprogressindicator	nswindow	nsprogressindicator
inside our app we have a file choosing dialog which is an nsopenpanel after the user selects and appropriate file a nsprogressindicator pop-up and updates using a call to incrementby while the user s project loads and then finally an nswindow pop-up with many fun and interesting views some are nsopenglviews

12082951
portrait	landscape
my modal view is displayed in landscape mode but the view below it is displayed in portrait

12083007
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
in this case looking at the docs you might be getting either a argumentnullexception or argumentexception so you need to test for that in your try catch block

12083024

imagick	gmagick
otherwise try imagick cairo or gmagick which there are pecl plugins for too

12083084
cvs	svn
this seems to differ in my mind from cvs svn branches where after i merge in a feature branch to the main branch i don t actually consider the feature branch as part of the main branch s history

12083094
google-chrome	safari
it works fine on safari iphone google-chrome android and even in an android webview native app

12083121

if you look at the docs for oncreate you can see that savedinstancestate will be non-null when the activity is recreate due to configuration changes for example and thus will be null when the activity is run fresh

12083378
ironruby	rubinius	jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius	mri	rubinius
in mri yarv mruby and tinyrb it is c code in rubinius it is c++ code in macruby it is objective-c code in jruby and xruby it is java code in rubygolightly it is go code in ironruby and ruby.net it is c# code in maglev and smallruby it is smalltalk code in cardinal it is pasm code

12083383
hide	show
a simple solution might be to show a loading gif before the functions start and then hide it when they re finished

12083402
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately firefox doesn t support text-decoration attribute on svg elements so perhaps you are testing in firefox but in google-chrome it might be displaying fine with your style attribute

12083408
post	get
this is probably such a simple question but after reading a few tutorials and other post on stack overflow i couldn t get what i was looking for

12083447
plone	buildout
1 confirm you re on plone 4.2 - plone.app.theming is part of plone 4.2 so you don t need to reference in the buildout

12083449
hide	show
the best thing would be to just hide show the elements and not constantly replace them like so fiddle

12083486
hash	salt
secure hash and salt for php passwords

12083486
hash	salt
i try to create a function that hash my password with salt using haval160 4 hashing algorithm

12083504
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
it s also a major drawback when i have to rely on numerous different objects that implement inotifypropertychanged instead properly implementing inotifycollectionchanged

12083527
libzip	zlib
libzip uses zlib for the compression and decompression part

12083533
for-loop	arrays
there are two ways in my idea allocating a cell arrays then using a for-loop or

12083538
subclass	abstract-class
note that inputstream is an abstract-class so any inputstream object you have will of necessity be a subclass

12083555
pop-up	dialog
while the cursor is in the inputtext and i press the enter the dialog will pop-up

12083562
int	chars
no problem with chars or int

12083563
google-chrome	safari
note if you use webkit it ll only render in google-chrome and safari

12083566
mouse	keyboard
to get a better sense of it working use the keyboard arrows instead of the mouse to slide through colors

12083628
udp	tcp
it is very important to use udp and not the tcp dns implementation

12083668
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i m developing an app right now and it basically consists of 2 view controllers the first being a uitableviewcontroller embedded in a uinavigationcontroller the second being a completely custom one being built on a stock standard uiviewcontroller

12083668
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
i ve noticed that on my uinavigationcontroller view when the device rotates the uinavigationbar and the uitoolbar both perform a cross-fade animation when transitioning to their landscape dimensions

12083668
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
for technical reasons i didn t use a uinavigationcontroller for my custom view controller but i manually added a uinavigationbar and a uitoolbar in the same places to it basically because i need those elements to be able to be overlaid on top of the background view as they can optionally be hidden and i wanted direct control to do that

12083673
fgets	strcmp
the next thing to be aware of is that fgets will retain the newline in your input so you ll need to address this in your usage of strcmp

12083683
range	max
the user program never sees the real physical address space it always deals with the logical addresses.as we have two different type of addresses logical address in the range 0 to max and physical addresses in the range r to r+max where r is the value of relocation register.the user generates only logical addresses and thinks that the process runs in location to 0 to max.as it is clear from the above text that user program supplies only logical addresses these logical addresses must be mapped to physical address before they are used

12083714
put	get
put your keys to an nsmutablearray will help you get last first key

12083738
queue	fifo
if you need to retrieve data based on when you added it to a container you need a lifo aka stack fifo aka queue or deque aka double-ended queue kind of container

master left hand view controller is hidden in both portrait and landscape by returning yes in the shouldhideviewcontroller delegate method

12083788
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
by putting break points in my code i can verify that when i first try to access the master view after a memory warning the viewdidload event is called this does not occur if there has not been a memory warning however the viewdidappear viewwillappear events are not called

12083798
width	height
i ve set the width and height but i don t know where that weird white space is coming from

12083820

12083930
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu linux 12.04 and octave 3.2.4 from the repo s

12083933
postgresql	mysql
this would apply to oracle sql server mysql and postgresql

12083954
width	height
if possible i would like to avoid specifying absolute values like pixels for all but the x button which may be given absolute width and height

12083956
post	get
everyone says it s as simple as calling it on the iframe element but the only way i was able to get it to work was via a method called postmessage which i found on someone else s stackoverflow post

12083962

if anyone has a suggestion on how to adapt the above code or an entirely different way to find the position of the mouse keyboard it would be appreciated

12084040
decltype	auto
as i understand it both decltype and auto will attempt to figure out what the type of something is

12084047
getter	setter
one possible way would be to introduce getter setter methods for the private variables of your class

12084047
getter	setter
edit your question has the following comment about getter setter that i missed

12084047
getter	setter
if you really do not want to expose the realvector vector field i think what you can do is have getter setter methods for individual attributes of your realvector class

12084087
uiview	subviews
the custom cell in the real code is adding uiimageview and uilabel uiview on the other hand doesn t have contentview so we don t need to add subviews to its contentview

12084107
decltype	auto
so for example if you have a function that returns a reference auto will still be a value you need to get a reference but decltype will be exactly the type of the return value

12084107
decltype	auto
also see david rodrã guez s answer about the places in which only one of auto or decltype are possible

12084124
decltype	auto
in the cases where auto can be used it is more concise than decltype as you don t need to provide the expression from which the type will be inferred

12084135
children	parent
does not work -- probably because i am performing set algebra to remove children from parent

12084147
width	height
using that font construct a string object that you ll use for a label or edit control i don t know what this is for qt for windows it is gettextextentpoint32 and pass it to a system function to determine the width and height of the string for your environment

post	get
here is a link to an example of my code can t get it to display fully in this post

12084229
int	double
if i were to change third to a double instead of an int i would expect marshal.sizeof to return 16

12084229
int	double
but if i add a double in after 3 int the size isn t what i expect

12084283
put	get
however when we put it on the live server the website we get 406 errors randomly occuring

12084325

12084602
matlab	simulink
i could go on the mathworks has many toolboxes for matlab there s simulink and its related products for which there really is no equivalent in octave yes you d have to pay for all that

12084622
client-side	server-side
if you re asking about whether it s more important to pre-compile templates used server-side as opposed to client-side it usually is simply because a server is going to have to render them potentially several thousand times a second so it s wasteful to have to compile them each time they re rendered

12084640
getter	setter
manually implementing the setter getter to set return mutable instances is probably wrong

12084654
post	get
is telling the recipient that a xml file for the post is created and you will get this from post_url post

12084721
afnetworking	sdwebimage
just use sdwebimage or afnetworking

12084721
afnetworking	sdwebimage
what that means is if the image downloader library sdwebimage or afnetworking has found an image in its cache then it will just get that one from disk rather than redownload the image from the web

12084721
afnetworking	sdwebimage
sdwebimage or afnetworking will essentially do all the hard work for you and make your table responsive

12084870
mp4	h.264
according to android 4.0 supports the video element but it doesn t support embedding mp4 h.264 or ogg videos

12084898
post	get
also you may use a using either get or post method to pass the value into db

12084899
width	height
so what this function does was to put border width and height to my div class box then this fake_box will move to the top right corner

12084920

note that after a failed malloc there is no point in attempting to free the result--it s a null pointer anyway

12092785
getter	setter
i wouldn t add getter setter unless you need them otherwise it s hard to know what data methods other classes are depending on when you need to make a change

12092785
getter	setter
plus overuse of getter setter can be a symptom of poor object-oriented design which is all about data encapsulation

12092832
getter	setter
getter and setter should be always used

12092832
getter	setter
the reason of getter or setter is not to provide a public interface to internal properties rather to provide a control over read write of a property

12092832
getter	setter
even your class properties is private you need getter and setter

12092832
getter	setter
the fact is blindly using getter and setter for every property is evil

12092896
getter	setter
it is not implicitly wrong to have getter and setter for all members and some people will argue that it is a good idea although in practical terms few people actually bother for every private variable .

12092896

what is a bad idea is to have public getter and setter for every variable

processors	hyperthreading
i tried disabling hyperthreading this kinda smoothed the results then assigning each thread a single physical processors by using setthreadaffinitymask

12093444
affinity	processors
i can sort of understand how running on a hyper-threaded system can make some threads unlucky they are scheduled to compete with other threads on the same physical processors and because of soft affinity to this virtual core they get to run on it again and again thus scoring lower than others

even so as the guy who is most likely to train a group of cvs coworkers in an alternative vcs i do firmly believe bazaar will require the least retraining

12095666
bazaar	cvs
it is almost trivial to use bazaar in a workflow that closely correlates with cvs workflows

12095666
bazaar	cvs
what i m trying to say is i am not blindly enamored by bazaar but i still believe it to be the easiest tool to transition to away from cvs in a small engineering department

cvs	svn
i have worked with svn a lot and have even set up partial checkouts etc but i disagree that svn is cvs done right

the title is centred not through only usage of the h1 element s width of 100 and text-align center but is also due to the margin 0 auto applied to the header div

consistency	acid
the expected acid properties of relational dbs defining proper transactions too restricts how scalability can be improved we have to choose between giving up scalability consistency or fault-tolerance -- and most of these tools give up consistency and therefore acid

12096376
consistency	acid
a new weaker set of requirements replacing acid is base basically avalilable soft state eventual consistency

12096376
voltdb	acid
here a good idea would be to use in-memory column-oriented and distributed sql acid databases for example voltdb

12096381

crypt	hash
from my point of view it s better to hash passwords on the server because you can control how you crypt passwords algorithm etc. and you keep consistency

12096740
width	height
this means it has zero width and height so it is basically invisible

12096740

you should turn the into a block element so it will automatically adjust to the parent s width and adjust it to its parent s the div s fixed height

12096756

hash	salt
hackers - provided they are interested in your program - will crack it by reverse engineering the source they ll find both the hash algorithm and the secret salt

12096796
implements	extends
what you saw here is an anonymous class which is declared and initialized simultaneously and it must extends or implements a class or interface respectively

12096807
int	double
if not then you could either use a 64 bit int and atomic functions which you read by value then transfer to a double or you could use a simple pthread_mutex_t or perhaps even a spin lock be very careful with spin locks

12096814
listview	gridview
i ve got a listview with a gridview inside of it

post	get
there are three ways to get data from an html page into the server backend url get form post and cookies

12097605
post	get
in terms of efficiency per your post title url get variables a slightly more efficient since form data goes through a mild amount of encoding before it is sent on to the server

12097605
post	get
under normal usage the standard is to use url get variables when you are retrieving data from the server and to use form post variables when you want to manipulate edit delete data on the server

12097609
post	get
you can either add these manually or by changing your post form to get

12097688
free	malloc
after bit of further research i found that the sigusr1 was handled by the main thread and not the control thread.as the fn_recv called had functions like malloc free which i suppose are not re-entrant it was causing the problem

12097698
addeventlistener	onload
if so you ll need to use addeventlistener instead of your inline onload handler

12098110
hide	show
if your r.layout.main is not using a relativelayout as the root node but is instead using a linearlayout you should still be able to achieve the same effect by setting the visibilities to view.gone if you want it to hide and view.visible if you want it to show

12098120
move	drag

12102693
fontfamily	font-size
fontfamily and most-common font-size for general body text for instance should only ever be declared in one place

12102705
width	height
it has to do with how you are defining height and width

12102705
width	height
you get the correct behavior the reason you were seeing the t multiple times is because with the height and width defined with the incorrect values you just happened to be indexing the same point in memory because you were over running the buffer into memory that you had just happened to have correctly initialized

12102709
width	height
by the shape of the output you re obviously using height of 10 and width of 26

12102759
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu you can simply sudo apt-get install libsdl-image1.2-dev

using entityframework i have created a page with a number of detailsview and formview controls to try and capture survey information 100 inserting

12102967
formview	detailsview
rather than have the user click the autogenerated insert button in each detailsview or formview i would like to provide a single submit button to insert all the new data which is what i am currently - and unsuccessfully - trying to code

12102967
formview	detailsview
i don t seem to be able to access them through the formview detailsview itself and i can t seem to access the boundfields within the views

12102967
entitydatasource	detailsview
i m about to start looking into solutions involving the objectcontext and or entitydatasource s tied to the detailsview s but it seems to me that if i m coming at it from that side then i might as well use plain textbox es and just loop through them creating all the entity stuff in code rather than letting the databinding features kick in

12103016
google-chrome	firefox
if you go to the following example on google-chrome or firefox and then in ie9 you will see that it is broken in ie9

ideally at the root project folder but current file directory would also be fine

12103029
pop-up	dialog
i m trying to fill a listview in a dialog window that pop-up when a button is clicked

as you are using a checkbox so you need to convert boolean value into int before passing into the query

12103297
ubuntu	linux
i am on linux ubuntu 2012.04 and have enabled debugging information

12103305
for-loop	loops
you re calling that every single time through the for-loop but only once with the for-each loops

12103305
for-loop	loops
the reason is because a for-loop invokes a method send on every single pass through loops -objectatindex whereas for-each can fetch the objects much more efficiently by grabbing them in large batches

i ve got a main view controller that has a subviews of uiscrollview and another 2 uiviewcontrollers each with nibs uiview and buttons

12103694
portrait	landscape
change your layout to relative layout -- and you can also put a different layout for landscape and portrait refer supporting multiple screens by android developers you will understand in a better way

12103722
portrait	landscape
create layout xml file for both landscape and portrait mode is the good practice

12103775
udp	tcp
you can even make your server.php title becomes misleading in this solution btw accept ips via rest interface so no additional tcp udp connection would be needed

i passed in the new width and height of the frame and not the original width and height of the frame for source coords

12104087
dbcontext	objectcontext
what might be easier altogether is to use the overload of objectcontext dbcontext

12104109
folder	directory
a good practice and a wise thing to do would be to separate the operations directory retrieval list sorting list display in different functions so that you can test them separately and incrementally the folder retrieval does retrieve everything and you can display the files in unsorted order etc.

12104112
dns	spf
please check your reverse dns spf and domain keys of your mail server and your domain

12104138

you might try utilising asp.net web api tracing but i haven t test it with post request yet so i m not sure how if it is tracing the request body it is tracing parameters for get request for sure

12104344
submit	submission
so if you submit the second form after submission the first one you will have a session variable user_id provided you have commented out the lines that unset and destroy the session

12104377

12104410
portrait	landscape
well if u are creating your app for both portrait as well as landscape mode then you have to make two different layouts otherwise you can restrict your app to display your app only on the portrait mode by adding a screenorientation property in your manifest file

12104451

i m using tcp sockets for packets that require guaranteed delivery ie. chat messages login and logout requests ping packets etc and udp for everything that does not necessarily need to be delivered since only the last packet that got through is important ie. user input game world and objects updates etc

the reason you cannot get this to work is probably because in firefox and google-chrome you don t have the correct culture

int	chars
as far as i guess you should extract 4 ascii chars from a 32 bit int

12106004

read all your int values in an array then point the starting memory location with a chars pointer then write one by one the contents of this chars array

screens	tablet
detecting screens orientation might help but afaik on tablet the soft keyboard won t cover the whole screens even on landscape

12106317
int	chars
i think all of this originates from the incorrect weird assumption that there are 8 bit int and then there are chars where chars is some sort of magical mysterious thing

12106317
int	chars
the mysterious signedness of chars adds nothing to the language except perhaps a potential for signedness-related bugs caused by implicit int promotions

12106317
int	chars
likely they let chars be signed because they wanted it to behave just as the other int types short int long which are all guaranteed by the standard to alwasy be signed by default

12106317
int	chars
whenever you use chars as operand in an expression it will always get promoted to int

12106317
int	chars
similarly constant chars literals a n etc are of type int not chars

12106317
int	chars
first of all the literals a and b get silently truncated from int into signed unsigned chars

12106361
int	chars
so basically for some reason the input file contains the chars to output stored as int

12106361
int	chars
your least worst bet it to read in each int cast it to an array of chars and output those 4 chars

12106443

if you don t want the table header to scroll with the table then rather than add the uiview to your uitableview you can add your uiview as a subviews of the view controller s view at the same level as your uitableview

int	chars
as for performance values of type chars are implicitly converted in many contexts to int assuming that int can represent all values of type chars which is usually the case

12106604
int	chars
it converts the value of ch from chars to int adds 1 to the result and converts the sum back from int to chars to store it in ch

12106604
int	chars
converting an 8-bit signed chars to a 32-bit signed int requires sign extension

12106604
int	chars
converting an 8-bit unsigned chars to a 32-bit signed int requires zero-filling the high-order 24 bits of the target

12106606

so forcing chars to be unsigned is far lower on the list of achievable goals than forcing int to be 2 s complement and c hasn t even done that

12106626
inherited	properties
attributes on interface properties doesn t get inherited to the class you may make your interface an abstract class

12106655
queue	fifo
i am reading about fifo queue array implementeation in algorithms in c++ by robert sedwick

12106656
hide	show
in body load call the javascript function to show hide the divs

12106734
hide	show
what i mean is to calculate the absolute positions of all price divs hide them and when the cart div reaches that position by scrolling show the price div for x amount of pixel scrolling or via z-indexes by making backgrounds not sure what suits you better

12106766
textblock	itemscontrol
the itemscontrol now has a stackpanel with a textblock to show the date header the dictionary key and another itemscontrol which is basically a copy of the old one which just listed the items the dictionary value

12106766
inotifycollectionchanged	icollectionview
as the control is bound to items and the icollectionview implements inotifycollectionchanged i was expecting the filter to work as it is changing the items list and that the converter would be re-run to rebuild the dictionary

12106792
post	put
2 in javascript it s better for reasons that are beyond the scope of this post to put opening curly braces on the same line not next

12106835
for-loop	arrays
if you are using php then you could just place it in a for-loop add an index to the arrays such as bestscore and then check each score individually like so

12106838
children	parent
try finding the parent of the clicked element only and using its children

12106844
pull	push
the reason i am doing it this way is in my research everyone keeps telling me that you should only ever push to a bare repository so i have set up a bare for everyone to push to so we can pull down into different locations

12106860
didselectrowatindexpath	viewwillappear
do the deselection in didselectrowatindexpath instead of viewwillappear

12106878
queue	fifo
my question is we have rule for removing for example lifo queue removing last in last out and for queue it is fifo but how it is related to insert for large number of items in them as mentioned in above paragraph

12106894
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works great in firefox safari and google-chrome but somehow ie9 seems to mess it up of course..

12106894
google-chrome	firefox
open in google-chrome firefox and resize browser window - the table is responsive and changes to a narrow design

12106913
openbsd	freebsd
operating systems like freebsd openbsd and os x use the yarrow algorithm for their urandom devices

12106913
prng	random
this however does not supply a large amount of random data and it is therefore often used to seed a prng

12106942
soa	osb
i would not recommend start using it just for this but one possibility oracle fusion middleware soa and osb

12106952
button	checkbox
actually i need to be able to change the background-attribute for other ext-controls than button too panels checkbox ... but i think that i can adopt a working solution for button to those other controls myself

12106957
queue	fifo
what i think the author means is that you can simply use a fifo or a lifo queue but better performance can be acquired in some scenarios by using an algorithm that tackles resource-heavy items in the queue first

12106969
children	parent
so when you add some children into the first one this may result in a crappy structure as all children have the same parent some children have the same children as their siblings etc.

12106981
macbook	bootcamp
so i recently bought myself a macbook air and i just installed visual studio 2012 in bootcamp

12107059
requestfactory	gwt	requestfactory	gwt-rpc
so if you need some specific things for your test you can very well create a test-specific module that inherits your standard module and return that new module from getmodulename gwt unit tests do that for testing some set-property or set-configuration-property values or declare servlet s for testing gwt-rpc requestfactory or formpanel for instance

12107093
client-side	server-side
you re mixing server-side and client-side

12107097
rss	feed
my rss feed

12107114
svg	vml
as mentioned earlier you should avoid libraries based on svg or vml because most won t work on android devices

12107268
min	max
on the issue with setting min max window size

12107292
plot	heatmap
i would like to create either a heatmap with a bar plot along the axes like this

12107294
division	multiplication
signedness affects the result of division right shift and the high half of multiplication which is rarely used and in many programming languages unavailable anyway

12107360
gson	jackson
actually genson is faster and has more features than gson and has performances close to jackson but its a lot more lightweight see

12107360
gson	jackson
a few words on gson and jackson

12107360
gson	jackson
i have used jackson for more than 2 years and a bit gson

12107360
getter	setter
first thing to note about gson is that it does not use getter setter but only fields

12107360
gson	jackson
note also that gson comes with less features out of the box than genson or jackson

12107360
gson	jackson
if you don t want to use genson i really recommend you jackson over gson

12107400
folder	directory
found the location of the temp folder using sys_get_temp_dir made this directory writable and all was go again

12107414
try-catch	exception-handling
as spring hibernate integration doesn t mandate to write try-catch block but suppose if any exception-handling is thwron while saving that object

12107487
mouse	trackpad
i have set up a page which will flick through a sequence of images as the user scrolls with their mouse or trackpad

12107487
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this is working perfectly in firefox google-chrome safari opera ie9 and also on the ipad iphone etc

what i m trying is to make textarea autogrow when you enter text or paste some text in it

12107507
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
but in opera google-chrome and safari it is auto growing even i click functional keys additional keys like shift ctrl down arrow up arrow left arrow right arrow home end delete etc. also

12107536
qobject	qwidget
and this points qwebpage inherit qobject qobject inherit qwidget

12107566
ant	maven
if you are coming from java world then using gradle which is groovy-based would be rather simple for you because you can reuse your java ant maven groovy knowledge to write scripts

12107566
ant	maven
it also integrates very well with maven infrastructure and you can reuse all ant tasks

12107572
jar	war
as per some expert s suggestion i tried removing slf4j-api-1.6.1.jar jar file from my project s war and redeployed it again

12107594
free	malloc
if you malloc memory write something in it then free it and malloc some more memory you might get the same memory again with its previous contents largely intact

12107598
jerkson	jackson
correct me if i m wrong but it looks like jackson jerkson will not support arbitrarily nested json

12107605
qobject	qwidget
qobject inherits qwidget

12107605
qobject	qwidget
no it doesn t - qwidget inherits qobject not the other way around

12107635
chunked	transfer-encoding
i was doing fine until i learned there is something called transfer-encoding chunked

12107692
put	get
however in this application i put an instance of an lrucache inside another cache class that i created in order to get the application more feasible

12107692
put	get
there is only one possible scenario where i can imagine that the oom will appear and that is if we download many really big images and before they get scaled and put into cache will simultaneously take up more memory and cause an oom

12107694
gridview	sqldatasource
i have dragged and dropped a gridview into designer and configured the datasource to new sqldatasource where i chose a image table

12107707
dictionary	map
you could use a dictionary to map row column names into indices

12107757
centos	linux
on my dedicated centos linux server my php cli has stopped working

12107769
cos	sin
update even if ilaenv were the same qr uses elementary rotations so it obviously depend on sin cos implementation

12107769
cos	sin
unfortunately no standard tells exactly how sin and cos should bitwise-behave they can be off a few ulp from rounded exact result and differ from one library to another and will give different results on different architectures compilers hardwired in x87 fpu

12107778
folder	directory
if anybody comes to this it s just because in sites all libraries mediaelement the file mediaelement.js should be not be in this root directory but you have to extract all the files and folder so mediaelement.js is in the build subdirectory so sites all libraries mediaelement mediaelement.js

12107841
awt	swing
swing programs should override paintcomponent instead of overriding paint . â painting in awt and swing the paint methods

12107844
getter	setter
i stuck on dot notation for setter and getter

12107883
folder	directory
no such file or directory - var folder v8 v8lbbdwcgjmntpbjrzgcfu+++ti -tmp- rackmultipart20120824-71301-1aqop0s

12107932
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
as uitableview is a subclassing of uiscrollview it inherited all of uiscrollview s properties including its gesture recognisers

12107932
uipangesturerecognizer	uipinchgesturerecognizer
uiscrollview declares a uipinchgesturerecognizer and uipangesturerecognizer

12107933
width	height
provide contentsize of uiscrollview in width and height

12107966
folder	directory
however this puts the uncompressed folder in the output directory

12107987
getter	setter
the first one is the getter it gets the ivar and the second one is the setter it sets the ivar

12107999
websphere	ibm
for example when developing connectivity to ibm websphere mq i just need to install websphere mq client which can connect to licensed mq server

12108025
getter	setter
a public field is not worse than a getter setter pair that does nothing except returning the field and assigning to it

12108025
getter	setter
an oft-mentioned advantage of getter setter pairs isn t

12108025
put	get	getter	setter
however adding validation to a setter is a change to its preconditions a violation of the previous contract which was quite simply you can put anything in here and you can get that same thing later from the getter

12108025
getter	setter
this same argument applies to other supposed advantages of these pass-through getter setter pairs if you later decide to change the value being set you re breaking the contract

12108025
getter	setter
if a class has these dumb getter and setter for every field then it is a class that has no invariants whatsoever no contract

12108025
getter	setter
if all the class has is those getter and setter it s just a dumb data holder and dumb data holders should look like dumb data holders

12108025
getter	setter
adding pass-through getter setter pairs to such a class adds no value

12108025
getter	setter
there are reasons to use getter and setter but if those reasons don t exist making getter setter pairs in the name of false encapsulation gods is not a good thing

12108025
getter	setter
valid reasons to make getter or setter include the things often mentioned as the potential changes you can make later like validation or different internal representations

12108083
submit	submission
on desktop browser everything works for submission submit button or enter key

12108092
int	chars
talking about memory structures if you have simple data structures like chars int floats use built-in array.array which is much more memory efficient than a list

12108097
google-chrome	firefox
if you only need to support google-chrome firefox latest version of ie you are usually better off with writing your own widgets tabs popups etc are all actually very simple widgets that can be implemented in 20 lines of code

12108130
google-chrome	firefox
the css3 specification allowing different origins for background-position is now supported in firefox 14 but still not in google-chrome 21 apparently ie9 partly supports them but i ve not tested it myself

12108204
width	height
and width height declarations in ie are the common causes of that sort of problem

12108231
getter	setter	erd	diagram
so to resolve that i m using visual paradigm for uml this software is not for free it needs activation key.but it offers a connection directly to your database just follow tools database reverse database then you create your entity relationship diagram finally just you click with right button of your mouse on the page of erd and choose synchronize to class diagram and automatically you will have your class diagram finally you can just add your setter and getter also you can export it to a lot of kind of format xml xls...

12108241
post	get
to get the selected state in post you can check the state property value

12108311
google-chrome	firefox
this script works only in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

websphere	ibm
i m very new to ibm mq i find out the documents or books related to mb are so few the only one i found is websphere mq using java written in 2004

12108419
int	double
so here p is double pointer to int and q is of type int

12108468
min	max
answer of above question will make my work easy because if multiple image upload in the order we select then it would be easier to choose one image for main profile image using min id or max id of given profile_id

12108482
width	height
say an image of 1px width and 20px height of size 1kb is repeated in an unordered list item of with 10px

they are empty if there is spaces my local thousend delimiter and if i have value like 15 45 i got 15 4500 instead

12108564
action-filter	onactionexecuting

12108612
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
take a look here it all works fine in google-chrome safari firefox

12108617
qplaintextedit	qtextedit
alternatively copy the example and derive from qplaintextedit yourself and don t use qtextedit

12108677
int	chars
use the string.indexof chars int method to search for starting at a given index in the string the last index that you found a chars at at the end of the previous e-mail address - or 0 when looking for the first address

12108792
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome display it correctly

12108818
strncmp	strlen
although the code you are using is not good but you can still get your expected answer by using strncmp giving the 3rd parameter the strlen of a common string variable

12108904
int	chars
usr include stdlib.h 712 error too many arguments to function â int system const chars â

12108917
mouse	keyboard
mouse and keyboard event

12108917
awt	swing
in the case that you use awt popup or mixing swing lightweight with awt heavyweight components then you have to look at swing utils by darryl

12108928
move	drag
on the frontpage you can drag icons to the trash by pressing them for a few seconds the trash pops up and you move them out of the way

12108979
oncreate	setcontentview	oncreate	findviewbyid	setcontentview	findviewbyid
so make sure setcontentview is done in oncreate before you call findviewbyid and make sure r.id.videoview1 is present in the layout that you have set

12109006
bsd	xnu
xnu s system calls are indeed following the bsd posix model but are a subset there are quite a few additional calls proprietary to apple - for example stack_snapshot #365 iopolicy 322 proc_info 336 and others

12109013
datamapper	activerecord
you can also consider some orm like rails activerecord or datamapper or sequel

12109018
m2e	pom.xml	maven-dependency-plugin	pom.xml	maven-dependency-plugin	m2e
this will remove the error and make m2e recognize the goal copy-depencies of maven-dependency-plugin and make the pom.xml work as expected copying dependencies to folder every time eclipse build it

12109027
sorting	filtering
also the original query has joins used for fetching data from other relations although they are not relevant for sorting or filtering

12109029
width	height
you have in chapter 3 a sample of how to calculate width and height and distance

12109054
rar	zip
it works well when implemented but only to download text files or some files with texts if i download an image or a docx or a a zip or rar or for that matter any file which is not text it fails it fails to open after downloading says invalid file

12109062
google-chrome	firefox
we ve got a really annoying layout problem on our site only in ie 7 8 tested firefox and google-chrome works fine

12109088
ccscene	cclayer
my first project is based on the kobold2d helloworld example and there i see that the layer is subclassed from cclayer instead of ccscene

12109088
ccscene	cclayer
i looked at some other examples doodle and pinball and there also cclayer is used and not ccscene

12109099
width	height
there is no width and height functions below is the corrected the code

12109106
daemons	systemd	daemons	launchd
launchd will enumerate and execute the daemons in systemd library launchdaemons and library launchdaemons for all users

12109160
post	put
the ids and names are created dynaically and may not be in any order or scale so an id maybe chk51 and the next one maybe chk205 appologies i should have put this in my original post

12109163
getter	setter
in that class there would be the hyperlink that has been scraped and a getter and setter

12109168
ccscene	cclayer
in kobold2d if your first class derives from cclayer instead of ccscene kobold2d silently wraps it in a ccscene object

12109181
implements	extends
this will allow anyone to extends your own abstract class and force them to implements these specific methods

12109198
width	height
anyway make more distance between your buttons add at least button width on x and height of button on y axis.

12109201
inherited	properties
as described by the docs on datagridtextcolumn.cellstyle the target type of the style must be datagridcell and as that class inherited from control we can add setters for dependency properties of control such as background

12109217
int	boolean
means as per i know boolean store as int 1 means either 0 or 1

12109237
viewdidload	viewwillappear
does nothing once the tabbar is showing if i put the line in the viewdidload viewwillappear it does work

12109252
maven	pom.xml
for the scm activity plugin since you use maven you need to specify the scm url in your pom.xml like this

12109345
min	max
i need to find min and max values in an array not taking into for possible nan values in this array

12109396
int	double
check the data type of your column height it should be a int or float or double and if it is amongs above run the following query

12109397
min	max
given that you re trying to find max min values you might want to try using instead of - that may well let you detect nan in other ways

12109474
folder	directory
when application is running in compatibility mode read write operations from to system folder are redirected to safe directory located in c users current user appdata local virtualstore

12109866
carrierwave	paperclip
the code above is for carrierwave but i tried to switch to paperclip and errors were the same

12109904
tex	mathjax
well the original tex code is stored by mathjax so you can use some javascript to put it back

12109932
octal	decimal
the reason you got 4680 is because in java source code a leading zero before a numeric constant indicates that the number is specified in octal and numbers are printed out in decimal

12109932
octal	decimal
11110 octal 4680 decimal

12109938
octal	decimal
so 1111 octal is 585 decimal

12110047
debian-based	ubuntu	debian-based	linux	ubuntu	linux
i m going to answer for the linux side of the house at least for debian-based systems such as ubuntu since it s more common for users at this point

12110219
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to write a cross-browser extension for firefox and google-chrome

12110219
google-chrome	firefox
firefox uses the commonjs specification and google-chrome just lumps everything into the global namespace like a webpage

12110224
int	chars
so i modified source from int to chars to see what is the problem about taking eof values.

12110224
int	chars
int type is 4bytes long so it can take 4 chars inside a variable

12110238
x-ua-compatible	user-agent
it s sad but adf do adds x-ua-compatible tag based on msie property in user-agent header

12110238
x-ua-compatible	user-agent
in which you can determine ie engine version by trident property in user-agent and set an appropriate x-ua-compatible tag

12110252
folder	directory
the best practice for this is to create an images directory in your webroot the folder with index.php and use the base_url function to get the link to the image i.e

12110265
put	get
however if i put it in a function then i dont get that error

12110281
distance	pdist
then i get the distance from everey point to every other point with pdist when the distance is 1 its is a connection we want to draw

12110309
int	chars
so i modified source from int to chars to see what is the problem

12110309
int	chars
the last question is chars type is one byte long and int is 4bytes

12110309
puts	putchar
long stored and how does putchar puts an entire string

12110376
launch4j	jsmooth
there are developers that also use jsmooth or launch4j for native launchers

12110410

in your code the f objects are the pathnames for file system objects either files or folder in the directory denoted by the string dirname

12110441
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade its code so it functions with the new wordpress versioning

12110447
hash	hmac
for additional security you can hash them with a keyed hmac hash and verify that hash to make sure that the token came from your server

12110452
fflush	gets
because none of these events or listeners are documented i don t know if this event gets thrown in other situations besides fflush so there s a potential it could create false audit entries

12110478
gridview	sqldatasource
i have several gridview and repeaters bound to sqldatasource using stored procedures

12110480
int	chars
why int and not chars

12110480
int	chars
when you pass it an int it is implicitly casted to chars

12110480
int	chars
if the number in the int fits in the chars all is good and nobody notices anything

12110541
udp	tcp
rtsp over udp works well but i need it over tcp

12110601
rss	feed
i am trying to get the rss feed of a site as xml and trying to display it but i am geting syntax error my whole code is as

12110604
rss	feed
i am using rss feed generated from wordpress blogs to fetch some information

12110604
rss	feed
wordpress is just too good in providing comprehensive information about a post and it is quite easy to extract number of comments for a post in rss feed

12110604
rss	feed
now the problem is that i didn t find any way to get number of comments from rss feed generated by drupal and joomla blogs

12110623
children	parent
the former selects all descendant para elements that are the first para children of their parent

12110648
button	checkbox
2 disable checkbox radio button selection of that row

12110667
jax-ws	jax-rs
most web service stacks at least in jax-rs and jax-ws do not enforce schema compliance by default

12110669
vmware	virtualbox
they re all running windows server and i would like to run a program in all these machines not by copying and double-click executing but by using some vmware api to do that just like virtualbox sdk

12110716
google-chrome	firefox
basically if i rightclick in any browser and choose to view source the code won t show up even though i can clearly see the content on the page tried on ie firefox google-chrome

12110716
google-chrome	firefox
if i use the inspect element feature of google-chrome firefox i can however view the code

12110831
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
we saw it happen on google-chrome safari and opera

isotope	masonry
with isotope you have masonry plus much more functionality while it is similarly easy to implement

12116760
isotope	masonry
but because of layouting masonry isotope which is the whole purpose here you can not have bleed at all sizes - for that you d need to code boxes with fluid widths also which can be done with some extra effort

12116784
textview	imageview
step #2 create your own pagerindicator implementation probably based on the library s tabpageindicator that uses imageview instead of textview .

12116848
outputstream	inputstream
i think you need to provide an inputstream containing the image in the response.ok out not an outputstream

12116848
outputstream	inputstream
your jax-rs framework would read the bytes from the inputstream and put them onto the response it wouldn t be able to do anything generically with an outputstream

the trouble is that you need to save the value from getchar â in an int â because you are reading two chars for each time you increment the count

12116938
int	chars
the reason you need to store the result of getchar in an int and not a chars is that it can return every possible chars value and also a distinct value eof

12116938
int	chars
if you don t use int you store direct into a chars one of two things will happen

stdout	stderr
the usual solution is to use nohup or exec the scripts with stdout and stderr redirected to dev null or nul in windows but this often has issues

12117252
put	get	post	get	post	put
i can solve it by throwing get out of the window and just put everything in a post body as a jsonobject mapped with jackson and problem solved

12117252
post	get
but then i m using a post to fetch data while a get should be used in pure rest to fetch data

12117258
stdout	stderr
to do this redirect both stdout and stderr to dev null then background it

12118047
listview	gridview

the dropbox folder is probably within the home directory of the user so to save some time you could limit your search to that

12118282
getter	setter
you can always hide all of the messy syntax behind getter setter functions but if the structure is large then that method will not be very maintainable

12118287
folder	directory
one option is you could go searching for the .dropbox.cache directory which at least on mac and linux is a hidden folder in the dropbox directory

12118315
put	get
i feel like i m missing something obvious to get this work but i can t put my finger on it

12118339
uiview	uiwindow	uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
another alternative is to use a raw uiview in your main uiwindow directly placed above your normal view controllers without a uiviewcontroller

12118362

integer	unsigned
i want to convert a floating point value to a 16-bit unsigned integer without saturating wraparound overflow instead

12118920
viewdidload	viewwillappear
but i realized that even if a physical ipad 2 is rotated to landscape mode self.view.bounds is in viewdidload and viewwillappear

12118920
viewdidload	viewwillappear
if the table is created in viewdidload or viewwillappear using self.view.bounds then the table ends up being 768 points wide and is meant for the portrait mode

12118921
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
the webforms for marketers modules is a module that provides a gui for non-developers to design forms with textboxes dropdownlistfor checkbox etc.

12118967
hide	show
user selects a value with mouse or arrow up down key to show hide a layer on page

12119015
post	get
i need visitors to be able to get back to the originally requested url like www.mysite.com page or even www.mysite.com page post from the m.mysite.com splash page view full version link

12119086
mef	prism
prism contains guidance for both mef and unity

12119091
folder	directory
so i need to create a script that automates the process of building the initial project which depends on other 3rd party jar files residing in its libs directory and creating an obfuscated jar file the .class files from the 3rd party jars don t necessarily need to be obfuscated which can then be copied over to the libs folder of the dependsoninitial project

12119126
mouseout	mouseleave
this is just the difference between mouseleave and mouseout and is expected behaviour

12119132
fseek	ftell
and by the way i am aware of fgetpos fsetpos and ftell fseek but this is not a duplicate

12119132
fseek	ftell
that question asks about ftell fseek and the answer is not applicable to ftello fseeko

12119174
fseek	ftell
in a call to fseek or fseeko on a text stream either the offset must be zero or whence must be seek_set and the offset must be the result of an earlier call to ftell on the same stream

12119182
rvm	bundler
because you re not managing your gems through gemsets like rvm or rbenv will do for you the default version of rake became 0.9.3.beta.1 instead of the version installed by bundler 0.9.2.2

i m trying to place a series of jlabels at specific x and y coordinates on a jpanel and set its height and width too

draw your graphics on the canvas then scale and translate the canvas itself using css properties not the width and height attributes of the canvas which will clear it

12119352
nsstring	nsdata
it won t be a string but that s fine because an nsstring in cocoa represents a sequence of unicode characters while an nsdata represents a sequence of bytes which you could easily store wherever you want including in a database

12119354
width	height
it has a width of 100 and a height of 300px

12119360
getter	setter
assuming you mean that it auto-generates an ivar and getter and setter methods for you even if you omit the synthesize this is variously called default property synthesis automatic property synthesis and property autosynthesis

12119360
getter	setter
if you don t explicitly synthesize a readwrite property and you do include both an explicit getter and an explicit setter then again clang will not automatically generate an ivar for you

implements	extends
it s more flexible to work with interfaces because if you have bedroominterface and livingroominterface then you can have flatinterface implements both interfaces then flat101 implementation class implements flatinterface instead of extends from flat then implements an interface

12119367
implements	extends
option 2 is to have flat101 extends from flat then flat implements bedroominterface and livingroominterface

12119391
implements	extends
you can not extends more than one class but you can implements more than one interface

12119417
rss	feed
drupal does not provide a default method for customizing the core rss feed

then after you get a post back from paypal or whatever you could read the cookies from the user s request

12119453
stdout	stderr
a c# app is still an app so as long as its a console app and supports stdout and stderr you shouldn t have any particular trouble capturing the output to stdout

12119466
hide	show
otherwise there is an another option like presentmodalviewcontroller and u can also use hide show view while showing dialog in your original view

12119526
hide	show
in your tableviewdidselectrowatindex method on selection of row just show the particular custom view which contains details of selected row and at that same time hide the table view so u can have the view that u want

12119526
hide	show
and make a back button on that custom view and on that button action hide your current view and show the tableview again

using xcode 4.4.1 and my ipad 3 running ios 5.1.1 i m able to use the core animation and time profiling instrumentation on third-party apps

12119539
keydown	keyup
one way to filter the omnibox s false event out would be to check that every keyup has a pair keydown

12119539
mouse	keyboard
remember to use your mouse to focus on the omnibox and type not a keyboard shortcut

12119582

12119677
min	max
the column in the min or max function must be an indexed column

12119677
min	max
update 2017 06 23 recently this has been updated to say that a query containing a single max or min might be satisfied by an index lookup allowing for things like arithmetic

12119677
min	max
however they still preclude having more than one such aggregation operator in a single query so min max will still be slow

12119677
min	max
queries that contain a single min or max aggregate function whose argument is the left-most column of an index might be satisfied by doing a single index lookup rather than by scanning the entire table

12119682
put	get
you can put that method in your model class and use that in template to get the type of file

12119700
free	malloc
every malloc need a free so you ll need a similar for-loop to free all the inner mallocs

12119701
free	malloc
you need to call free as many times as you called malloc and on the same addresses which was returned by malloc

12119702
free	malloc
for every malloc there must be a free

12119702
free	malloc
you need to iterate in the same fashion as the malloc loop but call and then free tree0 afterwards

width	height
fprintf fp width d height d x co-ord d y co-ord d n s width height pt.x pt.y szenter

12119871
margin	height
this 100 height is what makes your content push the footer to the bottom of the window and then the footer worms its way back up into the visible area using a negative margin which is why you need to know the height of the footerâ the negative margin must be the same height as the footer element

12119911
backslash	double-quotes
just found out that double-quotes can be escaped with backslash

12119939

awt	swing
swing runs on-top of awt whose underlying event-dispatch thread may be in the process of shutting down too

12120365
awt	swing
trying to use swing or awt while shutting down can lead not only to dead locks but also may just not work at all anyways

12120469
post	get
but that doesn t look that nice if you want a rather long message plus get has size restrictions where post virtually hasn t

12120478
post	get
the controller takes care of all the web requests get and post

12120499
google-chrome	firefox
i have write some js code which is working fine on google-chrome and firefox but not working on ie 8 or 9

chat is an important aspect of mmorts games and i am thinking of using node.js and socket.io or nowjs for this

12120505
nowjs	node.js
so my front runners are node.js for server side javascript possibly with nowjs to implement chat redis for key-value store backbone.js for the mvc framework mustache or maybe linkedins fork of dust for templating and jquery of course

12120516
width	height
lets say we have a div that has some fixed height and width

12120536
uploadify	plupload
so if you need to support ie lower than 10 you could upload the file to the server using some of the existing ajax upload components uploadify plupload valums ajax upload bleuimp ... generate and store a thumbnail on the server and send the url to the saved image to the client using json so that it could display it using an tag

12120564
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i ve got 4 uinavigationcontroller in uitabbarcontroller

12120564
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
at the start only first uinavigationcontroller with root uiviewcontroller initializes but other 3 initizlize only when i select them

12120565
getter	setter
both the setter and getter are referencing themselves causing the stack overflow

12120622
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
im am pretty sure that the uinavigationcontroller together with their root uiviewcontroller are instantiated as soon as you load the uitabbarcontroller from the storyboard

12120658
range	minimum
i have a vector containing the minimum and maximum of 3 range i.e

12120814
apache	lighttpd
apache and lighttpd have the same feature

12120862
exponent	modulo
rsa_key needs exponent and modulo so my question is how can i create rsa_key object from single char buffer the public key

12120862
exponent	modulo
however my question is exacly how to get modulo and exponent from a public key with format thats the bytes representing the public key

12120862
int	chars
ohh i forgot first column is the byte position second column is the byte value typecasted to int 3th column is again value but int unsigned chars so i can see if its +127 4th colums is the hex representation of the value and the last column is chars based on ascii table if its visible chars

12120871
google-chrome	firefox
first of all i would inspect the image request in a network tab of google-chrome firefox

however when i use it on a webp image that has transparency it seems that it can t get this info at all returns -1 for both width and height

12120903
calloc	malloc
note i replaced the calloc with malloc simply because i never use calloc so i m not sure whether it tries to play alignment tricks

12120904
super	self
now reading through the code i set the self to the super init hence self is now pointing to super

12120967
super	self
and yes itâ s very good to realize that self and super both point to the same object as noted by driis

12120969
sbt	spray
however i cannot have them working it seems that the sbt configuration of spray has changed quite a lot since this documentation was written

12120978

in the glulookat function and then in a view matrix we put -zaxis or we can write that and then in a view matrix we put zaxis to get the same result

12121001
super	self
both self and super point to the same data structure in memory namely your object that you have allocated

12121001
superclass	subclassing	super	self
in other words slightly simplified super treats the memory location as if it were an instance of the superclass the type you subclassing often nsobject while self treats the memory location as a regular pointer to the type you have defined

12121001
super	self
if you print super and self in the debugger you will see they point to the same memory location

12121013
restrict	shared
given the object-behavior of postgresql i don t think you can restrict access to either function definitions in compiled environments that s not source code though but would include which shared object files the routines are in or type definitions and that includes table structures

12121014
put	get
after you ve put all your objects in you can use values to get the objects in proper order

filtering	grouping
imho using the having clause should be efficient because there would an additional pass on the worktable that contains the grouping results on top of which the filtering criteria is run in the second case

12121189
put	get
the simplest way to get your code working is just put one line in view did load method as follow

oncreate	findviewbyid
because of this order any attempt to access the views of the fragment in the activity s oncreate method using findviewbyid produces a nullpointerexception as the fragment s oncreateview only gets called after the end of the activity s oncreate

12122624
oncreate	onstart
basically i have been forced to put the problem code in the activity s onstart method instead of oncreate as onstart happens after the fragment s oncreateview

12122719
opengl-es	glkbaseeffect

realloc	malloc
malloc and realloc relation how does it handle when the required space is not available in memory

12122751
free	malloc
consider this as memory blocks assume that 01 to 06 has been used by malloc func 07 and 08 are free and last 2 blocks i e 09 and 10 are being used by memory of other programs

12122756
unsigned	short
false making wchar_t a typedef to unsigned short which makes

12122756
unsigned	short
functions overloaded for both unsigned short and wchar_t like the

12122775

usually most mom call themselves brokers such as rabbitmq activemq qpid etc

12122854
post	get
then you will get the post ordered by your ordinalposition

12122898
mvp	presenter
the key of the mvp pattern is to separate the concerns between the view and the presenter

12122954
inherited	subclassing
when the runtime calls mybase.print it can easily check the inherited of the classes and see that subclassing has overridden the print method and calls the subclassing implementation

12122956
int	double
the solution is to use input.nextline after getting your int and double in order to swallow the eol token

12123055
free	realloc
if size passed is zero to the realloc function then it will just free the old memory block and return null

12123055
free	realloc
realloc ptr 0 is equivalent to free ptr

12123057
min	max
it s c++ no need for any macros especially not those that are already given as functions to you by the standard it always bothers me when including and getting complaints about their stupid min and max macros

ethernet	wireless
a the ethernet cable from say a cable modem connects to your wireless router wan port and then wireless router sends out radio waves which your laptop catches

12123163
ethernet	wireless
so the wan port of one of the routers will connect to the cable modem same as a and from that router s ethernet ports usually there are 4 ethernet ports on a wireless router ethernet cables will connect to other routers ethernet ports and now these routers will send out radio waves which your pc catches

12123976
mouseleave	mouseenter
the textfields come from a custom class that extends jtextfield and uses an overriden paintcomponent method along with a mouselistener so that when mouseenter on a textfield area the gradient color slightly changes and changes back again when mouseleave the textfield

12124016
equals	compareto
so in theory it is possible that a class in the jdk had a compareto not consistent with equals

12124247
folder	directory
there could be many files and the directory structure inside public folder can vary

12124253
super	extends
if you add the same attributes accross all your controllers you could consider adding them in a super controller a spring controller can extends another controller without problems

12124257
super	extends
but note that interfaces don t implicitly extends any super interface or class unlike classes which implicitly extends the object class

12124342

for-loop	loops
when you declare j this way it s scope is limited to the for-loop and it isn t usable outside loops

12124386
for-loop	loops
if you want to continue to use j after that for-loop declare it outside loops

12124389

here is the difficulty by assigning the prototype to child we get one more object parent that doesn t do anything in our code just shares its properties with children

12124409
bluetooth	usb
the device will stream digital data from these sensors over bluetooth or usb

12124419
multibyte	substr
but modern high-performance substr search algorithms traverse strings in multibyte steps

you should use the jquery library to access the show and hide functions

12124452
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
generate a hash of the counter and the salt say md5 counter + salt

then when a coupon code is received we extract the counter and hash the counter + salt and compare it to the hash found in the code

12124463
equals	gethashcode	inherited	properties
the equals and gethashcode methods on anonymous types override the methods inherited from object and are defined in terms of the equals and gethashcode of the properties so that two instances of the same anonymous type are equals if and only if all their properties are equals

12124472

12124519
getter	setter
i would use the angle as object and degree and radian as different getter setter for the same internal angle value

12124525
oncreate	ondestroy
maybe the problem is you have overridden oncreate and ondestroy but you are not calling the super.oncreate and super.ondestroy

12124589
width	height
how to copy paste range of cells with preservation of cells properties values row height width for instance

12124589
width	height
rows columns height width differ from their original values

12124590
g++	gcc
you re probably compiling with gcc instead of g++

12124590
g++	gcc
the actual compiler is the same but g++ tells the linker to use the default c++ libraries were gcc only tells it to look at the c libraries

12124594
g++	gcc
also you need to compile this with g++ and not gcc

12124604
public	protected
i can speculate though as to the cause of your problem it is likely that you are using this colormap or its type as a public or protected member of a public ref class or that you are using it in some way that its type ends up being the type of a public or protected member

12124614
vaadin	wicket
as far as measuring like feedback there are services such as sharethis such that one could integrate with roller at the presentation level - perhaps using wicket or vaadin at that same application level

12124751
put	get
get the next 200 000 rows from the text file etc and put into excel below previous data

12124777
equals	gethashcode
the works because the implementation of equals and gethashcode for anonymous types works on the basis of field-by-field equality

12124777
equals	gethashcode
if we do change it we can change it for just equals and gethashcode or for them and also

12124777
union	distinct
very often with linq groupby as we saw above but also distinct union groupjoin intersect sequenceequal todictionary and tolookup and often with other uses it s not like we weren t doing the things linq does for us with enumerables in 2.0 and to some extent before then anyone coding in 2.0 would have written half the methods in enumerable themselves

12124777
equals	gethashcode
the default implementation of equals and gethashcode has an optimisation that let s it use a binary match in cases where it s safe to do so

12124932
move	drag
as the nodes are move that is .on drag the code that calculates the hulls is fired

12124936
integer	fractions
i know that fractions of the form 1 pow 2 n with n an integer can be represented exactly in floating point numbers

12124940
inherited	subclassing
static methods are not inherited and not overridden by the subclassing

12124942
folder	directory
ideally this directory should be located outside of your drupal root folder

12124944
width	height
i m trying to position a view in my framelayout but the view gets positioned in the topleft corner with the given width and height

12124968
keydown	keyup
this can be done with little trick with keydown and keyup events a flag

12124973
rational-numbers	base
a rational-numbers x can be exactly represented in base n if the prime factorization of the denominator of x contains only primes found in the factorization of n

12124977
inherited	properties
instead they inherited the default value of auto for both properties

12124981
for-loop	arrays
with the help of excray s comment i manage to figure it out the answer what we need to do is actually write a simple for-loop to iterate over the two arrays that represent the train data and test data

12124982
integer	fractions
where 1.m is a binary fractions and e is a positive or negative integer

12125017
xpages	lotus

and simply probes for a minimum of three letters in a range

12125022
mouse	keyboard
now what i want to do is when the user select some index for example index 1 in the listbox and only if he clicked enter with the keyboard or clicked with the mouse left click it will call use the function parseanddisplayxml

12125042
equals	gethashcode
override the equals and gethashcode on menuitemaction and each time you want a collection of distinct items- use the set collection

12125121
folder	directory
after some inspection i came to the conclusion that eclipse isn t putting the .class file on correspondent folder in the ouput directory it s simply ignoring it

12125130
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
this suggests that the tab bar is a subview of the main uiviewcontroller which contains an array with 4 uinavigationcontroller one for each tab

12125130
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
when a tab is pressed the main uiviewcontroller removes the currently visible uinavigationcontroller from its view and adds the new one as subview

12125130
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
they probably use one uinavigationcontroller with the main uiviewcontroller + tab bar as rootviewcontroller

12125143
client-side	server-side
anyway what i m trying to do is generate input fields in the server-side code bound to observables on my client-side code then set the initial values of the observables through the value of the hidden fields

12125209
punctuation	words
the function currently adds spaces after punctuation removes spaces before punctuation and capitalizes the first words of each sentence

12125210
iboutlet	ibaction
i m not sure what you re asking but by ibaction and iboutlet for a button is definitley possible

12125211
width	height
my tiles are all squares with a size of 40 by 40 pixels so this constant is used to help calculate anything that needs to be adjusted by the image s width and height

12125274
floating-point	fractions	floating-point	integer	integer	fractions
expressing the representable numbers using an integer times a power of two rather than the more common fractions significand simplifies some number theory and other reasoning about floating-point properties

12125297
width	height
i m guessing you ve got your width and height of the canvas set to less than the rectangle s dimensions

12125301
udp	tcp
is it possible to send complete tcp or udp packets including headers and etc programmatically

12125303
bash	tcsh
despite the comments there s no direct problem with tcsh and believe me i m no fan of c shell nor is there a problem with bash per se

12125303
bash	tcsh
the problems would be similar in fact if you replaced the tcsh with bash

12125303
bash	tcsh
in the bash script you are trying to create a single string that will contain a valid command line that tcsh will interpret correctly including preserving spaces in arguments

12125334
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
an implementation might decide to implement realloc in the most primitive way by doing an unconditional malloc for a new memory block copying the data and free -ing the old block

12125349
free	realloc
for example if a particular implementation uses different pools per object sizes realloc may actually allocate a new block in the pool for smaller objects and free the block in the pool for larger objects

12125364
int	double
columns of j don t evaluate to consistent types for each group result for group 4 has column 1 type int but expecting type double

12125381
bash	tcsh
you would need a instead of your on the tcsh side just like on the bash side

12125381
bash	tcsh
so to correct your assumptions in your original script it is not tcsh which receives only a single argument from bash but it s ls receiving only a single one from tcsh

12125387
google-chrome	firefox
vertical and horizontal alignment and height percentage not working correctly in firefox although it works fine on ie and google-chrome

i ve tried using push pull with no success

12125421
google-chrome	firefox
i tested both with firefox and google-chrome and the behavior is the same

12125467
accessor	properties
to implement ifeature a class must have a decimal properties called price with a get accessor like the garden class above and the pool class below

12125475
pop-up	dialog
the reason you don t see the loading dialog is that you call a blocking function in your gui thread main thread.when you set your dialog to visible you should let the gui thread to keep running so it can draw the dialog on the screen.moreover after 5 seconds that the gui thread is blocked the user will be presented with force close wait pop-up

12125492
dbcontext	objectcontext
assuming that myentity is your objectcontext or dbcontext you could bind to the local property of the dbset which is an observable collection that supports sorting

12125532
hide	show
in the following code on click of the button i want to hide the relative layout rl1 and show rl2 but my app crashes down after on button click.what am i doing wrong

12125544
hide	show
a possible solution is to use the hide and show functions they don t modify the dom

rss	feed
i ve made myself a class that reads rss feed and returns them to my main class

12125588
rss	feed
i m assuming it s because that s how long it takes for the application to request the rss feed network latency and so forth

12125598
post	get
this code only works if i do a simple post or get request

12125655
integer	fractions
for numbers it does so by chopping off the fractions portion numbers that do not fit 32-bit integer range loose more than just the decimal portion

12125778
boost	stl
i d prefer an stl compliant circular buffer like for example the boost implementation

12125841
postgresql	mysql
it s like offset x limit 100 in mysql postgresql query or top 100 in mssql

12125882
int	double
median trips up data.table because --- even when only passed int vectors --- median sometimes returns an int value and sometimes returns a double

12125882
int	double
but then right away or in your case in group 4 it gets passed a value of type double which won t fit in its int results vector

12125917
min	max
if it did cause more than one sql call again i d be surprised then try max or min instead of first

12125948
keydown	keyup
as there does not appear to be any modifier information in the event args you could keep track of the state yourself in some fields and handling both keyup and keydown to update them accordingly

12125950
put	get
if i don t put cvwaitkey i get the same error i get when writing video frames with avfoundation library without using

scipy	scikit-learn
the scikit-learn library refers to the scikit-learn package specifically this method for calculating a graph laplacian from a sparse scipy matrix

12125964
cos	sin
if so just take the arg to sin cos to be 0 to complete the loop

12125970
button	marquee
you could use the rectangular marquee tool cut out the button you want then create a image based off the button you just cut out

12125993
chunked	transfer-encoding
during testing we discovered that some of their clients expect the response to always be chunked transfer-encoding chunked

12126015
width	height
i am familiar with the absolute positioning centering techniques when you know the height and width left 50

12126016
cobertura	jenkins
since this is possible for other coverage tools like cobertura via a jenkins plugin you could either

12126029
uiviewcontroller	uipopovercontroller
create a property to hold a uiviewcontroller and another one to hold a uipopovercontroller

12126042
post	get
you will get a typeerror object has no method objectat if you try to get the json data for the post model using approach 1 and you will get typeerror cannot call method objectat of undefined if you try to get the json data for the embedded model using approach 2

12126059
gentoo	linux
i ran across the following in gentoo linux s wiki about dynamic jumphost list

12126077
mouseover	mouseout
.hover allows you to bind mouseover and mouseout simultaneously but you can also bind them separately

12126083
jlabel	jlayeredpane
i need to move a number of jlabel around on top of a jlayeredpane dynamically

12126107
int	chars
so instead of printtext chars chars int

12126176
width	height
dynamically get width and height of .hiddenbox and properly position it using technique you are familiar with

12126176
width	height
but in this example you need to know the exact width and height of parent container .hiddenbg in your case it won t work with units

12126224
concurrenthashmap	readwritelock
my best suggestion would be to use a readwritelock but as you specifically state that you don t want to use any locks btw concurrenthashmap will probably use them internally you could try the following

12126243
centos	linux
i tried to stick with one flavor of linux but have somehow gotten into centos fedora and amazon linux mix

12126251
rss	feed
i m wondering if it s possible to create some kind of feed that will automatically notify me whenever that variable is changed from its current numbers because rss or at least page2rss is incapable of doing that

12126251
rss	feed
if this isn t possible an alternative method is the facebook page i found the rss feed for it but that feed doesn t include wall posts by other people even if i add everyone to the end of the url which is a problem because the author currently posts to the page from his own facebook account when he updates the site

12126254
google-chrome	firefox
the problem in google-chrome but not in firefox when moving the mouse cursor along the black div there is a whole area in which the cursor goes back to default and click events aren t triggered

12126261
postgresql	mysql
i m looking for examples of current systems plugins to existing databases mysql postgresql mongodb etc or specialized databases of limited functionality

12126270
int	chars
here you declare a function named printtext which expects three inputs two chars and one int and has not outputs void

12126270
int	chars
this printtext function needs a chars array a chars and an int as its inputs

12126270
int	chars
note that the inputs given here are two strings or chars arrays and an int

super	implements
the gem is super easy to implements

12126320
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in google-chrome however in firefox and ie i was getting mysterious extra padding seemingly coming from nowhere as you can observe here

12126320
google-chrome	firefox
the other weird thing which you can observe in the fiddle i linked is that the clearfix on the bottom which is not necessary in the example but is on my site also picks up the margins and applies them in firefox and ie but not in google-chrome

12126321
free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
if you don t want to rely on glibc s memory management function malloc ... you could roll your own memory management library and force your process to use it with a ld_preload trick that way you could define a malloc calloc realloc free using sbrk implementation matching your own requirements

int	double
the original index the int must be attached to the double that was in that location in the original vector so that you can recover the location

12127500
int	double
note that if you sorted only the double within the pair then the value of the int would be the location in the array.

12127500
int	double
create a single vector of int that is initialized with values in the range where n is the size of the vector of double

12127500
int	double
then sort the vector of indices using a comparator functor that instead of looking at the value int passed in will check the value in the original double vector

12127502

the only way i manage to get hold of this information is using qtkit and quicktime via tcgetcurrenttimecode on qtmedia of the timecode qttrack

12127526
put	get	post	get	post	put
there is no way you can actually stop is behavior people have removed the back button disabled it but the user would still have controls from short cut for any browser my suggestion would be that for all those pages where you want the users to be logged in put them on a post method instead of a regular get use post

12127526
post	get
it is a bit crude using post where get might work but it solves this issue of yours

12127567
post	get
as to how to get around this problem unfortunately i don t see a clean way of doing it at the moment if anyone does find an elegant way to handle this please post it

12127611
put	get
you also define the syntax and parse rules in one file when using antlr with flex and bison you have to create .l and a .y .ypp files which can get really confusing when it comes to know what to put in each

12127646
hash	md5
you might be able to guess what the plaintext of an md5 hash is by using a rainbow table or brute force guessing but it is expensive and not really what you re looking for

12127726
superclass	subclassing
via the use of abstract methods and final methods on the superclass they allow you to restrict the manner in which your class is subclassing which can be useful in a wide variety of circumstances see also the template pattern

min	max
32 20 20+20 40 min 23 max 32

12128181
min	max
45 24 24+18 42 since 42 40 so here min and max will be same that is 43

12128181
min	max
56 6 24 +10 +6 40 so here min 45 and max 56

12128181
min	max
then first key of the map from where the calculation started and he key where exactly it reaches to 40wilkl be choosen as min and max also explained above

12128181
min	max
besides this care need to be taken the at if sum reaches more than 40 then we have to ignore it and taking the previous value itself as min amd max in tha case min and max will be equal

12128199
post	get
i am able to use ajax get method to post data to a php page but i have a problem adding more parameters to the post method

because 1 3 is rank 1 in the list dates the set called rp1 is retrieved combined with response days for the items in the set jim and fred and the median is calculated

12128369
hide	show
if you want to make it such that clicking the button show the popup if it is hidden and hide it if it is show and clicking anywhere else hide it it s this block of your code that is causing the issue

12128396
width	height
this means that you can ask identify to print out width and height for the first page of a pdf with this command which you should have no problem to translate into php syntax

12128405
put	get
the trick then is how to put the right data in the data section so that you can send get variables to the curl script but ill let you solve that if you want a ruby sinatra example here is one

12128409
ubuntu	linux
he said sometimes you need to restart it in some linux systems like ubuntu for it to work again

12128413
getter	setter
i think having an abstract class for your objecttype with appropriate getter setter methods might help

12128420
hide	show
that is on a click on the document check if the target source element was your button if so show the popup otherwise hide it

12128420
hide	show
that is prevent clicks within the popup from bubbling up such that they don t reach the document-level click handler that does the show and hide

12128434
switching	screens
i am in a process of optimizing item renderers that display a character in a rect i notice that the action of dynamically setting the text is slow now i am thinking of creating premade objects with text hard-coded in them and inside the item-renderer have a switching to select the proper text object instead of using does anyone have any other idea on how to optimize the renderer it is a tile layout that displays about 100 renderers on screens

12128444
mouse	keyboard
along with the usual mouse keyboard messages and apis windows also has various techniques and apis eg a href rel nofollow raw input for getting input information defining additional input devices and i think also associating additional information with messages and one of those techniques might be more appropriate here

12128462
cos	sin
i m porting some code from matlab to c++ and discovered that matlab s sin and cos functions produce slightly different results from the sin and cos functions in the c++ library

12128462
cos	sin
to eliminate these differences i would like my c++ code to call the sin and cos functions from the fdlibm 5.3 library which is what i think matlab uses for sin and cos operations

12128528
for-loop	arrays
a think it will be good idea to make an arrays of 10 boolean values and every time your button has been pressed - you just need to toggle corresponded value in your boolean arrays and update your label using for-loop

12128545
postgresql	mysql
additionally there is nothing similar to the rowid in sql server or mysql in postgresql it would be ctid

also if want to do more interesting work in curses and before calling the embed_kernel function then i can t see the text which was printed to stdout or stderr by that function

12128697
accessor	properties
if you don t synthesize the properties with synthesize in the implementation file the compiler doesn t generate accessor methods automatically in this case you have to write accessor methods on your own or you will not have them

12128697
accessor	properties
with the new version of xcode 4.4 the compiler will generate automatically accessor methods even without and synthesize statement for properties

12128741
getter	setter	int	boolean
standard java bean convention is to name your properties your int and so on with camelcase so markquiz rather than mark_quiz and your getter and setter as getmarkquiz and setmarkquiz the 1st letter after get set is now capitalized for boolean properties use isxxx rather than getxxx

12128900

this method should work in array of chars or int but does not work in array of strings

12128934
for-loop	arrays
then i tried to use for-loop and wanted it to stop when reaching total number of string elements in arrays stored in count variable

12128937
typedef	struct
our c programming god linus torvalds strongly encourages not using typedef for struct except if there s an explicit need for hiding the actual fields and type behind an opaque struct as it diminishes readability

on the main activity you extends fragmentactivity and implements the interface mylistdialogfragment.ondlglistclick

12129114
post	get
at first glance this seems like a logical choice use dapper or another other micro orm s for get and nhibernate for any post action methods on controllers

12129114
post	get
to tidy this up you could utilise the post redirect get prg pattern so get controllers use dapper and post controllers only have access to nhsessions

12129114
post	get
now your get and post action results would look like this -

12129125
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	informix	informix	ingres	informix	firebird	ingres	postgresql	ingres	mysql	ingres	firebird	ingres	oracle

12129942
cos	sin
two you want the sources to match the c++ standardâ s specification for declaring sin and cos

12129942
cos	sin
otherwise you may have to modify the sources to wrap the sin and cos definitions inside the std namespace or otherwise modify the sources

12129942
cos	sin
you can simply compile the source file s containing sin and cos to produce an object module or modules then link that object module or modules with your other object modules

12129942
cos	sin
if you wish you can instead create a library put the object module s with sin and cos into the library and link the library with your object modules

12129942
cos	sin
another note about linking when you supply your own sin and cos the linker has two implementations to choose from your implementations of sin and cos and the standard library implementations of sin and cos

12129942
cos	sin
usually standard libraries are linked in after any user-specified files so merely specifying your object module or library will suffice to ensure your sin and cos are used not the libraryâ s sin and cos

12129947
getter	setter
in addition to synthesizing getter and setter if necessary implementations auto-synthesis will also synthesize an instance variable prefixed with an underscore

hash	salt
if it exists use process above with saved salt and given password and check if it equals stored hash

it s very odd behavior...i wonder if it has something to do with headers that are passed along as when i try loading the api url in google-chrome unsupported api...or if i do same url in firefox works just fine

12131975
width	height
i suspect the other reason the image is coming out small is because you are drawing the image using pixels for the height and width of the drawing but drawimage uses points which will make the image appear much smaller if you use the pixel measurements

12132033
temp	tmp
if not defined temp set temp tmp

12132033
temp	tmp
if not exist temp set temp tmp

12132477
isotope	masonry
use the masonry layout inside isotope

12132484
screens	tablet
normally i d just let the content respond to the pixel resolution of the device however a 1280px layout on a 4.3in screens just doesn t look right especially since my application deals with a lot of form elements which on a phone you want to span the entire width but on a tablet or desktop you do not

12132842
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter

12132873
post	get
i used firefox s firebug to get the header and data to post

12132885

implements	extends
however such complexity can be implements on the top of the thread thus extends the oo paradigm and not being in contrast with it

12132957
int	chars
i need it to read chars and int since usernames consist of that

12132967
swing	windowbuilder
when you go new other windowbuilder swing designer jframe than name your class you should get this

12132989
int	chars
also you should to store a value as int instead of chars and read it in appropriate way

12132999
fadein	fadeout
now in your loop you add 6000 times fadeout fadein and delay

12132999
fadein	fadeout
unlike the other snippets you here add the fadein and delay in the fadeout callback - after all those 16000 other items which are already in the queue

12133023
hash	salt
first you add salt to the password then you pick a hash algorithm say sha512 or perhaps a newer algorithm that is designed to be inefficient for this very purpose and hash it say 10 000 times then store it in the database

12133045
google-chrome	firefox
yeah interesting google seems to send back random unsupported api responses if the request is missing the cookies that the browsers tested with google-chrome and firefox are including with requests to the inofficial weather url

12133048

i am using this javascript jquery to hide a part of my page and show a new part

12133056
bionic	glibc
if you have code that needs to behave differently depending on whether it s linked with bionic or glibc this can and must be determined at compile time

12133056
bionic	glibc
bionic and glibc aren t binary compatible anyway so you need to commit to one set of headers at compile time

12133062
spaces	delimiter
however the -t option defaults to using any whitespace as a delimiter which does not work for the data i have it contains spaces and tabs

specifies a margin in percent of the width of the containing element

12133192
width	margin
the contained div s vertical margin is exactly that of the width html and not the container div unless i change the contained div s position to absolute as well

12133192
width	margin
therefore i was wondering if the margin is affected by the document layout and if it only takes the width of the containing element

12133222
width	height
yes even though it may seem counter-intuitive vertical percentage margins are relative to the width of the containing element not the height

12133223
width	margin
in css percentage values of margin s both vertical and horizontal margins -- as well as padding percentage values are always calculated relatively to the element s containing box s width

12133238
stdout	fflush
in this case fflush means send to stdout

12133256
vagrantfile	berksfile
i ve included some snippets from my setup there s more to the berksfile and vagrantfile of course but these are the relevant bits. the only truly tricky part is that the local name of the chef-rbenv cookbook has to be rbenv if you want to use any of the off-the-shelf recipes that include other off-the-shelf recipes from the cookbook as it refers to itself as rbenv

12133317
width	margin
the css 2.1 spec says about margin â œpercentages refer to width of containing blockâ block not element

12133318
google-chrome	firefox
note i tested it on google-chrome and firefox browser

12133331
width	height
the - 6 on both width and height accounts for the small gap between the window and the taskbar and is easily customizable

12133336
mouseover	mouseleave
i have jquery ui datepicker inside the slider which is working on mouseover leave and each time i try to pick a date it register mouseleave event because datepicker has been appended to the bottom of the page and its not in the div which is firing hover events

12133352
mouse	keyboard
well sendkeys is for simulating keyboard input and not mouse input

12133352

edit i played with your code and i was wondering if it might not be a solution to use a key press handler instead of click handler so users would be forced to use keyboard to fill the form instead of mouse click

12134036
ubuntu	linux
ideally the solution should be platform independent and should work on both linux ubuntu and windows server os

12134066
int	double
this is generally okay for value-types like int double float and even for immutable reference types like string

12134085
public	protected	inherited	properties
in first case when you use class it s inform xcode that you will be using coredataclass somewhere and you will #import header for example in .m file in second case you re inherited from coredataclass you will get access to all public and protected properties

the hours control the height and the minutes rounded to the nearest five control the width

12134299
width	height
i have put a test alert to show me the text it should be putting into the window.open method and this looks fine - in fact if i copy and paste the text from the alert into the code and re-load the page then the height and width both work perfectly

12134328
realloc	malloc
if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc

12134328
realloc	malloc
the function realloc only works correctly for null or values obtained from malloc realloc

12134333
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
if realloc doesn t get a null it will try to expand memory starting from that location or may try to free and malloc another part of memory

12134583
realloc	malloc
there are those who argue it is better to use malloc for the initial allocation and realloc thereafter

12134583
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
there is some justice to the suggestion not least because you probably wouldn t use to free the memory even though you could do so so you don t really need malloc or free because realloc can do all three operations

12134583
realloc	malloc
but the c90 standard requires realloc 0 new_size to work equivalently to malloc new_size and i know of no c library that behaves differently but there might be some

12134589
getter	setter
such code also has an abundance of getter and setter because the data objects are too dumb to do anything by themselves

youtube	vimeo
note that there is no guarantee that it is a youtube or vimeo link

12135248
post	get
i am building a php script which requires me to forward the post or get string that was sent to this script to the next one

12135255
hash	md5
this means that it requires substantially more work for an attacker to brute-force bcrypt hash versus md5 ones

12135255
hash	salt
in either case you should be sure to salt your hash

12135255

google-chrome	firefox
hard to explain why google-chrome is unsetting the cookie but it s google-chrome s behavior that appears to be aberrant not that of firefox

12135445
client-side	server-side
storing that info on the server-side is probably more common with the client-side only given his the session cookie

12135451
getter	setter
i would then make setter getter for all the relevent information you need to get and update

12135472

12135555
post	get
i have read the documentation here on static file implementations and various stack overflow post here here and here on setting the background image but i still can t get it to work

12136250
mongodb	bson
the short take is that you generally do not have to worry about the same category of string injection problems as an sql injection because the requests sent to a mongodb server are in an object format bson rather than a string format like sql

12136905
maven-failsafe-plugin	maven-surefire-plugin
the includes for maven-surefire-plugin are defined like test testcase whereas maven-failsafe-plugin are defined with it.java it .java or itcase.java

12136905
maven-failsafe-plugin	maven-surefire-plugin
so you don t need to define includes for maven-surefire-plugin or maven-failsafe-plugin use the defaults

12136956
persistent	transient
it may be because the table field is declared as transient so that it s not part of the persistent state of the hashmap object

12137629
min	max
if your answer is 1 the solution is pretty straightforward a greedy search for all numbers whose length is the same as your min and less than or equal to your max you can then parse the matches and filter based on the min and max ...if its one of the others then your solution is going to be a bit more complicated you are basically going to have to create a sliding window to evaluate all the possible combinations in the string

getter	setter
with _yourproperty you access the instance variable with self.yourproperty its getter setter

12137751
getter	setter
as long you are sure you have no costumized getter setter both is the same with a very small performance penalty for getter setter

12137751
getter	setter
however in general you should use the getter setter approach except in getter setter themself in case you will change your code later

besides the actual hashing phpass transparently generates random salt when a new password or passphrase is hash and it encodes the hash type the salt and the password stretching iteration count into the hash encoding string that it returns

12140178
hash	salt
when phpass authenticates a password or passphrase against a stored hash it similarly transparently extracts and uses the hash type identifier the salt and the iteration count out of the hash encoding string

width	height
you can put width and height attributes on the image so that it maintains its size even if no image is in the element

12142783
width	height
if the dimensions of the images changes i would leave off the width and height attributes in the html

12142783
width	height
instead when you go to change the src attribute in jquery first add width and height attributes to the img tag for the size of the image so that the element will maintain its size

a further optimization would be to store the min max and update the two values during each insertion step

12143904
google-chrome	firefox
i am not sure google-chrome has that option like firefox has

12143952
maven	pom.xml

12144201

problem is that when the slider is working properly i cannot use a show hide onclick event such as

hide	show
using trial and error i have found that commenting a few lines of js on the html page allows the show hide functions to work but then the slider is broken

12144222
children	parent
that is possible because branches are linked to streams which are organized following a strict hierarchy a parent stream children streams

popover	tooltip
namely twitter bootstrap does not automatically initialize popover or tooltip on a page

12144586
popover	tooltip
for performance reasons the tooltip and popover data-apis are opt in

12144586
mouseleave	mouseenter
i believe the performance considerations originally in mind came from the fact that prior to 2.1 the popover plugin was by default triggered by mouseenter and mouseleave events which are certainly not something you want to be constantly processing for an entire page

12144654
bindparam	bindvalue	bindparam	pdostatement	pdostatement	bindvalue
if you don t need the ability to keep the variable in sync with the bound parameter before the query is executed which is the case 99.9 of the time in my experience it s probably better to simply use pdostatement bindvalue instead of pdostatement bindparam

12144675
google-chrome	firefox
also if you re using firefox google-chrome you will be redirected to the default error view under views shared error.cshtml if you re using ie you ll get a generic http 500 page cannot be displayed

i am guessing that to get the reportng report to show up on the generated site it would have to put an html page in target site like the regular testng report is

12145182
post	get
like they suggest in that answer i would suggest doing some sort of server side processing of the data most likely in a post over a get

in this case your class named subclassing uses the unit class through composition not inherited

12145672
superclass	subclassing
as such the unit class knows nothing about subclassing or superclass or any of their properties like the test property

12145672
superclass	subclassing
since your unit class needs to access many properties of subclassing and or superclass you might want to just pass an instance of subclassing to unit

12145681
int	chars
first remove non numeric chars just to get the int numeric value

12145710
filtering	grouping
it s particularly useful when you need to filtering something based on something like the result of a aggregration grouping by

12145724
width	height
if you are using the wpf version available in the wpf toolkit probably the most convenient way to hide the legend is to set the width and the height in the chart.legendstyle to zero in xaml

12145724
width	height
in order to re-display the width and height need to be set to non-zero values

12145729

i ve tested the sample on firefox and it s a bit slower than google-chrome but usable

12150271

change process priority and or processors affinity

12150599
affinity	processors	cpu	processors	cpu	affinity
now i know you said you that the whole system hangs so this might be tricky impossible.....one thing you could try is lowering the process priority on your process and or set the processors affinity before it gets to the hanged state...this should give you a better chance to load your debugger on the same machine because in theory your stopping your process from monopolising the cpu so much

12150606
google-chrome	firefox
works in firefox 14 google-chrome 21

12151617
post	get
if you want to follow up a post with a get to something explaining the result the 303

12151677

rss	feed
i designed an algorithm that i think will be optimal for large rss feed and i wanted to check it and get the o notation on it from this group

12152081
rss	feed
also is there maybe a better way to do this when the rss feed is say 500 000 entries

12152108
errai	guice
the errai documentation says it uses guice internally however i need that my guice module recognizes the errai one

12152127
disk	ram
sql server will use whatever ram is dedicated to it to keep things that it accesses frequently in ram rather than on disk

12152127
disk	ram
the more you run the same query the more the data that would normally be found on disk is likely to reside in ram instead

12152137
public	protected
on closer inspection it looks like you ve done this at least partially because you ve reversed the normal convention which is to have parameters to functions not use underscores whereas private protected storage should use underscores but otherwise should have the same name as the public property

gmail	hotmail
setting up spf and dkim to add trust for mail hosts hotmail gmail etc.

mousemove	mousedown
now simply setting greaterx lessx etc back to false is not enough because the mousemove event checker inside of mousedown is still active

12152371
mousemove	mouseup
so the next step is to separate the mousemove event function into it s own function i used mousemovehandler for the name and remove the event listener using .removeeventlistener type listener usecapture inside of mouseup

12152398
soundpool	audiotrack
you may obtain better result using audiotrack instead of soundpool at the cost of more code on your side

12152442

int	chars
you are not converting a chars to an int and comparing you are slicing off a part of an int treating it as a chars then promoting it and comparing it

12152652
width	height
i know of the -vf scale filter such as -vf scale -1 320 but that only takes the width and scales the height accordingly

12152824

hi i am new to android and i m building my first app.i ve implemented a listview which contains an imageview a textview and a spinner a drop down list .i populate the spinner with data dynamically the thing is that every time that the spinner is empty the list behaves accordingly though this doesn t happen if there is at least one item in the spinner.if the spinner is not empty the onlistitemclick function for the list is never called as if i never clicked it.i fill the spinner on the getview function on my implementation of the adapter i use for the list i don t know if it s relevant i mentioned it just in case

that is ok - i don t want to set the axis min max ticks manually as the range of the data may vary greatly

12163439
versioning	upgrade
there is no indication as to what versioning of php you are using but i would suggest an upgrade immediately

12163447
google-chrome	safari
gwt thinks your ie8 is a safari you probably have google-chrome frame installed and your page or server sends the appropriate bits to activate it

12163450
windmill	mechanize
alternatively you can look at mechanize or windmill or if you also require javascript code to be executed phantomjs

12163488

when i try to set current time and i use my america phoenix timezone i get a value that is at 9pm when the eastern post should expire i get

12163499
screens	tablet
i believe it s a good idea because using different xml layouts based on the current screens size and orientation can make the app more usable and reduce the need to release multiple versions of your app if you plan on releasing your app for both phones and tablet

12163558
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox it works just fine the problem comes up when i m using internet explorer so far i ve only checked 8 9

textview	imageview
make sure that newview just returns a blank view meaning no values for textview or imageview have been set

12163702
factors	mean
it can be composed of other distance functions say you use the harmonic mean of the euclidean distance maybe weighted with some scaling factors and a categorial similarity function

12163739
google-chrome	safari
it runs a headless webkit safari and google-chrome s browser engine and capybara tells it what to do

12163742
width	height
create a bitmap context the same height as your view but twice the width

12163742

the image you will draw will have the proper width and height but the bytesperrow will be 2x more on that

12163802

12163821
rss	feed
i m building a rss feed of my website using jquery and the link element keeps returning blank

12163888
width	height
the first one is defined by the viewbox which contains x and y coordinates for the top-left corner and a width and a height

12163888
width	height
the second one is defined using the width and height attributes or style properties

12163888
width	height
then since you want the image to be displayed as 50mm wide and 25mm high you set the width and height accordingly

12163888
width	height
for browsers if you re defining the viewbox you don t need to specify the width and height explicitly since by default the area defined in the viewbox is displayed pixel per pixel

12163975
jobs	cron
point #1 you should use cron jobs to schedule your tasks and use a database table to keep a history of the jobs that actually ran start time end time result etc. that way you get much more accurate reporting

12163983
implements	extends
i want to extends linq s datacontext class to implements the orm

12164037
google-chrome	safari
fisrt of all your fiddle does indeed not work on the iphone either both in safari and google-chrome

12164188
factors	matrix
doing the second part will require you to use matrix scale type and set scale to 1.0 and transform factors to 0.0

12164317
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox and it will most likely work in google-chrome too but haven t tested it

12164332
opera	safari
he states that the tel protocol is supported by almost every mobile device including safari on ios android browser webos browser symbian browser internet explorer opera mini and low-end devices browsers

12164467
google-chrome	firefox
facebook button not display am getting an text only in google-chrome but it works in firefox

12164478
google-chrome	firefox
after inspecting the test in ie 8 9 and seeing its results look like those of firefox i think there s an explanation for the google-chrome results i m pretty sure google-chrome webkit has a better optimization in the first version of the test especially the parseint part which gives a better result for parseint there

12164494
int	chars
the compiler interprets unsigned as unsigned int you should specify unsigned chars like this

12164511
int	chars
it s weird you are sizing your array based on unsigned int size instead of unsigned chars one

12164517
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
for example in opera and firefox images loading very quickly about 1 sec in ie about 3 sec but in google-chrome it is loading very slow

12164519
int	chars
because it looks like you really want unsigned int as your type instead of unsigtned chars

12164519
int	chars
of course this assumes you really want unsigned int and not 1-byte unsigned chars

12164520
width	height
if left is larger than body width or top is larger than body height

12164521
boost	allocator
my use case is using boost pool in a high-performance server that will run all day long with lots of allocator and deallocations throughout the day

12164547
portrait	landscape
okay so it turns out that simply adding the following to the flash embed code will make it render only in landscape mode preventing it from switching to portrait mode and appearing stretched.

12164622
hide	show
we have a lot of code that show and hide ui elements based on the user actions.most of it is repetitive we are to blame ourselves for this one

12164665
draggable	droppable
i use the jqueryui draggable droppable functions

12164737
pull	push
i may make changes and push the changes back to origin mybranch and then pull the changes back on to other lab machines

12164770
google-chrome	firefox
i tested this on my w7 computer at home in google-chrome firefox and ie with no issues

12164796
width	height
the jquery implementation of the selector visible requires both the height and the width to be set to 0 in any ancestors in order to fail

12164814
textview	imageview
textview - 40 of width layout with imageview - 30 of widht layout with imageview - 30 of width

12164837
integer	fractions
then you recompute the new frame by using that value divided by 0.7777 to get some fractions value that when scaled by 0.7777 returns an integer

12164867
firefox	safari
this happens in safari as well and in firefox it happens but almost to an unnoticeable degree

12164904
prng	random
on freebsd the prng that supplies data for dev random uses the yarrow algorithm which is generally regarded as being cryptographically secure

yet you can use gson from google or jackson to do this..

12165090
dependencyobject	uielement
like wpf visual or uielement or dependencyobject --- the microsoft s design is therefore flawed here a bit too

12165120
prng	random
it is indeed normal for random numbers to come up imperfectly distributed with a good prng

12165138
post	get
but seeing that many people may find this post because they can t get pygame to install on mountain lion i will be posting a solution here

12165167
puts	gets
in the first piece of code the code gets 5 characters and puts it in buffer5

12165167
put	get
however because you press enter a newline character isn t put into the stream when calling get so the program will terminate and will not ask you for another round of 5 characters

12165524
hide	show
currently i want to create a simple show hide function with 2 drop-down list

12165535
width	height
i would recommend to just use opengl s standard orthographic projection function which allows you to define the top bottom left right instead of just width and height and as such you can flip the y axis any way you want

12165571
put	get
in any event when i put this into ielm i get

12165593

inherited	subclassing
protected members can be accessed by the subclassing of the class that has the protected member outside the package.... by the law of inherited ...

12165726
superclass	subclassing
usually a superclass declares defines methods that are common to all the subclassing

12165726
superclass	subclassing
and if any of the method should not appear in the subclassing then it should be private to the superclass

12165726
inherited	subclassing
and if method is common to some of the subclassing but does make sense in other subclassing es then it probably does not belong there and should be declared defined somewhere down the inherited heirarcy

just use std istream getline which behaves the same as std istream get but also extracts the delimiter if this is why it stopped reading

12167848
put	get
you will note this is not quite what i was looking for - i am trying to get the legend on the border of the well div not on the fieldset itself because this is a nested form there could be multiple fieldsets within one well so i can t put the border on the fieldset itself

however when i switch to the java project open the main class make sure the cursor focus is in the main class and run it with run run as my run config no output shows up in the console stdout or stderr

12172050
for-loop	arrays
in your code before the for-loop you know the number of buttons so you can initialize the arrays length

12172076
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
what finally worked for me was setting box-sizing content-box for the textarea - drupal 7 defaults this to border-box which causes the padding and border width to be subtracted from the size of the textarea

12172137
hash	salt
however i felt that all the passwords are still dehashable with access to both the hash and the salt

12172193
getter	setter
with that said your code is partially encapsulated as you have a private int with a public getter and setter and a private getter which i see no purpose in but that s up to you

12172193
getter	setter
however string name is public and has no getter or setter

12172193
subclass	abstract-class
when modifying a method which must be in an abstract-class the modifier denotes that the abstract method must be defined in any subclass implementation

12172261
getter	setter
also the idea behind having getter setter combo is to provide a controlled way of accessing the properties of that class

12172261
getter	setter
so for each private property of a class you would would have public setter and getter method

12172281
setinterval	clearinterval
as you re using setinterval for repeating time so to clear that timer you need to use clearinterval

now i want to profile or rather count how many times the get and put methods have been called in my program

a profiling performs instrumentation on all or a subset of the classes loaded by the profiled jvm to perform exactly what you need count and measure all of the method invocations without a single line of modified code

12172565
happy	alex
since you do have a grammar you might prefer to use happy and alex which will give you a much more lexx yacc-like experience

12172565
bnfc	parsec
an interesting project might be to adapt the bnfc to produce an ast of parsec combinators to represent a grammar but i suspect this would be a non-trivial task

12172597
tcplistener	networkstream
i ve written a small server component in .net 4.0 that uses the tcplistener socket networkstream and serialport classes all of which are in the system.dll assembly v4.0.30319

12172626
google-chrome	firefox
but in firefox ie8 and google-chrome the table is rendered like

12172903
put	get
no need to save mapview drawing cache as bitmap.this will be cleared by android very soon so you have to put a layout over mapview and get drawingcache bitmap from it

punctuation	words
the b is a words boundry so there must be a words boundary space punctuation new line start of string end of string etc before and after the match

12173118
put	get
however if you are making a call directly from browser for this you cant put it in header neither in body because it is a a get request

12173118
post	get
instead of get call use a post call by putting this search in separate form in your page and use https on top of that

12173118
put	get
if you want to use get request you have to put the parameters in headers make a search page when user hits the search button make ajax call to above resource by passing it into header using https call

12173638
post	get
i m pretty sure it s the redirect_to back in your dataload model which must be redirecting to customer new but keeping the same http action a post instead of a get hence the routing error

12173638
put	get
i don t think you should have a redirect there redirects are the territory of controllers but wherever you put it you ll probably need a 303 status code to force a get

12173638
post	get
if you are using xhr requests other than get or post and redirecting after the request then some browsers will follow the redirect using the original request method

12173824

12185288
innodb	myisam
if you use both myisam and innodb - flush + lvm snapshot + file-level copy might work for you

12185370
width	height
rather than supplying the source s width and height as the last two parameters you should specificy the width and height the cropped result should end up with

12185370
width	height
if all you want to do is crop a tenth off the left and top simply subtract the offsets from the original width height

12185383
width	height
for example if you want your background to be black height 20px and width 20px you would do

12185394

12185512
post	get
because each time you send a form you can use the post or get

12185546

i would like to specify a different loading image depending on which orientation portrait or landscape the ipad is in

12185665
floating-point	fractions
you re expecting fractions - floating-point - results from your calculations but they re all using integral values so you ll lose the fractions parts

12185665
integer	fractions
since this is integer division the fractions part is truncated

12185666

firefox	safari
my problem is that when i make the y-axis tick labels really long and accordingly increase the padding size of the svg elements with css part of the tick labels get cut off in firefox 13.0.1 yet not in safari 6.0

12185757
firefox	safari
increasing the padding size of the svg elements prevents the cutting off of the tick labels in safari 6.0 but not firefox 13.0.1

12185761
firefox	safari
safari and firefox are styling links by snagging the url via attribute selectors check in web inspector for specifics but i m guessing it s something like this which you can override by setting

12185777
portrait	landscape
however after i have added a landscape page and try to add a portrait the landscape is shifted back to a portrait and the whole formatting of the document breaks

12185807
wakelock	powermanager
from the discussion in the comments above it would appear that you need to acquire a partial wakelock from the powermanager

12185822
width	margin
we re simply subtracting the margin from the width and adding the margin to the left offset so it still lines up

12185824
width	height
however when i go to re-open it again for a second time the width and height are out of scope and the ui dialog looks different

12185961
folder	directory
renaming moving file folder involves just one replacement replacing with will rename directory ghi to klm and move it to the directory c abc

12185966
int	chars
this will let only values allowed by xs int be valid with the additional restriction that the first chars must not be a zero

12185976
post	put
if your rest clients put post resources in msgpack format the rest server can still read this message and update create the resource

12185976
post	put
if your rest clients put post resources in pdf format my guess is you won t be able to extract all the information you need to create update a resource properly

or you can just make your int into double or floats

12186024
post	get
that will never work you cannot get a model it has to be post puted

12186039
margin	height
with flexibleheight and flexibletop it means that when the parent view frame changes it will maintain the bottom 100 pixels fixed and split the remainder proportionally between the top margin and height

12186039
margin	height
so if you go from 400 height to 300 height on the parent it means it will use 100 for the bottom margin and split the remainder 200 proportionally leaving your y 66.666 and height 133.333

12186039
margin	height
if you go from 400 height to 100 height it will still use those 100 for the bottom margin leaving 0 space for top margin and height leaving your y 0 height 0

an alternative is to check out youtube sdk for php - these are pre-written libraries that contain the post and the get bits for you

12186787
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome do not support avi format but the strange thing is if you just drop a avi file into the browser it plays just fine

12186807
free	malloc
raw memory allocation deallocation mechanism behind is typically the same as the one used by malloc free

12186807
free	malloc
standard library implementation of raw memory allocation deallocation functions can actually directly call malloc and free

12186817

the code works on firefox safari google-chrome and ie8+ but not in ie7

12186841

the core sass math is fairly simple but compass comes with a load of helpers including sin and cos functions

12186980
puts	gets
instead of the default sync method with deletes puts c i ll have to use gets and posts to do the crud operations

12186993
hash	md5
files uploaded to amazon s3 that are smaller than 5gb have an etag that is simply the md5 hash of the file which makes it easy to check if your local files are the same as what you put on s3

12186993
hash	md5
my local file has an md5 hash of 702242d3703818ddefe6bf7da2bed757

12186993
hash	md5
i also suspect that the new etag before the dash is still an md5 hash but with some meta data included along the way from the multipart upload somehow

12187053
getter	setter
using the symfony2 entity genenerator it added me some getter and setter to my entites which look like this

12187116

you should at least post some code and say why it isn t working if you do try this and get stuck

12187129
ccscene	cclayer
however i have tried every possible target including the sprite itself the batchnode self cclayer and the current ccscene and nothing has worked

button	checkbox
at least for me also in the html i have elements checkbox radio button dropdowns etc. in which the user can select values

12187216
background-color	outline	background-color	transparency
defining a background-color will prevent the black outline artifact from occurring and including the dximagetransform.microsoft.chroma as part of your filter will make anything in the element which has that color transparency

12187216
background-color	transparency
it is important to not choose a background-color which will match any content color or this will be made transparency as well

12187232
getter	setter
i have read some about the use of getter setter in object oriented programming and many resources such as this suggest that they should be used very infrequently

12187247
post	put
setting this option will fake put and delete requests with a http post setting the x-http-method-override header with the true method

12187250
width	height
specifying width and height is fine but as soon as you specify left and top - then switch from relative to absolute positioning you get that jump you re seeing

12187257
hide	show
hide just hide the window it can be show again

12187269
ubuntu	linux
currently i m using linux ubuntu but i will certainly be working with windows soon if that s an information needed to answer that question

12187375
nswindow	nsscrollview
the nsscrollview fills the nswindow and the custom nsview fills the nsscrollview

12187375
nswindow	nsscrollview

12187487
hash	md5
i m basically trying to create an md5 hash of input parameters sorted in alpha order per the fastspring api

12187495
getter	setter
that article is describing that you should use methods instead of property getter setter

12187495
getter	setter
properties with both getter and setter provide an interface that both update state and query state

12187495
getter	setter
one of the other problems with properties is that people habitually add both getter and setter simply because it is a property

12187495
getter	setter
the ability to get or set a property may not be necessary and simply adding both a getter and a setter by rote creates and interface that requires testing and maintenance that may not ever be needed

12187505
put	get
it is better to get the value once and put it into some temporary variable

12187509
fiddler	charles
i already use charles a nifty https proxy app similar to fiddler and it is essentially what i want except that it s packaged up in an app

12187540
mouse	keyboard
however when i right click the mouse the appbar shows up and it steals away the focus of my app so now all the keyboard events are not doing anything

12187570
getter	setter
getter and setter are not evil they just shouldn t be generated automaticaly for every attribute

12187576
post	get
i have a music blog and would like to duplicate all my post to facebook but i can t get the api to post streaming audio like i can when i post manually

12187577
getter	setter
getter and setter methods also known as accessors are dangerous for the same reason that public fields are dangerous they provide external access to implementation details

12187581

post	get
i ve tried the following code from various other post which should rule out certificate issues but i still can not get this to work

12187646
width	height
lets say you want to shrink your bitmaps width to 1 2 and increase its height to 2 times of the original

12187646
width	height
now if you have another your actual scaled bitmap or an imageview what you want to compare to the original then you can use this to get the width and height use getwidth and getheight

12187653
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval are supplied by browsers outside of the proper javascript language which provides an external means of access to the language like event execution

12187759
post	get
the main concept of this code that i made a page where you can rate a thing and that thing has got hidden values that i need to get in post format because this is the only way that i can decide which button has been pressed to do the mysql query in the second php file without refreshing the current one

12187769
int	chars
the try-catch is pretty important because the string could contain chars that cannot convert to int ofc you need to catch it better than this but keep it in mind

12187777
inherited	subclassing

12187857
width	height
in php i will pass it top and left coordinates and width and height of the jpg

12187857
width	height
in otherwords what ever part of the jpg is outside the png border s gets cut out and the resulting image is the png overlaid on the jpg at the png width and height

12187881
width	height
you can either move the item off-screen requires display absolute display relative or set the flash object to be 100 size of containing html element and to set the height or width of that element to .01px

12187889
interpolation	splines
pyxplot has an interpolation command see for producing functions which interpolation data from files for example by linear interpolation or a splines fit

12187924
ssl	https
the only difference https makes is that you have to speak ssl instead of plaintext

12187933
hash	salt
i felt that all the passwords are still dehashable with access to both the hash and the salt

12187933
hash	salt
salt slows this attack down in that it has to be done separately for every password instead of pre-calculated over all at once but modern hardware can calculate hash so fast now that this doesn t have the deterrent value it once did

12187947
serializable	deserialization
is a popular networking framework that has json serializable deserialization built in

12187947
serializable	deserialization
the core data base object has an associated with it which has the method which should make it easy to write serializable deserialization methods without having to write explicit code for every class and attribute

12187947
serializable	deserialization
i find core data to be heavy and complex for most of my needs and typically write local storage and serializable deserialization using the protocol

12188006
getter	setter
i have seen some projects jsoup for example are using this new getter setter naming convention

12188006
getter	setter
instead of old getter setter convetion

12188031
getter	setter
without getting into a discussion about when if to use getter setter in general it s better to stick with the naming convention because there are fewer surprises that way especially when you re integrating with third-party libraries or frameworks that expect things to be named according to convention

12188033
gif	png
the supported types might change by manufacturer and version though you can usually count on png jpg gif

12188130
post	get
i want to get blog post which has certain tags associated with it

12188139

12188183
comparator	comparable
in classes that implement ievaluator i get the following warning when calling comparator on the values of map type safety the method comparator object belongs to the raw type comparable

12188183
comparator	comparable
similarly the ievaluator instance does not need to know anything about results that is evaluating except that they are of the same type and that they are comparable ievaluator implemetations need to be able to call the comparator method.

12188222
put	get
but these functions get put and del still need to access the common objects functions found in a so i need a reference to a but i don t know how this can be achieved

12188222
put	get
and that would be used in those get put and del functions instead of this

this contains a value such as amd64 for 64bit and i386 or x86 for 32-bit systems

12188273
implements	extends	comparator	comparable
whenever i implements comparable or extends comparator i always do something like this

12188273

12188297
getter	setter
also you need to declare public setter getter you just can t get set any private variables that you have in your code

12188330
tostring	string.format
string.format doesn t complain if you pass it too many arguments so i could probably just pass a big array of integers which could get unboxed to d or tostring ed to s and look for format exceptions

12188358
apache	nginx
the wiki page also includes instructions for configuring your self-hosted web service to run behind an nginx or apache reverse proxy

12188388

since you are not gmail hotmail or your users email provider you cannot have from otherdomain.com and then deliver the mail via mail.yourdomain.com - this will most likely move your mail to the spam folder

if you need to provide properties for maven on command line talking about system properties which are slightly different from maven properties you can also use plugin to provide these properties in your pom.xml or in separate properties file

12195770
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
box-sizing border-box is most useful when you can t specify an exact content width based on the margins borders and padding of a box because you don t know in advance and can t control what these values are

12195770
width	border-box
in your first example if you didn t know how much padding was in the box or how thick its borders were making it use the border-box model allows you to just set width 50 to ensure that the box will always take up 50 width of its container regardless of borders and padding

12195780
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
in the first example you re setting width to 50 plus some border but due to the presence of the property box-sizing border-box

12195780
box-sizing	border-box
without box-sizing border-box

12195783
primes	modulus
for a 32-bit modulus the question is a bit academic your primary aim in choosing p and q is to make the product hard to factorize but finding the primes factorisation of a number smaller than 2 32 is so easy that there s little point worrying about the sizes of p and q in this case

12195783
primes	modulus
for something more realistic like a 1024-bit modulus then yes you re pretty safe choosing two 512-bit primes p and q at random that is choose p and q uniformly from the set of all primes in the range

12195783
primes	modulus
of course if you do choose two 512-bit primes you ll end up with either a 1023-bit or a 1024-bit modulus

12195825

if it is stored what it is doing now nh clears the list in the database and removes the children from the parent

12196033

12196134
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
following examples and tutorials for getting a php application up and running with amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk and getting errors when i try to push

12196206
getter	setter
it also lets you offer a getter while not offering any setter then your field is read only from outside the class

12196226
width	height
actually when we use padding in our div elements on vertical and horizontal basis its add the padding in total width and height

12196233
getter	setter
what you can do is define getter and setter methods

12196235
background-image	background-size
as we all know using background-size cover makes the background-image automatically scale perfectly on the browser s viewport

12196256
serializable	deserialization
a better approach i think would be to reorganize your data structure before serializable and after deserialization

12196338
google-chrome	firefox
i have seen mozilla firefox or google-chrome doing the above without any issues

12196361
tcplistener	tcpclient

pains me to post this i cannot get it and been at it for sometime

12196486
imperative	declarative
here s an analogy to get you started on declarative vs imperative

12196486
imperative	declarative
although this is almost exactly how you would solve this particular problem in an imperative programming language we re talking about styles of calculator just now and the first way of doing it with the old calculator is much more imperative step-by-step in style and this with the new calculator is in a much more declarative just-say-what-you-mean style

12196486
imperative	declarative
these aren t examples of imperative or declarative code but an attempt to show you the differences in style of thinking and programming

12196486
imperative	declarative
i ve talked about trust because someone who read a draft of this said trust was important - she explains she uses the calculator the imperative way because she doesn t really trust it if she does it in the declarative way

12196486
imperative	declarative
it sounds from this that it would be much easier to use declarative styles all the time but there s usually a steep learning curve for declarative languages and most people prefer imperative

12196486
imperative	declarative
traditionally there was a huge difference in speed imperative has fewer overheads because it s more directly like the computer works but some more modern compilers of declarative code seem to be in the top few of the speed tables a lot of the time - compiled verses interpreted makes a much bigger difference than imperative vs declarative which is why python etc are often slower even though they re imperative

12196505
mouseleave	mouseenter
nb hover isn t a valid javascript event too it s a jquery one so it needs 2 functions one for the mouseenter event and the second for the mouseleave so you should use mouseenter instead

12196511
width	height
1 first am calculating the width and height of the phone

12196513
width	height
and i want it to increase its width and height respectively but origin should have from center

12196517

12196538
post	get
you can t redirect to paypal with a post only a get

12196547

12196563
mp3	wav
i did a lot of research regarding transferring a custom sound clip wav mp3 etc to an ongoing gsm voice call in android so that the other party can hear it but it seems it cannot be done

12196618
width	height
right now i would only suggest adding some layout attributes like width and height to your viewpager

12196622
width	height
you can increase the width height as per your requirement image will come in the center

12196631
getter	setter
seems you declared priority as long and getter and setter methods are using float

12196661
sqlconnection	sqltransaction
the above three methods used to get argument which are necessary for connection such as sqlcommand cmd sqlconnection conn sqltransaction trans commandtype cmdtype

12196700

the thing is on my vps provider s cpanel i have the rsa and dsa host key fingerprints listed as something like

12196703
freebsd	linux
so far so good this is an reliable approach working perfectly on linux or freebsd

12196704
lisp	smalltalk
in some languages lisp smalltalk this is a non-issue

12196765
width	height
when we increase image width while increasing the top - left corner of image remains constant and width increases towards right corner same height increases towards bottom

12196765

he want to increase height and width from center not from rhs or bottom

12196801

12197013
width	height
window.open formpopup width 400 height 400 resizeable scrollbars

google-chrome	firefox
this may be simple way to know that the browser is not using ie google-chrome or firefox

12197072
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
sometimes opera still uses the old and cached style which means that you should avoid opera and use google-chrome mozilla or safari

12197072
google-chrome	safari
reload f5 will be sufficient on google-chrome mozilla or safari

12197084
textview	imageview
i have to display video image title and description for which i have created a layout with an imageview and two textview .i am able to display the video list

12197085
actionscript	mxml
additionally it becomes much more readable and there s no mix of actionscript and mxml

12197085
actionscript	mxml
because your collection is declared as public it makes difference whether to use actionscript with or using mxml

12197085
actionscript	mxml
btw a general recommendation for cleaner code is to separate actionscript completely from mxml

12197085
actionscript	mxml
for instance in my projects i create a separate actionscript file for each mxml component in the form

12197109
temp	tmp
the bug report filed for this issue was closed as by design it seems the intermediate directory should not be temp or tmp or any subdirectory of those

getter	setter
getter and setter are abstraction wrappers around your object implementations

12197381
getter	setter
also getter without setter allow you to create read-only properties and protect internal members of the class from inadvertent and possibly destructive modification

12197405
getter	setter
getter and setter methods are accessor methods meaning that they are generally a public interface to change private class members

12197405
getter	setter
you use getter and setter methods to define a property

12197405
getter	setter
you access getter and setter methods as properties outside the class even though you define them within the class as methods

12197405
getter	setter
there are some advantages to using getter and setter methods such as the ability to let you create members with sophisticated functionality that you can access like properties

12197405
getter	setter
even though getter and setter methods are useful you should be careful not to overuse them because among other issues they can make code maintenance more difficult in certain situations

12197414
width	height

even though getter and setter methods are useful you should be careful not to overuse them because among other issues they can make code maintenance more difficult in certain situations

12197488
getter	setter
when you write classes you are always encouraged to make as many as possible of your instance variables private and add getter and setter methods accordingly

12197488
getter	setter
in this situation you might create a private instance variable and allow a getter method only for the counter variable which means users are able to retrieve the current value only by using the getter method and they won t be able to set new values using the setter method

12197488
getter	setter
creating a getter without a setter is a simple way of making certain variables in your class read-only

12202471
equals	gethashcode
with reference types we start with both equals and gethashcode referring only to identity

12202471
equals	gethashcode
when we re very likely to care about some other way of considering two objects of a type to be equivalent we override equals to make use of it and gethashcode to correspond

12202471
equals	gethashcode
with value types we start with both equals and gethashcode referring to a field-by-field comparison because that s the most discriminating view of equality that makes any logical sense with value types

in this case mysql does a single key lookup for each min or max expression and replaces it with a constant

12202764
min	max
select min key_part2 max key_part2

12202764
sorting	filtering
therefore mysql cannot use the simple index that you have defined on col_1 for finding max col_1 when you are applying a filtering it must instead scan all matching rows albeit it can do this in descending order of col_1 by sorting upon that simple index as would be shown by the explain output for your query

this probably is a bug in the framework and this happens when the extjs renders the application before the browser populates mayb the correct window.innerwidth and window.innerheight and thus the viewport cannot take the correct width and height

12205226
width	height
i poll for the correct height and width of the browser for around a sec after every say 100ms for the correct height and width of the window and if i find that the height or width of the viewport isnt same i re adjust it

one way to get the size of a control taking into account all of the scale transformations that have been applied to it is to walk up the visual tree and apply all scale transforms to the actualwidth and actualheight of a control

now what i need is for the imageviews in the list to have a fixed height they re part of a more complex layout so i m using the linearlayout weight trick to give it a height equal to 1 3 of the screen height and a width that adjusts in relation to the height without destroying aspect ratio

12209473
width	height
the images have a longer height than width - an aspect ratio similar to a phone on portrait

12209510
integer	unsigned
basically the first 2 arguments are just simple strings no problem accessing these but the 3rd argument is defined by the upnp people as an unsigned 4 byte integer and this is where the problem lays vb6 is unable to interpret this datatype and is not letting me access this array item aryouts 2 and i could not figure out what part of the typelib i need to modify since the definition for invokeaction aryouts is just stated as a variant in the typelib and here is the relevant part of the typelib for your view i ve included the area i understand to be relevant if you would like additional areas posted let me know and i can do this

it s possible you re-synthesized the delegate properties which will mean there is now a new instance variable private to your class and synthesized accessor pointing to that private variable

12211287

12211547
post	get
on the server which will manipulate the data you can then post it back to your server using someting like curl if you dont totally understand curl take a look at that link there or you could use a php header and set the data you want to send back into the url using a get method so the url the user receives would look like this using the get method

12212413
sorting	grouping
the important thing here is that the sorting makes it trivial to count each element at a time by grouping all the identical elements together into a single sequence which makes the counting trivial

12212447
serializable	deserialization
it is for low memory consumption and fast serializable and deserialization from your posting i can understand that low memory consumption is achieved you have to understand what is actually meant by serializable of datastructures and it varies architectures and implementations

versioning	upgrade
from an upgrade perspective my experience is that you best can upgrade all your 3rd party libraries to the latest versioning one by one and then finally upgrade delphi

12212869
int	double
int string and double do implement the comparable interface but in a generic way int implements string implements etc.

12212876
comparator	comparable
specifying comparable as a common interface also gives the false suggestion that you can sort the array which is false since the different comparator can t cooperate

12212886
comparator	comparable
if you use the comparator method directly or not for example by sorting your array take comparable

12212886
int	double
but note that you rarely have to store in an array strings double and int

12212893
filtering	grouping
we did this in one of our projects to provide users the flexibility to filtering sort grouping on any attributes of the underlying data model and this approach works really well

12212898
children	parent
the children will inherit those supported orientations from the parent

12212916
comparator	comparable
- moreover comparable is good when you need to sort only according to one parameters but it would be good to use comparator when you want to sort in more than one way..

12213009
int	chars
the reason of the error is that chars is 2 bytes and int is 4 bytes

12213009
int	chars
you have to make an explicit cast from int to chars

12213041
int	chars
in both cases you are requesting a conversion from a signed 32-bit int into an unsigned 16-bit chars

12213041
int	chars
in this line the compiler only knows you are converting some int value to a chars so it doesn t know for sure it can fit

12213055
iscsi	cifs

12213068
getter	setter
an entity can contain getter setter adders behavior and business rules recommended .

12213070
int	chars
loss of precision means that int has a larger value and chars is smaller so you can t fit something which is to large for that space

12213070
int	chars
you need to type cast the int into chars but still the precision will be lost because you just can t fit int into chars but if the int value is smaller than loss precision can be ignored

12213094
int	chars
line 4 fails because it says that if you try to assign a 4-bytes value int to a 2-byte location chars it needs a cast

int	double
note pow returns a double so the best way to avoid such problem is to make a double not int

12213397
int	double	ceil	floor
you need to use ceil to round double value to the int just assigning is the same as floor - it s truncating fractions part of floating point double number in your case positive number

12213397
ceil	floor
you may also find useful to get mathematical rounding - floor x + 0.5 for positive x ceil x - 0.5 for negative one

i don t know the answer but as c++ evolved from c a lot of code in c used malloc free as there was no other way to do it and so it carried over to c++ as new delete

12213624

so as you can see in the code below i check for tablet large screens and minus the extra 90 degrees

12216148

i would like to differentiate between explicitly-defined methods and properties accessor to omit the latter

12216735
backtracking	greedy
i thought that when i use atomic grouping aka nonbacktracking subexpressions then would match the last two double quotes of because the left alternative can match two double quotes and then result in an overall match fail as desired because the last of the regex is not present but the group seems like it wouldn t be greedy enough although having greedy quantifier and atomic grouping and still backtracking to the point after the very first of the regex as soon as it is noticed that the regex fails

usually group by is used with aggregate functions to get min max etc for each group in a table

12216969
ftp	smb
it s part of fuse-workspace which offers access to all kinds of resources like smb shares ftp server work in progress and audio cd s

mp3	ogg
so i guess that decode.encode this audio tracks to another format like mp3 or ogg is a good option

this is essentially replacing the middle for-loop the one that goes from i 0 to 9 with the while loops

12217343

put these two together to get

12217354
width	height
because you are not accounting for the height and width of your loading spinner hence it would be a little bit -less- than 50 top left

12217354
margin	height	width	margin	width	height
everyone beat me to the next part but yes you always divide 2 the height width of your div image etc and that make that negative top left margin

for-loop	while-loop
use a while-loop instead of a for-loop to iterate through your cursor your for-loop is doing three times the necessary work

12219472
width	height
it does not happen when resizing window on a desktop pc i.e on a desktop browser map_canvas is correctly filled when browser s window is enlarged even without the resize binding only due to width height at 100 on map_canvas...

but when i put the same code in header i am not able to get the page title

12219654
try-catch	exception-handling
you could potentially place this in a transaction in ssis you ll need msdtc running or you could create t-sql script with a try-catch to handle any exception-handling of the bulk insert probably just rollback or commit

12219703
width	height
this is done with trickery where the body or some other element has a large size so as to get a scrollbar and another element is placed with position fixed and height width 100 in front of the scrolled element and takes up the entire screen so the scrolled element is nt visible

12219721

malloc and free use the data segment returned by brk and sbrk by turning it into a heap

12219932
free	malloc
it is important to note that many calls to malloc and free will make no system calls

12219932
free	malloc
now when malloc and free want to make use of the heap they need to get a pointer to the heap

12219932
free	malloc
however on linux both the dll and the executable will access malloc and free through a common dll libc.so on linux

12219958
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox this seems to be the default type

12219976
children	parent

12219987
nofollow	noindex
add meta or x-robots commands to each page with a value of noindex nofollow

12219987
nofollow	noindex
additionally to be extra safe i would also add a meta robots or x-robots-header command to each page to noindex nofollow just in case ip tables fails from a misconfiguation or if authentication ever fails .

12219987
nofollow	noindex
otherwise pushing out a noindex nofollow or a disallow would be disastrous for your production site

the task of the .https version will certainly be to redirect the https traffic towards a service that can handle https stunnel or nginx usually since haproxy cannot terminate ssl connections

the second example doesn t work because because capybara resets the session after each rspec example

google-chrome	firefox
i am testing with both google-chrome and firefox and the behavior is the same so there must be something that i don t understand and am doing wrong

12220789
fadein	fadeout
edit i almost forgot you are going to have to set the body or a wrapper element s height to be what the height would be if your elements were part of the normal flow as display none which is required for fadein and fadeout will remove them from the flow and shorten your page to the height it would be without them there

12220824
jar	war
you may also try placing the folder inside the war or jar ejb to narrow down the issue

12220857

12220889

so you re running respondstoselector on this subclassing which replies yes but then later trying to get gesturerecognizer shouldrecognizesimultaneouslywithgesturerecognizer from the superclass which doesn t have it

12220898

as a workaround i read all the children into the list and remove them from the parent widget at the same time then sort these items using comparator and add them back to parent from the sorted list

12220914
put	get
to get around the problem i tried to put the argument -d32 in the vm arguments but got the same result

12221119
put	get
i put it in my application models directory but these files do not even get included they have syntax errors but my app works just fine

12221134
min	max
also it s worth noting that min and max work on text and several other data types that are not numeric values

12221189
ienumerable	iqueryable
prop3 is actually implemented as an iqueryable but is an ienumerable because i need to pass the resolved query back across the wire because the context is lost upon returning a value from wcf and therein lies the problem

12221193
typedef	struct
there are several problems with this approach but the most important is for each typedef or static constant that i find convenient defining in the vector_expr struct i will need to perform all the above only to have the expression compile even if an iterator-expression is-not vector-expression and it makes no sense to enlarge the interface of vector_expr to accommodate transformed trees

12221205
hide	show
i have used hide and show methods of jquery

i don t know how to do it from woocommerce but with following code it is possible just make sure that these php code should execute so put it at suitable place in php file where some php codes are executing best place would be any wordpress plugin s base file be careful while updating that plugin as these code will get lost after updating

12221336
google-chrome	firefox

hy i m trying to display my rss feed but the problem is that while trying to display the title the rss feed somehow displays everything the link title and even the name of the page i m trying to read the feed from

12221531
integer	unsigned
i also took the liberty to assume that you want an integer not an unsigned integer

12221533
dictionary	map
another approach is to use dictionary to map keys if you have small number of them to values

12221546
put	get
also getting used to add quotes around your variables helps you to remember to always put them once you get used to it and makes do you less errors

12221550
put	get
you get your urdu string say the one you put before ø¹ ùˆø ù ø ù ø ø ø¹ø ù ù ù ø ùšù ø ø³øªø ùšø¹ ø ù ø ø ø ùƒ

12221582
getter	setter
a quick way around this would be with a type-hinted setter method and subsequent getter like this

12221600
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works properly in ie7 ie9 google-chrome firefox and safari

12221618
int	boolean
set method has a lot of overloads it can accept int string boolean datetime etc

12221628
children	parent
there is only relation in parent to children like this

12221643
post	get
in your post redirect post - redirect - get pattern

12221657
next	except
to fix this you can wrap the next in a try except pass

12221692
post	get
it works with get but we really want post

12221713
put	get
they may even do a read query to get all the fields change the one they want to update then put them back

12221754
elf	coff
the directives in the linked file are only valid for elf targets as used on linux and other unices but cygwin is a coff target

12221758
getter	setter
the auth_key is simply a getter setter virtual attribute for the column you choose to locate the record when authenticating it is not a column itself unless you choose to create an auth_key column in your identity model

12221852
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
only store salt hash made with appropriately secure not md5 hash functions

12221852
hash	salt
use a different salt for each hash

12221862
folder	directory
in this case the simplest thing for you to do is to invoke python from the directory containing the folder swampy since the interpreter will first search for modules in the current directory

12221933
decoder	encoder
this is the buffering the encoder assumes is available at the decoder side

12221976
loops	if-statement
i want to go back to loops 1 if the if-statement is successful

12221988
width	height
the left title is set to preferred width and fixed height so that it gets the width it needs but doesn t grow vertically

12221988
width	height
the expanding title gets an expanding width policy and a fixed height

12222006
ienumerable	iqueryable
i can understand that the code compiles iqueryable inherits from ienumerable which have an orderby method taking a as parameter

12222007
mp4	webm
output format webm ogv mp4

12222040
ienumerable	iqueryable
because f is a delegate rather than an expression the compiler picks the ienumerable orderby extension method instead of the iqueryable one

12222040
ienumerable	iqueryable
it seems that your question is as much about the iqueryable ienumerable duality being dangerous from the point of view of introducing ambiguity

12222068
udp	tcp
port forward tcp udp 5555

12222105
kerberos	ntlm
so in short you need to switch from using ntlm to kerberos

12222109
sigkill	multitasking
then if i press the home button then close the app from the multitasking bar then press the icon i get the sigkill error

12222163
getter	setter
all the fragments are able to access the data in the activity they are displayed in just make sure to create getter and setter

12222201
matplotlib	scipy
generally for mountain lion you can find great advices and a well described step-by-step procedure to install numpy scipy matplotlib iphython at this link

12222212
getter	setter
assuming that you have created getter and setter in your computer class

12222220
client-side	server-side
please refer to the documentation for a list of simple client-side and server-side hooks

12222283
width	height
the size width and height and the filename is included for each record

12222283
width	height
width and height are included no need to launch phpâ s imagegetsize to get the size

12222286
mp4	h.264
mp4 with h.264 aac is the most common and for devices that don t support those mpeg4 with mp3 will suffice

12222342
versioning	upgrade
i m afraid i can t show you any code because we got rid of it as soon as most firefox users were upgrade to a versioning that supported ellipsis

12222403
width	height
i add a custom button in storyboard and add some text and then add the backgroundimage which is a vector done in illustrator width 630 height 130

12222488
google-chrome	firefox
intellij 11 does support js debugging with google-chrome maybe firefox too but only the ultimate edition

12222529
post	get
but to get a value from a view in the post action you should use an hidden input

12222638
gunicorn	uwsgi
i ll second matt w s note about the application environment being a major factor gunicorn uwsgi nginx- paster pserve eventlet apache+mod_wsgi etc etc etc

12222648
epplus	excellibrary
but instead of creating a html-table that can be interpreted by excel i would use a excellibrary like epplus gpl which i can warmly recommend

12222696
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the solution should work in recent versions of google-chrome firefox and safari

12222760
websphere	ibm
we have ibm rad 7 with websphere 1.6 version when creating webmodule project it is taking only java 5 and override annotation methods not working .please provide hints

12222775
inherited	properties	implements	extends
if you want to create a custom class for your textfield though it s not clear whether that s altogether necessary in this instance you would need to either extends the textfield class in your custom class in which case it will inherited the textfield.text properties or implements a setter of your own to set the text on a textfield instance stored as a properties of the class

12222813
google-chrome	firefox
however firefox google-chrome and unfortunately the android device do not allow me to get the information

12222813
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox complain about cross-site ajax callsâ and the phone just freezes up when the function is called

12222826
versioning	upgrade
i see that the latest versioning for ef in nuget is 5.0 but i m running .net 4 and don t plan to upgrade to 4.5 anytime soon

12222836
content-disposition	content-type
as it is quite simple in this scenario and involves only terms like content-type content-disposition therefor i would recommend it here

12222873
mouse	keyboard
i started automating this process using autoit to control my mouse and keyboard

12222873
mouse	keyboard
not only am i dependent on an installation of visual studio but while the script is running i cannot use the mouse or keyboard without throwing the automation out of sequence

12222885
post	get
these might be some good blog post to get you started

12222893
post	get
the service has a few get methods which return some data that is serialised as json and some post methods that accept custom wcf classes

12222926
put	get
you need to put your php function in a .php file of its own and then use an ajax request every second to get the updated table

12222977
union	distinct
with union only distinct values are selected

12222984
securitymanager	classloader
the xalan engine internal to jre has the logic to look for a callback class in the boostrap classloader if securitymanager was set in the jvm else it would look for it in the system classloader

12223004
octal	decimal	octal	binary
we must use these 3 loops to generate a table of decimal numbers as well as the binary octal and hexadecimal equivalents of the decimal numbers in the range 1-256

12223024
post	get
if you want to know how to get the permalink based on the title of a post then send it to the server call get_page_by_title and return get_permalink

12223037

the last post by date of every category is returned so i get 3 post back

12223124
versioning	upgrade
to upgrade cygwin s openssl you just need to run the installer and select the newer versioning

12223124
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
after the installation upgrade is complete you should be able to see the new versioning in cygwin with the following command

12223124
installation	upgrade
i figure cygwin handles the installation upgrade for a reason

12223127
for-loop	loops
using log.d i saw that once it gets into one of the inner for loops the ones with the if statements before them it will not leave that for-loop ....which doesn t make sense to me but i figure it has something to do with the canvas and holder

12223156
hide	show
you can either append it to the dom later or just hide it with css and show it with js

12223192
ubuntu	debian
unfortunately by looking around the web i have only found hints for debian and ubuntu

12223197
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
you can read from inputstream and write on bytearrayoutputstream then use tobytearray method to convert it to byte array

12223242
hash	hmac
a common choice of mac is hmac with whatever hash function you prefer such as sha-2

12223267
nfa	dfa
i don t know automata theory and can t help you with dfa nfa but that s a solid direction to go if you needed more precision

12223305
put	get
the queries work when run individually but when i put them all together i don t get the desired result set

12223305
min	max
but now they want me to get a certain column image_measurer_id with each row returned that corresponds to the row from the group that has bottom min bottom bottom max bottom bottom closest to avg bottom and bottom from the row where date_time max date_time

12223348
uigesturerecognizer	subviews
each of the subviews cells in the uiscrollview content view have a uigesturerecognizer attached to them so that when a person touches one of them the uigesturerecognizer will trigger

12223348
uigesturerecognizer	subviews
the problem is that when a person has scrolled away from the contentview origin the uiscrollview returns a contentoffset where x is other than 0 any of the new subviews cells that scroll in from the right do not trigger the uigesturerecognizer when touched

12223348
uigesturerecognizer	subviews
all the subviews do have their uigesturerecognizer

12223348
uigesturerecognizer	subviews
i implement my own queue dequeue of the subviews analogous to what a tableview does so if i have scrolled over by place #15 none of the original icons subviews is even in the contentview as the subviews are recycled and old uigesturerecognizer removed and new ones attached when it is pulled off the queue and reused and none of these are touchable and trigger the uigesturerecognizer

12223348
uigesturerecognizer	subviews
it is just the uigesturerecognizer attached to each subviews that are not triggering and are position dependent on being within the original bounds of the scrollview before it starts scrolling

12223365
for-loop	arrays
the first for-loop seeks to convert each integer to a binary string and store it to the string arrays

12223388
postgresql	mysql
i would like a single query that would work just as well on sqlite mysql postgresql or sql server

12223433
folder	directory
but a simple approach for basic security could be to deny directory listing to the folder and then to create encoded filenames and put these in the dbase

12223484
capistrano	rvm
gem rvm capistrano

12223492
width	height
you have to encapsulate your height width -calculating code into

12223493
public	protected
in your ai class create an addedtostage listener and in that handler create an enter_frame handler that is either protected or public then you can override parts of its behavior if you have slightly different needs for different character types

12223501
rar	zip
the archive itself may include other archives zip rar kmz zae

12223565
width	height
if you want to scale down to inside 250x200 pixels while keeping aspect ratio the ratio of height to width of the original image and cropping that dimension of the 250x200 pixels which isn t used up use

12223565
width	height
by default width and height given in the -resize argument are maximum values unless you specify it as a percentage

12223565
width	height
when the height is shrunk to 200 pixels from the original s 1200 pixels to 16.6666 of this original value the width is now 266.66 pixels

12223565
width	height
when the width has shrunk to 250 pixels from the original 1600 pixels to 15.625 of this original value the height now is 187.5 pixels

12223565
integer	fractions
so the final dimension will be either of 250x187 or more likely 250x188 pixels you can t have fractions of a pixel in the height it requires an integer

12223565
width	height
when modifying width and height with the addition to the -scale or -resize arguments these settings are considered to be minimum values where only one of these too dimensions is really attained

12223565
width	height
this means output images expand or contract until either width or height matches its specified dimension maintaining the aspect ratio of the image

12223571
post	get
in general you should not need to serialize the form into json and post that - instead you should take advantage of the model binding in mvc and submit the form data the standard way by using the action attribute on the form element - well the model binder is able to bind objects based on json but i think you get my point

12223571
client-side	server-side
as you might already have guessed my best experience with asp.net mvc3 when it comes to model validation is using data annotations and the built-in support for server-side validation through modelstate.isvalid and client-side validation through unobtrusive javascript

12223588
hash	md5
you can use file name with md5 hash a the end

12223642
uitableview	nsindexpath
- void tableview uitableview tableview diddeselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

12223688
qthread	qnetworkaccessmanager
what you should probably do is create your own qthread subclass and create the qnetworkaccessmanager in the run method

12223696
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu you can also run following

12223707
folder	directory
the commands in this case generate lists of files under the two directory - the cd makes the output relative to the directory being compared so that corresponding files come out as identical strings and the sort ensures that comm won t be confused by the same files listed in different order in the two folder

12223767
implements	extends
in simple words implementation means applying set of predefined rules.interface is same like this.so an interface can not implements other interface.thats why we extends one interface with other

12223774
width	height
i want to make a qwebview appear expanding to the width and height so that ideally it will have no scroll bars

12223774
width	height
it doesnt take into account that the height and width are related to each other

12223774
width	height
it doesnt take into account the relation between the displayed width height

12223801
width	height
the effect is that the image will fill the to the width of the containing element and height will automatically adjust

12223813
ubuntu	linux
i have this problem when i run my application developed with zend framework on a linux server ubuntu or a hosted sever the login won t work

12223824
put	get
i have been searching google all day so far the best i have been able to come up with is using a ternary which i have put into my code but it keeps throwing an err and i get a blank white page

12223827
put	get
when using readline via the -e flag the argument to -i is put on the first line of the input to get you started

12223848
public	protected
the methods that could be invoked on item inside the method would have to be public methods or protected methods within the same package

12223862
portrait	landscape
so it seems that the rule of ios app is that it is always first layouted in portrait mode and then resize re-layout if landscape mode is wanted

12223866
client-side	server-side
using meteor i m wondering how best to handle different client-side collections that share the same server-side database collection

12223904
jobs	cron
i know nothing about cron jobs unfortunately but maybe i don t even need to use them

12223912
public	protected
about the methods you can invoke if you are not using casting then you can only invoke public protected within the same package of launchable

12223932
portrait	landscape
i get the same view frame in both portrait and landscape

12224027
put	get
i have an application that scans text from a website in order to get the information and put it into my application

12224037
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
works in google-chrome safari not in firefox

12224128
post	get
they really do not describe it in any detail for me at least post tutorial here and then go down to uploadfields and there is where they attempt to describe how to get the post data

12224132
loops	if-statement
why doesn t one this have only one loops and the if-statement

12224144
width	height
in your ib storeyboard tableview cell drag a uiview width 36 height 36

12224171
bash	zsh
i start to get itchy when my code isn t dry and for various reasons i jump back and forth between bash and zsh

12224193
put	get
i am wondering if some sort of in memory cache would help improve this if i put images in memory there when they were decrypted and checked that cache in loadandshowthumbnailimage before i kick off all the threads to get and decrypt them

12224204
min	max
in coreimage a cifilter has both a set of max min values and a set of slidermax min values

12224204
minimum	max	min	max
the documentation for the max min says the maximum minimum value for a filter parameter and the slidermax min says the maximum minimum value specified as a floating-point value to use for a slider that controls input values for a filter parameter.

12224207
postgresql	mysql
i doubt that you can do this in mysql or postgresql as you expect to however there is an alternative which i have used where data is very free-form

12224253
min	max
i would wager that a value of 0 means there is no max min that any value representable by the datatype is valid for the filter

12224276
filesystems	fat
fat short for file allocation table is the name of a computer filesystems architecture and a family of industry standard filesystems utilizing it

12224284
division	modulo
modulo gives the remainder after division

12224286
filesystems	hfs+
hfs+ the mac filesystems is usually configured to be case insensitive but case preserving

12224291
division	modulo
the modulo returns the remainder of the integer division

12224312
google-chrome	firefox
while the embed seems to be working in google-chrome neither ie nor firefox display the font

12224330
post	get
your form is using the method request which is not correct it should be get or post

12224395
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this error only happens in explorer and opera but works fine in firefox google-chrome and safari

12224396
uiview	subviews
you may have to create a background view uiview will suffice and put the uilabel on top not as a subviews because the alpha value of the background view affects all of its subviews

12224410
post	get
i get array return id of those post

12224420
mongoid	mongomapper
the rails3-jquery-autocomplete gem can work with mongodb but only if you use the mongoid gem not mongomapper

12224451
post	get
however the radio button chosen by the user doesn t get send along with the word in the post request

12224471
subscript	superscript
in general when there is an unicode equivalent for the subscript superscript you should use that character directly instead of the sub sup element it s not a must just a recommendation so go on using whatever you like more

12224471
subscript	superscript
it s not relevant in this case but maybe for other readers when the subscript superscript is stylistic only and carries no new meaning by being subscript superscripted you should use css instead of the special unicode characters or sub sup elements vertical-align with sub super and you d have to adjust the font size too

12224476
int	chars
the main problem is that i cannot touch the resulting chars buff with any members of my class nor can i even change an int flag that is also a member of my class

12224509
subtract	add
you must subtract hours and minutes from a time given in an eastern hemisphere timezone in order to get back to utc not add them

12224516
getter	setter
i ran the command line to generate the getter setter and join info in the entities

12224521
setinterval	clearinterval
angular s built in timeout service is used instead of setinterval and clearinterval since modifying the model outside of angularjs shouldn t be done if easily avoided

12224583
wordpress	joomla
setting up a poll is not going to be a simple task if you are not using some sort of cms platform like wordpress or joomla for example and some extension such a platform might offer

12224602
put	get	post	get	post	put
only supports post and get requests for some reason- but i also need put and delete standard restful methods so i didn t bother looking into it any further

12224604
int	chars	int	boolean	int	double
the wrapper classes boolean chars int long float and double serve this purpose

12224629
google-chrome	safari
in particular which versions of google-chrome and safari will have support for them

12224632
public	protected
also it is a good idea to declare your methods as public protected or private

12224678
setinterval	settimeout
i m possibly looking for an alternative to node.js - some really nice things about it are settimeout and setinterval

12224706
put	get
since in this case get time will never change and accepts no parameters you would do best to put this into a static method since it s a waste to instantiate a class in this situation

12224721
des	aes
symmetric cryptography such as the aes or des algorithms use a single key to encrypt and decrypt data

12224721
hash	md5
common hash algorithms include message digest 5 md5 and secure hash algorithm sha and its derivatives like sha1 sha256 and sha512

12224739
google-chrome	firefox
this script is working for me in google-chrome firefox but choking in ie

12224739
google-chrome	firefox
and now it s working in google-chrome firefox ie8 and ie9

12224741
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
you should use nscalendar and nsdatecomponents to do the maths - something like

12224765
rss	feed
i have seen several apps which use rss feed as their back end

12224765
rss	feed
most websites have a restriction on how many calls an app can make per second or per hour for an rss feed

12224765
rss	feed
but if my app is distributed amongst several users it is not really a single user who is calling for rss feed

12224765
rss	feed
also one idea i had was to cache the rss feed on some different server for some time but then the users might not get the most latest feed

12224765
rss	feed
i don t wanna get sued for using rss feed from websites but asking every website for permission is too much

12224798
cefsharp	cefglue
in the realm of providing a decent implementation of the chromium embedded framework cef for .net the two leading options appear to be cefsharp and cefglue

12224798
cefsharp	cefglue
they differ in approach cefglue uses p invoke to call into the cef unmanaged code cefsharp uses a mixed-mode c++ cli wrapper around the cef libraries

12224802
rss	feed
most rss feed are available to the public to subscribe to so there shouldn t be a problem if your app is subscribing to them

12224816
rss	feed
you don need to to ask permission to consume an rss feed - that s what it is implicitly for - content syndication

12224816
rss	feed
however if you are creating an app with wide distribution and it is going to be hitting the same rss feed then you almost certainly should cache the content on your own servers

12224820
put	get
get the url from the ide ends in dev and then put the params after the dev

12224884
post	get
i have an initbinder function but this does not get executed when i post the form so no error messages are returned from the validation class nor is the result.haserrors method getting set to false

12224884
post	get
presently the only message that gets executed when the page is get is welcome it was a get which is what i want but the post i am getting error

12224884
post	get
it was a post and validation does not get executed

12224907
int	double
i am a mewbie in java but the problem may be that you create the list for double s however you are adding some int s

12224969
google-chrome	firefox
note the code jsbin.com does not work for me in ie9 firefox and google-chrome work fine

12224988
int	chars	int	double
things like int chars double are all primitives meaning they do not need to be instantiated by using new

12224988
int	chars	int	double
things like int chars double are objects that take up more room on the computer since there is more overhead for objects but you can use methods like integer.parse

the former is called directly by the swing paint manager and thus must be public while the latter is called only internally by the paint ... method and so is protected

12228406
public	protected
version 1 would introduce access modifiers in the parent that perhaps should not be there going from protected to public while version 3 does not make much sense since you are still using an instance of maptile even if it did it looks awkward and unnatural

12228406

then there s your stuff with get and put

12235094
floating-point	integer
lack of an fpu or even a hardware integer multiply or divide does not preclude the use of floating-point it simply means that such operations are far slower and require greater code space

12235094
floating-point	fixed-point
i would evaluate the standard library software floating-point performance precision and effect on code size and only if i found it to be inadequate for the application requirements would i consider an optimised solution using an established algorithm and possibly fixed-point arithmetic

if you open it in ie 8 9 you see that the lay-out is kinda really different from firefox google-chrome

12235213
wxpython	pygtk
if you don t write a cross-platform app then you should better use the specific api to this platform pygtk gnome etc. pywin32t windows or whatever native toolkit on your platform as it is normally more updated to the latest api than wxpython

12235222
int	double
i don t get why it works fine if you change all the double into int

12235244
int	double
the thing is that on your system int appears to be of the same length as float but not as double - when you scanf a double you loose half of it and by the way feeding a wrong format specifier to scanf is undefined behaviour

12235251
int	double
also in the main function the type of buffer should be double not int

i have a udp server reading images both udp and tcp

12235388
oncreate	onstart
on an application i m working on the oncreate starts a service with startservice and subsequently after that same activity calls bindservice to that same service in its onstart

12235398
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari webkit supports it already

12235426
submit	submission	post	get
because of this on your products list the tag of the first product is being ignored form elements are not allowed to be nested so submission the first product performs a post submit so the data gets transferred in the http body the url has the value that you want and your variables get populated correctly

the solution in any client-side or server-side technology is acceptable

12235528
post	get
a http get post

12235547
udp	tcp
tcp and udp have very different characeristics

12235547
udp	tcp
if you care about data arriving in a timely manner where if data is late it is no use then tcp is not useful and as such you should use and only use udp

12235587
udp	tcp
now imagine writing lots of small packets across a network udp may cause congestion whereas tcp is better controlled

12235612
nowjs	node.js
i would suggest using a webview and using a node.js nowjs chat

12235919
profiler	yourkit
i would use a commercial memory profiler like yourkit

12235919
profiler	visualvm
a problem i have found with visualvm is that when you minimise your object creation the biggest memory producers is the memory profiler itself

12235931
mdpi	hdpi
that will result that on each device you ll have different sized if you d put the image to different folders hdpi mdpi etc

12235958

12236600
apache	nginx
make the name a hash of something random so it can pass right through nginx apache without php

12236629

link 1 would show the first div and hide all others

12236629
hide	show
then when clicking link 2 the div that is visible will hide and div2 would show

12236629
hide	show
when clicking link 3 the div that is visible will hide and div3 would show and so on

12236629

qtableview	qtablewidget
if you have a qtablewidget and not a qtableview you could use the same mo

12236753
internationalization	translation
translation internationalization

12236763
postgresql	informix
in theory if you were working with informix and needed to access postgresql you could buy and use the enterprise gateway manager egm and use the odbc driver for postgresql to allow informix to connect to postgresql

12236763
postgresql	informix
the egm would do its utmost to appear to be another informix database while actually accessing postgresql

12236763
postgresql	informix
for the converse connection working with postgresql and connecting to informix you will need to look to the postgresql tool suite â or other sources

listview	gridview
as for the appwidgets you can t retrieve a resizable appwidget s current size because they are intended for use with listview and gridview containers

12236846

the argument is passed to your program as a chars and so as andy pointed out you would have a pointer to a byte containing 0x35 - which is the int value that represents an ascii chars 5 - rather than a pointer to an int value 5

12238754
int	chars
to use your argument as an int you would need to convert the byte to its int equivalent as defined by the ascii table - otherwise you will find that you pass in the chars 5 but any math you attempt to do with this will be using 53 0x35 because that represents a 5 in ascii

12239920
mergesort	timsort
if you are using the standard java sorting method and an array of floats you are fine with 1.2gb imo as it already uses a very space efficient and fast n lg n sorting method timsort mergesort - see arrays.sort

12239920
integer	radix
to make it even faster you could convert the floats to integers but you ll need to know precision up front and then apply integer sort or the already mentioned radix sort

12239925
width	height
you need to specify a number between 0 to 1 which is the percentage of the texture s width and height

12239968

12240137
versioning	upgrade
also i recommend you to upgrade jquery to the newest versioning and replace delegate with on

12240147
width	height
though you could use the function mentioned above to convert meters to map points and create an mkmaprect it would be easier to use the mkcoordinateregionmakewithdistance function which takes a regular coordinate latitude and longitude in degrees and the desired width and height in meters so all the calculations are handled by the map view

12240378
nsoperationqueue	completionhandler	nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
i bet using the new api that allows to send an asynchronous request on an nsoperationqueue +sendasynchronousrequest queue completionhandler uses gcd under the hood and dispatch_source_create or something similar so that it behave the same way as when an nsurlconnection is scheduled on the run loop avoiding using an additional thread watch the wwdc 12 videos that explains why threads are evil and their usage should be minimized the difference only being that allows you to use a block to be informed upon completion instead of using the delegate mechanism

not likely with int and double but with slight alteration

12240591
getter	setter
kineticjs however generated it s getter setter based on the name of the variables

12240591
getter	setter
so with the addgetterssetters method you generate getter setter based on the names of the variables

12240591
getter	setter
i could add externs to for each getter setter

the on-disk storage of documents in mongodb is in bson format

12241117
spaces	delimiter
while there is some disk savings from using short key names since as you can see by looking at the spec the key name is embedded in the document it looks to me like there d be almost no net difference between the two designs in terms of on-disk spaces used -- the extra bytes you use by using the delimiter - get bought back by not having to have string terminators for the separate key values

now what i would like it to do is as the user is typing in each textbox it will output automatically to the notes_view textbox and also the same with the checkbox needs to keep the formatting and predetermined lines of text as well and then the user can just push one button that will copy it to the clipboard without having to use the file to store the information

fgets	getline
if you can t block while waiting for input then you can use select to check if the stdin_fileno file descriptor is ready for reading and if it is then you can use normal input functions scanf fgets std getline etc.

12245264
inherited	subclassing
this have worked nicely and the code is pretty straight forward but it does not work with multiple inherited because the constructor call will be to the subclassing instead of baseclass and that will create a stack overflow

12245283
width	height
you should set its width or height to a fixed value not the default 0

12245300
width	height
iframe width 640 height 360 src frameborder 0 allowfullscreen iframe

12245312
fts4	fts3
in case of fts3 fts4 in sqlite database i conclude that the default tokenizer which is simple at least ignores and while tokenizing the elements in any text column

12245727
textview	imageview
i think you can use a relativelayout within the framelayout for the imageview and the textview and by using the parameters you can navigate the textview to the white box

12245727
textview	imageview
you can add the imageview block first and then the textview so that the textview will lay over the imageview and by using align bottom and specifying top margin with a negative value you can make the textview go over the image

12245727
width	height
use your images and values for the height and width

12245744
selecteditem	selectedindex
the tag property is easily accessible from the code but from the ui it will be quite tough complext to bind to - all because the treeview itself exposes only a selecteditem selectedindex properties that returns usually the data items not the treeviewitems

12245756
post	get
add asihttprequest or af and sbjeson framework and encode ur data into json and send with post or get method to php page where php can decode the dictionary as a associative array and just loop through and update into mysql

12245757
subtract	add
i need to add seconds and subtract variables with type timestamp with timezone however to my understanding adding numbers to such data causes the information about the timezone to be lost perhaps because it s converted to a date type

12245833
int	double
field type can be some of primitive types like int double bool etc

12245926
cos	sin
i need to create a function for sqlite because the sin and cos mysql-function doesn t exist and i need to make a query like

maven	m2e
i normally run maven commands via the m2e plugin provided as part of eclipse juno 4.2

12245938
maven	m2e
the prepare ultimately fails giving the error - presumably because i am using the built-in maven excetable provided by m2e rather than the command line

12246031
try-catch	exception-handling
looked at this way you can see that the dispose will indeed be called if the exception-handling throws because the try-finally is outside of the try-catch

12246041
implements	extends
you are instead passing a mock object which implements the same interface or extends the server abstraction class

12246045
inline	inlining

whilst it worked on a pc google-chrome i found it was broken in other places other than on android such as on the website and other browsers safari didn t work with the raw api call

12246248
maven	pom.xml
the solution is to create a multi module setup with maven and declare a dependency on the outputs of emf library re-packaging from the question i ve referenced the parent pom.xml for all projects has this

12246634
google-chrome	firefox
i can unfortunately not just check if the pid i created is still alive as most browser firefox google-chrome will immediately exit the creating process and spawn more one per tab as they want

12246651
button	checkbox
this also still assumes that your checkbox radio button will be grouped by having the same name

12246652
passenger	thin
you could copy newrelic s approach check discover_dispatcher in local_environment.rb which basically has a list of heuristics used to detect if it is running inside passenger thin etc

12246673
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it is difficult to say without seeing your page but try using the webkit developer tools in safari or google-chrome or else use firebug in firefox to find out where the other jquery is loading form

12246684
versioning	upgrade
but this means you will need to keep in mind that this plugin is handled in a special way everytime you upgrade to a newer versioning of eclipse

12246754
folder	directory
create a virtual directory under the application and point this to a folder outside the application folder

12246792
versioning	upgrade
to solve the problem simply upgrade to versioning download v1.8.1

google-chrome	safari
i face this problem only with google-chrome version 21 but not with safari 6

12246820
stderr	fflush	stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush
redirect your spawned scripts stdout err to dev null close stdout and close stderr in main script or consult your web-server framework documentation on how to fflush response when you re done with output

12246843
width	height
this writes the values of width and height to the output window in visual studio

12246856
width	height
if your app for diff size density use display height width instead of fix value

12246904
put	get
then you should put a checking if finished in the half-way to get better situations such as o nlogn or o n

12246920
opera	firefox
the interesting thing is that the supposedly optimized loop is actually slower than the regular way of looping in both opera and firefox

12246948
openssl	crypto++
couldn t find anything about this either in the crypto++ or in the openssl documentation

12247000
opera	firefox

12247084
put	get
according to rest and depending of the request method this can either be a get method put method or delete method

12247098
post	get
after get the post values in model you can merge the array values into a single variable like this

12247135
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
while google-chrome shows correct well-formed json output firefox and also tested in in opera only show null even for simplest string like usa

12247155
nuxeo	documentum
nuxeo is based on open source but you have to pay the license and is pretty expensive at this point documentum is better anyway

12247214
post	get
other thing you can look at is this post which will show you some light on how to get your work done

12247221

google-chrome	firefox
this configuration gave me deterministically the following exception as i was doing tabbed browsing with the same browser either google-chrome or firefox or conkeror

12247277
min	max	width	height
others suggested overriding measureoverride and setting window s min max height and width there but this seems to be somewhat unclean considering that such a trivial problem should surely have a purely declarative solution

12247341
accessor	properties
you can do afhttprequestoperation alloc initwithrequest ... and then set the completionblock with either the straight properties accessor operation.completionblock ... or with -setcompletionblockwithsuccess failure

12247352
put	get
if you don t get any out put then i think you didnt tuch on swiperecognizer

12247362
pop-up	dialog
that image shows a pop-up that looks like a facebook dialog but is actually designed by the app developers so it would something you would build yourself

12247368

my class extends gxt button and i would like to add a checkbox in the button

12247506
oncreate	setcontentview
it seems you want to set a layout in your oncreate method using setcontentview

12247542
hash	md5
i changed the buffer size to 8192 and i now get about 3.7-4.5mb sec transfer over wireless to my laptop which is plenty fast enough for now but i still have the problem of the file getting slightly bigger which would cause it to fail an md5 sha hash test when it is received

12247577
hex	binary
also not sure if you re handling the hash loading properly if you have a long string of hex characters in the file that will need to be converted to binary before being

12247577
hex	binary
the hash computed by sha256 is binary not hex string

12247612
getter	setter
the entities which only have getter setter and possibly internal business logic according to your overall model you may want to separate that too

12247663
post	get
i ve built up a script that is to get users post from a database and i m almost there

12247663

12247731
daemons	launchd
i was under the impression it was for launchd an application from a daemons

12247754
ostringstream	std
the class std ostringstream is what you are looking for

12247754
ostringstream	std
if you want to buffer instead you can redirect your output to a std ostringstream instance that you can later redirect to the standard out

12247760
vb.net	vb6
it is easily adapted to vb.net vb6

12247769
put	get
basically you get both a wrapper for 1 making the ajax call more seamless and 2 for being able to easily program html-modifying instructions put this html into that div or whatever into your ajax response

now i put all these catogories in uitableview.but can any one guide me that how can get the alevel when i click on first section of uitableview and so on

12247795
getter	setter
i had weird issues similar to yours when i mixed public fields with getter and setter

12247817
min	max
now i want to save the max value i.e 52 and min value i.e 49 in a variable so that i can use it in my next query.i am using the following query to do so

12247817
min	max
i ve but these variables save the max and min ids of the column not this result set.i.e

12247817
minimum	max	min	max
it returns me max 52 and min 41 which is the minimum value of the column.i need min 49

12247818
mocha	node.js
i use node.js and mocha plug-in

12247841
rss	feed
big differences between working with the graph api and an rss feed would be

12247854
google-chrome	firefox
the same clicks work perfectly in other browsers like firefox windows google-chrome windows+mac ios simulators ie

12247882
put	get
that allows you to search for a garage - eg put in scarborough and you get a list choose the first location and the map redraws showing a couple of place markers

12247989
versioning	upgrade
whenever i see someone post a question and stating an old versioning of joomla usually the first thing i say is upgrade to the latest versioning of joomla 1.5.26 2.5.26 or 3.3.5 depending what build you re on

12248011
hex	binary
and the other is an array of binary value which you are printing as hex

12248019
min	max
i wrote a validation - i wanted to display a single error message for all kinds of errors not like too_long or too_short but here s the question - can i pass both min and max values to the translation to have something like username should be between 4 and 30 characters

12248073
textview	imageview
inside this app we have a relative layout with a group of 15 imageview 1 dynamic imageview and two textview to which i have to program zoom controls for zooming in and out

12248178
min	max
then you can use them inside your string template with min and max

12248184
mouse	keyboard
nothing special about that but if i select username field with mouse and then only use keyboard for the rest as soon as i get to next view mouse cursor becomes input caret

12248212
width	height
currently i m setting width and height of some elements with jquery in window resize event based on window.innerwidth and window.innerheight

12248227
children	parent
the problem is that the parent are often updated through reading a text file but the children for each of the parent are updated through the web-app

12248234
jtree	jtable
jtree and jtable are the most complex swing components

12248246
folder	directory
the directory structure is known and not deep and folder usually don t contain unknown files

12248294
post	get
reading other post i ve tried to delete the for id delegate because the type id is already a pointer but in this case the program get crashed

12248307
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
you could try using calc but the support is not very good limited to ie9+ ff4+ safari 6 google-chrome 19+ firefox for android

12248315
hide	show
i know i can find this is in my vm and hide show header based on a property in vm etc

12248371
hash	md5
the new structure simply stores the md5 hash of the original query 16 bytes expireunixtime and the serialized row-set

12248382
width	height
i am expecting a hash in the console like width 100 height 100 but i am not really sure how to do that

12248396
width	height
if the width gets smaller the height should get larger accordingly to display the whole content

12248401
base-class	derived-class
you ll have to call the base-class function from the derived-class override

12248421
getter	setter
you can do this using the getter and setter methods

12248426
getter	setter
you can also use setter getter class to set data and access data anywhere in application by just creating object for that class

12248473
wsimport	wsdl2java
wsimport is better don t use wsdl2java

12248479
filtering	grouping
since this particular filtering works with dns only i first get hold of dn of the user i want to check and then query grouping to see if this particular user is a member of any of grouping in chain

12248531
folder	directory
then we are copying all the files from the bin directory of that project to the patch folder in the specific manner in which the release has them by using a mapping file which has all the files of the application in it

12248534
width	height
and their width height s to all elements

12248557
autocomplete	typeahead
it uses twitter bootstrap typeahead 2.0 which supports data-source as an array for autocomplete

12248604
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i ve got this transition working smoothly in google-chrome and safari but it is not working in firefox

12248633
ienumerable	ilist
this enumeration happens via the ienumerable interface regardless of that ilist is implemented or not

12248656
background-image	background-position	width	height
it means that you need to create an element block width specified width and height then give it a background-image along with background-position and backgorund-url then hide everything that goes out of the box overflow hidden

12248666
implements	extends
i don t know if it s really important to you to demand in your observer but if it s only optional you can still implements or extends splobserver but make the optional it lets you do that

12248678
ati	nvidia
we have reproduced this on 5 different workstations with different graphic cards nvidia and ati cards and a mixture of windows 7 32 and 64bit

12248760
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it has to work in the following browsers ie7+ google-chrome safari firefox

12248878
hide	show
i am trying to show or hide a button based on the contents of a particular database field

12248887
prepare	execute
in practice the constant overhead required to prepare a query for execution will be execute n times instead of once so you ll almost certainly be degrading performance

12248904
post	get
remember the get post calls made using the http wrapper are ajax calls

12248994
opera	firefox
also you shouldn t forget to also put the unprefized version for transitions at the end as well both transitions and transforms will be unprefixed in firefox 16 opera 12.5 ie 10

12249000
postgresql	informix
for this sort of answer i would recommend postgresql informix or oracle

12249013
post	get
if you use typical rest approach like resteasy which is jax-rs implementation you are bound to use http - it is by design all that get post content type stuff is connected with http communication handling

12249021
versioning	upgrade
so it may be working now but it may not work in the not so distant future when you upgrade to mysql versioning x where the optimizer will be clever enough to understand that order by inside a derived table is redundant and can be eliminated

12249058
children	parent
here children will contain the descandants of parent

12249150
profiling	debugging
a set of dev-stage profiling debugging tools i already know some and i d use them if i knew what to profiling debugging it looks a little bit too much to be forever monitoring services running in production

12249216
postgresql	mysql
i m migrating from mysql to postgresql and i would like to use some advanced database layer in php

12249223
post	get
but with this query i do not get a post at all

12249223
post	get
when i exchange gte with lte i get obviously the post with its 2 comments

12249226
portrait	landscape	screens	tablet
for instance in certain flavors of android example 2.x running on a nook tablet if my device s screens turns off while flash builder is packaging and deploying my apk the app starts in a semi-broken state where its aspect ratio is landscape but everything has been measured with portrait dimensions

12249226
portrait	landscape
on other devices like my google nexus android 4.1 the application launches correctly in landscape mode but if i turn off the screen rotate the device to portrait mode and turn the screen back on- my air app has been invisibly rotated into portrait mode again

12249246
google-chrome	safari
however since the preferred font for most browsers is now svg safari seems to have trouble handling letter-spacing as in - it just ignores it however google-chrome does not

12249268
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfect for saf google-chrome firefox ie7 ie8 ie9 but in ie10 it doesn t work

12249282
folder	directory
i had similar errors when i placed the hibernate libraries in a folder inside the libs directory lib hibernate

12249310
post	get
the issue is that for the edit action i get a routing error no route matched post

12249335

the compilers can target the freebsd linux netbsd openbsd os x

12249429
inherited	properties
your delete simply unshadows native properties inherited through prototype chain

12249429
inherited	properties
some browsers have window inherited from native prototype and you ll have check out sources to see how properties is inherited if you really want to know that much details but mostly they work just like js own

12249434
post	get
the problem is that when i like a post it increments the post total_likes column but also increments the another table column which those 2 share associated columns like post_id and user_id and i don t get why.

12249476
aspell	enchant
this will additionally install enchant aspell and hunspell libraries

12249485
min	max
i understand i can do that using 2 consecutive queries fetching the min and max dates from the first query then using thoses numbers to run a second query but i m convinced there is a much better solution not found after dozen of tries

12249532
google-chrome	firefox
i have jquery ready function fired too early in ie but in not in google-chrome and firefox

12249658
filtering	grouping
the results are that there is a new security filtering added which references mygroup but the grouping authenticated users is not being removed

12249691
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it s checked on ie9 browser google-chrome opera and firefox

12249707

the best way to get your table randomly sorted is to add an extra field and populate it with a arbitrary md5 hash and create an index on that field

12254034
hash	md5
you can query the table at a random point by creating another arbitrary md5 hash and querying the record nearest that value

12254034
hash	md5
md5 hash are randomly distributed so every record would have the same chance of being picked

12254353
for-loop	arrays
in your for-loop you are going to do some special handeling if you re dealing with a questiongroup you will know that an arrays on that object is questions assuming it is the only arrays so you can create a new question object for each entry in the dictionary

then as others have pointed out you should use a simple for-loop with arrays s

12255843
many-to-many	one-to-many
the bad news is that it costs you the ability to have unidirectional one-to-many relationships as samer s code assumes that all x-to-many unidirectional relationships are many-to-many

12255843
many-to-many	one-to-many
presumably you could code up a different implementation of shouldmap that would distinguish between what you want to be many-to-many and what you want to be one-to-many and everything would then work again

ocp	principles
it s useful to keep the open-closed principles ocp in mind when designing classes but it s not always practical or desirable to make classes closed for modification right away

12256309
srp	principles
i think the single responsibility principles srp is much more useful in practice -- as long as a class only does one thing it is okay to modify it if the requirements for that one thing change

12256309
srp	ocp
moreover srp leads to ocp over time

12256320

12263658
base	fractions
the problem is that some fractions values can t be exactly represented in base 2

12263666
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the tooltips work fine in google-chrome safari but in firefox and ie when you hover over a point while the respective tooltip does appear it shows up outside the graph svg element in the top left hand corner of the screen html element instead of next to the point

12263688
base	fractions
the numbers will in general be stored in base 2 so fractions numbers are unlikely to correspond precisely to concise decimal strings

width	height
if you need some padding you can tweak the x y width height attributes on the filter element

12263967
google-chrome	safari
it assumes that such things work on svg elements unfortunately that assumption is incorrect outside of google-chrome safari

12263967
google-chrome	safari
it seems that google-chrome safari have put these on their svg elements but there s no specification that says that that should be the case

12263993

12264362
range	max
i have to perform count max avg on various columns total 20 odd queries for same data range

12264363
postgresql	mysql
as i know mysql doesn t have a array type like postgresql so you have to fetch it one by one

12264424
google-chrome	firefox
since the test cases must run against google-chrome firefox and ie we are currently passing around a webdriver object for our driver

12264462

if so you should just load them up to begin with and use javascript to show and hide the appropriate dropdown onclick of the radio button

12264469

jquery.pack.js - smaller in size - but requires unpacking time sort of like a rar zip would

12264692
onbeforeunload	onload
my first thought was to simply tap that onbeforeunload event by redirecting the page to a generic page which would hold onload code to close the popup

12264692
pop-up	dialog
instead i choose to check for changes in the iframe document when a close event happens and display a dialog which can be modified too and clearly indicates that you are performing an action on the pop-up and not on the page which could be interpreted as the parent page of the modal

12264701
realloc	malloc
i mean it is define structure rather than class allocate memory through malloc and realloc and calloc.in recent they have installed boost library so i am planning to use into my existing code base so i have some following question

12264701
free	malloc
can i use std shared_ptr with malloc and free

12264751
min	max
the obvious answer to select min zonemin max zonemin from plant in linq to sql is

12264751
min	max
however this answer actually retrieves each of min and max and if you include other aggregate functions like count and average in separate sql queries

12264751
min	max
i also say obvious because the obvious answer to me aggregate p in plants into min p.zonemin max p.zonemin actually retrieves the whole table twice even when optimised and then uses the linq-to-entities min and max to obtain the result -

12264811
post	get
i have seen this blog post automatic login for sharepoint using claims authentication but the code on the site doesn t appear to be complete i cannot get it working

the only difference i can see between my ssis custom component dll and the console application is that my component references system.windows.forms and uses bids

12264826
free	malloc
can i use shared_ptr with malloc and free

12264826
calloc	malloc
if i create shared_ptr in my application and pass this pointer to another function if they are using malloc or calloc

12264856
free	malloc
to use a std shared_pointer with malloc and free you should specify a custom deleter

12264872
width	margin
edit i found the culprit i assigned a top margin in but all top bottom left right margin values are defined as of the width of the parent.

12264885
wordpress	joomla
i don t want to use things like wordpress or joomla or blogger

12264892
min	max
i want to generate another table which includes all numbers from min tick to max tick as tick values

12264905
for-loop	loops
i can do this another way by using a for-loop but i am just wondering what i ve done wrong with this while loops

12264920
openssl	crypto++
apparently crypto++ and also openssl doesn t support tofb-i operation mode

12265013
put	get
edit i ve tried creating a sinple one page website to test and i can get it to work alright so it must be a problem of where to put the htc file

12265019
onmouseover	onclick
on a side note try to never use any onclick onmouseover etc events on any dom elements each one individually creates a script block within legacy browsers ie and with hundreds thousands of elements on a page it can deteriorate performance

12265069
free	malloc
can i use shared_ptr with malloc and free

12265069
free	malloc
remember that malloc and free only deal with raw memory and you re responsible for correctly creating and destroying any non-trivial objects you might want to keep in that memory

12265069
calloc	malloc
if i create shared_ptr in my application and pass this pointer to another function if they are using malloc or calloc

12265069
realloc	calloc
how will handle with realloc and calloc

12265069
free	calloc
it s fine to initialise the shared pointer with the result of calloc or anything else that returns memory to be released using free

12265069
free	realloc
you can t use realloc since shared_ptr has taken ownership of the original pointer and won t release it without calling free

12265112
ant	maven
i am pretty new to maven ant hence please excuse me if my question sounds silly to you.

12265112

the most important thing is the ratio between height and width that should be lesser than 1 3

12265291
int	chars
.nextint gets the next int but doesn t read the new line chars

12265305
nfa	dfa
the way i did it was to combine all the expressions in one pretty big nfa and converted that same thing into one dfa

12265317
width	margin
simply put when you want an image to go to 100 of the monitor then you need to put it into a container with width as 100 and margin auto not fixed width and no position at all

12265343
mouseup	mousedown
i store each mousedown and mouseup event in an array and on each frame i loop through the events to set the appropriate flags

everybody seems to be agreed to use post http method for get put delete and pass http_method as parameter and using the parameter decide what operation to do

12265613

from experience you ll end up running into a few issues with various browsers using width and height

12265620

cos	sin
now use the pythagoras theorem to get the distance from the middle point of ab to the middle point of the circle and calculate the position of the circle shouldn t be hard from here using basic sin cos combinations

12265702
outputstream	inputstream
if you see in the above code itext is not using any inputstream parameter rather it is writing directly to response s outputstream

12265702
getter	setter
i know that my class should have getter and setter for inputstream and i have that too in the class mentioned in struts-configuration

12265702

but since itext doesn t really need inputstream rather it is writing directly to response s outputstream i get exceptions since am not setting anything for the inputstream parameter

width	height
i then changed only the android version to 3.1 did not change width height and density and it worked as expected - the default layouts were used

all of the sections have fill_parent as the width and 0dp as the height and there are no padding or margin properties on any of the 3 children of the top level linearlayout

if you decide you are a custom company and want to have multiple versioning of the software and database that is fine just make sure you charge the full cost for it - factor in that you may need to maintain multiple levels of source code and databases and factor in that upgrade are going to take many multiples of effort to rollout as you will need to test each client s code base

or just take the container an absolute positioned div with height and width that you want and and position the image too and assign the image a higher z-index and then assign the opacity you want

12269796
ubuntu	linux
since rails 3.1 a javascript runtime has been needed for development on linux ubuntu

for development on linux ubuntu itâ s best to install the node.js server-side javascript environment

i would like the behavior the same as in google-chrome where an event is triggered by the img when it is clicked which is ignored by firefox

12270108
folder	directory
if you put the migrate.exe in a separate tools folder like im doing it needs the correct version of the entityframework.dll in the same directory as migrate.exe it will need the clause and you should specify the name of the assembly without the path like

12270267
getter	setter
my customview has a bunch of setter and getter

12270291
width	margin
the auto value for the margin css property will work only if a width is set

12270302
children	parent
on a certain event where a tabbed element get highlighted or selected i want to disable the click function below and all click functions for the parent button and all the children elements within the column

12270305
google-chrome	firefox
in mozilla firefox it displays the image in center while in google-chrome it displays it of left-middle of the screen.

12270305
width	height
i e max height width .

12270320
packets	pcap
it currently writes only in pcap format which means there s a 24-byte header at the beginning of the file giving information such as the link-layer header type for packets in the file so the first thing you d need to do would be to subtract 24 from the size of the file

12270320
packets	pcap
therefore what you should do is write a program use libpcap as it already knows pcap format and you don t have to write your own code to understand it that reads all the packets and adds up the length of the packets field it s the len field in the struct pcap_pkthdr structure

12270360
google-chrome	firefox
firefox ie8 9 and google-chrome all run with the desired effect

12270399
width	height
jquery assumes that any element that has a width and height of 0 is already hidden and therefore wont try and hide it again with a fade-out

12270399
google-chrome	firefox
now why it was working in firefox and google-chrome is a different issue but might be relevant to what you re doing

12270399
width	height
i am setting the width and height of my divs dynamically by examining the dimensions of an img file that is contained in it

12270399
google-chrome	firefox
i was using the direct .width and .height properties on the elements which works in firefox and google-chrome but ie likely doesnt set those properties for images and for ie i was getting back 0

12270403
min	max
to allow the browser to scale your content you need to set user-scalable yes then to disable zoom you can set the min and max scale to the same value so it cannot shrink or grow

12270403
min	max
android 4.x same rule apply as 2.3.x except the min and max scales are not honored anymore and if you use user-scalable yes the user can always zoom setting it to no means your own scale is ignored this is the issue i m facing now that drew me to this question.

12270403
min	max
you don t need min and max since you can switch off zooming in the expected manner

12270403
min	max
chrome scales work as expected like they do in ios min and max are honored and you can switch off zooming by using user-scalable no

12270412
post	get
i saw a few post about get columns from subqueries most of them suggest use a single select for each column but this is my case

12270416
portrait	landscape
i am allowing the user to use the hardware camera button to take a picture which may be accomplished in either portrait or landscape mode

12270427
versioning	upgrade
so after we ran some tests we upgrade the ibm data dll to versioning 9.7.6.2

12270433
rss	feed
what you can however do is host the whole calendar yourself and if the user has outlook or similiar to subscribe to that rss feed

12270437
button	checkbox
when user clicks the button i need a modal dialog to display a message containing a hyperlink to an agreement doc and a checkbox for the user to confirm they ve read an agreement

12270437
button	checkbox
after closing the dialog if then the continue button opens the same dialog loop until checkbox is clicked

12270440
tiff	bmp
you need to use bmp or possibly uncompressed tiff

12270440
bmp	png
i think if it were me i d use bmp scan the pixels for changes and construct a png where everything except the changes were transparent

12270461
post	get
so if i am inserting a news item that can be read by restricted and confidential i would set read_roles to have a value of 2 | 4 or 6 and when i want to get back the news post that a particular user can see i can use a query like

12270462
children	parent
1500 objects with an average of 13 properties per object and an average of 3 object within each of the 1500 parent object as children also being populated with an average of 13 properties a piece - boast these times for my comparison

12270473
factors	matrix
factorization is the decomposition of an object for example a number a polynomial or a matrix into a product of other objects or factors which when multiplied together give the original

12270509
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox but it doesn t in ie9-7 nor google-chrome

12270580
int	boolean
effectively you can fit four or more boolean columns for one int column eight or more for a bigint

12270629
inherited	subclassing
might want to watch for subclassing of known valid types though as even if they inherited from a valid serializable type their implementation may not be

12270629
serializable	deserialization
in fact you may want to separate out the serializable deserialization aspects to their own discrete method class so you can feed in other serializable or be more clear from the stack trace where the issue is or simply to make your methods do one thing and one thing only but any more rewriting refactoring is really left for code-review anyway and not valid much for the question at hand

12270645
stdout	stderr
stdout stderr

12270645
stdout	stderr
however this solution doesn t generalise to the case where you want to do this for both stdout and stderr while satisfying the following

12270645
stdout	stderr
the output from stdout stderr should go to the parent process stdout stderr respectively

12270645
stderr	fflush	stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush
the order between stdout and stderr lines should not be changed i m not quite sure how that would even work if the subprocess fflush its stdout and stderr caches at different intervals

12270667
vbscript	jscript
i am writing the script in jscript but i have reproduced the problem in vbscript as well

12270737
subtract	add
subtract that from the overall price to get the cents and then use the case statement add the correct .05 or .09 back to the price

12270739
implements	extends
but even then it s useless as an abstract factory because the way that you implements a new concrete version of the factory is by creating a new class that extends inputstream

12270750
hide	show
i m trying to do a simple hide show effect depending on what radio button is checked

12270750
hide	show
i want the hidden table #reprint_oui to show when the user clicks oui ...and hide if non is selected

12270778
uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
one of these is a uibutton that calls when touchupinside one is a uisegmentedcontrol that calls when valuechanges

12270778
uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
what i need to do is to ask if sender is a uibutton or if sender is a uisegmentedcontrol

12270788
multiplying	add
if the int is odd multiplying it by three and add one

12270793
superclass	subclassing
so far what i have thought of doing is making an invoice superclass with a customer and vehicle subclassing since vehicle information and customer information is on the invoice

12270822
onchange	onkeyup
you can change with onkeyup or onchange

12270862
submit	submission
if you re submission the form without using the form s submit handler then the wymupdate class won t work and you won t get the implicit wym.xhtml call which means that some necessary html cleanup might not occur

12270880
portrait	landscape
on an ipad when i change its orientation from portrait to landscape the page will continuously reload with the portrait orientation all is well

12270885
stdout	stderr
create two readers as above one for stdout one for stderr and start each in a new thread

12270984
stdout	stderr
i made a second attempt specifying both stdout and stderr

12270995
screens	tablet
note this works fine on my kindle fire and 7 tablet where the screens size is 600x1024 ish

12271021
feof	fread
either check the return of fread or call feof to check your status or both

12271051
google-chrome	firefox
for example i d like to be able to run it on google-chrome firefox etc

12271069
hide	show
so this will either show or hide all drugs

12271085
width	height
while loading the image of size 767 x 1105 on a phone layout with resolution 320 x 480 the image width fits the device width but the height of the image is stretched which disturbs an aspect ratio

12271105
post	get
i am trying to get swfupload to properly upload an image to my server along with other post data that must come with the image

note the button validation was a good idea you should try to get it to work using sriks answer on the other post suppress setformat

superclass	subclassing
if you are saying subclassing are both using a date field for different purposes you mentioned they are called different names then you should probably declare it in the subclassing themselves and not use a superclass field for more than 1 purpose otherwise this will be very confusing in the long-run

if you use pdo- prepare why not do in the pdo- execute array params parameter binding

12271316
superclass	subclassing
another important thing i can say is that you shouldn t build a hierarchy of elements that aren t relationed for example you shouldn t build a superclass vehicle and two subclassing car and horse maybe you think they share some features but they aren t in the same category of elements a more studied hierarchy is better in that case

and finally you might be able to leverage a translation tool that is following the in-place localized replacement of strings in source files and then recompile localization technique as opposed to the extract strings out to resources technique...which is the more common one

12273192

you can use jquery to get the computed width and height of any element

say you have an image of dimensions width by height and desired margins of left right top and bottom

12273365
width	height
allocate a buffer of width + left + right by height + top + bottom filled with zeros

keydown	keyup
rather than trying to react directly to the keydown event i d suggest you use the keydown and keyup events to maintain a list of which keys are presently down

12273538
keydown	keyup
you ll notice that this lets you handle multiple keys at once if the user presses the left and up arrows together and the problem of delay between subsequent keydown events when a key is held down goes away since all you really care about is whether a keyup has occurred

12273577
lzo	snappy

someone else recommended using invokeandwait ... instead of invokelater ... but this can be risky especially if you inadvertently make this call from within the swing event thread itself

width	height
there are some little differences across browsers on how this method works but for the height and width properties it works the same

12273672

i found some information on this post which helped a lot - and using encodeuricomponent as shown above i was able to get the form to submit without a problem

your issue is simply that the tuples that maxratio deals with are typed by you int int double but that one such tuple is constructed as n phi n ratio

although that url will be shown as original characters in google-chrome and firefox it is an encoded string in ie

this works ok in firefox but in google-chrome it only dumps data as it reaches 2k

12273866
stdout	stderr
i m working in a windows cmd.exe environment and would like to change the output of stdout to match that of stderr so that i can pipe error messages to other programs without the intermediary of a file

12273866
stdout	stderr
i m aware of the notation but that combines stdout and stderr into a single stream

12273866
stdout	stderr
but that combines stdout and stderr just like

12273964
put	get
to access the different fields it invokes get put methods on hashmap

12273964
getter	setter
therefore it is faster than code generated java beans because there i will have to access the getter setter methods using reflection

12274046
backgrounding	multitasking
the nature of what may be done in the backgrounding and for how-long is well documented and supported by any version of ios that supports multitasking

12274051
submit	submission
that s because when you submit the form with it still runs the submit handler which unconditionally prevents the form from submission

12274088
implements	extends
finally i had to write my own class which extends gesturedetector.and you can implements scale by yourself

12274145
stdout	stderr
you want to first redirect 2 stderr to 1 stdout then redirect 1 stdout to something else

12274145
stdout	stderr
at this point stderr will still be redirected to the previous definition of stdout

12274145
stdout	stderr
the pipe will still work with the old definition of stdout which now contains stderr

12274145
stdout	stderr
if you still want to see stdout on the console but you only want to pipe stderr to find then you can redirect 1 to con

12274145
stdout	stderr
it is possible to truly swap stdout and stderr if you use a 3rd initially unused file handle

12274145
stdout	stderr
1 and 3 will contain original definition of stderr and 2 will contain original definition of stdout

12274145
stdout	stderr
but saves the original definition of stderr in 4 3 has already been used and saves the original definition of stdout in 5

12274145
stdout	stderr
so technically the explicit redirection of 3 is not needed to swap stderr and stdout

12274145
stdout	stderr
saves stderr in 3 and 2 is redirected to 1 stdout

12274145
stdout	stderr
saves stdout in 4 and 1 is redirected to 3 stderr

12274164
width	height
the image had to be translated by half it s width height along the axis it was being rotated

12274175
width	height
these values reflect the actual dimensions of the source mediastream and can differ from the width and height attributes of the element as rendered on the page

12274175
google-chrome	firefox
this approach seems to work well in google-chrome and firefox nightly

12274224
width	margin
so if you have width 400 padding left 20 right 10 margin 20 10 on each side and 4 pixels of border 2 on each side your whole box will be

12274232
width	border-box
border-box the width of the element includes the padding and border

12274232
width	border-box
while the border-box model will set the width of the div to

12274233
children	parent
now what i am trying to do but can t seem to figure out is how to display a count of the children from the implied collection children in the parent object

12274294
put	get
what you want to do is put jquery into a folder you designate as a library folder rather than a source folder libraries don t get validated by the javascript validator builder you ll see it on the project s properties dialog s builder page

each button has width 27 and height 40

12274579

change the width and height of jquery slider

12274582
put	get
sometimes values more complex than primitives and you will want to prune the json returned or sometimes you will want to put multiple actions into a single class sometimes you get back a complicated structure and by pruning it certain ways you can make your work on the client easier

int	chars
define a procedure pick that takes a non-empty string s and a non-negative int i and returns a substring of length one consisting of the chars at index i in s

12274669
folder	directory
it s in a folder called project1 this is what my directory view looks like

12274673
min	max
bad news batch files cannot control whether their own window is min or max

12274673
min	max
this must be done when calling a batch file at which time you can tell it to run min max or neither default

12274673
min	max
only when starting a new batch can you control if that one will be min max or normal

12274688
folder	directory
and check if in the folder if file is successfully uploaded in the directory

12274715
min	max
group by lets you use aggregate functions like avg max min

12274757
screens	tablet
that means you can scale up for small screens ie stretch or scale down for the latest tablet that have near desktop resolution

12274802
folder	dir
alternatively you can hack it by trying to do something like a dir of a folder like windows on a computer that s part of the domain

docx	xlsx
hence now you should be able to get the open in.. option for pdf doc docx ppt pptx xls xlsx

12274804
jar	manifest.mf
the manifest.mf file in your jar should specify the main-class and the classpath

12274804
ant	maven	jar	manifest.mf
you would probably want to use an automatic build tool like ant maven or gradle in order to generate the manifest.mf file in your jar that way

unsigned integers declared unsigned shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer see footnote 41

12275310
integer	unsigned
footnote 41 this implies that unsigned arithmetic does not overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type

and generate the setter getter stubs of lines

12275914
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
the former has many advantages it can t leave partially written file around it can t leave both files around it is very fast and if you use it to rename over old file there is no period where the target name wouldn t exist the last is posix semantics and windows can do it on ntfs but not fat filesystems

you must create an accessor method for example getid which will then return the value of id properties

12276237
int	boolean
the last two statements compare boolean against an int

12276237
int	boolean
by placing parts of your expression in brackets those parts get evaluated first and you end up with comparing int and boolean

if the extension uses standard magento getter setter maybe may work too

12276371
getter	setter
the varien_object class defines the standard getter setter i was talking about so yes you can also use to get the value

calculation of the next double involves computing a large int based on the seed and dividing it by another constant large int and the magnitude of the result is mostly affected by the magnitude of the int

int	double
there is another problem that you implicitly convert the double into int

12296880
width	height
this will also keep the node in place and image width height

12296888
width	height
the problem is due to the fact that you have not defined the height and width attributes of the elements

12296888
width	height
as per the html specification the canvas element has two attributes to control the size of the coordinate space width and height

12296888
width	height
the width attribute defaults to 300 and the height attribute defaults to 150.

12296888
width	height
so your default width and height is getting set to 300 and 150 and because of the your top left bottom right attributes in rect it is going out of the canvas size

12296888
width	height
set it explicitly to a larger width and height and you will see your rectangles

12296895

so i figured i can disable the combobox on mouseover and re-enable it on mouseout

12297107
nsstream	nsoutputstream
the only way you can do it is register your application as voip type the most problematic part because if your app is not a messenger conference social type app apple may refuse it and then use nsstream in couple with nsinputstream nsoutputstream and interface to send receive heartbeat

finally you iterate over your arraylist with a for-loop and write the contents of the arrays to the dataoutputstream preceded or followed by the additional data you need to add for each chunk

12297383
int	double
double is bad as we can lose some data precision biginteger is good but only for int values

12297385
int	chars
i would probably write a helper function int is_vowel chars c

i use ajax for call remote webpage this works on firefox google-chrome and ie correctly

12297852
jobs	cron

int	double
then you have to know that in the xxxtablemodel is stored only string value or double or long or int or icon depends of value stored in comboboxmodel for combo box as an editor

12298273
mouseout	mouseenter
use jquery hover instead of mouseenter mouseout

12298277
mouseover	mouseout
because the mouseover and mouseout events bubble they will trigger multiple times as you mouseover and mouseout of child elements of the element your event handlers are watching

12298277
mouseleave	mouseenter
jquery provides the ie-inspired mouseenter and mouseleave events which only trigger for mouse events on the watched elements themselves and are not triggered for events on the element s children

12298277
mouseover	mouseleave
use the mouseover and mouseleave events and your code will work as expected

12298277
mouseleave	mouseenter
alternatively use the jquery hover syntax which internally uses the mouseenter and mouseleave events wrapped in a convenient syntax

12298344
super	extends
then extends it in subclasses by calling super

12298345
hide	show
i have a form with several buttons that i hide and show as needed

12298347

therefore the movement of superview in it s parent s coordinate space does not effect it s children

12298587
for-loop	loops
then i tried to use a for-loop that loops in 4912 but it gives me number like

12298606

you can use maven-shade-plugin instead of maven-assembly-plugin to merge these files correcly as described here

12298620
google-chrome	firefox
- it s great debugging - at least in firefox and google-chrome

12298623
super	extends
a good way to think about extends and super in generics is in terms of assignment t extends foo will accept any type t that you could use on the right hand side of an assignment to foo without casting

12298678
fileoutputstream	filewriter
along those lines you should at least consider using outputstreamwriter wrapping a fileoutputstream instead of filewriter - that way you can specify the encoding to use utf-8

12298810
google-chrome	firefox

12298824
int	double
the built-in data types int long and even double can t hold the result of that calculation

12298828

12299179
google-chrome	firefox
i use google-chrome but it should be very similar with firefox

12299273

i think it s quite a frequent task to define the layout where the guiding role of the sizing during measure pass of the layout conditionaly swithces from children to parent and back

12299274
google-chrome	firefox
the problem happens in all ie google-chrome firefox

12299294

12304032
oncreate	findviewbyid	oncreate	recreate
in other words until activity recreate you always get same object when you call findviewbyid so better practice is to get it once in oncreate and reuse variable

12304609
maven	pom.xml
i d also like to be able to easily use it with maven which it s also not set up for so i d like to include a maven pom.xml that describes its dependencies

maven	pom.xml
i looked at the layout of various mavenized jars and found that they seem to include the pom.xml in meta-inf maven groupid artifactid

12304609
jar	manifest.mf
i think but not 100 sure that i m probably misreading bnd s documentation on -include - it looks like it might be for including extra manifest directives in the resulting manifest.mf rather than including extra files in the jar

12306012
filtering	grouping
1st added a custom grouping field to django_filters.filter and a filter_grouped method almost copy of filtering method

the things might go more complicated if the int s are long s or the double is float since there are long values that cannot be represented by double s so loss of accuracy might happen for large double values in this case and in any case - large double values are less accurate

12306353
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu packages are named slightly different

12306353

12306449
fflush	gets
example the garbage collector may decide that there are candidates but because it considers that there is plenty of memory still to be had that it might be too expensive time wise to fflush them out at that point in time and it will wait until memory pressure gets higher

12306459

what i ve tried is creating a dependencies solution folder within the solution itself and added the dlls to it that way they belong to the solution even though they don t belong to the directory structure of the solution

12306492

superclass	subclassing
subclassing can override superclass behaviour like using method overriding like templatetypedef ted hop answer

12306706
width	height
so you either need to define the size explicitly with width and height well not the solution we re looking for or you need to install the python imaging library to let the converter identify the image size automatically

12306802
public	protected
i don t like to change it to public because it will cause that blockbase will be visible from outside the parent class but changing visibility to protected doesn t change anything because i parent class don t have inherited classes

12307053
superclass	subclassing
up-casting a reference from subclassing to superclass serves no real function and in fact will generally be a no-op internally

12307053

12307244
ant	maven
you embed only one property file and this one is created during build with ant or maven

12307244
ant	maven
you must configure a lot of ant tasks maven target in order to build for specific environment

12307244
ant	maven
this one foo.properties will only have placeholders for values and values will be inferred within it using foo.env.properties with the right ant task maven target

12307248
folder	directory
about zend framework i downloaded the zip file and extracted the contents of the zf bin directory to c xampp php that means zf.sh zf.bat and zf.php and all the library folder content to c xampp php pear zend so those are in the right path to be used

12307253
bionic	libc
this should dynamically link to the bionic libc and should enable android driver development

12307702
jsf	seam
i m using jsf 2 without seam

12307702
jsf	seam
i could dive into the spring seam and struts examples but for a pure ee 6 developer it s a lot of overhead and with a better understanding of this issue i can produce a simple working jsf only example which i will make available to the socialauth team for use on google code

12307725
uiview	cashapelayer
you could assign your path to a cashapelayer such as wrapping it in a uiview subclass that returns cashapelayer as its +layerclass

12307737
openssl	gnutls
the subversion that comes with el 6 is linked against gnutls which is a change from older releases which linked against openssl

12307737
openssl	gnutls
you could also try building subversion from the source code and using openssl instead of gnutls in the configuration

12307743
actionscript	mxml
css styles are set a little differently in actionscript versus mxml

12307779
onresume	onpause
you may want to move your code to onpause and onresume respectively or maybe you shall use intentservice instead if you dot require any ui for the task

12307791
free	malloc
or use malloc but be aware that you ll need to free this memory later

12307863
cos	sin
finally another approach is to use a taylor expansion for cos theta and sin theta theta

width	height
so basically i want to scale the width down to 512 then add an equal amount of transparency in the height both above and below the original image

12307937
maven-plugin	pom.xml
check that your pom.xml file does include maven-plugin

12307969
ubuntu	linux
im using ubuntu linux if its neccesary i might tommorow check kernel version mono 2.8.3 visual studio 2008 and project in .net 3.5

12308002
for-loop	loops
if i understand your question correctly you could just use a while loops instead of your for-loop like

12308018
width	height
the wrappings part works fine the box will drop to the next line when there is not enought width for it to fit however there is a gap between the first row element and the second row element if the height are different

12308079
versioning	upgrade
note i won t be able to update these versioning to the latest versioning available because multiple teams are using the old versioning of these files and they dont want to upgrade to the latest

12308080
onmousedown	onmouseup	onclick	onmouseup	onclick	onmousedown
i want to add an onclick onmousedown onmouseup etc. event to

12308088
public	protected
this option in turn breaks down in many possibilities making dootherthing public easy to test but not safe as we might not want to expose the internal substeps of the operation to the outside making it internal as alski points out making it protected virtual and using a partial mock in your test to the verify the collaboration between the 2 methods

12308133
int	chars
the reason why you get 49 is because it s a chars code of the 1 symbol and not it s int representation

12308193
srp	principles
it follows basic srp principles

12308242
int	chars
you get a chars chars from read not an int

12308271
inherited	subclassing
you either need to use inherited to make b a subclassing of a so that a b is an a or use composition and then refer to the appropriate subobject

12308278
many-to-many	one-to-many
if you had an employees and departments table in your database with a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship then you would have appropriate foreign keys configured

12308282
int	chars
now that you have a string you can use int.parse or int.tryparse to turn a string containing entirely numeric chars into an int

12308400
oncreate	ondestroy
if i bind my service in the oncreate of an activity but i don t unbind it in onstop or ondestroy i get the error

12308472
flip	slide
from what i can make out you need to simply flip the loops that create the sides in the slideshow so that it makes the last slide where it was making the first

12308493
gridview	rowdatabound
i would bind the datatable to the gridview and handle via the rowdatabound event

12308508
iboutlet	ibaction
at this point i began to wire the iboutlet and ibaction in the pasted view in the new xib file

12308508
iboutlet	ibaction
although i see the iboutlet in the file s owner and connect them properly the function for the ibaction is never called when i press the button

12308514
for-loop	arrays
and then i want to use a for-loop to generate the arrays names and output certain elements of the arrays and or the whole arrays itself like so.

12308537
percentile	max
very strange that you wish to do this on the client you could very easily sort and get the value of the 85th percentile on the server where you are actually sending the data from and use it as a max value for the y axis

12308554
jcheckbox	jpopupmenu
edit if you want to put this in a popup menu note that jpopupmenu is a jcomponent therefore you can put anything there including normal jcheckbox

12308565
postgresql	greenplum
in ruby i have a test that s a subclass of activesupport testcase and access a table through an activerecord subclass in a postgresql actually greenplum database

12308633
expander	grid
you ve got the expander sitting it column #1 of a 2-column grid

12308633
expander	grid
just removing that auto should fix your problem and make the expander content fill 50 of the space available to the root grid

12308677
ostringstream	std
in c++ you ought to use std string for strings instead of char arrays and std stringstream and its cousins std istringstream and std ostringstream instead of sprintf or snprintf for formatting in string buffers

12308718
getter	setter
keep in mind getter and setter

12308753
width	height
1 width and height size image - i improved

12308755
base-class	subclassing
the subclassing might rely on its base-class s invariants to protect its own invariants and if the base-class constructor has not completed then its invariants may not hold

12308771
websphere	ibm
i know out of my head that apache activemq has ajax support and the same goes at least partially for ibm websphere mq as well as jboss hornetq

12308783
int	chars
with list you need to convert to chars when using that example or you get the int coding of the factor variable

12308794
ant	maven
3 build tools like ant maven etc

12308813
min	max
i m trying to change where the pointers min and max are pointer to but it seems that the change is not sticking outside the function s scope after the function has run

12308813
min	max
before running the function i set min and max to point to a double m 0

12308815
uitableview	reloaddata
calls reloaddata only when you create a new instance of uitableview or

12308843
width	height
if you still want to use a null layout you have to set the width and height of the component not just its x and y position see the setsize method

12308852
versioning	upgrade
my advice is to not upgrade in-place but instead install the newer plone versioning to another directory create a new instance and copy the data.fs file from the old site over to the new one

12308856
pop-up	dialog
anoother way solve the issue of the keyboard type i would pop-up a native dialog with a textfield and set the keyboard type of this field to the one you need

12308866
min	max
send an array a pointer like thing to retain the min and max values

12308866
min	max
well sort of but you re asking for a pointer to the array element that is min and max not the actual value

12308866
min	max
but your caller appears to want the actual address within the array of the max and min values unless this was a mistake due to being new to pointers

12308900
integer	unsigned
look at the context property of gkscore - which is a 64-bit unsigned integer - that way you may be able to assign different values for the context for different levels and filter that data when you get the scores from leader boards this will probably require you to use your own ui to display high scores rather than the generic gkleaderboardviewcontroller - good luck and let me know how it goes

12309000
children	parent
you can add to the has_many relationship which would delete the children of the parent when the parent is destroyed

12309015
post	get
if you don t get an answer please try and post back if i have time i ll do the same

12309043
width	height
in this i m using rectangles with no width height to mark the sides of the brick

in my case i just wanted to post the binary file directly with no multipart junk so i just put the include .

12309074
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works in everything that i have been able to test firefox google-chrome opera safari

12309074
width	height
the reason why your original version would have been extending beyond the bounds in internet explorer is due to the difference between browsers when calculating a percentage width height of a child when padding is applied to the parent element

12309080
processors	hyperthreading
which leads me to believe there may be something wrong with my computer or something dealing with how my processors deals with threads due to its hyperthreading ability

12309115
getter	setter
having them defined by attr_accessor only guarantees that you ll have setter and getter and roseburg which has nothing to do with rails s mass-assignment checks

12309127
post	get

getter	setter
getter and setter are highly overused

12310891
getter	setter
iâ ve seen millions of people claiming that public fields are evil so they make them private and provide getter and setter for all of them

12310891
getter	setter
iâ m not in favor of public fields but against making a getter setter or property for everyone of them and then claiming that doing that is encapsulation or information hidingâ ha

12310891
getter	setter
it is when some side effect occurs within the property getter setter that the question is a little more difficult to answer

12310893

12311261
antivirus	rootkit
the problem with implementing an antivirus as an entirely userland construct is that malware usually runs at a higher privilege and so can easily evade detection this is why rootkit infections are so difficult to deal with nuke it from orbit it s the only way to be sure

12311261
antivirus	norton
you might get away with this in vm-based systems where a program s behavior can be easily analysed such as locating calls to system functions of use to malware but a good virus is going to be written in a native language making detection very hard if not impossible back when i used norton antivirus their bloodhound heuristics system never worked and always generated too many false-positives

12311494
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops

12312009
factors	matrix
you could factors the matrix into eigenvalues and eigenvectors

12312048

getter	setter
the property keyword is a feature used to indicate to the compiler and to the class user that there will be getter and setter methods for that property. in this case there is an expectation that there will be a getter method called foo and a setter method called setfoo

12312447
getter	setter
the synthesize keyword tells the compiler to synthesize a generic getter and setter method as opposed to you providing your own

12312447
getter	setter
there maybe some additional features that the compiler provides in the synthesized getter and setter but that is the gist of it

if the taskproperty class is decorated with datacontract attribute and with datamember attribute for each property the deserialization is much faster than when it is decorated with serializable attribute

12316966
serializable	deserialization
using serializable attribute the deserialization is very slow it takes about 30 seconds

12316966
serializable	deserialization
furthermore if the deserialization is preceded by the serializable of an object of the same type obviously with different contents the serializable is slow while the deserialization is fast

12316966

in a similar way if serializable is preceded by deserializing an object of the same type the deserialization is slow while the serializable is fast

if the padding is critical you might want to try setting box-sizing to border-box but i didn t notice anything other than the elimination of the rubber banding of your items

12319309
width	height
some improvements can be made e.g you can store the width and height values of the view in a local variable to avoid calling getwidth and getheight all the time but you can only do this in specific places like inside your activities onwindowfocuschanged callback otherwise getwidth and getheight will return 0

12319533
subobject	instances
in my company we do enough work with jaxb that it was worth writing an xjc plugin which generated safe versions of every getter that were guaranteed to return non-null values for any non-trivial value immutable instances in the case that a subobject did not really exist

12319556
screens	mdpi
if you want to support multiple screens sizes you should provide also ldpi mdpi and xhdpi versions of your image

the encryption or hash creation always uses the latest salt algorithm but the decode verify function always uses the algorithm specified in the record

12319686
processors	hyperthreading
i was reading a book which says that a processors with single core and no hyperthreading can process only one process at a time so a doubt arises that when we do so many operations on a pc and also some background processes are always there then why not music player stops in between for short while

12319723
getter	setter
note that it doesn t help to have threadsafe getter setter for the dictionary if the items contained aren t threadsafe themselves

12319757
ireport	subreports
so i compiled them with ireport 2.0.7 and used them compiled the only version working with my java class is the one compiled from ireport 2.0.7 problem there is no possibility of adding new band for another subreports

12319757
ireport	subreports
i compile subreports using ireport 2.0.7 and the main report i designed with ireport 4.5.1 containing many bands and many subreports and i compile the main report by the first code

12319946
implements	extends
each widget implements an interface that extends iswidget

12319946
implements	extends
if the widget is very simple i will have a single class that extends composite and implements the interface

12319946
implements	extends
there will be a presenter class that implements the public interface of the widget a view interface that extends iswidget that the presenter depends on and a view widget that implements the view interface

12319946
mvp	presenter
there are many files that get created for all the interfaces and implementations in mvp but the abstraction is absolutely worth it because they enable easy unit testing of presenter and allow you to change how the top-level interface financialchart in this example is implemented change from a single composite class to mvp with no client needing to change

12319949
ubuntu	linux
i was not able to reproduce this on my linux system ubuntu 12.04 intel i7-3770k quadcore ht see screenshots below

12322445
integer	unsigned
this is an unsigned 32 bit integer type

12322445
integer	unsigned
your code could define word to represent an unsigned 64 bit integer if it chose

12322486
put	get	post	get	post	put
what happens is the constraint kind of fakes in the method so that this route will only match the default get post put and delete methods

12322567
datamapper	activerecord
i used datamapper s syntax here for record deletion please adapt to activerecord

12322568

12322626
dbcontext	objectcontext
one of the overloads for dbcontext takes an existing objectcontext

12322626
dbcontext	objectcontext
i thought this would allow me to wrap my existing objectcontext in a dbcontext and expose my existing entityobjects through idbset properties

12322626
inherited	properties
unfortunately when creating the dbcontext the idbset properties are not created and instead an exception is thrown with a message of verify that the type was defined as a class is not primitive nested or generic and does not inherited from entityobject.

12322626
dbcontext	objectcontext
it seems strange that i can create a dbcontext with an objectcontext but not expose the entities themselves

12322672
dlsym	dlopen
and then you dynamically load your library with dlopen giving a full path like some file path to generated.so and probably the rtld_now flag to it and you have to use dlsym to find relevant symbols inside

12322687
versioning	upgrade
is it possible to upgrade my project to kobold2d 2.0.3 i know that the newer versioning uses opengles 2.0 and cocos2d 2.x

12322714
titlebar	window
i know it s also possible to do it by making a borderless window and drawing everything myself but i don t think that s how pixelmator is doing it because they still get all the additional bits that comes with the standard nswindow titlebar

this is the code i added to show the new column and hide the previous

12322927
width	height
if anything still isn t resizing properly adjust its constraints so that its width and or height is no longer constant

12322927
put	get
for example if you put a button next to another button at the appropriate distance you ll get a blue line across that distance and if you drop it you ll create a constraint that those two buttons must remain that distance from each other

12322948
put	get
you can put a limit 1 clause at the end of the query to only get the first row which has the biggest value of difference

12322993
post	get
the model the view is bound to is the model that is expected to be procesed on an post action and is the model that i want to assign the value on the view or on the previous get action

post	get
i just want to pass a value a from get action to view assign model.a a and then process the model with a attached to it on post action

12323039
puts	gets
but since we don t know what it is we can create a spring factorybean which just gets locationrepository from the app context via autowiring and puts it back into the app context under a new name

12323040
sorting	filtering
the biggest downfall of this approach is it s complexity and the risk that my own sorting filtering algorithm won t match sqlite s

12323056
public	protected
so this won t let you circumvent public get but protected set properties you can t make a property only initialized via this method

also i do not want to use something like visual studio i want this to be installed simply so i can create c++ projects using editors like vim and emacs

12323331
.htaccess	httpd.conf
the short answer is no you can t just use setenv dev 1 in httpd.conf and then use ifdefine to detect it in your .htaccess which would seem intuitive and reasonable based on the syntax and nature of programming logic any of us are used to

12323378
versioning	upgrade
the adt stop compiling my app nothing else changed reading a lot seems that this upgrade was the problem one of the most important think its that i didn t find how to downgrade the java versioning o fix this issue can t update to the java se 7 because android its based on java se 6 more accurately on apache harmony that doesn t support completely java se 6

sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
another solution to this problem is to modify sudoers file and add your account to it and state that you should never be asked for the sudo passwd

12323611
sudoers	visudo
i would suggest reading the man page for sudoers and visudo before going this route

12323650
war	manifest.mf
when war is created it has manifest.mf file with the default content

12323650
war	manifest.mf
so when the war is created it should also have build revision number head revision number of svn and the manifest.mf in the war should look like this

12323856
rational-numbers	fractions
the api z3_mk_numeral expects a string which encodes a rational-numbers in decimal format 1.3 or fractions format 1 3

12323870
integer	unsigned
you don t say explicitly but i assume your library is integer only and the unsigned longs are 32 bit and binary not decimal

12323870
multiplying	add
for each of the unsigned long ints in your bignum multiplying by the current multiplier and add it to the result then multiplying your multiplier by pow 2.0 32 4294967296.0 for 32 bits or pow 2.0 64 18446744073709551616.0 for 64 bits

12323870
int	double
you need to use 2 even if the number of bits in your int type is larger than the precision of a double since the number of used bits in the most significant value might only be 1

12323882
google-chrome	firefox
but the problem came when i tested it in firefox and google-chrome

12323890
textmate	sublimetext
coda ships with it and there exist textmate and sublimetext plugins several of the core team members use sublimetext and i hear it s pretty good.

12323972
integer	unsigned
first convert the most significant integer s into an unsigned long long

12323972
int	double
for converting from a double to a biginteger first seperate the mantissa into a double m and the exponent into an int e using frexp

12323972
multiplying	add
if performance is a concern you can add an overload to your bignum class for multiplying by which simply returns

12324058
google-chrome	firefox
this works well in firefox but google-chrome seems to ignore the 5 part and renders it just like it was 700

12324060
int	chars	int	double
it should operate on chars int floats and double

12324069
sudo	passwd
you can save file with some anonymous name then pass into stdin of sudo the user passwd like

pseudo-class	visited
then you won t need to specify the link and visited pseudo-class since you can basically guarantee that all your remaining elements are links

12324386
subset-sum	np-complete
then your problem is equivalent to choosing signs for the d_i to minimize the sum which is equivalent to finding a subset of the d_i which sum to half the total sum which is equivalent to subset-sum which is np-complete

12324404
perl	tcl
its claim to fame is that it was written in c especially for perl not a port from tcl or bindings to something else

12324448

uiview	subviews
also make sure that the textfield is a subviews of the uiview

12324827
inherited	properties
however you could argue that those properties should then be part of the parent and inherited by the child

12324827
children	parent
given that your validation rules will be stored in a db you could write a method in the parent that would allow the children to retrieve the validation rule s for their properties

you have set although you have 6 numbers and you have so if you calculate it only runs the loop 3 times because if you add the -- before the operator it will first subtract 1 and then compare

12325296
width	margin
set your total width for each left-floated child div to the correct fraction using for left or right margin or padding so that they equal 100

on submit i get a 200 and post looks fine i can see the fields in the post but nothing happens

12325424
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
in google-chrome and safari it all works ok but in ie firefox not so much

12325470
accessor	properties
that d be useful if you want your data objects to include methods beyond just the accessor for the entity s properties

12325479
public	protected
oh i see you need a constructor that has more access than protected but less than public

12325519
google-chrome	firefox
i am testing in google-chrome and firefox

12325529
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
is that supported in all common browsers ie firefox google-chrome safari

12325533
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
three of them are regular uiviewcontroller but one is a uinavigationcontroller

12325579
width	height
the formula is area height width and so that is what i have entered

12325579
width	height
however the outcome is not actually answering height width

12325592
width	height
the behavior of double.parse is deterministic so you are assigning the same value to height and width

12325618
.htaccess	httpd.conf
all resources i am looking into mention either php.ini or .htaccess or httpd.conf files for setting configurations and stuff

12325629
width	height
re assigning the height value to temporary then assigning the width value to temporary

12325684
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you can enable or disable the use of .htaccess files in your httpd.conf file

12325686
google-chrome	firefox
here s a drag and drop from desktop to browser using jquery firefox and google-chrome

12325710
intersect	contains
you can write it by yourself just remember that two areas intersect if their areas overlay not just when one contains the x and y coordinates for which you are testing

12325710
intersect	contains
it already has contains and intersect methods you need

12325744
width	height
assuming you have an class named box with three parameters length width and height and that you have created a strongly-typed collection containing instances of this class

12325752
inherited	properties
if invoice inherited transaction then it is a kind of transaction and the compiler requires it to inherited all of its properties

12325774
public	protected
you can hide the transaction as a protected or private member of the invoice and expose manipulate it using the public properties of invoice

12325783
pop-up	dialog
and a dialog pop-up telling me that it can t rename the folder and what to try to get it to work

12325791
accessor	properties
in javascript it seems like using properties accessor is not all that common unlike in other oo languages such as java for example

12325791
getter	setter
even in a dynamic language i think the principles of using getter and setter apply the same way they do to statically typed oo languages encapsulation adding validation restricting access etc

12325834
accessor	properties
javascript has intercept-able properties accessor

12325861
post	get
it requires you to get accustomed to working with those technologies -- forms get post requests and ajax

12325872
getter	setter
it is not necessary to use getter and setter with prototypal structure as you can simply set an object by well setting it to a value and get it by calling it as a value

12325882
post	get
so option two would not be a good fit for millions of comments i ve never seen a site with a million of comments per post but reddit does get over 5k for popular post

12325893
getter	setter
getter and setter are evil

12325893
put	get
it doesn t protect not really and what you put in is what you get out

12325893
put	get
on the other hand i m rather fond of methods that put information in then get information back out

12325893
getter	setter
you don t play with getter and setter

12325903
jlabel	jlayeredpane
for that i tried with a jlayeredpane in the gridlayout and put two images jlabel in a different level

12325910
inherited	base-class
my recommendation in order to reduce the amount of code duplication would be to create a base-class that each specialized class will inherited from where the base-class contains all the methods and members that will not change depending on the type that the class is instantiated with

12325918
for-loop	arrays
so i would like to extend it assigning pointers of real components to elements of an arrays to them work with all of them with a for-loop

12325932
google-chrome	firefox
the explanation why it worked fine in google-chrome and firefox but failed in ie though is much more interesting

12325932
google-chrome	firefox
both google-chrome and firefox will spit out a reference error warning right where it belongs - at line

12325947
int	chars
since there is no way to call nextchar i am not sure how i am supposed to read an input which could either be 2 int separated by a white space or a chars

12325991
children	parent
almost every example i ve seen involves only 1 parent with multiple children

12325991
children	parent
notice how in family echo parent nodes are spaced out properly depending on how many children they have so as not to collide with other surrounding nodes

12326040
daemon	cron
but when i put it on the crontab i instead got an email from the cron daemon saying

12326041
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i have a website that was originally designed for enclosed intranet use under ie 7 8 and is now needing to be running on the web which means making adjustments for firefox safari and google-chrome

12326056
pull	push
and if the linq provider doesn t support the max or contains though it should then it ll pull eveything client-side and that s a lot of data to push over the wire

12326059
inherited	properties
basically i want to know if there is a better solution to hiding the backing value of a properties than the use of inherited as shown

12326059
inherited	properties
solution using inherited and protected properties with private backing value

12326063
next	except
this doesn t bother me except now for some reason the db has been adding new entries to these empty spots so the count vs what is actualy their is off and this causes the highest value s next to point to a higher value than what actually exists since it is over the total count keep in mind that even its id is over the total count.

12326094
width	margin
margin auto + width x where the width of .project_content is calculated and x is the calculated width

12326095
spaces	delimiter
the following example uses a spaces as the delimiter

12326101
width	height
i tried supplying a height and the code doesn t compensate for the width of the scroll bar

12326120
width	margin
to add margin and width into the mix you can no longer use css since you need to modify one of multiple properties but you can do it using .each

12326147
hide	show
i m used to work like this wrapping html content between brackets to hide or show depending on given conditions

12326161
rss	feed
you could get the news from your website through its rss feed

12326161
rss	feed
make a http request with the rss link to your website to obtain the xml feed as an input stream

12326161
rss	feed
from a user perspective i would not prefer a rss news app to constantly fetch for the feed every time the phone connects to the internet

12326186
int	boolean
use an encoding such as json that distinguishes between int and boolean values

12326195
folder	directory
the problem is i need to remove two layers of folder in the middle of their structure so that they can be directly extracted into the necessary directory

12326218
put	get
however you can put the expression within a sub-expression group inside a double-quoted string to get powershell to evaluate the expression and then convert the result to a string

12326241
folder	directory
in the end be sure that the compiled executable will be able to find the dll in the project folder or in a system directory in the path or it will not start

12326260
int	boolean
change the boolean to true false and the int to regular int

12326319
division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
the only calculation support i need it addition substitution multiplication division and rounding

12326382
rss	feed
easy reading of rss feed

12326448
width	height
basically the way it works is that it update the frame to show every let s say 24 ticks and every time the frame update it recalculates the height and width of the new sprite to render so that my gravity logics and stuff works well

12326451
x86	64bit
10.6 x86 64bit dmg archive version using the pkg-installer it says the installation failed

12326452
post	get
having read the wordpress docs and done some research it seems as if the advice on how to get the last 10 post on a wordpress site is to do the following

12326471
yacc	bison
a generic parser in the style of yacc lex bison or a static analyzer somehow relaxed to tolerate code in the process of writing able to make sense of javadoc-style comments

12326476
hide	show
i then hide the paragraphs in order to be able to use the show functionality

12326497
width	height
win32 c++ - check if the window positionx positiony and width height changed

12326554
g++	gcc
yet the g++ compiler g++ gcc 3.4.6 20060404 red hat 3.4.6-11 is complaining

12326563
eigenvalue	diagonal
of course the eigenvalue of a triangular matrix are just the diagonal elements

12326589
subtract	add
so i m writing a relatively simple program that prompts the user for a command add subtract etc and then prompt for numbers to complete that operation

12326589
subtract	add
everything is written and it compiles fine but when i enter a command in add subtract etc. it isn t comparing it properly

12326601
folder	directory
wound up creating a replica of the directory structure with a symbolic link to the needed folder then used the -h option on tar to follow it

12326627
mvp	presenter
mvp is basically about the connection between a presenter and a view

12326629
free	malloc
there is of course an important detail objects created by new exist until they are delete d d and memory allocated by malloc exists until it s free d

12326650
hide	show
panel is used to show only one question at a time show hide

12326651
versioning	upgrade
this webservice is called from an application written in .net 1.1 while this is upgrade to a newer versioning i need to make the service to work

12326668
put	get
we re assuming that myconfig is a simple class with get string and put string string methods

12326677
lxml	elementtree
i d suggest lxml but the following code works with either lxml or elementtree

12326733
width	margin
reduce width increase left margin

12326775
uilabel	uibutton
i have a uibutton and a uilabel in my custom cell

12326802
post	get
and it seems to work pretty well i correctly get the comment for a post here the debug for a post

12326809
ciimage	uiimage
after i finished i wanted to cleanup the relatively lengthy code and noticed that instead of going from the filter s outputted ciimage to a cgimage and then a uiimage i could go directly from a ciimage to uiimage using uiimage s imagewithciimage method

12326809
ciimage	uiimage
my understanding of this is that making a uiimage from a ciimage results in a null cgimage property in the uiimage which is used in drawinrect

12326809
ciimage	uiimage
if so is there a better way to display a ciimage than to go through cgimage followed by uiimage

12326812
ubuntu	debian
i never had the chance to try it myself but i heard php5-sybase works fine which i know is available for both debian and ubuntu in the repositories

12326817
put	get
since i struggled to get javascript to put num.innerhtml into main on load i ve ended up putting virtually identical content to num with a different form name into main

12326838
google-chrome	firefox
this simple example on jsfiddle breaks in every browser i have access to some versions of google-chrome and firefox as they act like overflow hidden

12326848
inherited	subclassing
so i want the book to inherited the methods from product and not for the product to know about the attributes required by each subclassing

12326868
int	chars
most use parameters of chars and int

12326868
int	chars
we have an existing managed c++ class that can call the unmanaged methods that need chars and int without problems

12326887
put	get
those dialogs that the browsers put up tell you that they are going to do a postback instead of just get ting the page

12326899
for-loop	arrays
to give you an idea of what i was trying to do i was attempting to enter the words into a string sentence then break that string up into individual words in an arrays words then run a for-loop to compare the strings to each other by comparing the lengths to the entries in the arrays

12326958
profiling	debugging
in addition a cool plugin called debugging queries is useful for tracking down performance issues although the wordpress profiling above actually does track queries too

12326972
opera	firefox
i have tested it under firefox 14 opera 11.62 and internet explorer 8

12326976
google-chrome	firefox
i have issues when changing the timestamp to iso 8601 in js as it errors at topicdate in ie and firefox but it works in google-chrome

12326989
cng	cryptoapi
you might be missing cng which is a long term replacement for the ms cryptoapi

12327010
portrait	landscape
this works for both orientations portrait and landscape

12327066
width	text-align
simply set the width of div #children to 100 and text-align center so it s css becomes like this

12327100
google-chrome	firefox
it s right under the picture when i use firefox but when i use ie or google-chrome it s towards the middle of the page

12327116
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i created a for-loop that appends everything to the deck arrays however my problems occur when i want to loops through the deck and print out card values suite and value

12327141
put	get
you can put a widget inside the eventbox but you are limited to only one widget that will also get the shape and size of the eventbox

12327158
profiler	visualvm
i ve found this using the java visualvm profiler in the development environment

12327200
put	get
you will not be able to get away without either editing the classes source files and use my solution or organize them in a conventional hierarchy to put them in and use josh s solution

12327215
post	get
you need to ensure the http get post request has the correct host field

12327226
int	chars	int	double
primitive data types int bool float double chars string etc

12327242
post	get
i will be using ajax post request to get the primary key attribute of my row from the database

12327281
width	height
the mosaic has rows and columns of the same width and height

12327281
width	height
in other words moving the boxes with absolute or relative positioning wouldn t be the best option since the boxes and their width height are generated by javascript although feel free to post any answer

12327301
setinterval	settimeout
i use both settimeout and setinterval to do this and then clear the interval after 5 executions

12327337
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this form works in google-chrome firefox safari

12327337
google-chrome	firefox
i see a post request sent in google-chrome dev tools and firefox firebug

12327355
x86	64bit
by default the 32-bit jdk will install into program files x86 and a 64bit jdk will install into program files

12327364
prepare	pdostatement	prepare	execute
when constructing a pdo prepare statement we use the array keys to specify placeholder names instead so we can pass the array directly to pdostatement execute

12327366
g++	gcc
with gcc g++ you can do something like

12327412
width	margin
once the design drops to an iphone for some reason the width of the top elements logo menu has some margin padding or is only approx 80 width

12327423
width	height
my end goal here is to resize the input image to 100px width 125px height

12327423
width	height
i ve tried compositing the resized image into an empty newimage with the set width and height but it just seems to overwrite the dimensions regardless of the composite type setting the gravity to center and then the extent to 100x125 has no effect it always sits at 0 0 and trying to set the y offset to 125-imageheight 2 resulted in an offset that was way more than it should have been

12327439
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i ve tested it on google-chrome safari and firefox btw and they all do not work i m on a mac so i can t test it on ie

12327492
button	checkbox
i am trying it to be something static no pop up users should be visible just like any other media on page with checkbox allowing selection with a send button

12327492
button	checkbox
after user selects some particular checkbox and clicks the send button

12327510
division	addition
it will return a 0 if there are no errors and -1 if an error occurred in the case of addition there wouldn t be many errors - but division for example divide by 0 would be an error

12327580
superclass	subclassing
the standard argument for making immutable classes final is that if you don t do this then subclassing can add mutability thereby violating the contract of the superclass

12327580
superclass	subclassing
if you take this argument to its logical extreme then all methods should be made final as otherwise a subclassing could override a method in a way that doesn t conform to the contract of its superclass

12327589
for-loop	loops
i have also made this program using for-loop but i want to get matrix n x y without using loops operations

12327621
direct3d	directx
i am not familiar with slimdx but in native directx if you want to draw a quad in screen coordinates you should define the vertex format as translated that is you specify the screen coordinates directly instead of using direct3d transform engine to transform your vertex

12327648
multiplying	add
for example if we are multiplying two bit-vectors x and y of size n then we must add n zero bits to x and y to make sure that the result will not overflow

12327654
rss	feed
full story i am modding the markup of my blog s rss feed for google currents and for the app to display image galleries in articles as slideshows the markup of my feed should look like this

12327654
rss	feed
but due to the way my wordpress blog works the galleries are shown within the article which is usual which means the same happens in the rss feed as well

12327654
rss	feed
so i am wondering if i can do it like this and it d still be valid rss feed

12327671
rbenv	homebrew
there s also rbenv and ry as alternatives to rvm but i just use 1.9.3 across all my apps so homebrew is fine.

12327679
put	get
i started out with multiple files and decided to put it all in one main.cpp file for now just to get it working

12327707
free	malloc
but with a normal malloc free mismatch i would expect all the memory to return when the program terminates

12327716
opera	safari
i am testing in windows opera safari 2 firefoxes+firebug ie+f12 and two androids

12327720
width	height
here s a working example that will capture the height and width of the image and assign it to a variable

12327779
free	malloc
no malloc and free and even mmap are harmless in this respect and when the process terminates the os suse linux in this case claims all their memory back unless it s shared with some other process that s still running

12327779
free	malloc
like malloc free and mmap files opened by the process are automatically closed by the os

12327779
disk	ram
writes to disk or mmap may be cached for a while in ram

12327816
free	malloc
malloc free work on the heap

12327821
for-loop	loops
on the next loops you see the output you want because as previously the j defined inside the for-loop is referred but as you have initialized the value of j local to the for-loop with the same value of the j outside which has nothing to do with the j inside the for-loop hence you get the second output in your question

12327830
hide	show
it is a common requirement and you can very will jcheckbox extend a to some jfoocheckbox which has the foo object in it and a listener should take care of the show hide of foo

12327836
post	get
so change your type to from post to get

12327850
width	height
place the image inside a with the width and height set to your desired size overflow set to hidden and position is either absolute or relative

12327850
width	height
essentially this figures out how much it would need scale the image to make the width fit and to make the height fit then picks the larger of the two so the image fits on one side and overflows on the other

12327864
src	attr
#frame attr src source

12327874
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i test filter shadow color #ffffff direction 80 strength 12 and others filter but i want make text-shadow in css work in ie like google-chrome and firefox and opera

12327893
width	height
fyi createcontrol uses twips one 1440th of an inch for left top width and height

12327901
width	height
style issue your code would only have worked with a linear axis as you convert width and height via a single call to xscale yscale instead of calculating the absolute coordinates in domain space first then convert both via scale to calculate the width height in output space

12327901
width	height
if you want faster code instead you need to prepare your data so that the output will produce valid svg here processed input x 80 y 80 w 10 h -60 in particular positive values for width and height or similarly x2 x1 and y2 y1 for

12327947
google-chrome	safari
fixed for me in google-chrome safari ie 7 8 9

12327958
google-chrome	firefox
after getting the numbers from a couple of runs of the benchmark i noticed that firefox is doing about 15 operations per second on average and google-chrome is doing around 300

12327997
int	double
the number type in lua is double which can hold many more int exactly than a long int

12328033
wordpress	joomla
the best solutions would be a cms like drupal wordpress or joomla

12328120
spaces	delimiter
str any delimiter by default it is spaces

12328158
spannable	charsequence
its possible when i m entering the text using inputconnection.setcomposingtext charsequence cursorposition since the argument of the method setcomposingtext allows a spannable type

12328161
mouseover	mouseout
i have a row of images that animate trought jquery zoom effect when mouseover and then gets back to their original size then mouseout

12328176
subtract	add
i want to iterate through letter and for each letter in the array i would like to add or subtract the value of shiftcode

12328200
apache	nginx
its working on apache server buut not working on nginx can any one help apache giving output but nginx no result

12328232
for-loop	loops
therefore row + 1 two so when you enter the second for-loop again it will loops until hit hits two

12328240
bash	tcsh	jline	readline
people familiar with the readline editline capabilities for modern shells such as bash and tcsh will find most of the command editing features of jline to be familiar

12328243
serializable	deserialization
i think i can use the reflectionmodelservices class to create import export definitions but that still leaves the serializable and deserialization parts

12328247
post	put
i m trying to use django tastypie to allow an implementor to post put data to create models that are related several levels deep

12328335
superclass	subclassing
for your first question subclassing can call superclass constructors with a call to super

12328353
range	infinity
range may extend to infinity -- for example the range x 3

12328444
int	boolean
public abstract boolean committext charsequence text int newcursorposition

12328489
mouseleave	mouseenter
fwiw i ve never needed this control - a regular label with some styling and use of the mouseenter mouseleave events has served me well in many projects

12328504
prepare	execute
my problem preparationgoals in my first module pom will not execute when i run mvn release prepare in my parent pom

12328511
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i have a set of checkboxes they appear perfect in firefox show a little weird behavior box enlarges turns grey on click check mark becomes smaller returns to normal on blur or when you click somewhere else doesnt show up at all in google-chrome and safari os x according to browserlabs

12328531
converter	multibinding
that s a weird solution lol anyhose you can solve it with multibinding converter

12328585
post	get
in the pseudo-code i m assuming that you get a row_array with the getcomment function that this comment is the head of all the comments like the initial post

12328600
matlab	simulink
as far as interfacing with arduino is concerned there is a support package from the mathworks that allows you to interface matlab code and simulink models with arduino

12328600
matlab	simulink
the only other general suggestion that i have is to consider using simulink for this project rather than matlab

12328633
screens	tablet
abd there is difference in screens size of both the image which is perfect on mobile is became very small on tablet

12328666
tablet	mdpi	screens	mdpi	screens	tablet
speaking about density motorola xoom also uses mdpi drawables so to differenciate drawables between tablet and small phones you should use folders with respect to screens sizes

12328666

12334438
getter	setter
every property that you can use in the original code would have a getter and setter

12334438
getter	setter
in the transformed code there would also be a version number of the property and additional code added to the getter and setter

12334438
getter	setter
the deuce framework in the paper above shows how to change all your getter and setter by injecting new java bytecode into your classes at load time

12334438
getter	setter
specifically with deuce your source code objects can have simple getter setter pairs but transformed classes at runtime have enriched getter setter which do the bookwork

12334866
put	get
so if your orderby is simply formatting the data to be friendly to view put it at the end after you have trimmed your collection if your looking for the first value of a sorted collection then maybe you would need it before the collection is iterated to get the first

width	height
this code specifies that you want to copy a rectangle with the dimensions 50 width 50 height of the source starting at position 0x 0y and draw into the destination bitmap starting at position 50x 50y and occupy it until 200x 200y - therefore stretching a bit - because as the source is only 50 pixels long to stretch to 200x and 200y the copy will end up with the size 150width 150 height

12335007
width	height
you are also using the screen that the window is on to get width height with device.displaymode which is something you should avoid because this will only work when your window is the same size as the screen

12335019
button	checkbox
checkbox to select those i want to send invitation email and a submit button that submits the form

12335045
std	ostream
note that there is rarely a need to use the template approach nor is there a good use of deriving from std ostream for a different purpose than convenient initialization of a std ostream with a custom std streambuf

12335066
hide	show
the correct approach would be to add kml region tags to your placemarks so that placmarks show hide as the user pans zooms etc

12335105
mouseover	mouseleave
my first thought is to add an overlay that blocks all mouseover mouseleave events

12335108

12335210
post	get
the additional slash is not caused or avoidable by your apache configuration it s a feature of browsers that are composing the http parameters of the browsers created http post or get request to the web server

12335210

now i have a new project and i put my c project folder inside the visual basic project folder in hopes that visual basic would fetch the dll from that folder and copy it to the output directory

12335409

the issue is that when i do my first search based on the search filter i get from ui i don t know the uuid of the first row so i prepare a query which gives me first 6 records i store the key of the 6th record in a map and put it in a session so when user from ui request for a second page i retrieve this key uuid and take it as a start for the next set of records to be retrieved

12335439

int	boolean
i thought about having another class b which contains the int array as a static member an init method which would fill this array according to some formula and a static boolean flag initialized if this variable if true then the init method would do nothing but i m not sure this is the best way to solve my design issue

apache	nginx
i need to convert apache mod_rewrite rules to nginx

12335741
post	put
also in your simple_form_for method in your html file take out the following as you are duplicating the functionality of rails - it already knows to change the request and correct routes to a post put based on whether or not the form is a new record or not

12335746
min	max
i m having a bit of trouble coming up with a good design that can support a min spec of 768x1024 and a max spec of 1200 x 1920

12335841

spaces	delimiter
the first parameter is the event s can be spaces delimiter for multiple events while the second can either be the targeted element or the function to execute

12335976
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
other java se layouts that might achieve it are gridbaglayout or nested boxlayout gridlayout as mentioned by ray

12336002
pow	sqrt
what is happening is that the arithmetic and or calls to sqrt and pow are generating nan values

12336009
fadein	fadeout
tried using jquery s nice fadein and fadeout functions but they only wait for the duration then appear disappear abruptly without transitioning the opacity

12336010
drawrect	layoutsubviews
depending on how you re drawing the buttons it might be a better idea to use layoutsubviews and setneedslayout than drawrect for repositioning subviews

12336242
user-controls	tabcontrol
user-controls is placed on tabcontrol the following way

12336246

12336274
min	max
for the min and max price per category

12336280
for-loop	arrays
i can do this using the glbegin and glend method calls inside a for-loop using the fixed functional pipeline but i would like to know how to do this using vertex arrays

12336307
concave	convex
you can get convex and concave shapes using css3 border-radius

width	height
first don t forget to set you body tag to be 100 width and height just to make sure the measurement is accurate

12336404
implements	sealed
in first case nobar class is explicitly sealed and hence no derived classes can implements ifoo and compiler knows that it does not implements ibar itself - hence can fail at compile time

12336460
union	distinct
since i don t know if the query could produce duplicate rows i used distinct in order to collapse duplicate rows in the same manner that the union did in the original query

12336484
children	parent
it is in its parent node where that score is returned and compared with the other scores corresponding to other children

12336493
children	parent
the forking processes creates children in a tree-like manner.consider each fork to be the different layers of a binary tree.when you dont issue a fork u have a process tree of only a root node.when u issue a single fork then u have a binary tree with two levels now the first level will the contain the parent process the second level will contain two processes - the parent and the child process

12337210
puts	gets
i have put up a different controller which will handle the request gets and puts the extra info in the model and forwards the request to the existing controller like below

12337236
width	height
ps a better solution might be to add a right proportion of height and width since the text wraps around the image

12337313
width	height
increasing the size of the font when the width of the stage increases will also increase the height of the font

12337342

np-hard	np-complete
it is np-hard â in fact its decision version is one of the canonical np-complete problems and was among the 21 problems included in karp s 1972 paper â and so no efficient algorithm is known for solving it

12337848

12338029
temp	tmp
in windows the temp folder s have the address es tmp and temp

12338033
oncreate	findviewbyid
i think that you did not set content view inside oncreate method and therefor findviewbyid is unable to find view objects and so returns null

12338064
integer	unsigned
it is supposed to be the fastest unsigned integer type with at least 8 bits

12338147
folder	directory
so the linker is looking for vc100.pdb in the debug folder but the vc100.pdb file is located in the top level directory

12338167
post	get
so when you click on the link you get a dialog that allows you to post the url of whatever page you re on to your timeline

12338167
pop-up	dialog
the fb.ui method seems the best way of invoking the dialog because it automatically creates the right type of pop-up for your device

12338188
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i found that frame for ipad frame changes in viewdidappear than the one in viewwillappear

12338188

if you use int32 or int64 as the type for a negative number the resulting varint is always ten bytes long â it is effectively treated like a very large unsigned integer

12338250
box-sizing	border-box
here is a solution for you using box-sizing border-box

12338251
width	height
taken with height and width calculations

12338254
box-sizing	border-box
edit maybe the best solution is box-sizing border-box as mqchen suggested

12338278
width	height
using the screen.primaryscreen.bounds gives you the complete height and width of your screen

12338331

this will show the div but unfortunately will not hide it

12338464
int	chars
on all of the computers i work with int is faster than unsigned significantly faster than signed chars

12338473
scatter	graphing
i recently created a program that calculates flow rate through a pipe and generates line by line a scatter graphing of the output

12338492
int	chars
there is no way you can assign a chars to an int value

12338509
int	chars
d is for decimal int c would be for chars the variable holding the value should also be a chars

12338513
int	chars
in c chars are just int

12338568
post	get
the problem is that you are doing get request instead of post to send a big portions of data you have to use post

12338607
maven	cargo
however i now want to bind the cargo start and stop goals to the maven pre-integration-test and post-integration-test phases

wxpython	mayavi
still no 64 bit version with ets for mac components are ancient mayavi based on wxpython looks ugly and feels slow and unresponsive

12338632
matplotlib	scipy
2.5 scipy matplotlib ipython

12338632
matplotlib	scipy
i prefer to get the bleeding edge from github for scipy and matplotlib

12338663
qunit	sinon
seems there is no equivalent in qunit and sinon

12338687
mouseleave	mouseenter
not entirely sure in jquery but in straight javascript clicking on the item gives it focus and the focus is retained until you click elsewhere so what you want to do is test for loss of focus i m guessing mouseenter mouseleave check if the mouse is hovering over the item

12338688
google-chrome	firefox
it looks as it should in google-chrome and firefox but ie really messes it up and none of the animations sliders work

12338704
post	get
is it possible to implement post-redirect-get pattern with two overloaded action methods one for get action and the other for post action in asp.net-mvc

12338704
post	get
in all of the mvc post-redirect-get pattern samples i have seen three different action methods for the post-redirect-get process corresponding to initial get post and the redirection get each having different names

12338707
box-sizing	border-box
you might have to set box-sizing to something consistent to make it work cross-browser like box-sizing border-box

12338749
instances	transient
ideally you want a transient generated field in your entity that reconstructs the calendar instances you want using the timestamp and interval stored in the database

12338840
min	max
i though it should have a max min and according to the bounded value it will move by using a transform that s the easier part but the actual graphics are tricky here.

12338854
textarea	textbox
in your case you have only one textbox that you need to disable but consider the case where you have multiple input select and textarea fields that yout need to disable

12338948
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to get my html tidy c++ wrapper library to build on linux testing on ubuntu at the moment but make fails with a libtool error libtool link you must specify an output file

12338952
ubuntu	linux
so binaries from your ubuntu gcc will most likely run on any linux system that s no older than the machine it was compiled on

12338952
sunos	aix
anything compiled on aix 6 say or sunos 5.8 or hp-ux 11.00 or whatever runs with no issues on all later releases

12338952
freebsd	linux
freebsd knows the linux syscalls and when you tell it do the 42 thing it checks a flag in the header of your elf and does the appropriate action for the linux syscall numbers if the elf is stamped as a linux one

12338952
freebsd	linux
but a statically linked linux binary will run fine in freebsd with no externals.

12338977
integer	unsigned
corresponding unsigned integer type and the value is representable in both types

12338977
int	chars	int	boolean
â 6.3.1.1 boolean chars and int

12338977
int	chars
int which shall be greater than the rank of signed chars

12338977
integer	unsigned
â the rank of any unsigned integer type shall equal the rank of the corresponding

12338977
integer	unsigned
â an object or expression with an integer type other than int or unsigned int

12338994
width	height
or if you want to stretch width and height to 100 try this but the ratio will not be correct

12338999
opera	firefox
firefox and opera are not allowed on our networks

12339065
children	parent
i have parent div tag and him must be several children div tags i want that children tags placing horizontal

12339065
children	parent
count children div tags is not known advanced on this i can t set width parent div tag with css for this i use js

12339133
children	parent
that way the parent div will get the appropriate width automatically so that the children can fit into it

12339170
public	protected
if i have public internal or protected property setters there is a risk that inheriting classes will break the original contract

12339220
allocator	stl
in c++03 this would have been relatively difficult however c++11 now requires that stl containers work with stateful allocator so you could perfectly create an allocator with a small stack for its own use.

12339308
aggregate-functions	sum
when you use a value of -1 for downvote and 1 for upvote you can calculate the total score of an article by using the sum aggregate-functions it would also easily allow you to introduce weighted votes later when you feel like it

12339327
typedef	struct
don t bother with typedef for struct

12339331
debian	linux
check the httpd.conf file is set in apache to allow overides so htaccess will work - this might be apache.conf if using a debian box with debian squeeze - not sure about other linux types though

12339334
macports	homebrew
i have installed homebrew and macports and have installed the mongodb using both homebrew and macports

12339443

just gave the video a different class and gave it a specific height and width at each screen size in the media queries

12339459
setcontentview	recreate
as you can see i recreate radarview and then use setcontentview to update it but i don t think it s a good solution

12339506
mdpi	hdpi	screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi
it is taken straight from stack overflow question android screens size hdpi ldpi mdpi

12339555
put	get
this proves you get out what you put in regardless if it contains quotes or not

12339568
squash	merge
as far as i understood i should squash the merge commit 34db3b8c08.

12339625
button	checkbox
qml quick markup language includes basic necessities like text fields radio button checkbox etc which can be animated and controlled with event handlers

12339665
hash	md5
again this feels right - trying to do the md5 step in method would cause issues if the model_user were one pulled from the db as the password field would clearly already be hash

12339681
post	get
you cannot have overloaded action methods when they respond to same type of requests get post etc.

12339716
apache	nginx
finally now i have all working both in nginx and apache

12339769
hash	salt
i m working on my first c# program and so far have sorted the database connection users table adding new users login with salt hash password etc

when i test the url you gave in a simple background rule the image shows without problems on firefox ie google-chrome safari tested on win 7

12339881
implements	extends
i also implements a custom adapter which extends baseadapter

12339882
tablet	mdpi
for xlarge tablet you probably only care about mdpi right now

12339898
int	double
once you declared your variable as say an int you won t be able to store a double in it - however you cast the division etc

12339934
hide	show
unfortunately there s no event for it but i guess one could listen to when a textbox gains or loses focus and set a margin or perhaps show a control at the bottom of the page when a textbox has focus and hence the sip is displayed and hide it when it doesn t

12339943
superclass	subclassing
i am using a uitableview which has a custom superclass customtableview - this is a subclassing of uitableview

12339944
int	double
if it s double then you don t have to do anything int division won t be used in any case

12339944
int	double
but if it s int then your cast doesn t make any sense you can t store a double value in an int variable

12339970
int	chars
if you re looking to sanitize the string then maybe you need to remove everything that s not and then validate against the difference is while int are allowed chars a class function name may not start with one

12339990
nsoperationqueue	nsblockoperation
you can make use of nsblockoperation and nsoperationqueue to create a cancellable download task

12340060
getter	setter
you must access to the relations using getter and setter this is because doctrine build a proxy class extending from your entity class and override your getter for provide lazy loading

12340075
int	chars
i am trying to get a minesweeper 2d chars array game to first count the mines surrounding basically the 8 blocks surrounding the mine a mine then convert the chars surrounding the mines to int

12340110
for-loop	loops
put the as the middle clause of your for-loop then it s checked earlier and you break out of loops sooner

12340119
lan	intranet
if you are writing an internet web app as opposed to an intranet lan app there is no way to determine the local address and mac address of the client unless the client explicitly sends it to you

12340122
int	double
you can but you do not have to bit shifting will double the number no matter what base you use for interpreting it later because internally these int s are still interpreted as binary by the underlying shift operations

12340134
post	get
you can not use javascript to get the mac address however you can get the ip address and post it back

12340152
integer	unsigned
if you need to add a 33rd you are out of luck unless you go to a 64 bit unsigned integer

12340168
for-loop	loops
but if i try to loops through the using a for-loop i am getting a classcastexception

12340171
folder	directory
and when i create these folder it copies to directory i created.

mongodb	bson
a single emit can only hold half of mongodb s maximum bson document size 16mb

12340283
sorting	grouping
uses a pipeline approach where objects are transformed as they pass through a series of pipeline operators such as matching projecting sorting and grouping

12340341
google-chrome	firefox
what ends up happening is that the browser firefox google-chrome ie handle both pages meaning the ajax call and they do a get from page i m trying to redirect to but only the original page is rendered so no redirection takes place

12340355
getter	setter
all of the getter setter constructors and other methods are pretty much so we can put values into those variables

12340382
datamapper	activerecord
this is a common approach when you re using the activerecord pattern instead of datamapper which is a bad thing

12340395
post	get
but you can find with firefox s httpfox extension for example what request your browser sends to the target site than you get recommendations and make the same request i m sure this is post from your www mechanize object

12340422
for-loop	arrays
34 always explicitly initialize an arrays of reference types using a for-loop

12340426

the above works perfectly on firefox and google-chrome

12340497

width	margin
since you say that your site is a fixed-width layout then with width device-width it is likely to look bad if it is shown on different size devices for example you might see a white margin down the right hand side on wider devices whereas with width 320 the browser will scale it up to fit the device s screen width it may therefore look somewhat enlarged but that s probably better than having a white margin

12342197
width	height
divs display block by default take up whole line so you can have an inline-block span takes up only required space but treated like block element with set width and height and a number next to it

12342541
filesystems	btrfs
if you want to actually format it with a filesystems such as ext4 or btrfs you d have to take a look at those filesystem-specific libraries

12342558

i then find an article suggesting sn.exe for files not in the gac and an answer suggesting the gacutil for everything else

12342933

int	boolean
i have to create 52 elements array and keep some int boolean currency long and place holder values in the array

12342943
integer	unsigned
you might argue that an unsigned int serves dual purpose as a bit pattern and an integer value but int does not

12342973
stateless	stateful
in addition you ll find that frameworks claiming to be stateless and doing anything but pure rest are actually doing a pretty bad job at being a stateful framework typically that involves round tripping state into cookies or serialising it into a hidden form field

12342982
post	get
thus you ll not get any order for your items and therefore the post symbol will not be used

12342983
versioning	upgrade
since nuget doesn t seem to notice the need for an upgrade it lets you install ef 5.0 on top of it lists the new versioning as 4.4 after install and requires you to include both of the following using statements in your model classes since some of the ef data annotations were moved redirected and some were not

12343043

the getlength method wouldn t compile because all the types i want to use int float double long would require to share an interface which math.pow should accept as a parameter

12343106

folder	directory
after a new record is saved i want to delete all folder and files in the cache directory

that s the idea of polymorphism - all the subclassing of canvas share the same methods from the canvas superclass but if you add methods to those classes they are not shared any longer

12343478
post	get

change the window style to remove the borders and titlebar

i made sure to recreate the images folder in the new directory and reupload the background but the background just doesnt show

12343552

even if i was a 128bit quantity it would not be big enough to handle all possible 64bit numbers such as 2 63 -1 accurately

12343883

ilist	icollection	ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist
that said if you want to map your existing xml to some sort of c# data structures the way you re doing it seems reasonable - i d just recommend replacing your public fields with actual properties and maybe making the list properties a less specific type - say ienumerable or icollection or ilist if they really need to be in order

12343996

everything works fine in ie9 firefox mac + pc safari mac + pc and google-chrome mac + pc however when the requests are sent from ie 9 the ajax requests are fired correctly and correct responses are returned without error but it appears that it is sending through a different session for each of the calls so the 3rd party system recognises the 4 different requests as coming from different sessions

getter	setter
and alike the setter method if you can get an attribute using a method it is usually called getter method

12344130
getter	setter
having a setter getter method for a private attribute is mandatory if you want to retrieve set the attribute but optional for public attributes but in my opinion this is a good practice to have it

while you could probably get a memory-pool allocator to allocate your strings stl is not my strong point so i m going to do it by hand

12345779
allocator	stl
even if you made memory-pooled a bunch of stl containers i expect the overhead of those allocator along with the containers themselves would still make it slower than what i ve given you

you have put the value of the model instead of naming it appropriately as explained in the hanselman s blog post

12346539
int	boolean
if i get it right you need the array value to contain int and boolean but you set there an object at first which is replaced by a string after that

12346539
int	boolean
due to that java cannot invoke the method string getlist int boolean because string is not castable to int nor to boolean

12346907
cos	sin
at this point it s worth noting that all trigonometric function sin cos tan atan etc. use radians

12346918
folder	directory
i think it is because of directory structure followed for all applications of same types as all the application contains some files folder on the root folder that is the name of our application e-g android project contains files like .project and .classpath and folder like .myeclipse src bin .settings etc

also you must add padding to the parent in place of margin on the children

12347074
implements	extends
the simple solution is to write a class that implements an interface rather than extends a base class

12347087
implements	extends
handy you should create a class that extends from arrayadapter then you implements the method getview to tell your list what to do on each item add the image and the text

12347100
fadein	fadeout
you can loop through all your divs using jquery .each function and then fadein each div with a delay of 5 seconds and then fadeout .if the div is last then prevent fadeout

12347236
getter	setter
suppose there is an atomic string property called name and if you call from thread a call from thread b and call from thread c then all operation on different thread will be performed serially which means if one thread is executing setter or getter then other threads will wait

12347236
getter	setter
this makes property name read write safe but if another thread d calls simultaneously then this operation might produce a crash because there is no setter getter call involved here

12347239
versioning	upgrade
if you can upgrade your copy of netcat the modern versioning 1.10 for one have an option to execute a program or a shell command upon connect

12347239

otherwise you can make the netcat think it runs in a terminal to disable buffering of stdout by using for example script it just saves everything on stdin stdout stderr in the given file

12347246
packets	multicast
to send multicast packets all you need to do is bind to a local interface 0.0.0.0 with a random port works as you ve discovered and then address a packets to the correct group port which is what sendto will do

12347246
packets	multicast
when you make this call the system sends an igmp onto the network instructing the routers to forward multicast packets for a specific group to your interface binding to the correct port is then enough to receive them

12347246
packets	multicast
you can normally also instruct the os to duplicate multicast packets with the loopback interface so you can use multicast on the same machine

12347246
packets	multicast
the traditional solution to this is to create an igmp packets yourself which would allow multicast to work via a switch but not on the local machine

12347246
udp	tcp
unfortunately this needs access to send raw ip packets not tcp or udp and chrome.socket doesn t provide that

12347259
getter	setter
with atomic the synthesized setter getter methods will ensure that a whole value is always returned from the getter or set by the setter regardless of setter activity on any other thread

12347259
getter	setter
so if thread a is in the middle of the getter while thread b calls the setter an actual viable value will be returned to the caller in a

mstest	moles
i researched various stackoverflow posts regarding ncover + moles and mstest and the those posts are the base for my execution

12347305
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
if your case enables you to feed the dictionaries with items in a sorted ascending order you may want to switch to a sortedlist rather than a sorteddictionary because in the list adding items is o 1 rather than o log n if the new items will wind up at the end of the sorted collection

12347305
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
this is not yet possible with a sorteddictionary but the sortedlist supports that feature

12347309
jlist	jtable
for most complex output to the gui or array is based on java.util.list map hashmap then to use jtable with one column based on abstracttablemodel because jlist has implemented reduced methods or features in compare with jtable

12347761
curb	libcurl
the dependency is on the libcurl headers so you could try to find those headers in the available search paths and then make a recommendation of which package to install based on the platform being installed on but the libcurl headers could be installed by any number of packages or even from source so there s no one way to say curb requires libcurl-devel in a general case

12347785
getter	setter
the setter .text string affects all elements in the jquery object and the getter .text concatenates the text of all elements

12347785
getter	setter
the same applies to most other methods the setter affect all elements and the getter read usually the first element

12347788

folder	directory
everything works fine until i keep the keystore file in my home directory but when i try placing it in another folder and i set the keystorefile parameter i get this error message at startup

12347933
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
the only option would be using the original inputstream and write it into a temporary file or a bytearrayoutputstream if the file s are small enough to not use too much memory so you can access the data several times

12347934
serializable	deserialization
transient field of an object is ignored for serializable deserialization like java orms ignores transient fields

12347967
min	max
in other words your example code should work exactly as you d expect it to return the max of comparing b to the min of comparing c to d

12348067
min	max
i ll just write two short functions to do these checks and return the min or max long

12348067
min	max
edit2 here s the function for limiting a long to its min max value according to the answer i linked to above

opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the behavior i m experiencing is that google-chrome 21 and firefox 15 displays scrollbars inside the box resizing it s content thus hiding some of the text however opera 12 and internet explorer 9 displays it also on the inside but without resizing it s content and resizing the box instead which is in my opinion correct since the box doesn t have width defined

keydown	keyup
so now of course nothing happens - you took the default event handlers out like you wanted to for keydown event and there were probably no other event handlers registered to the keyup and keypress events so there were no more actions handlers to fire anymore

12352879
keydown	keyup
i mean just bind keyup directly now from same keydown handler to whatever function you desire and i believe that when key goes up it should actually fire that function event handler that you bound to that event

getter	setter
i ve noticed that often times when i create a custom getter setter for a property in objective c at least once somewhere in my class i forget to use self.variablename to access my property and instead access it directly with just variablename which defeats the purpose of the getter and setter and may cause a bug later on that could be tough to track down

12357095
getter	setter
to avoid the accidental non-usage of getter and setter

12357095
getter	setter
don t get me wrong sometimes it is nice to be able to access instance variables directly and avoid the getter and setter but sometimes when i write a custom getter and setter it is important that these getter and setter get used every time and do not get forgotten

i mean layout height of both spinner is wrap content but width should be first half for the first spinner second half of the screen to the second spinner

12357268
post	get
the only way you might be able to achieve this is if the other site doesn t employ xss protection and allows you to directly get post a login url to their site

12357282
implements	extends
create a class that extends runnable implements the run method or make it call your current method that should be enough to do this

12357325
versioning	upgrade
upgrade spring versioning to last best versioning 2.5.6.sec03 - this still shows the same issue

12357326
ant	maven
we use maven to for our web application and we used to use ant

pop-up	dialog
this will pop-up dialog box

12357375
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you want to add server side filtering outside of your repository methods you need to return your types as iqueryable rather than ienumerable and not call .tolist .asenumerable or any other method that would cause .getenumerator to be called

12357380
maven	m2e
i m converting some of our projects into maven projects but m2e changes my .classpath jre entry from

12357441
width	height
i would also like my canvases to have same height and width at all times

12357464
opera	google-chrome
only in google-chrome and opera the normal for-loop is the fastest

12357517
stdout	stderr
using readline twice you should strictly consume stdout stderr simultaneously

12357567
swing	windowbuilder
i have recently started making a minesweeper-like game in java with swing using eclipse windowbuilder and in the app there is an ordinary jframe with a jmenu with options in it

12357599

you could instead put all your gif sprites into a sheet if their frames are all divisible by one another and all your png jpg sprites into a second sheet and use them separately

12357601
fadein	fadeout
the php code is executed on server side and the fadeout fadein on client

post	put
if you re doing some rest service use the proper post put delete patch methods

12357741
implements	extends
if a class is made abstract you can give body to all the methodes or none of these but if any class is extends abstract class it must implements all the methode which is only being declared

12357769
ready	each
this is a limitation of mongoimport - essentially each piece of data you import must be insert ready even though you are using the upsert functionality which is basically working as a de-duplication mechanism for your input data

12357812
int	chars
the problem with your current implementation is because you re trying to compare an int value that you ve in your selection variable with chars which is internally getting converted to its corresponding int value int value of 1 is not the same as 1

12357812
int	chars
so when you set you would find the output from the int block however if you set you would find the output from the chars block

12357813
air	flashdevelop
since flash builder is kinda expensive 249 you could use flashdevelop there is some tutorials to compile in air with it

12357878
put	get
put the bytes in a memorystream and then use setsource member of bitmapimage to get the image into your ui

12357887
tax	shipping
packaging cost shipping cost country import tax inspection fees etc

12357925
jar	war
is the jar put into the war

12357936
concave	convex
the faces usually consist of triangles quadrilaterals or other simple convex polygons since this simplifies rendering but may also be composed of more general concave polygons or polygons with holes

12357986
free	malloc
so for example if the interruption happens in the middle of malloc calling free in your signal handler to clean up will deadlock

12357997
implements	extends
then each concrete class that extends bird that can fly should implements this interface

12358019
uuid	uniqueidentifier
for databases that do not support a uniqueidentifier uuid type you should use string

12358038
google-chrome	firefox
you can use firebug for firefox or google-chrome inbuilt web developer tool to debug such error

12358040
solaris	aix
this seems to work fine on solaris and aix but on linux i get this error messages

12358050
maven	pom.xml
i wish for something like maven clean install -dspecific.build and some configuration in the pom.xml to build this additional module

12358079
requestfactory	gwt
you should probably use requestfactory as it does not require that the bean be serializable as the gwt rpc service does

12358079
getter	setter
you would create a value proxy on the client side and make sure it maps getter setter that you need

12358087
google-chrome	firefox
this issues occurs in google-chrome and ie but not in firefox

12358125
folder	directory
my mistake is probably that is nstreecontroller does not differentiate between the simple objects files and the directory folder

12358127
try-catch	exception-handling
i have a try-catch sentence for it and it doesn t throw any exception-handling

12358127
post	get
with firebug i get the post request is successful along with the response this i got adding an aftersubmit option function and checking postdata

12358128

when doing more complex stuff with javascript you can also consider using a framework like backbone.js sammy.js or knockout.js there are many more

12358132
onresume	onpause
is it appropriate to define instance variables on the top of the class or we need to define them in onresume onpause of the activity

12358140
popover	tooltip
the only features that are opt-in are the tooltip and popover

12358151
profiler	visualvm
also it would help if you use a java profiler such as visualvm

12358169
boost	stl
using the stl and boost will probably help avoiding some mistakes

12358215
unsigned	short
unsigned short gf_t 44

12358249
google-chrome	firefox
it seems it s a little faster than a while backwards on firefox and on google-chrome they tie

12358265
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql or sql server

12358295
int	double
also there is a slight rounding issue with double and if you need perfect precision doubtful given the rest of your code but typically the standard is to use 2 int to store currency

12358313
subtract	add
go through both arrays for each number in n add the exponent of each prime in its factorisation to the value in the map for the numbers in d subtract

12358316
google-chrome	firefox
as far as i know google-chrome extensions technically can t save files to disk like firefox

12358357
google-chrome	firefox
try using google-chrome or firefox s developer tools to identify any elements on the page that might be interfering

12358391
versioning	upgrade
i could not upgrade my jboss tools to recognize jboss as 7 so i upgrade my versioning of eclipse as well

12358419
google-chrome	firefox	http	spdy
you could even go overkill and look into spdy which is an alternative lighter http protocol supported in google-chrome and firefox

12358426
int	double
2 casting from double type to an int

12358442
put	get
you might as well always use cgcontextdrawpath and put in your own parameters to get the type of fill stroke that you want

12358621
int	boolean
the left shifts will automatically convert the boolean to their corresponding int values

12358640
translation	localization
now you can decide to have a multiple-bundle approach or follow a single-bundle technique in the latter case you can package all the languages and then use the unique updated bundle for language translation by using the automatic system localization rules

12358660
int	boolean
if your language allows the use of boolean as int values true 1 false 0 these get easier

12358675
implements	extends
instead of extends a concrete list adapter and modifying the getview method i created a new class implements the listadapter interface that blindly forwards almost everything to another listadapter except getview

12358675
listadapter	simplecursoradapter
to use it simply instantiate it supplying any other listadapter be it arrayadapter or simplecursoradapter or anything else

12358679
getter	setter
in avoid internal getter setter section is

12358689
post	get
if i happen to get better results i will post em here

12358690
sorting	grouping
each script handles a different incoming flat file with it s own formatting sorting grouping and outputting requirements

12358690
put	get
because the processing of the data is different for each file i need to open the file to get my counter value because this is a common operation i d like to put it in a sub to retrieve the counter

12358821
int	double
the standard conversion methods begin with to 20d.toint will convert a value 20 of type double a value 20 of type int

12358836
inherited	properties
also you should make application derive from component so it can inherited all the same properties behaviour without duplicating the code

12358861
caanimation	calayer
caanimation calayer caanimationgroup etc are nearly identical between mac and ios

12358894
google-chrome	firefox
it works flawlessly in firefox but google-chrome and ie act like the observers don t even exist

12358901
profiling	benchmarking
as a rule of thumb exception handling is more expensive than ifs but i agree with thez that the best approach would be to benchmarking profiling both versions under the expected load

12358910
int	double
i have comboboxes than bind to collections of type int or double in my silverlight application

12358913
range	minimum
i am planning on using a device such as the microsoft kinect or an asus xtion pro for 3d imaging purposes and they are great on all specs except for the minimum range

12358916
google-chrome	firefox
this works great...in ie9 firefox and google-chrome

12358927
google-chrome	firefox
this works in the browsers i ve tested google-chrome firefox ie8 ie10 but this does not pass jslint bad invocation

12358974
google-chrome	firefox
i went to firebug on firefox and the developers tools on google-chrome and tried to find a solution perhaps looking at styles but nothing came up

12358999
awt	swing
you can learn about abstract classes here and about awt swing painting here

12359061
implements	extends
just write a servlet that extends httpservlet and implements dopost

12359063
getter	setter
the second quote suggests that without jit using a trivial getter setter is slower than direct field access eg

12359102
width	height
this is because of limitation set to display routes in the region of quarter of world size in height and width around the current location

12359122
mouseleave	mouseenter
note that it subscribes to the ie specific mouseenter and mouseleave event so you also have to reference jquery which simulates those events in the other browsers

12359143
getter	setter
you should always keep your variables private and use methods to manipulate them getter and setter or something else

12359210
hide	show
here s the thing first i m loading a video in html5 and then when the video finish the function hide the video and show the iframe div which is occult with jquery but for some reason when the video s hide the iframe doesn t appear and when i inspect the element the tag is there but appears with the src empty

12359261
instances	transient
almost any component is also using a repository instances which is also transient and also implements idisposable and again no particular reason for that

12359328
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
if you re going to subclassing make each subclassing a module with its own public-facing interface and its own privately-scoped vars and then make that module the properties of whatever you were trying to make rather than trying to get chains of inherited working

12359359
persistent	transient
every non static non transient property field or method depending on the access type of an entity is considered persistent unless you annotate it as transient

12359384
floating-point	integer
in your case if all your probabilities are multiples of 1 96 then you can do the same thing choosing a random integer less than 96 instead of a floating-point number

12359384
int	double
just use int s instead of double s and use rnd.nextint 96 to choose an int between 0 and 95 inclusive instead of math.random

12359502
udp	tcp
the fact is i m bound to use the tcp server to communicate with both users the udp server is just here to return user s port to himself so it can send it back to tcp server

12359579
cpython	ironpython
this use of traceback only works with those implementations of python that uses frames such as cpython but not jython or ironpython

12359599
put	get	post	get	post	put
since i get 200 ok status i think the code for post works ok so i won t put the whole httprequest class here just the most important methods

12359624
children	parent
the parent always resizes to that of the size of the children s space if not anything else is declared

12359627
solaris	aix
solaris and aix do just fine

12359629
width	height
unfortunately it s not quite as configurable as views slideshow but views slideshow requires hacking to get it responsive as it inserts width height attributes directly in the dom

12359632
children	parent
i think you don t have to do anything special to have the parent div as high as the children blocks

12359650
single-quotes	double-quotes
in xml codes you can use either double-quotes or single-quotes for setting strings

12359724
put	get
when i tried to put the data in mysql i get this error java.lang.outofmemoryerror java heap space

12359747

java and scala allows you to cast a primitive double to int in scala s case double to int

12359842
width	height
then you for-loop the width and height getwidth getheight

12359867
google-chrome	firefox
i was under the impression that both my syntax and use of data-attributes was correct as i had managed to get full functionality within firefox and dreamweaver s preview window but it soon become evident that my method didnt work in google-chrome or ie9

12359942
int	boolean
if you re going to be returning mixed values int + boolean you should use the strict equality check

12359947
union	distinct
using union is like adding and implicit distinct requirement which takes up processor cycles and makes the query plan more complicated

12359967
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
works great in ie but not in firefox safari or google-chrome

12359993
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari

12360000
put	get
in the log below whether i put into the db.key.from_path command c_key or court i get exactly the same result which shows that the values of the 2 weekday_key s are identical not different as i expected

12360070
int	boolean
or since c casts int to boolean automatically

12360070
int	boolean
if you really want to get a 0 or 1 value out of your comparison you can take advantage of more automatic type-casting to turn a boolean back into an int

12360094
folder	directory
i think most of the views templates are mapped as filesystem directory folder

12360098
post	get
my actual project is too large to post here but basically what happens is i get a huge amount of error output as if the classpath was improperly set they re errors on library functions

i am currently grouping them and sorting by most recent vote

12360438
post	get
while it s good practice to fix non-structural errors such as the one you mentioned in your other post browsers are forgiving if you get the basic structure right

12360440
capitalize	uppercase
capitalize transforms your string to lower case but for the first letter which becomes uppercase

12360465
put	get	post	get	post	put
the content of an http get request will always be empty - it is only valid to send content on post and put and possibly delete requests

12360589
uiview	subviews
important notes i m not using a uiscrollview because the mentioned uiview has plenty of draggable subviews so if i use a uiscrollview i can t drag because the uiviewscroll scrolling event executes over the subviews events

12360602
codeblocks	codelite
one wants to provide project files for many different ides under different platforms such as linux 32 bit 64 bit windows 32 bit 64 bit mac 32 bit 64 bit codeblocks eclipse cdt kdevelop3 codelite microsoft visual studio etc

12360602
folder	directory
i have already looked at cmake which gets very close to the final goal but it creates an additional cmake folder to the ide project files and also doesn t copy possible example source into the build directory

12360608
int	boolean
if some of them are categorical int markers those feature should be exploded as one-of-k boolean encodings instead as scikit-learn implementation of random forest s cannot directly deal with categorical data

12360611
width	height
i want to make the rectangle fill all space of the pane without set the width or height manually because the pane be resizable

12360626
uiview	subviews
i would rather make a uiview container clipping subviews add the content view which we will drag as a subviews and change it s frame

12360643
versioning	upgrade
i ve since upgrade the os on my server which in turn upgrade the php versioning and this issue has been fixed

12360652
virtualenv	setuptools
virtualenv is now using distribute not setuptools

specifies that public and protected static members up the hierarchy should be returned

12361030
getter	setter
and the app already makes extensive use of and both getter and setter

12361030
getter	setter
it seems that we can actually use and change the getter and setter to actually use the array but there will be two extra instance variables

12361030
getter	setter
or can we define 2 methods so that will actually invoke some setter method and parent.leftchild will invoke a getter

12361059
pop-up	dialog
i have added links to text that is surrounded by square brackets in a pop-up dialog box

12361099

12361099
128bit	64bit
devices such as the arm cortex-a8 and cortex-a9 support 128bit vectors but will execute with just 64bit at a time 32 whereas newer cortex-a15 devices can execute 128 bits at once

s wider than it is tall landscape we can set the width to the desired width of the thumbnail thumb_width and adjust the height to maintain the aspect ratio

12361307
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
nowadays many modern browsers accept styling like border-radius for example the latest google-chrome safari firefox and ie9 so as minitech referred to earlier these stylings are now used to support older versions of modern browsers

next i was writing my own class to treat a stream or array of bytes as a big number and add multiple operator methods to perform hex arithmetic until i read about the system.numerics.biginteger class online - but being that there is no biginteger.maxvalue and that i can only load a max of 2 gb of data at a time i don t know what the potential of biginteger would be - even compared to the object i was writing called number which does have my desired minimum potential

12363976
division	multiplication
i ll be treating the 4-5 gb of data like any other number instead of an array of bytes - performing such arithmetic as division and multiplication

12363993
cakephp	kohana	codeigniter	kohana	codeigniter	cakephp

12364559
qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel
as an sql table doesn t naturally map to a tree you might have to look at using a proxy model or extending qabstractitemmodel yourself to work with the qtreeview as this will be specific to your business logic and whether you are using nested sets or materialised path etc

12364580
nsstring	nsobject
which is technically correct as nsstring is derived from nsobject and nsobject does not have writetofile function

12364596
int	chars
since you only use 26 chars you can do the same with a simple int too

12365527
int	chars
a late edit applying a data orientation pattern can be even more beneficial if we take struct and class padding into consideration if a model has a chars and an int data members in oop fashion it will be padded which will only pollute cache further but a data oriented storage mode can store all the chars s and all the int s sequentially with no space and cache wasted at all

12365554
hash	salt
the user password is then hash with sha-256 using a 256-bit securely random generated token as a salt a string is created with a colon delimiter containing the hash and salt which is then encrypted with the public key same one as previous and stored in the database password_hash field

hash	salt
first the password_hash is unencrypted using the private key stored on the server in a non-web-accessible directory the password for that private key is hard-coded into the app the user-entered password is then rehashed using the salt from the now unencrypted database entry and if it matches the hash of the stored salt password the process continues on else returns error of event id not found or password incorrect

12365556

12381086
width	height
0.6 according to the discovered screen resolution you will multiply the width height of the image with that constant

readwrite vs readonly determines whether a synthesized properties has a synthesized accessor or not readwrite has a setter and is the default readonly does not

12381203
getter	setter
if you are writing your own setter getter atomic nonatomic retain assign copy are merely advisory

getter	setter
with atomic the synthesized setter getter will ensure that a whole value is always returned from the getter or set by the setter regardless of setter activity on any other thread

12381203
getter	setter
that is if thread a is in the middle of the getter while thread b calls the setter an actual viable value -- an autoreleased object most likely -- will be returned to the caller in a

12381203
getter	setter
if thread a is calling the getter simultaneously with thread b and c calling the setter with different values thread a may get any one of the three values returned -- the one prior to any setter being called or either of the values passed into the setter in b and c

12394949
filtering	grouping
you can add the following filtering before grouping by

12394951
inherited	properties
ensure that the inherited properties and the class defined in this code file uses the same name and try and add the namespace before the class name

12394955
width	height
the solution i ve foud to center it was removing the button height and width because it will expand to wrap the span and it will be centered

12394955
width	height
but for bigger buttons like 30px x 50px it will just be fine to set height and width or at least the padding is very very hard to notice if there s some

12394956
bitwise-or	bitwise-and
they perform bitwise-or operations and bitwise-and operations with the result being stored in the lvalue

12394988

keydown	keyup
i want to be able to send a keydown message and a keyup message

12395126
button	checkbox
basically i would suggest you to create a delete button which executes the logic to delete the selected rows - i guess you are using a tempalte column with a checkbox inside

12395126
button	checkbox
so lets say the name of the class for the checkbox is cool then you can execute the following logic in the delete button click handler

12395153
width	margin
when true is passed it will take the outer width of a container including the margin

12395153
width	margin
therefore when you have an item of width 0 and take the outer width it will be only the padding margin border you don t want included in the width

12395174

maven	pom.xml
because you mention a pom.xml i assume you want to support maven users or you want to publish to a maven repository

12395307
ant	pom.xml
if that isn t true you don t need to publish to a pom.xml and you can just work with ivy metadata like in the ant ivy setup

12395310
ant	maven
can maven do what we are doing in this ant build.xml

12395316
google-chrome	firefox
if i remove this event google-chrome and firefox and still ie will receive my file

12395331
children	parent
my favourite approach is using windows powershell but you ll need to delete the blueprint children first before attempting to delete their parent

12395349
min	max
therefore and indexed views containing top or for the matter max or min which suffer from the very same problem cannot be maintained efficiently and are not permitted

12395362
getter	setter
furthermore if a local variable exists it takes precedence over getter and setter

12395362
getter	setter
if you re using a getter or setter always use self even when it s not strictly necessary

12395362
getter	setter
and that ended up being a bit long-winded but i was unable to find a good demonstration of the getter setter local problem to link to

then setting them in ini file makes further use of myqsli convenient since you don t have to parse any file define your own config simply connect

12395515
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
this is why most developers use concurrent nsoperation using asynchronous nsurlconnection to do the downloading - so the get the cancel message in real time

12395520
int	chars
i know typecasting int to chars is quite simple in plain-old c however i m wondering if the jni will negate any performance gains

12395520
int	chars
edit 2 i changed the text above to say that c code can cast from int to chars instead of int to byte

12395533
put	get
problem every time i add let s say a text view i get a green box around it that will put it in a location

12395576
mouseover	mousedown
noticed that i declared px and py in the mousedown event making them accessible as a closure to the inner function that is bound to the mouseover event

12395608

to simpelify usage you can also add a .git file not directory in your dropbox synced folder with the content gitdir path to repo.git so that you can use git as normal

12395660
stateless	stateful
difference between stateful v stateless bean behavior when calling different methods

12395690

12395909
setinterval	clearinterval
setinterval will do it once-every-n-miliseconds and clearinterval will stop it when you re done

12395929
hide	show
onmouseover and onmouseout events are used to show hide the popup

12395929
google-chrome	firefox
in ie google-chrome and firefox in windows the system dialog disables events handling by page

12395929
mouseover	mouseout
which means if you move a mouse cursor out of the dialog window on one of the page element the page won t do anything like reacting on mouseover mouseout events

12395929
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
unfortunately in case with google-chrome firefox on mac safari is ok the page elements do react on mouse over out

12395966
folder	directory
at first i thought that i must have put the csv file into the wrong directory inside xcode project s folder structure

12395980

or better write it as a for-loop and apply a suitable #pragma and compiler options to make the compiler do loops unrolling for you

12396012
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
in ios 5 you can use the following call to start an nsurlconnection and add it to an nsoperationqueue

12396013
versioning	upgrade
if you recently upgrade to phpunit 3.6 there s a possibility you still have an older versioning of file_iterator installed and that s the problem based on a vague memory of the same error

12396013
versioning	upgrade
if anything looks not-right or just to be sure upgrade phpunit to ensure it s at the latest versioning and so are all dependencies

12396024
ant	maven
after recently converting to maven from ant run configurations that launched immediately pre-maven take an excessive amount of time and consume an abnormal amount of resources while eclipse prepares to launch the projects

12396024
maven	m2e
i am only using the latest m2e maven plugin with the latest version of eclipse

12396035
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome successfully parse the entire page correctly

12396035
google-chrome	firefox
again firefox and google-chrome do not have trouble interpreting or displaying this page

12396046
ready	each
for each branch you want to update with the caveat that i would generally advise against simply going through every branch until you re actually ready to do work on it

12396056
integer	unsigned
cf carry flag - similarly to the overflow flag of it can be used to determine overflow of integer arithmetic operations performed on unsigned operands

12396056
operands	decrement
the value of this flag tells whether the memory operands address es should be incremented or decrement after each iteration

12396137
put	get
i would like to do something like the above code to get the values in the duedate element so i could manipulate the values then put them back into ocrvar.duedate

12396159
mouseevent	mouselistener
you can add mouselistener to gui component whose top left pixel should be threated as 0 0 point and get x and y from mouseevent

12396191
google-chrome	firefox
using uploadify in firefox doesn t work while using it in google-chrome does

12396247
submit	submission
also i recommend to redirect user to the same page after form submission it ll prevent from repeated form submit on page refresh

12396252
ant	maven
for typical distribution you would use ant maven gradle to build your own jar file with the compiled groovy class files in it

12396281
nant	xmlpoke
you might also consider using nant xmlpoke if you are running from nant script

12396304

12396408
width	height
i only see 0 as height and width

12396443
hide	show
my guess is that in mobile and ie8 these sub-menus start out as hidden so this function does what it is supposed to show the sub-menu on first click and then hide it when clicked again

12396487
width	height
that way i get a box that is 220px width and 440px height it was important that the text box has the same size as the image

12396504
apache	nginx
they can be requested directly from the web server apache or nginx

12396506

12396556
margin	height	width	margin	width	height
when you specify a height width or margin or anything else in your css it will display in the correct size on a normal display and a retina display will do the double pixel conversion internally so it uses double the device pixels

12396560
jar	war
this process can still slow down especially when redeploying large applications with multiple jar files and war files and all the classpath has to be refreshed

12396663
scala	typesafe
typesafe stack is a bundle of common scala tools if you happy with standalone play framework and don t use most of the stack tools just continue usage but if you are using sbt g8 and or akka it s a natural choice to have it all packed together you install stack and have instruments up and running

portrait	landscape
i d like the listview to display underneath the mapview and header in portrait mode and on the right of the mapview and underneath the header in landscape mode

12428838
portrait	landscape	width	height
i d also like the mapview s height in portrait and width in landscape to be a percentage of the available window size minus action bar status bar and navigation bar - if one exists on the device

12428838
width	height
i ve tried a few things recommended in similar questions but the solution always returns the height width of the device and not the window size of the activity

rails receives a get and shows the post but it does not destroy it

12429098
post	put
i would post code but i have tried so much i wouldn t know what to put anymore

12429143
getter	setter
the way you would do that is by making currentlat and currentlong private with public getter and setter and synchronizing the get set functions

12429149
portrait	landscape
i m not sure the answer here is to get the screen dimensions but rather to use appropriate layouts for portrait and landscape that use the weight property to allocate the screen space between the different views

12429157
junit	mockito	junit	powermockito
i m using junit mockito and powermockito

12429177
width	margin
but your better option would be to wrap the main area in a div or other block element sectioning root set it to the width that you want and then center it with margin 0 auto

12429187
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a tabcontrol where each tabitem shows a listview

12429191
for-loop	loops
observation i noticed that i made a newbie s mistake -- i only used a single ctx.beginpath and ctx.moveto posx posy prior to the for-loop and a single ctx.stroke after the for-loop and loops itself wrapped a single ctx.lineto

12429195
addition	multiplication
i typically only use matrices for a short-time to take advantage of the syntax for multiplication but with the addition of the .dot method on arrays i find i do that less and less as well

12429237
getter	setter
experimentblock inherits its primary key field with annotations a getter and a setter from its superclass periodresident

12429237
getter	setter
this is the mystery of this bug the exact same field getter setter code is being used for every subclass of periodresident but experimentblock is the only one that eclipselink returns with a nulled-out primary key

12429241
backtracking	greedy
normally the term greedy is used to describe algorithms that do not backtracking

12429279
pandas	pytables
being a regular user of numpy i am falling in love with pandas for its syntax and concepts and started to read about pytables which seems very robust and performance-oriented

12429286
sharpbox	dropnet
in the desktop version i have used dropnet which references sharpbox json etc

12429287
cvs	svn
of course in cvs that would never have worked but since svn allows you to move files around on the server i presume it is smart enough to know how to merge files that have changed directories

12429306
getter	setter
in particular note that it defaults to public members only - which means that every public getter setter pair and every public field will be automatically bound to xml unless annotated by xmltransient

12429396
width	text-align
to get your centered text in the header is as simple as text-align center which will work no matter the width of the container

12429436

i am fairly new to xslt and have scanned through several post on the topic but cant seem to get the final peice i need to make this work

12429438
tablet	galaxy
i have tested it on samsung galaxy 1 and 2 note mobile devices and on a lenovo thinkpad tablet

12429454
children	parent
this makes the child parent more loosely coupled so that you could swap in any parent that implemented that protocol and the children would still work fine

12429468
required	placeholder
i initialized two threads in the constructor using the placeholder _1 as the argument required by member function fillsample int num

post	get
i am having trouble setting up a aspx.cs page to get the information to post on the server

12429736
floating-point	integer
given your last two examples with 4543621235648200192 and such it seems you want to accept numbers that are integer multiples of .0001 and reject those that are not and you want to do this not using .0001 but using a variable that contains the floating-point value nearest .0001

12429736
floating-point	integer
in other words is there an integer k such that multiplying .0001 by k and rounding to the nearest floating-point value produces exactly x

12429821
width	height
browser window size 1600 width x 530 height

12429821
width	height
orignal image size 1024 width x 768 height

12429821
width	height
expected result 1024 width x 530 height so it should crop the remaining height

12429821
width	height
height and its cropping is ok but 1600 width is wrong i want it to be 1024 width so image didnt loose quality

12429831
memcpy	memmove
knowing that length allows python to use memmove or memcpy the difference being that memmove works correctly even if the source and destination overlap

12429831
memcpy	memmove
it is relatively unlikely that they ve got anything faster than memmove memcpy available

12429831
strcpy	memmove	memcpy	memmove	memcpy	strcpy
i modified the c code to produce more stable timings for me on my machine mac os x 10.7.4 8 gib 1333 mhz ram 2.3 ghz intel core i7 gcc 4.7.1 and to compare strcpy and strcat vs memcpy vs memmove

12429831

mouseup	mouseleave
to avoid this i decided to force draggable to stop when the mouseleave the #window tiggering mouseup i read this on the forum and it works

12429899
move	drag
and now the problem when the mouse is move again and drag event is trigged it remembers the distance with the box and magically move it without touching.

12429942
getter	setter
it will not work in your case because your getter method is not projected by the lock which protects the setter method

12430021
accessor	properties
note the use of the object properties accessor

12430053
put	get	hide	show
following is my javascript in which i ve been trying to show certain div and after the function being performed the div should get hide by itself but i am having this issue that in same function both doesnot work like to show first then after some time interval hide that div but when i put event of show and hiding separately it worked fine

i have a uiview which is a subviews and it contains several uitextfields

12430397
hide	show
everything works fine if the datetextfield is the first field to edit but when another textfield is edited and of course show the keyboard and then try to edit the datefield the keyboard doesn t hide and everything goes normal but with the keyboard doing anything

12430443
uiview	subviews
the best way is to use a custom view your custom navigation bar as a subviews of the main view then do the animations yourself using functions like uiview animatewithduration .... with translation function using something like catransform3dtranslate

12430451
division	multiplication
since the multiplication and division segments are right next to eachother just read from left to right for that part

12430451
division	multiplication
remember when multiplication and division are right next to each-other just read left to right

12430544

12430576
implements	extends
you can easily implements a myspace-like system in asp.net assuming that each skinnable feature is implements as a control subclass just extends your render method to allow for the insertion of said arbitrary html

12430607
opera	firefox	width	height
so i did a test of the actual size width and height of the jquery ui combobox button on the jquery demo page in opera 12 ie9 and firefox 15 to see if it was a zoom thing or something else

12430607
width	height
opera width height 30px 25px

google-chrome	firefox
i have tested it in google-chrome ie and firefox all with same results

12430668
width	height
and i want to use css styles to set the width and height look the follwoing code

12430668

but the height and width are not set instead the background yes

12430715
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this works in some browsers firefox and google-chrome but not in others safari

12430724
button	checkbox
so to use multiple option button as checkbox you will need to store the correct value of the option button probably in an array .

12430809
firefox	safari
i have checked in firefox ie and safari which all yield the same results

12430855
keydown	keyup
using keypress prevents the bounce effect that keyup has keydown also does but event.which doesn t distinguish directly between upper and lower case here--shift key check is messy owing to caps lock

12430897
matplotlib	scipy
if you would like to easily install ipython scipy matplotlib etc

min	max
assuming that pids cannot be repeated this is a trivial task put everything in a table select min time max time pid group by pid

12430921
innodb	myisam
i decided to change the table engine from myisam to innodb

12430942
client-side	server-side
if you re talking about some application that runs solely client-side with no server-side processing whatsoever then there s really no such thing as pre-processing

12430953
web-inf	xwiki
i m trying to write a class separately from my project and separate from the xwiki package it up as a jar and put it in the xwiki web-inf lib folder of the xwiki project as that s what the instructions say for the xwiki custom authentication

12430966
guava	java.util.concurrent
also iirc there s a concern that many of the components used like those in java.util.concurrent or guava may assume that interruptions are solely for cancellation so if you use interruption for something else those objects may not do what you want

12430990
move	drag
if you click and drag it you can move a dark version of it around the screen

12430992
move	drag
by having a margin between tiles and allowing them to move over into another tile s space before a collision detection began and then springing back into their correct places when the user released the drag

viewdidload	viewdidappear
here is my implementation of the viewdidload and viewdidappear methods

12431072
ctypes	boost-python
but you can wrap up any c or c++ library i d start with sp pretty easily as long as you re comfortable writing your own wrapped in c cython boost-python whatever or using ctypes

12431078
width	height
the best way is to replace the image with a div that has the same width and height of the image and set the background-image property to the image you want

12431137
post	get
in chrome the same action just does a normal get on the link without any of the post data

12431159
mp4	h.264
both videos open and play perfectly in vlc so i don t think there s any issue with a corrupted file and both are mp4 s with an h.264 format using yuv color space

12431171
hash	md5
it seems the hash function uses md5 by default though when i specify md5 in hashbytes it returns the same value but with a 0x prefix

12431364
int	boolean
that means strtotime is returning a boolean false to indicate failure and then you force php to convert that false to an int 0 to handle your minus 3600 calculation

12431434
margin	height
i need to dynamically find the full height of an element usually a div including padding margin and border

12431452
daemons	launchd
if you peek into the teamviewer_linux.rpm for example by running the command rpm -qpl teamviewer_linux.rpm you won t find any launchd agents and daemons since on centos teamviewer is wrapped around a windows emulator wine

12431459
asterisk	freeswitch
you can use the asterisk ices command 1 or install a parallel freeswitch server bridge both servers and use freeswitch s mod_shout 3

12431459
asterisk	freeswitch
you can use freeswitch and asterisk together to solve this

12431459
asterisk	freeswitch
make a call to freeswitch from asterisk instead the ices command

12431472
libsvm	liblinear
in the case of linear kernels libsvm and liblinear produce similar results

12431558
google-chrome	firefox
i m using google-chrome 21 firefox 15

12431647
textview	imageview
one kind of kludgy solution that seems to work is to add a blank textview in a third column to force the 2nd column holding the imageview to be exactly the width of the imageview s bitmap

12431687
portrait	landscape
when a list item is selected the landscape view should show the list and the details side-by-side while the portrait view should show only the details fullscreen

12431687
portrait	landscape
when nothing has been selected the landscape view should show the left on the left and blank space on the right while the portrait view should show only the list fullscreen

12431687
portrait	landscape
consider the opposite case shown above -- rotating from portrait to landscape while the details are visible means the details activity would need to be finish ed so the main activity could display the two-pane layout but this also destroys the details fragment and its savedinstancestate

12431730
width	height
create an element with zero width and height and outline 8px solid invert

12431757
ioexception	printwriter
printwriter and printstream never throw ioexception

12431765
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it seems to work fine on safari firefox and ie but is not working consistently in google-chrome sometimes it does sometimes it doesn t

12431792
ioexception	printwriter
the fact printwriter doesn t report ioexception makes it a poor choice for writing text to a socket where you often need to know the connection has failed

12431812
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox and opera you can use event.detail property if it is not predefined by inituievent

12431824
put	get
do note that that difference will get smaller the more actual code you put into your functions though

12431879

i ve tried google-chrome firefox on a mac and ie 9 on windows and they all demonstrate the problem

12431955
post	get
i ve seen questions about post followed by get but i haven t been able to find this situation

12431959
post	get
i suspect they are caching the conversion so the first person that post a youtube link has to wait for the download and convert all subsequent users just get the already processed file immediately

12431964
openssl	libcrypto
since i am cross compiling openssl i need only the libssl and libcrypto with architecture armv7 other intermediate executables should build with i386 architecture

writing a new record is just a matter of inserting max+1 and incrementing min and max where max-min is the number of records you want to keep available.

12432030
factors	mean
not that i wanted to insult you or something but i really don t like the style of coding when it takes time to understand why something works properly i mean why writing n+1 and then sum factors 2 n

12432061
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
for one touch4j does not support firefox so if you are developing with gwt in windows you cannot view your application in dev mode there s no gwt plugin for safari or google-chrome for windows

i checked in the uploadify code and this is happening because it can t find the swfupload that should be stored

12432351
int	chars
in short i want to identify any chars other than int in a vector and create an object with an output message error for any that are found

12432417
required	placeholder
if something similar is required in the future although i would recommend strictly using placeholder consider non- eval alternative mechanisms.

12432435
post	get
note that i can do get s just fine over curl - only post returning this confusing response

12432492
setinterval	settimeout
as i said you don t need to clear the timeout in your case but in case you do need to clear it in another instance you would need to have settimeout or setinterval return a value

12432495
range	max
hue is a cyclic value thus if you add the total hue range to any color s hue modulo its max value so that it is still within the range you get the exact same color

12432502
children	parent
the use of inverse_of will make the children variable parent be set before saving and there is a chance it will work

12432507
hide	show
i had to hide and show the sub-menu on page load to get my dropdown to work

12432518
gridview	repeater
it has on it a asp repeater and in that repeater there is a asp gridview

12432518
gridview	repeater
each gridview in that repeater then has x amount of columns to show name price blah blah

12432518
gridview	repeater
let s assume that my boss is a very flexible person and does not want to change the structure of the page repeater and gridview and wants me to complete this using some js jquery client side - not another call to the db

- then 1 or more gridview inside the repeater

12432561
put	get
essentially i d like an expression i can put in place of the question marks below to get the metadata of # map

12432598
accessor	properties
it looks like the type needed to be explicitly set to the base class type in order to use the set accessor for that particular properties

12432601
inherited	properties
you can work around this walking the inherited hierarchy and getting the properties declared on each type using the declaredonly bindingflag together with public and instance or checking whether the properties is declared by the reflection type and if not get it again from the properties info s declaringtype

12432610

width	height
1 when drawing this texture give the source rectangle a width of 2 and height x thus only drawing 2 by x instead of x by x

12433055
cout	cin
i would like to wrap cin and cout in the class and overload the and operators

12433078
cout	cin
but if this is just to make std cout and std cin more convenient i wouldn t bother

12433100
cout	cin
if you re really just going to pass them on to cin and cout you can save typing by using a template member function like

12433101
setinterval	settimeout
every time it loops implies that the value might change - so setinterval is incorrect you d need to use settimeout repeatedly.

networkstream	sslstream
i am using sslstream on top of networkstream that wraps a socket how could i detect socket disconnection at this situation

12433473
width	height
it makes the text field bounds shrink to the size of the text otherwise it has a default height width regardless of the text it contains

12433473
width	height
or forgo the autosize property and manually set the height width of your text box to the height width of the rectangle though this would truncate any text that doesn t fit

12433491
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
following code should create the qgraphicsview widget which owns one qgraphicsscene having text inside of it

12433511

the serialnumber value from win32_volume class is an unsigned integer uint32 there s no way to query an unsigned integer value using wmic since you cannot convert the value you can only list all values

12433766
integer	unsigned
as far as i know you can overcome querying an unsigned integer value by scripting it

12433766
integer	unsigned
for example using vbs quering for an unsigned integer value of -1435665788 my systems c drive

12433766

12433919
jar	war
when the template directory is accessible through java.io.file because it s not inside a jar war etc. spring will configure freemarker to use java.io.file directly to load the templates because that way freemarker can check the last modification times and automatically reload templates

backgrounding	multitasking
in the ios app programming guide which you linked to above look in the section backgrounding execution and multitasking under the subheading executing a finite-length task in the backgrounding

int	boolean
the object has four elements boo00 boolean lineiem arraylist rowid int str00 string

12433992

post	get
at implementation level where you will most probably have the same class implementing both interfaces you could express the post condition based on the get operation

i used to think that inheritable methods and fields of the superclass would just superimpose onto the subclassing

12434418
public	protected

12434432
typedef	struct
this typedef is a bit different from most note the basically its a pointer to a struct so this

12434432
typedef	struct
if we use sizeof pstudentrecord we ll get 4 or 8 depending on the underlying architecture because thats a pointer without knowing the size of the structure we can t really dynamically allocated it using its typedef name so what can we do declare a second struct such as this

12434475
post	get
that user had 14 post so all 14 of them get highlighted

12434592
typedef	struct
and there is a the end of a late-night lesson on pointers typedef of anonymous struct and other stuff

12434669
cassini	iis
another distinction i noticed is that cassini runs as a 32-bit process and you have no control over it whereas you can control the application pool of your iis app to disallow 32-bit assuming your iis is running on a 64-bit server

12434674
width	margin
you should update the margin and the specify a width for the element

12434689

free	malloc
the more that you can just reuse already allocated memory and the less you depend on malloc and free the better

12434865
free	malloc
the more that you can malloc and free contiguous blocks at the same time the more likely that the memory management run time can coalesce blocks

12434865

12435147
jquery	touchswipe
another alternative is the touchswipe jquery plugin

12435185
cos	sin	cos	atan2	atan2	sin
i handy rule i found is that if you find yourself using sin cos and atan2 then you re probably doing it wrong

12435207
textview	imageview
each view that is added is a complex component containing a few textview imageview etc

12435220

at least it s easy to calculate this sprite s width times height times four bytes per pixel rgba is

12435787
folder	directory
in this example opening the folder likely triggered a syscall to parse a directory and the scanner parsed it too eg realtime protection

i get the error initializing unsigned chars with an expression of type chars 5 converts between pointers to int types with different sign. i m guessing that means that some of the representations of 0 and 1 that are getting used are signed but i m not sure why how to deal with that

jboss	glassfish	jboss	weblogic	glassfish	weblogic
but your chances of writing documentation to instruct how to do it are better because you don t have to figure out how to do it for weblogic tomcat jetty jboss websphere glassfish and every other java ee app server

what you have right now is a method named show in derived class which hide the method named show in base class it does not override it

i forgot to say - i upgrade php versioning from 5.2 to 5.3 and some of code will break because php settings is secure

12437379
getter	setter	ivar	subclassing
obviously i m able to set the numberofbackseatpassengers on the sportscar - even though that ivar was declared as private - but that s because i made it an property in car.h which means that the synthesized getter and setter for it are instance methods thereby available to all subclassing of car

12437379
getter	setter
the other option would have been to not declare numberofbackseatpassengers as an property in car.h keep it there as only a simple ivar and instead manually create a setter and getter for it in the implementation of car.m like this

12437379
getter	setter
this would have made the getter and setter for numberofbackseatpassengers available only within car.m - which i suppose would make them private - but they d be too private i could never call them from main or from anywhere outside of car.m moreover and this is the real point doing it this way means the private directive back in car.h doesn t really come into play at all in any of this

12437379
getter	setter
2 aroth s also absolutely right in saying that in sportscar we can simply override the car class s setter and getter for numberofbackseatpassengers and have these overriding methods reset it to 0 or give an error etc

12437379
getter	setter	ivar	subclassing
or is there still some instance where you d want to declare an ivar in the header as private but not declare a setter and getter for it there in the header - so those won t be explicitly available to subclassing - and have it all make sense

12437379
ivar	subclassing
- we could solve a lot of problems - but its still very likely that sooner or later we ll run into a situation where we d perhaps want an private ivar for one of our classes and not want to create another subclassing to deal with it

12437379
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
i keep trying to think of a real-world example of some properties of a car that we would want only the car to have - and that none of its subclassing should inherited

12437379
getter	setter
cause its not like putting private in front of phantomivar freed us up to still be able write a setter getter for it in the header and have those be only accessible to car class objects and not subclasses of car

12437379
getter	setter
to get privacy you d have to go in the implementation file and write your setter and getter there

12437398
jar	war
i commented properties for war building and uncommented properties for jar building

12437422
getter	setter
i am rather the java-guy so handling getter setter in c# is a little new to me

12437445
implements	extends
class a extends class b both implements serializable class b does not have a serial uid

12437445
implements	extends
class a extends class b both implements serializable class b now has a serial uid class a s serialuid is same as that of version 1

12437447
accessor	properties
your current code simply calls into the same properties accessor method infinitely until you run out of stack space

12437460
getter	setter
this would have made the getter and setter for

12437460
getter	setter
the compiler wouldn t treat them as publicly visible and would complain if you tried to call them directly but you d still be able to call your getter and setter on any subclass of car simply by using performselector

12437460
getter	setter
i d suggest that if sportscar is meant to extend car and never allow any backseat passengers to be recorded that the standard way to do that would be to simply override the getter setter methods in sportscar to either always set return 0 or to raise some error if an attempt is made to set a nonzero value

12437460
ivar	subclassing
so a subclassing of car will not be able to see the numberofbackseatpassengers ivar itself

12437460
getter	setter	ivar	subclassing
but since you ve created a public getter setter for it the subclassing will of course be able to see those and use them to modify the value of the ivar

12437460
public	protected
without private protected every ivar declared in a header would be public which is definitely not good in an object-oriented environment for all the reasons jonathan pointed out

12437460
getter	setter
as for use-cases properties with getter setter are probably not the best example

12437460
getter	setter
the purpose of getter setter is virtually always to provide a public interface for modifying querying the property value and as noted in objective-c it s not necessary to explicitly declare an ivar in any scope to back a synthesized property

12437460
getter	setter
so you would declare them in your header and you generally would not add any getter setter methods for these ivars

12437460
ivar	subclassing
so subclassing can use the datarecorder through the api but they can t mess with the backing ivar itself to disable or modify the behavior of the mandated black-box data recorder

when i replaced the bionic libc from the gingerbread 2.3.4 sources distribution with the libc from the ti dsp sources it resolved all of my libc reference errors

12438036
bionic	libc
suggestion i would make sure that the c library which your android.mk build is pointing to for linking is the c library provided for the dsp project and not the default android bionic libc

12438077
qitemdelegate	qabstractitemview
2a is the default behavior and 2b can likely be achieved by using qabstractitemview setcurrentindex in a re-implementation of qitemdelegate eventfilter as suggested here in a similar context

i think you are mixing up localization with translation here

12438139
folder	directory
a good article covering what i ve said above as well as delving into code to copy the db from your assets folder to the databases directory can be found here

12438139
folder	directory
you cannot put the db directly into your apps data directory as its blocked from access by anything except your app unless you root your device so you must put it in your assets folder and then copy it from there to your apps data directory or somewhere else that it can be used.

mongodb	bson
i am just starting out with mongodb and one of the things that i have noticed is that it uses bson to store data internally

12438280
mongodb	bson
however the documentation is not exactly clear on what bson is and how it is used in mongodb

12438314
doc	rtf
as it is now-no matter how i save it rtf txt or doc it ends up just as source code

note it sometimes works as expected the nested svg stays crisp in firefox and google-chrome but not always for example if i open the attached jsfiddle in google-chrome it s blury broken

12438353
mongodb	bson
bson is the binary encoding of json-like documents that mongodb uses when storing documents in collections

12438353
mongodb	bson
in practice you don t have to know much about bson when working with mongodb you just need to use the native types of your language and the supplied types objectid of its driver when constructing documents and they will be mapped into the appropriate bson type by the driver

12438370
int	chars
string.charat i will return a chars and string.charat i - 0 will return the actual int value

12438382
int	chars
i don t know what is the purpose of this specific operation but in java and in many programming languages chars chars are represented as an int value only smaller 2 bytes in java

12438382
int	chars
you can explicitly cast chars to int like this

12438382
int	chars
the string.charat function returns a chars and if you treat it like an int it has a value like 120 only an example

12438472
min	max
you can use min and max to constrain a value

12438484
superclass	subclassing
the method has been overridden in the subclassing so it s effectively replacing the method on the superclass

12438484
superclass	subclassing
the subclassing itself can call the method in the superclass

12438497
int	chars
what you re trying to do is read a chars one at a time convert it to an int and store it in your array

12438523
int	chars
edit but as bali182 said just casting the chars to an int is more readable

12438632
fadein	fadeout
when you call fadeout the function you pass into it gets called after the effect completes and then the effect caused by fadein is processed

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
if you want a full compatibility with almost all the browsers in usage from ie 5+ onwards i m saying ie cuz this one is the shittiest and the hardest one to achieve compatibility for firefox google-chrome safari dolphin mobile phone browsers etc the modular design of the closure library enables you to compute browser specific css at runtime without it having to be an expensive process

versioning	upgrade
you can upgrade your rails versioning to 3.1.x or higher and upgrade the mysql2 in the gem file

however if i alert addonend after the for-loop it returns undefined literally the string and then the rest of the arrays as it should

12439742
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
if so to bypass that by adding the command to the sudoers file then when using the command with sudo it will not ask for a passwd but will elevate you to root right away

12439742
sudoers	passwd
to allow a specific program or shell script to run as root but without typing the passwd like during boot add to etc sudoers the following line

12439742

these strings may be long paragraphs so i m not sure it s best to split the entire string with a spaces delimiter

12440067
qtableview	qtablewidget
i used qtableview but i think it can also work with qtablewidget

12440117
width	height
what i can see here is you are creating a new webview so either specify height and width to webview or add webview control to xaml with some name and specific height and width .

12440125
filtering	grouping
with that in mind you should either name all your grouping or filtering out numeric grouping names

12440127
int	double
if you used an id column definition like id int primary key autoincrement where the system defined the values automatically for you this isn t an issue but if you manually populated the id column it might be something to double check

12440132

you can use any height width you want

for-loop	arrays
the idea is that i m re-creating them in a for-loop because the length of these arrays changes inside it

12440365
put	get	google-chrome	firefox
the accepted answer for this question is concise and nicely put together function - don t get me wrong - but it s about 70 slower than just scanning the string with a for-loop in my tests on firefox google-chrome at least .

folder	directory
other files in the directory include the gemfile.lock which was created through bundle install if i remember correctly and folder for r18n public views

portrait	landscape
the text can have arbitrary length and the flashcards are displayed in different activities sometimes smaller sometimes bigger plus in landscape + portrait mode and i haven t found any corner case where the solution would not work properly.

12441594
portrait	landscape
rather than have a really small portrait figure i d like to have this rotated to landscape so it can fill the page as much as possible

12441611
portrait	landscape
for example i want sunday to show sun for portrait mode but sunday for landscape mode

12442667

integer	fractions
a 32-bit float can represent many values that a 32-bit signed integer can t either because they re fractions 0.5 or because they re too big 2.0 100

12442741
int	double
use d for int instead of i and f and for double instead of d in the following line

12442770

chunked	transfer-encoding
though to be honest i like the idea suggested by user189423 of multipart content-type or chunked transfer-encoding as well

in this case if minimizing processors usage is important to reduce power consumption you will need to find a processor-specific method of suspending the cpu if your library doesn t provide one

12443683

12443795
for-loop	arrays
it seems to me in the following code extract from snippet2 sortlistener that is going to change the arrays of tableitems called items that we are iterating over in the outer for-loop also when one item is disposed and inserted into items at a new index the whole arrays is recreated afresh

ffmpeg	libav
ffmpeg merges most commits from libav but it s not as reciprocal so libav does not have as many features

virtuemart	prestashop
i am using it for the last two weeks and i am planning to switch all my customers from virtuemart to prestashop

12444263

the main point is that you put that xmlelement tag above the variable declaration versus putting it on a getter or setter

12444277
for-loop	arrays
you say that in the code before the value of y should stay the same which means for every other index of y in the 2-d arrays they re set to null but in the for-loop you have this

similar to calibrating a single camera 2d image with a chessboard i wish to determine the width height of the chessboard or of a single square in pixels

12444307
width	height
i am using the camera to determine the translation between consequtive frames successfully achieved using fourier phase correlation at the moment my result returns the translation in pixels however i would like to use techniques similar to calibration where i move the camera over the chessboard which is flat on the ground to automatically determine the size of the chessboard in pixels relative to my image height and width

12444359
google-chrome	firefox
it works normal in firefox and google-chrome

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works great on google-chrome safari and firefox but ie7-9 does not play well

folder	directory
i know i can umask to set the permissions for both files and directory however i need the permissions to be different for files and folder

that way assuming all your directory creations are done with mkdir you can ensure they use a different umask setting

so i ve seen a tutorial where a config file contained the width and the height and the values that followed the equal sign could been retrieved and used to establish the size of a frame

12447353
width	height
strangely enough this seams to work only for some key words as if i ve used in the config file also a parameter named freq it didn t retrieved its value as it did with the width height parameters

12447353

filesystems	ntfs
i am performing manipulations with tables in this db and noticed about many disk bad block reports in my windows system event log the filesystems is ntfs

12448244
width	height
you can use frame differentiation...that is subtract the current frame from the previous frame and take the absolute difference...threshold the difference...this segments out your moving car from the back ground...remember this segments all moving objects...so if u want a car and not a moving man you can use the shape characteristic that is the height is to width ratio...fit a rectangle to the segmented part and in each frame do the same steps

12448250

so i would like to know what i need to add to or subtract from the htaccess file so that the url can look like

12448942
min	max
set_maxmin sets max and min of all nodes 2 n-1 in number

12448942
min	max
tree_insert inserts an element by traversing till it finds the index max min of a node leaf o course

12448963

you want to change the box-model via box-sizing border-box

12449115
accessor	properties
every properties you declare for which you don t use synthesize explicitly will have its accessor synthesized automatically as if you wrote

12449115
accessor	properties
that s a new feature of the latest compiler as before you had to write synthesize or implement the accessor for all your properties explicitly

12449115
accessor	properties
simply go to the build settings of your project and turn on the implicit synthesized properties warning under apple llvm compiler 4.0 - warnings - objective-c section and the compiler will tell you about all the properties for which it implicitly synthesize the accessor as you didn t mention the synthesize directive yourself

12449129
viewdidload	viewwillappear
a well you cannot affect the ui til the view shows - so probably viewdidload or viewwillappear

12449141
folder	directory
apparently setting up custom icon on some folder on the repo has the side effect of preventing checkout between branches because windows would keep handle opened on some of the directory that need to be deleted

12449156
google-chrome	firefox
note i have tested in google-chrome and firefox

12449229
width	height
for the camera s height and width i use gdx.graphics.getheight

12449229
width	height
i set the cameras position to the camera s width divided by the two and its height divided by two.

12449229
width	height
when i draw the texture i set it s position to the camera s width and height divided by two -- so it s centered..or so i think

12449246
explode	implode
i highly suggest to use php for this one as you said yourself and explode your data replace what you want and then implode it back and update your record .

12449251

portrait	landscape
since a recoded video s orientation has to be portrait or landscape it ll error out on you

12449297
innodb	myisam
as far as data portability is concerned an innodb database will be completely accepted by myisam because myisam does not check data integrity is there a user number 4 in the user database when i insert a new record in user_car for example

12449297
innodb	myisam
if you start out with myisam exporting to a full-fledged innodb database will be a nightmare even if your data has all keys table data must be imported in the correct order user and car before user_car

12449297
innodb	myisam
never simply because less people use it therefore you will have less support as compared to myisam and innodb

12449333

i am working with an assignment where i have to write a c function that calculates log2 of an unsigned integer n by finding the most significant set bit and returning the position of that bit

12449471
for-loop	loops
you can simplify your while loops by just using a for-loop and a range object

12449471
dictionary	map
to actually make your code spit out the real song with spelled-out numbers use a dictionary to map numbers to words

12449504
strncmp	strcmp
as was stated in previous answers you should use the strcmp or strncmp functions from the string.h library to compare strings

12449506
folder	directory
ensure that existing folder in the root directory work

12449567
uitableview	nsindexpath

i need this so if someone has used my free app for a few weeks and saved a lot of data they can upgrade to the full versioning and their data will be preserved

12449618
nswindow	nsstatusitem
assuming that you know how to display your ui in a nswindow and separately in a nsstatusitem then you can switch from one ui to the other by

12449618
nswindow	nsstatusitem
hiding the nswindow and showing the nsstatusitem

12449618
nswindow	nsstatusitem
hiding the nsstatusitem and showing the nswindow

12449621
hide	show
i would like to show the header in the top of my page and hide it when scrolled like this site

12449648

so basically i think i need to write a condition that looks for the folder people and removes the third directory from the url

12449657
google-chrome	safari
now i added it in the body and works well in google-chrome and safari but not in the others

12449695
factors	matrix
for some matrix i can avoid this by using cholesky factorization instead which factors to c hh which at least for this is mostly okay but this requires a matrix that s positive definite

12449714
hide	show
i can hide show it on checkbox selection

12449753
width	height
i also gave the width and height 200 but you can make it dinamic something like

12449758
button	checkbox
i ve made dynamic forms that can update an entire list of options with a single submit button using the technique but for some reason i am having issues achieving the same thing with checkbox inputs

12449769
xuggle	vlcj
i have worked with this issue for several days and researched using the following existing frameworks jmf fmj vlcj xuggle jmyron javafx javacv

for-loop	while-loop	for-loop	loops	loops	while-loop
- its always better to use for-loop when you know the exact nos of time you gonna loops and if you are not sure of it go for while-loop

12449930
google-chrome	firefox
this happens under mac lion with both google-chrome and firefox

12449954
dictionary	map
if say you cache the result of each factorial call in a dictionary a map from n - factorial n you will get an algorithmic complexity which is equal to the iterative one but

12449962
getter	setter
if you go down this path you can simply add any getter setter or other method to your application extension to store retrieve data and do operations on it

12450002
getter	setter
hibernate will access the field directly and not use the getter or setter

12450002
getter	setter
if there annotations are on a getter then only the getter are considered for persistence and the state is accessed via the getter setter

12450014
textview	imageview
alright what i m trying to do is setting an imageview to be on the right and the 3 textview will be located on the left relative to the image

12450014
textview	imageview
with the following xml code the imageview is on the left and the 3 textview are located in the right of the imageview

12450035
int	chars
the int representation of a chars need not be the base 10 representation of the chars that you see in your string and typically isn t

12450035
int	chars
you need to explicitly convert the chars to an int value

12450035
int	chars
one trick is to subtract the integral value of 0 from a chars that represents a number to get an int conversion 5 - 0 yields 5

12450035
int	chars
presumably you don t want to include that value in your sum but if you do as you see it won t influence the sum as the null chars also has an int value of zero

12450040
hide	show
then simply show it whenever you hide the header

12450061
rss	feed
and some suggested using twitter4j and others uses public rss feed

12450098
fish	bash
bash fish command to print absolute path to a file

12450175

i have to make a program that takes two input int and squares the smaller one and double the larger one and keeps the int the same if the two inputs are the same

12450239
inherited	properties
if you force dependency properties all viewmodels need to inherited from dependencyobject

12450262
dictionary	map
since the user input has to be digits you need to create a dictionary to map the digits to numbers in words 1 becomes one

12450266
jar	war
in jboss as 7 applications that are packaged as top-level archives such as war jar and sar are assigned the following module name

12450313
g++	gcc
first of all you should use gcc instead of g++ to produce the exe file

12450360
daemons	systemd
systemd daemons all permissions possible which includes read write and execute to given file or directory

12450387
public	protected

12450613
put	get
ideally i would like to put the output in a matrix as follows once i get the counts

12450829
iprincipal	iidentity
the alternative is to completely throw away membership and create your own iprincipal and iidentity implementations and simply write your own user management i would still use the sqlmanagementprovider source as a basis for this however as it s a good implementation

12450829
iprincipal	iidentity
if you can t accept a dt then either change your workflows change your code to work with a try-catch-finally statement though this won t guarantee rollback in case the app code dies suddenly like a power outage or use a custom iprincipal and iidentity implementation

12450880
children	parent
tree structures with multiple children are easy enough oct-tree quad-tree binary tree etc. but coming up with an elegant system where whenever a parent spawns multiple children the children are also implicitly linked to only specific siblings was a mind-twister for me

i m had the same problem as well and i thought i had a valid reason to delete the class attribute in the subclassing my superclass call it a had a read-only property that provided the value of the attribute but in my subclassing call it b the attribute was a read write instance variable

12451269

since python has duck typing it does not really matter that b does not extends a i can still use them in the same places since they implicitly implements the same interface

12451276
post	get
if you want to default the checkbox to ticked then you can use to detect a get or a post

12451276

12451294
folder	dir
just tested this in eclipse debugger and the commandline arguments are correctly placed in args you may check if the file you test with are in your project folder or actual dir . because if not it will otherwise prompt for new files anyway

12451301
int	chars
if you require the behaviour that you expected on x86 you ll have to explicitly build the int from chars ie assuming little-endian

12451305

12451633
sorting	grouping
i ve tested it on a sample collection based on your schema and it works for me sorting the grouping post codes by number of students descending

12451641
width	height
each big image has to have the css height set to auto and the width set to 100 because i am making a responsive fluid layout

12451641
width	height
but height auto and width 100 are set in this example to 600ms after the attributes do their replacing

12451641
width	height
this doesn t work because i am using isotope jquery plugin for this and this plugin needs the real width and height of the element to position the grid properly

12451641
width	height
when height auto and width 100 are set during the loading of an image the plugin gets lost and makes positions the elements incorrectly

12451647
jtextfield	jlabel
i have several jpanel s with which contain jlabel s and jtextfield s for user input in my swing application

if you re interested in the subject take a look at scheme and especially the racket programming language

12451815
udp	tcp
however you should be aware that reliable udp will generally perform much worse than plain old tcp

12451815
udp	tcp
if you implement reliability on top of udp by necessity you will need to implement something functionally equivalent to tcp and then several factors will penalize you

12451815
udp	tcp
what can make udp faster in some circumstances is discarding much of the work that tcp does by being unreliable

12451815
udp	tcp
so many games send movement data over one unreliable udp channel then all control messages over a more reliable tcp channel

12451866

profiling	instrumentation
if you re profiling an ios app use the opengl es analysis instrumentation template and the opengl es performance detective tool

12452415
imperative	declarative
a declarative language requires you to code for what you want to happen rather than in an imperative language where you code how the computation should be done

12452415
imperative	declarative
in general this means that a declarative language does not allow for side-effects whereas imperative languages almost require coding with side-effects

12452415
imperative	declarative
this makes f# a general purpose language but does so by allowing imperative style coding to be mixed in with declarative coding

12452417
folder	directory
in my cases folder i created a test suite file that uses the recursive directory lookup

folder	directory
i am trying to write a small application whose only purpose is to copy some folder and .cs source files into a user specified directory i can do it easy enough by simply having the application look for the files and folder in its own install directory then copy them to thier destination directory but i was wondering if its possible to embed the folder and files into the application so that when you run the application it creates or copies the folder and files from the exe app directly to the install directory rather than searching for them in the apps install directory then copying them over

12455600
getter	setter
with getter and setter you can ensure the types are correct and provided you only use those it will work as expected

12455607

when i compile and run this under solaris 10 sunos 5.10 it doesn t stop

12455849
getter	setter
i see this as a bad pattern i don t see why someone should be able to set a value and then not be able to read it again and i believe a setter should always be accompanied with a getter but not necessarily the other way around

maven	pom.xml
i am new to spring development and i tried to add maven dependency for spring orm in the pom.xml file it gives the following exception when the server starts

note that in that model scheme i use the typeid properties both as a condition of my inherited and as a properties for domainentity

12456145
inherited	properties
lets say i will not use typeid as a properties and keep it as a condition for the inherited association that will result in the following when i ll try to populate a tree of my domain entities

12456145
inherited	properties
if i use inheritances and typeid as a condition for each inherited i can not access it as a properties of domainentity that will require me to use switch-case against typof entity to determine what type i should send to my jstree plugin because he expects a type identification for each node in his json if i will not use inherited i will loose the polymorphic capabilities

12456145
inherited	properties
there will be other methods and properties relevant only for the inherited entities and i can see some injections points in the future.

12456146
onchange	onkeyup
you need to use onkeyup rather than onchange if you wish to run a function every time a key is pressed

implements	extends
every interface that either extends or implements this interface doesn t see much difference between the methods that are explicitly declared by this interface or it got implicitly

12456319
listview	gridview
the activities are all gridview or listview of bitmaps and clicking on an image takes you to another activity that contains another set of images sort of like an album of albums of albums of albums

after doing a stack dump with ddms it appears that the gridview and listview of the previous activities are hogging all the memory

margin	text-align
i need to move small lol to the left with margin but the problem is that on the whole page is setup text-align center and i cant remove it

min	max
as stl internally uses red black tree for implementing map and min max heap for priority queue this approach seems pretty fast to me

12456515
boost	stl
i am developing this using c++ so solutions using stl or boost would be even better

12456595
post	get
you can also get comments on your post page with this snippet

12456738
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
google-chrome and firefox render it fine i face this problem in safari and opera please see the image below

12456738
opera	safari	children	parent
besides that overflow property does not work as expected as children elements overlap the parent div again relevant only in safari and opera

12456788

i have put the war file in the webapps folder then when i click in the start button i get the error fail - application at context path black.artesppap could not be started

12457277
serializable	deserialization
my only guess would be that i am sending a number of serializable data packs through the stream each encapsulated by some serializable headers and that therefore the deserialization process in the web service only finds and decapsulates the first one but that s just an idea and i am not sure how to do it differently

12457287
queue	fifo
using a serial queue guarantees you that all blocks will be executed in fifo order

12457322
width	height
for example you pass the top and left of image and you already know the width and height of div so if the left is -375px you know that you should crop the image from 375px to 375px + div s width and same goes for top

12457349
onfocus	onblur
onfocusin and onfocusout are required for ie 9 and lower while all others make use of onfocus and onblur

if you have a value in nsdata object then you can convert it in nsstring variable like bellow

12457378

this works perfect in google-chrome but not in firefox or ie

12457528
rss	feed
i have previsously parsed this rss feed now that i have updated it to use a asynctask it now displays a blank screen instead of a filled listview

12457547
children	parent
the parent #mainholder div is not increasing its width when child elements are added â as a result the children breaks the parent div

12457562
range	max
its also a good idea to specify a range via min-width and max width because there is a possibility that if you dont the test conditions will load multiple javascript files

12457569
hide	show
i have my existing code here which works to a certain extent in that it hide show the video

12457604
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox the property doesn t affect the children but on google-chrome the children are misaligned

12457648
int	chars
so when php cast a string to int usually return 0 unless the first chars of the string it s a number

12457653

but that works if you want to increase width not height

12457672
super	self
so super b self .__init__ calls c.__init__ self

12457862
try-catch	exception-handling
and i added try-catch around loop body to handle exception-handling manually

12457909
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
examples of common file handlers are fileoutputstream and fileinputstream

12457910
filesystems	ntfs
although cygwin supports the unix permission bits on an ntfs filesystems native windows programs like my eclipse don t know about them so that all files created by windows programs have the executable bit set 755

12457914
folder	directory
make sure your source directory for example myproject src is listed as a source folder

12457922

12458000
width	height
to get the correct height for a 16 9 video you just divide the width by 16 then multiply it by 9

12458026
udp	tcp
unfortunately though like windows 7 8 phone winrt does not support normal berkeley socket access but instead offers its own version of socket programming with discrete classes for different socket scenarios streamsocket for a connecting tcp client streamsocketlistener for a bindable tcp server and datagramsocket datagramsocketlistener for the udp versions

12458032
width	height
after doing this i found out that properties of progressbar control alertdialog tabhost have changed like background color height width etc

12458068

12458341
google-chrome	firefox
i can see this behavior on firefox but not in google-chrome when i expand my listbox but when i select my choose one my field doesn t have the italic style

udp	tcp
tcp is a stream protocol unlike udp which is packet oriented which means that the receiving application can t tell if the available data comes from one or several send calls on the client

12458395
cil	ildasm
using ildasm to disassemble the code i can confirm that cil for the three methods differs the code for conditional method being somewhat shorter

12458449

the filesystems is fat the sd card should stay be readable by windows systems

12458548

12458633
google-chrome	safari
sadly the desktop browsers like ie safari google-chrome etc

12458633
width	height
width of the page is 1026px and height is 680px

12458669
client-side	server-side
so you have to implement either the client-side or the server-side auth flow in your app

12458705
x86	64bit
i have found few remarks on the fact that this library cannot be used natively on 64bit machine and that it and all apps using it should be compiled targeting x86 platform

12458705
mef	prism
my even the simplest sample application that uses prism with unity mef always crashes with exception that an attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format exception from hresult 0x8007000b

12458719
integer	fractions
exponent is a standard integer but mantissa a value between 1 and 2 is a number of bits where each bit represents a fractions 1 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 16 and so on.

12458719
int	double
so the actual value of the double is not 33.30 its 33.2999999999999971578290569595992565155029296875 which of course rounds down to 33.29 when you do the type cast to int

12458719
int	double
sadly printf works by conversions to int inside it and will not properly print any double precision floats that have more than 6 decimal places which is why you see it as 33.30 even through you are asking printf to print the value of a double

12458732
implements	extends	comparator	comparable
if possible you can extends the class and write a new class which implements comparable so that you can implements comparator

12458762
getter	setter
in any case i suggest you use getter and setter as there is no overhead caused by them what so ever

12458768
filesystems	fat
the corruption probably happens because the os didn t complete its write operations on the fat filesystems

12458768
filesystems	ntfs
however you are having this kind of problems because you are not using a journaled filesystems such as ext3 or ntfs

12458777
hide	show
i am using jquery to hide and show the buttons add edit delete which is not secure

12458797
firefox	safari

opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
which works just fine in opera google-chrome and ie - but firefox and safari are having problems with calling the function checkdomain

12458824
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
so google-chrome opera ie calls the function with no problem after you enter text and click somewhere else - but firefox safari doesn t

12458842
opera	google-chrome
italic is not apply in google-chrome and opera

12458856
put	get
now if i put the createdby as hidden then i can get value of createdby in action

12458867
typedef	struct
the tag name space the name after the struct and the identifier name space the one you declare with typedef eg. are distinct in c

12458867
typedef	struct
the easiest i find is to always forward declare the struct tag and the typedef in one go

12458867
typedef	struct
from then on you could easily use the typedef name even inside the declaration of the struct

12458894
equals	tostring
the equals and tostring methods in each of the ai extending a and in the t class are overridden similarly and appear to behave as expected

12459033
for-loop	loops
it is not possible with a for-loop but if your actions in loops are similar in the two cases i would do this by cursors

12459041

udp	tcp
units using different format of data or non-standard transmission protocol for sending it for example cheaper units are unable to use udp protocol and are transmiting data through tcp protocol using packets that not always follows standards or definictions

12467413
udp	tcp
in general any tk102 related devices is opening a socket for a direct tcp transmission original one can be switched to use udp protocol

12467413
udp	tcp
many really many cheap clones uses tcp while only original tk102 allows switching to udp

12467413
udp	tcp
this is convenient because you need really basic server configuration to handle tcp connections while you have to use specific server-side software like node.js or specific configuration open to certain ports to handle udp

12467413
udp	tcp
but the key thing is to determine correct protocol as listening to tcp data while your localizer sends udp will most certainly fail

width	height
thankfully i came across a neat little trick of setting the padding-top of the slideshow viewport to a percentage value dynamically calculated desired slideshow height set in the settings panel for this script divided by desired width

12467946
width	height
as padding-top percentages are relative to the width of the element this did a great job of providing responsive height and correcting the viewport again no longer looking collapsed

the language toolkit shouldn t matter but for completeness the language is c++ and the primary toolkit i m using is qt i m actually trying to get a list of strings into a single qstring because it s one of the few qt types that doesn t get pickled in a non-human readable way when it goes into a qdatastream qvariant qsettings.

building on this approach i ve attempted a normalisation modifies the bytes in getaudiosamples to a normalised value considering the max min in the file

12469370

knowing your system s book representation will allow me to make a get call to retrieve one and understand it or make a post or put call to create one

12469447
for-loop	loops
you were getting out of bounds error as your for-loop wasn t looping correctly i have modified it so that loops doesn t go out of bounds and also your secretword variable wasn t populating correctly the code should now work as intended

12469472

the closest i can get is the enforcing of the min and max occurs but the order is enforced

google-chrome	firefox
to check to make sure it shows up correctly do an inspect element in google-chrome or firefox firebug to see if the code is on the page

12469738
width	height
might be just because i am brand new to d3 and svg this month but there is a getbbox method on the text element most elements that will generate an object with the width height x y and it really should be used instead of jquery for all svg dimensions

12469741
folder	directory
vs will by default copy the dll to your application project s output directory so you just need to configure your installer just to include all of the files in your bin folder except maybe xml documentation files

12469752
vim	emacs
you just need to take the beginning ssh-dss or ssh-rsa then your public_key then make ups some label to create a new public key file - use emacs or vim on your computer and save it as id_dsa.pub or id_rsa.pub and upload it to assembla - should work just fine

12469810

udp	tcp
to make matter more confusing on a lower level a single tcp or udp message with tcp ip headers prepended to the data can also be called a packet

12469991
uicontrol	uibutton
i d suggest subclassing from uicontrol instead of uibutton

12469991
uicontrol	uibutton
instead of working around the 1 label and image you get in a uibutton it s cleaner to start from scratch with a uicontrol and create your tiles

12469995
post	get
i got categories and post each category has to have its own unique filters that can be strings or booleans i ll get them via textboxes or checkboxes

you should close the bufferedwriter before closing the filewriter

12470180
width	height
the graph is a custom control of mine that wants to be as big as it can its onmeasure function just returns the provided width and height which i think is where the problem lies

12470268
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	abstract-class	superclass
while it is a debated recommendation to favor composition over inherited my view is to ensure that an abstract-class devoid of abstract methods is not simply a convenient container for methods convenient to subclassing but instead that each subclassing could stand in for its superclass

12470274
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
and the jqxhr in jquery 1.4.x xmlhttprequest object. the actual argument names don t matter it is the order that matters

mdpi	hdpi
if you wanna design for android you have to provide 4 different files of the same asset ldpi mdpi hdpi and xdpi

12470329
integer	unsigned
but a better way might be to change the id filed type to auto increment unsigned integer and then by knowing the last id before the gap equals to gid you can do a query like this

12470329
integer	unsigned
since all the records in your id field have the letter e in common it might be possible to get rid of this letter and change the field type to an auto increment unsigned integer

i have made a cydia tweak which does just this

put	get
as i told it works in some environment with a database but in the other environment doesn t work the trouble was that i had a multiple saving and dependant registers but the first takes some time to get saved so when i saved the second register different tables the second one dependant on the first one the data for the key s wasn t saved already so i couldn t saved in cascade as is usual cuz it would take to change a lot of code as this is not a begin from zero development so what i did was to dig more into the code and get where the data was exactly saved and put there the saving of the other register

12470455
put	get
i just can t figure out how to put together a bit of code that says get all mentions to user

textscan uses spaces and newline as delimiter by default

12470657

opera	google-chrome
while doing so they also want some testing in the real world and feedback from real developers so they encourage web browsers like google-chrome and opera to support stuff that s unfinished - but with a prefix

opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
you see which versions require a prefix like -webkit- -ms- -moz- or -o- for safari google-chrome internet explorer firefox and opera respectively

12475538
opera	firefox
in this case the most recent versions of internet explorer firefox and opera support this css instruction without a prefix which basically means we think we re done discussing this now pretty sure it s going to be like this forever

12475538
opera	firefox
if you feel very thorough and want to support older firefox and opera versions you could also add the -moz- and -o- lines

12476861
move	drag
when i drag the transformer div i trap the drag event figure out the delta_x and delta_y and add these to the existing transform using the jquery css function - so if i drag the transformer 10px to the right i update the tx property of the transforms by +10 to move the wrapper and its swf content

12476861
google-chrome	firefox
this is only in firefox - ie and google-chrome work fine if however i modify my code so that instead of moving the wrapper with a transform i simply update the top and left properties everything works as expected and the stage keeps updating

12476876
post	put
i ll give a link to the whole code i don t want to put it in an edited post since it d create a big mess

but when the buildsrc build.gradle is over it compiled the plugin and it run the gradlew task to generate settings.gradle and gradlew jumps to the main build on the parent dir i found out that the new settings.gradle that it generated is not the one that matters but the one read before the buildsrc

difference being setinterval repeats and settimeout executes once

12477187
pop-up	dialog
you should be able to detect clicking anywhere in the document using - keeping a flag boolean to indicate current pop-up state if necessary - without examining your markup this has worked in the past but might not for your situation structure or you could create an overlay that sits upon all elements of your site barring the dialog which sits atop and then detect clicking of thaty backing element

12477194
x86	64bit
not using the logarithm instruction is easiest to explain the logarithm instruction in x86 is defined to be accurate to 80-bits whereas you are using a double which is only 64bit

12477194
division	multiplication
this is because multiplication and division is faster in sse the 80-bit vs 64-bit issue again and that the sse registers are faster to manipulate in the fpu you can only access the top of the stack and rotating the fpu stack is often the slowest operation on a modern processor in fact some have an extra pipeline stage solely for this purpose

12477208
puts	gets
the requests are gets posts and puts even though i m pretty sure none of the requests are changing state

this is all simple enough you can alter the visibility of a control with the visible property and change the size of your form by altering the height and width properties of the form

12477371
width	height
button2 gets set to invisible as the form loads and the width and height get set to 100px each

12477388
put	get
or if there will be a lot of markup and you want to just get the text you could loop through the li elements and extract just the text and put that in an array

12477407
getter	setter
this way you don t need to worry about specifying individual properties getter setter

12477431
