18240069
put	get
do get the same result with arrayfun we need to dereference the cell within the anonymous function and then extract the character and then put the results into a cell array rather than a character array

18240077
maven	pom.xml
i think you may be confusing the maven pom.xml with the rest api used by nexus

18240083
inherited	properties
if you defined name in response responsembp would inherited the properties and it would be accessible from either class

vpn	lan
neither of the computers are on a domain although the vpn simulates the connection occuring over a lan

18240197
pull	push
from what i can conceive the brokers xpub-xsub sockets will also have push pull sockets to communicate the pub-sub messages

18240228
onbeforeunload	onload
i also tried putting window.close in the onload and window.print in the onbeforeunload but the print dialog cancels the window.close

debug this functionality before working on the wireless ethernet connection

18240399
subnet	packets
if the router is configured with routing rules to route between subnet it will deliver the packets otherwise it will just get dropped

18240399
subnet	packets
if b isn t on that subnet and ignores the arp request a won t send the packets to the router because where it sends the packets is just based on the destination ip address there s no changing of where it s routed based on if the packets got delivered

18240429
google-chrome	safari
the issue seems to be isolated to webkit based browsers like google-chrome and safari

18240430
put	get
all that other service should do is get the data and put it into the database

18240433
folder	directory
the code in new file ... is the same i use to create the directory so i know the path is correct when the application starts it creates the directory with no pictures in the folder until the user takes one

18240449
width	margin
that is nesting one textbox apply the proper width padding margin

18240470

google-chrome	firefox
the focusing works fine on firefox however it doesn t work on google-chrome

18240751
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
one of the requirements of one of my clients is to show a message to a user that s using an older version of firefox google-chrome ie or safari

18240751
google-chrome	firefox
but for firefox and google-chrome the requirement is that the site supports the current and the previous version of each browser

18240759
width	height
for example for an input i would have to account for border shadowing width height etc

18240803
udp	tcp
have your server broadcast udp messages announcing its presence and its ip address have your clients listen for these and establish tcp connections to server

18240803
udp	tcp
keep in mind that udp broadcasts are limited in scope to the subnet so you could not use broadcast-based discovery to discover machines on other lans -- for that you d have to do some kind of central service registry with tcp based registration and a well-known registration server

18240858
google-chrome	safari
i tried to reconstruct the example and it works in the safari and google-chrome browser

18240912

post	get
you can get great sample code and instructions on this blog post

18240941
post	get
if you want to use mailto which just opens the user s email client with fields prefilled you don t use a post form you use a get form

18240956
hide	show
the code 1 when i click on the click here it s supposed to hide the div with id adiv and when i click again its show it again

18240978

18240988
urllib	httplib
i m using selenium webdriver in python to automate the downloading of thousands of files from a certain website that can t be webscraped by conventional means like urllib httplib etc

18241058
textarea	textbox
the jsp shows a textbox to submit the command tx and in the same jsp there is a textarea to show the rx data

18241060
int	double
this doesn t make sense to me since the type of an int + double in haskell is a double so a + b should resolve to a double and since the constructor for a pfloat takes a double no problem.

18241084
terminate	timeout
well allowcorethreadtimeout true shall be used when you want to terminate core pool threads after some specified timeout time

18241108
versioning	upgrade
the issue here is that apple s trying to be a little careful that existing already published apps don t break when users upgrade their operating system so the runtime libraries are checking which versioning of the sdk your app was built with and modifying its behavior based on that information

18241112
post	get
first of all you cannot calculate the total like that it s not javascript you need a form with a get post request which will send a request to the server server will process and throw the calculated value back to the user

18241171
put	get
but if i put it after that line it doesn t get called

18241187
post	put
if you happen to know and like javascript you can skip step 4 and put whatever post processing you have in mind directly into the script in step 2

18241199
int	chars
if the object is a int it is considered as a codepoint and is converted to a chars before concatenation

18241244

18241305
folder	directory
so i have this code and i m only trying to make a list of the saves in another directory where the php scrip is in xampp folder and the saves are to this path root files saves

itâ s not floor that is losing precision but the conversion from int an arbitrary-precision int to double a floating-point value which has a limited precision

qtwidgets	qtgui
that is why you need to change the includes from qtgui to qtwidgets

18241464
screens	tablet
this is the screens of the tablet

18241465
google-chrome	firefox
exception being of course if you need a specific api that s just not available in previous versions of google-chrome firefox but in that case you d look and enforce the api not the browser version

18241465
google-chrome	firefox
adding to that if google-chrome firefox don t have an api chances are even the most bleeding edge version of ie won t either so the point is moot

18241465
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
the fact is firefox and google-chrome and in part safari are far ahead of ie when it comes to browser hosted capabilities that trying to enforce specific versions of the former would likely be a lot of wasted time and effort to yield nothing substantial

18241470
hide	show
either by show hide divs or drawing different buffers graphics to a canvas

18241470

factors	matrix
in reality when you print the matrix m it gets printed with a global scaling factors of 1e8

18241565
cos	sin
for example consider the built in math functions sin cos and tan

18241572
spaces	delimiter
my thought was i could open the file up in binary mode and read it that way and instead of having a tab be my delimiter i could choose any amount of white spaces

18241584
google-chrome	firefox
the following error occurs only in ie8 ...works in google-chrome and firefox can t test ie9 as i have recently downgraded for testing purposes

18241590
children	parent
assuming you want to use a linked binary tree with no pointers to parent nodes then the only solution i can think of is keeping a counter of number of children in each node

18241614
atoi	strlen	strtol	atoi	strtol	strlen
no need to call a strlen -- until you are allowed to use library functions the above-mentioned atoi and strtol you can use this

18241640
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari seems to repeatedly prompt the user

18241641
kerberos	ntlm
i goofed around with the windows authentication provider settings like ntlm negotiate and negotiate kerberos

18241651
stdout	stderr
as an additional stylistic issue warnings and errors should go to stderr not stdout

18241671
folder	directory
if not you will also need to add this assets directory to your classpath right click on the project - properties - java build path - source tab - add folder .

18241687
cos	sin
in this case sin cos and tan are all functions from math so you could do the following

18241706
inherited	properties
the object.create method is a great way to use simple inherited allowing access to the base properties and methods

18241711
pull	push
i m not sure if this is quite what you re looking for but you could use cloud 9 to pull your code and then push it up to whatever repo you want

18241722
foldable	traversable
often foldable traversable monoids monad zippers are more useful

18241724
google-chrome	firefox
this happens for some users in mozilla firefox for others in google-chrome for other in both of them

18241747
versioning	upgrade
the key difference is that my error tells me to downgrade from versioning 0.8 to 0.6cll while the error in the linked post requires an upgrade to resolve the error

18241769
hide	show
my problem is that when i click on the hide show it submits the form and since is empty it redirects me to homepage

18241839
hex	binary
the key is at h 23.4 binary files vim can be your hex editor

18241842
hide	show
the show hide button you are using acts by default as a submit button

18241888
post	get
get and post provided data are always strings but the calendar.weekday function wants you to pass in integer values so here they are parsed into integers with the int function

18241907
children	parent
see here for the question jquery - on page load select optgoup and children in second select by a default selected option in a parent select

18241909
int	chars
apparently an unsigned chars argument passed to printf is not promoted to int or unsigned int as the c standard requires

18241909
int	chars
i infer from this and from the error you ve run into that keil c51 doesn t promote narrow arguments to variadic functions and in particular that an unsigned chars argument is not promoted either to int or to unsigned int

18241941
min	max
just plug in the max min and run the rest of the code

18241966
g++	gcc
btw gcc is a wrapper which invokes a proper compiler cc or g++ and linker

18241969
oncreate	setcontentview
use this code before setcontentview in oncreate method

18241986
for-loop	loops
this leads me to believe my copy+paste part of the code works between the while loops statements but the for-loop fails somehow

18241991
pull	push
from what i can conceive the brokers will also have push pull sockets

18242034
qunit	sinon
i want to write unit tests with qunit and sinon

18242113
versioning	upgrade
the worst part is that this code used to work before i did a system-wide upgrade i don t remember which versioning of mysql i had but surely it was lower than my current 5.6

do i need to upgrade this versioning to use tempfile module

18242344
width	height
what i want to do is set the height of the left nav div to the document height and then when you scroll down exactly 296 pixels the width will grow to 150 pixels

18242344
width	height
so my question is how can i set the height of this div to the document height and then a second step would be to animate the width

18242369
post	put
so to make this as clean as possible for you guys i ve attached a sample of code to this post hoping that someone may put my logic to place and give me a guideline to re-think and think right

google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome cached copies of the page that were reached via the back button would run the .ajax but would use a cached copy of the variable data which would give me an out of date answer

preferably - a cross browser solution that includes ie8+ google-chrome and firefox

the only suggestion that might make that more palatable would be to write an ejb interceptor that behaves similarly to cmt that is inject usertransaction into the interceptor and begin commit rollback in the aroundinvoke

getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
if you are unfamiliar with getter and setter methods also known as mutators and accessor methods i urge you to find and review a tutorial on the subject since they are used a lot in java

18242999
getter	setter
the dynamodb mapper uses reflection to find the getter and setter

hex	binary
may be if you copy binary data into the eeprom from pc listening mplab ipe microchip aplication or similar and later load directly this data in the icsp circuit in the same way it could work but i suspect it is very unlikely on other hand you must load the hex file into the eeprom and implement the icsp protocol according manufacturer especifications into the pic-eeprom it would be probably a huge effort for example for microchip pic24 the intructions for icsp implementation are in section 3.0 datasheet

pull	push
the client library has an acceptmessage method and a getmessage method which basically push messages into or pull messages out of a blockingqueue for input and output respectively in the client this is implemented with put and take calls

18243419
system.in	system.out
one thread blocks on system.in and sends read lines to the client via acceptmessage whilst the other blocks on the client getmessage method and echoes messages to system.out when they arrive

18243419
system.in	system.out
the idea is for the text input box to take the place of reading from system.in and the label to display what would have otherwise been written to system.out

bower	npm
checking in front-end dependencies for bower but applies to npm too

18248309
width	height
and it resizes the window just fine - but it scales the content based on the height of the window rather than the width of the window

18248309
width	height
for the site i m building it is much more important that the visible width of the content is maintained than the height but cannot figure out a way to reverse the code to scale based on the width instead of the height

18248319

integer	unsigned
this in se wouldn t have been an error if unsigned meaning was non-negative integer a size cannot logically be negative but it s a problem with the conversion rules of the language

18248537
integer	unsigned

children	parent
now if you use percentage-based units for your children s height the children s height will be calculated based on the height of its parent

18254957
children	parent
the line p.parentid c.parentid is doing the join and the line count p.parentid is doing the count of all the parent and the line group by p.parentname is grouping all the rows by the name of the parent so you can display all the children of every single parent

i have multiple lat long in an arrays in php but a code available to display lat long is to display single lat long i tried to iterate the arrays in for-loop but it didn t work shown below

18258756

imagej will give you an option to specify width height and bit-depth

18258951
dictionary	map
unless you re writing your own dictionary map class

18258973
getter	setter
you generally want your getter and setter to reflect the fields you have declared

18258973
getter	setter
you would use a getter setter that takes an int index parameter when your field is an array type which conforms to the javabeans spec section 8.3.3

18258973
getter	setter
first on a conceptual level if your fields are significantly different from your getter setter while there are tons of valid reasons for this you may want to take a look at how you ve organized your fields to see if you can refactor to something that more accurately represents the purpose of your object it is assumed that public getter setter are good representations of this purpose

18258973
getter	setter
secondly and this is more just about being aware of what you are doing your getter and setter will affect interaction with apis that operate on beans and will also affect interaction with apis that use reflection

18258973
getter	setter
for example hibernate can be configured to persist objects to a database using getter setter properties or direct field access

18258973
getter	setter
so depending on the configuration there you have to at least be aware of your getter setter vs

it s inherent to the logic of a square that its width will always equal its height

18262683
for-loop	arrays
so using your example of 1 2 3 4 5 with n 5 the snap shots of the arrays after the inner for-loop is executed are 51234 54123 54312 54321 at which point i 4 so the for-loop test fails and your arrays is sorted

with a rectangle the client of the class expects that the height and width are independently settable

18262759
width	height
a client setting a width of 5 and a height of 10 whilst reference an object that happens to be a square but is held in a rectangle variable will get different results according to the order in which they set the height and width properties

18263044
cpu	affinity
on linux taskset sets the cpu affinity of the subprocess

18263044
cpu	affinity
besides it seems the only way to know about the forced cpu affinity with taskset would be to get the cpu affinity

18263044
cpu	affinity
it seems that function erts_get_available_cpu which queries the os for cpu affinity is not even called

18263049
jobs	cron
cron jobs don t really cut it for me as i need precision at the level of seconds

18263050
folder	directory
another possibility is that stata always looks in the current directory or folder for a user-written program before it looks in plus unless you mess with that order which i advise against

18263081

i would use a similar method to the others but i wouldn t rely on setinterval settimeout as a timer especially if users might be looking at the page for some time as it tends to be inaccurate

for-loop	loops
right now you do a for-loop for your operation then get the character the user types every loops iteration then just start a while loops that never terminates

18263165
uilabel	uibutton
why not just subclass uibutton and then within that subclass make the same changes you made in your uilabel subclass to the button s label property

18263379
integer	unsigned
to make it clearer unordered_set receives a template argument hash which is a functor that takes an argument of type key and return a 32 bit unsigned integer

18263379
integer	unsigned
i need something similar only it should take a template argument hash which is a functor that takes an argument of type key and return a 64 bit unsigned integer

18263416
google-chrome	safari
basically the dropdown is not aligned with the element on google-chrome and safari both tested only a mac

18263877

as was suggested by one of the contributors the parent required another class to set it apart from the children menu items for this to work

18274350
children	parent
it definitely is straightforward once you identify the parent state with a unique rule when one of its children menu items is active

18274363

i have an established wordpress with a members section and forum the whole site is being redeveloped but with joomla 3.0 a lot of the content will have to be just copied and pasted into the new site but the owner of the site wants to keep the old wordpress site up for a while and possible blend it into the newer joomla site with css and styling

quick fix is to set height of linearlayout to fixed size e.g 25dp and then set height of textview to 22dp and height of imageview to 3dp

18274654
textview	imageview
or as per code below simply remove imageview and set background of linearlayout to green with 25dp and textview height to 22dp

children	parent
i have an odd situation where i have an html table with hierarchical data and i need to provide the ability to sort the data but only the parent rows not the children

18274826
children	parent
in fact the children should stay attached to the parent so wherever the parent gets sorted the children should follow along but they don t have to be sorted internally

a rss feed page will open on selecting a specific genre which consist of news related to the the genre

18274880
innodb	myisam
and even if it does not fail multiple queries might still be faster depending on the underlying storage engine as well as how many threads try to access the data at once lock granularity - this only applies with mixing in update queries though - neither myisam nor innodb lock the whole table for select queries by default

18274893
int	chars

if this involved laravel wordpress codeigniter or any other framework that s using a front controller to make urls more readable i d add a .htaccess in that directory to rewrite all non-existing paths to index.php

18275067
openmpi	mpich
i think the best thing to do at this point is to uninstall both openmpi and mpich and go to whichever package manager you re using and reinstall

18275067
openmpi	mpich
there s lots of customization options for both mpich and openmpi that you can read about if you do a . configure --help and go through the readme but none of that is usually required unless you have a special system

18275084
google-chrome	safari
for webkit supported browsers google-chrome safari something like

18275084

my method returns a byte with a md5 hash in it

18275219
postgresql	mysql
with this idea you can change the lookup type to mysql postgresql to query the db but you will need transports defined in your master.cf

18275237

i m trying to create a site that will allow me to use the new contenteditable function in html5 it all works perfectly however if i put the jquery file in a folder structure js js.js and have my php save.php one directory back this does not work

i ve seen the issues on temp and logs and they are both . logs or . tmp

18275591
cfstring	nsstring
cfstring is â œtoll-free bridgedâ with its cocoa foundation counterpart nsstring

18275610

if you want the real raw message then either implement a custom message encoder to get it from there or read here about wcf logging and instead of system.diagnostics.xmlwritertracelistener put your own class that implements the interface

18275615
border-color	background-color
but the browser only allows to change color border-color background-color of visited property and jquery cannot filter select the visited property

18275620
emacs	aquamacs
in order to get all of this to run correctly and allow me to run the scripts from within emacs as well with all the imported modules i had to switch to aquamacs from my normal emacs editor in order for the correct path to be used from within the emacs environment or i could have just run emacs from the terminal with application emacs.app contents macos emacs

18275665
keydown	keyup
i tried keydown keyup focus but still doesn t work

18275674

i have a password dialog and want to have the asterisk over the letter in pyqt in qlineedit

18275804
pseudo-class	visited
you may not be able to directly select the visited pseudo-class but you should be able to check whether an attribute set by that pseudo-class exists providing the visited has at least one difference

18275804
pseudo-class	visited
say for example the visited pseudo-class sets the background to red you should be able to check for that like so

18275836

this works fine in firefox safari and ie.

18275841
button	checkbox

18275878
checkstyle	jacoco
all of them have a build.gradle file which right now contains the following lines specially for pmd checkstyle findbugs and jacoco code coverage for unit tests

18275878
checkstyle	jacoco
when i run gradle clean build project is compiled successfully and shows me the code coverage reports jacoco and findbugs checkstyle pmd reports

18275878
checkstyle	jacoco
the following code is only an addition to get pmd findbugs checkstyle and jacoco features to work

18275878
build.gradle	gradlew
any files which are present inside init.d folder are read first by gradlew so now we dont have to put the above code in every project s individual build.gradle file

18275878
build.gradle	gradlew
when i m trying this approach on my local windows machine where gradlew is stored at c gradle-1.6 i added the code in a file extra1.common-thids.gradle and i removed the same from project s build.gradle

18275878
checkstyle	jacoco
why we selected to do this so that when a developer wants to run gradle build clean he won t be able to see pmd checkstyle findbugs jacoco funcationalities in his local build as we ll tell him not to put the above code in his gradle s init.d common file but when we ll run the same builds from jenkins scm cm team then jenkins server s gradle-x.x init.d xxx.common-xxx.gradle build file will contain the above code and jenkins will show all features at that time

18275878
checkstyle	jacoco
this will help developers to get quick builds at their local machines and jenkins will show them what they want from pmd findbugs checkstyle jacoco side

18275888
getter	setter
so for debugging purposes i implemented a getter and a setter for this property

18275896
javassist	cglib
if you need to compose a real java java.lang.class javassist my preferred choice i used to resolve a solution similar to your question or asm or cglib are the best choiches

18275912
ienumerable	iqueryable	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	iqueryable
however if all repositories use the same underlying context through di then you should be able to join them using either query or lambda syntax as long as you are exposing the objects from your repository as iqueryable rather than ienumerable ilist etc

18275973
put	get
but i could get small includes to work if i put them within the body of the html

18275975
mvp	presenter
the mgm pattern is a bit like mvp passive view except that you have a separate mediator for each control rather than one presenter per form

18276005
button	checkbox
and if you can add a type field in the foreach question you can use ng-switch to display either checkbox or radio button so you can merge the 2 repeaters

18276023
onresume	onpause
this way you will know when is onresume onpause called etc and you will know where to put the code

18276037
unsigned	short

18276147
uicontrol	uiresponder
uicontrol uiview uiresponder nsobject

18276203
uiview	subviews
instead i turned my child view controllers into subclasses of uiview added a uitableview to that then added the uiview to the parent s scroll view as a subviews

18276243
superclass	subclassing
either you use an interface for some subclassing or you may really make the superclass abstract to force every child to instantiate it making the superclass not really instantiatable

18276330
inherited	properties
floating automatically makes the elements block-level so text-align will not apply to them rather their children if any will inherited the properties

18276501
post	get
you need to render something if the request is get instead of post ie

18276523
post	put
in asp.net click event handlers happen after the page_load event happens so if you do not put a condition on when you bind then every post back would wipe out the data before your event handler had a chance to find out what the user selected

18276527
integer	unsigned
except for one thing they only handle unsigned integer 2 bytes or 4 byte

18276528

18276530
flask	django
i m creating a little web app in flask using django and jinja2

18276556
ssd	sata
the only difference i can think of is that the dev server is running on an ssd while the production server is running two regular sata drives in raid 0

18276593
integer	unsigned
if the destination type is unsigned the resulting value is the least unsigned integer congruent to the source integer modulo 2n where n is the number of bits used to represent the unsigned type

18276600
implements	extends
when you click on hyperlink you don t supply the request url with parameters username and password the parameters aren t set by the params interceptor so the values of this properties are null but the validate method is called before the action is executed because your action extends actionsupport which implements validateable and validationaware that allows the validation interceptor which is a part of the defaultstack execute validate method where you could perform manual checks and provide actionerrors fielderrors and actionmessages

18276603
addclass	removeclass
also you could switch out your two calls to toggleclass by just calling removeclass on your .active items and addclass on the clicked item

18276636
implements	extends
as my contentmanagercontroller extends abstractrestfulcontroller it naturally has no index action implements

18276654
free	malloc
any crash inside malloc or free is a sure sign of previous heap corruption

18276657

18277071
post	put
it seems they both have to do with an error in method between put and post

18277076
postfix	dovecot
there are a number of ways to get the information you need based on just knowing you need postfix and dovecot

18277076
postfix	dovecot
you could also try searching google for how to setup postfix and dovecot on debian

18277076
postfix	dovecot
you could also reference the postfix and dovecot documentation as they also provide information on not only how to configure the respective pieces of software but also tutorials and examples of configuration

18277094
button	checkbox
when the webview content becomes very long that i need to scroll several times to reach the button the checkbox can t be displayed even when scrolling to button of the webview

18277118
width	height
onto a screen of height and width

18277129

18277421
try-catch	exception-handling
when i tried putting the sort in a try-catch block ie just didn t read any of the nodes they all threw an exception-handling

18277421
google-chrome	firefox
again google-chrome and firefox worked with the try-catch block

18277428
jar	manifest.mf
in my case it was because intellij was extracting all the dependencies into the output jar which ended up overwritting the meta-inf manifest.mf file with something from one of my dependencies

18277428
jar	manifest.mf
i had to open up the jar and copy in the real manifest.mf from the location indicated in the manifest file property that is automatically set in that artifacts page under project structure

18277476
client-side	server-side
therefore i set up a spring mvc rest api with jacksonmapper on the server-side and jsonp requests with jquery.ajax on the client-side which works fine

phonegap apps can get all of their content from the local device which means that if you store the assets within the application the traditional way in phonegap is to put pages images etc

18277582
opengl-es	glreadpixels
a better design would be to display the opengl-es rendering directly to the dss and avoid using glreadpixels and the fbo completely

18277642
folder	directory
it is my understanding that this code is using the symbol to say every file in this folder then piping all of the output to the target directory

18277667
submit	submission
you could make it so that the form could submit to your site which makes the submission to the other sites or you could make some ajax calls to the other sites from your form s onsubmit event

the prescheme compiler makes use of type inference partial evaluation and scheme and lisp compiler technology to compile the problematic features of scheme such as closures into c code without significant run-time overhead

18277961

you can specify the size in dp not inch for both width and height

18277962
min	max	ssl	https
the profiles will include basic things like host port and login info but also more complex things like whether to use tcp http ssl https which will determine which client type to use and timeouts and pool min max etc which will need default values

18278691

this means that it converts an integral type int and int to any numeric type b of which double is an instance

18281035

18281525
uilabel	uitextview
so i have some uilabel and uitextview in a cell

18281551
post	get
if we could get what we wanted with simple get post requests there would be no need for domains to write web apis

18281556
post	get
you can make get or post requests to node.js in fact your browser sends a get request in order to retrieve any html whatsoever.

18281629
uilabel	uitextview
you could replace it with a uitextview when the user needs to edit a field but using uilabel while scrolling should improve the speed considerably

18281649
width	height
to get the height and width of the primary screen you can use systemparameters.primaryscreenwidth and systemparameters.primaryscreenheight which are in the presentationframework library

18281659
google-chrome	firefox
once removed images started to be accessible within the canvas in firefox and google-chrome at least did not test ie yet

18281666
opera	firefox
transform property is supported in internet explorer 10 firefox and opera

18281719
put	get
when i am executing it i only get either pno or rno case statements result set.my expected out put should return all the case statements

18281747
width	margin
i want to transition the width and the left margin translatex a box so that it appears so grow from it s center

18281762
ready	each
one piece of advice instead of thinking in terms of data being returned from functions think in terms of functions that are executed each time some piece of data is ready

18281784
post	put
i pretty sure its because of the post in my link_to but i dont know what i would put there to make it go to the right place

18281784
post	get
so i tried replacing post with user_post_path post but then i get

18281789
udp	tcp
this computer doesn t need to use normal internet- it could be a proprietary network connection between two computers for tcp and udp

18281832
switching	screens
addition when the tabs referenced by name are deleted they are taken off of the screens whereas the tabs reference by header are not until you manually switching tabs

18281922
put	get
the file crruntime_32bit_13_0_1.msi i downloaded it but not matter where i put it in the setup project i still get the same error

18281924
int	double
i have a vector of objects from a class i ve created and each object contains 4 variables two double an int and a bool

18281924
int	double
the int is being used as an id number so i can keep track of which object is which within the vector while member functions of another class i ve created perform calculations on the double and manipulate the bool true and false

18281924
int	double
after random_shuffle operates the two double and bool return values properly i think but the id number int is returned as gibberish -858993460 for every id number except for the object with the first id number

18281950
google-chrome	safari
i have been having some problems with ios both safari and google-chrome for ios

18281965
imperative	declarative
another benefit of going the subclassing way is that it allows you to keep your code declarative instead of imperative

18281965
imperative	declarative
declarative vs imperative

18282001
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
on google-chrome for mac but not on safari or firefox i ve found that after a load error when i request a different image google-chrome will report that the load is complete before it has actually completed

18282001
width	height
you can also see that sometimes the image width and height are reported as zero

18282001
src	attr
after lots of banging my head on the wall i found that when the load error occurs i have to use attr src catch the error that results from doing so and only then attempt to load the fallback image

18282027
google-chrome	firefox
i am testing in firefox and google-chrome

18282031
width	height
after wanting to know this a few times a soultion i came up with is pre-calculating the height and width the characters by having them rendered cache this and produce a lookup function

18282042
folder	directory
in raspian i can make virtual envs in my home directory but when i try to make a virtual env in a folder on my thumb drive it says the os prevents it operation not permitted

18282047
wadl	wsdl
paste the url in the initial wsdl wadl field

18282073
google-chrome	safari
google page speed insights google-chrome 19.0.1084.36 safari 536.8â

18282080
for-loop	arrays
the reason for the arrays is that currently the values are being written to log.txt file when the submit button is pressed and will eventually be sent across to a python script so it makes it easier to send a large set of values using a basic for-loop

18282137
multiplying	transpose
you can use row-major storage c-style with cublas without transpose at least for these operations matrix-matrix multiplying without packed storage by following the advice given here

18282148
nonetype	iterable
i m positive that my logic is correct i just cannot get why am i getting typeerror nonetype object is not iterable

18282181
min	max
i want to find the count max min of the functions 2nd col elapsed time 3rd col in each hour first col

18282185
pull	push
this way you can setup a git server on your source machine and you can perform all the operations git commit pull push etc from your target machine

18282189
fileoutputstream	printwriter
personally if i were going to write a file this way i would use printwriter instead of a fileoutputstream only because it would make the code a little cleaner

18282205
google-chrome	safari
edit additional info from comments to be clear the partial view isn t being rendered at all on ipad but it is on desktop safari and in google-chrome for that matter

18282205
google-chrome	safari
in all of these cases it works on desktop safari and google-chrome but not on ipad

18282213
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have a uiviewcontroller that has been pushed on to a uinavigationcontroller stack

18282213
button	checkbox
while in edit mode i allow the user to multi select cells with checkbox that appear and uitoolbar has delete button

18282220
min	max
first observe that if x and y are your desired max and min locations respectively then there can not be any and and similarly no and

18282221
children	parent
given the quirkiness of os z-order handling you might need want to call toback on the child window first as well as calling requestfocus on the parent window or one of its focusable children afterward

18282242
button	checkbox
this modal popup window contains a checkbox that must be checked before the ok button of the modal can be clicked

18282248
getter	setter
intellij idea has no way to customize getter setter templates vote for this request

18282280
min	max
you can then extract the min max values

18282280
min	max
or you could keep the current min max values and test against these for each new value

18282358
equals	compareto
ideally i would like to have a comparator that can be used by a treeset thus compareto should only return a 0 if the persons are really not equals

18282395
put	get	puts	gets
gets and puts of individual entities are always strongly consistent once a put of this entry completes no later get will ever return a version earlier than the completed put

18282395
put	get	puts	gets
gets and puts of multiple entities are strongly consistent if they belong to the same ancestor group and are performed in a transaction if i have two entities that are both being modified in a transaction by a put and simultaneously read in a different transaction with a get the get will either return the old version of both entries or the new version of both entries depending on whether the put -transaction has completed at the time of the get or not but it will never return the old value of one entity and the new value of the other

18282395
filtering	grouping
queries with an ancestor filtering can be chosen to be strongly or eventually consistent where a strongly consistent query takes longer to complete but will always return the same version old or new of all entities updated in the same transaction in this ancestor grouping and never some old and some new versions

18282400
google-chrome	firefox
this doesn t happen in firefox and google-chrome

18282410
google-chrome	safari
the links work just fine in google-chrome but aren t playing nice in safari

18282414
int	chars
for loading just chars representation of unsigned int values there shouldn t be any problem with translation

18282423
cpu	processors
i assume that while the cpu is waiting for data it can execute other code especially considering most modern processors are out-of-order so in the end worst case scenario you will waste the same time on fetching the data but having all the data will allow for the code fragment to be executed much faster and therefore stall the processors for a shorter amount of time

18282425
children	parent
some minor changes to the css as you can see in the fiddle like height 100 and top 0 for the contained columns since the parent top is considered 0 for the children

18282438
min	max
these lines would receive a dummy storeid -9999 one with a min dateid - 1 and another one with a max dateid + 1

18282461
mp3	ogg
you can use it to providing the source in multiple formats. some browsers don t support mp3 - firefox doesn t support mp3 and you should provide ogg file

18282483
folder	directory
so now i have my php files the composer.json file the sdk_config file and the vendor folder which contains the composer files and the paypal sdk files all in one directory

18282567
width	height
as of right now when using the fade slider the image height is fine at width and height on my screen but when scaling down into smaller screens the defined height obviously becomes problematic as i have left right arrow navigation over my images and paragraph text below

18282574
ubuntu	linux
i m running linux ubuntu and apache

18282595
udp	tcp
messaging accelerator which includes enhanced tcp and udp

18282595
udp	tcp
udp latency under 1.4 microseconds and tcp socket latency under 1.7

18282662
width	height
looking at your layout i think you want to specify fixed width and flexible height or the auto layout equivalent

18282699
google-chrome	firefox
i am able to accomplish everything with this but on firefox on a mac the fadein is faster than it is on google-chrome

18282701
hide	show
what i do is from my menu click event i show a form then immediately hide the form

18282751
subtract	add
for the end date you could add 1 month to the first of the month s date then subtract 3 ms

18282783
mouseover	mouseout
if you mouseover over the 2nd link tip then mouseout you can see the text change while it s fading out

18282785
inherited	properties
fm-rating declares an isolated scope as seen here which means it does not use prototypical inherited to get access to the parent properties

18282812
hide	show
b set a css overflow-x property for the container and let the images either hide show a scroll bar .

18282826
puts	gets
in substance the code puts to and gets from the map concurrently and inevitably gets a cme

18282841
ciimage	uiimage
meanwhile display something else in the scrolling cell such as a flat color or - better - the uiimage you are feeding into your ciimage for filtering

18282897
rss	feed
it looks very similar to a rss feed in that it has various elements like titles and urls

18282916
uiview	subviews	width	height
what you can do is make a uiview to act as a container that is sized to the height and width you want then add the tableview as a subviews to that

18282978
hide	show
then you could easily write your selector using these class names to invoke your hide show toggle with something like

18282993
post	get
i have a permissions class for which i need to create a static method to get the corresponding element based on the post method in my views.py

18283026
for-loop	loops
the solution is to create only one buttongroup to do this before the for-loop and then add each jradiobutton to that group inside of loops

18283069
macports	homebrew
2 install pil or through homebrew or macports etc

18283071
ubuntu	linux
i am doing this using linux l ubuntu

18283094
folder	directory
the file i had been opening in notepad was saved in the directory where i expected it to be saved while the file the code was reading was saved in the vb project s folder

18283100
post	get
all post i found about the remote_app_id does not match stored id has solved fixing the key hash but the key get from app by get_signatures should be the right one right

18283108
filtering	grouping
i need to filtering out the people using different criteria s and put them in grouping problem is when i start excluding on the 4th-5th level performance issues come up and it becomes slow

18283120
width	height
the problem is that when loading the new image the img element collapses to 0 height and width for a moment and then jumps to the new height

18283121
spaces	linefeed
spaces and linefeed get ignored

18283124
pascal	delphi
in delphi pascal strings are 1-based but for arrays you have to provide range and so you can use what you like

18283175
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
each platform has direct collection sources like mvxadapter and mvxtableviewsource and it s trivial to write filtering sorting and less trivial grouping into your view model so that it works with the views

18283175
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
however no-one has yet that i know of written a reusable filtering sorting grouping layer on top of this

18283191
pull	push
this will allow you to make the change in one query as opposed to a pull and push

18283195
nexus	artifactory
nexus pro has a staging suite and artifactory supports similar features

18283248
post	get
i found a great solution by simply mimicking what java s securerandom.nextint int is doing at here securerandom.nextint int will post code as soon as i can get to code it i m busy at the moment

18283267
put	get
in this case the exception is thrown if the put thread adds a member while the get thread is iterating over the map

18283267
put	get
i was able to get good result with the following which artificially slows down the iteration which also does a put by adding a delay in hashcode

18283276
google-chrome	firefox
the drop down is not working in google-chrome works fine in ie and firefox

18283306
apache	nginx
there are many examples out there for both apache and nginx

18283306
apache	nginx
the way i do it is i configure apache nginx to send all urls that do not match an existing file so that static files like images js and css still work to my index.php file

18283331
accessor	properties	subclass	accessor
when generating the nsmanagedobject subclass i get an nsorderedset properties on the class and coredata helpfully provided some accessor in the .h file

18283342
listview	gridview
then place your gridview or in my case listview in your panel

18283352
hash	salt
if you would like to obfuscate your strings in a cryptographically strong way use a salt secure hash algorithm it will produce very different results for even slightly different strings

18283429
maven	pom.xml
in eclipse when maven is enabled there is a pom.xml file to build with maven

18283494
int	chars
you will find that this is not a simple task and that you will end up with routines to read ascii chars of int letters etc

18283735
for-loop	arrays
try to create a for-loop to iterate self.firsttableview allvalues then add all values in that arrays to your main to sort arrays

18283843
vmware	virtualbox
if you insist on being able to freeze processes and save state to disk you may want to consider running your processes inside a virtual machine like virtualbox or vmware

18283843
profiling	benchmarking
however you ll probably get more bang for your buck by improving the efficiency of your code profiling or benchmarking for bottlenecks scaling up your system or scaling out your program s tasks in a distributed way

18283885
for-loop	loops
you re using a foreach loops like a while loops that is written like a for-loop

18283962
uitableview	nsindexpath
it will not run - nsinteger tableview uitableview tableview numberofrowsinsection nsinteger section and - uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath functions

18283996
avr	microcontroller
i am new to c++ but not programming and have recently started to write a library for a avr microcontroller

18284000
google-chrome	firefox
my test code works in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie 10

18284000
google-chrome	firefox
output in firefox and google-chrome is what i expected

18284013
children	parent
to collect all href s of anchor links which are direct children of list-items within some root list start from the root find all such links then put them in the map and associate them with their parent

18284024
jar	war
for any jar within a war s web-inf lib classes get mapped to web-inf classes at runtime

18284034
pop-up	dialog
lbltestrequestnum and lbltestkey are labels on my jqm pop-up dialog box

18284034
pop-up	dialog
lesson learned don t expect ipad to be able to read anything from labels inputs inside your pop-up dialog

18284045
ubuntu	debian
it compiles fine on an ubuntu box with g++ 4.7.3 but on a debian 7 box with 4.7.2 i get this compile output

18284105
ubuntu	debian
evidently on ubuntu the resolution of high_resolution_clock is nanoseconds or finer but on debian 7 the resolution of high_resolution_clock is courser than nanoseconds

18284112
express	node.js
for example in node.js using express and passport the user id is in request.user.id so for example

18284118
google-chrome	firefox
tested in quirky google-chrome and firefox

18284188
width	height
if i understand you correctly you need to give a width and height in px to your html elements

18284223
width	text-align
obviously the table also needs a width of 100 and you also need to make the image in the center of the table cell so we need text-align center on the cells

18284228
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
sign there are 59 code for firefox and opera and 186 code for safari google-chrome ie

18284265
width	height
websites usually set the height and width of div s with percentage instead of pixels

18284267
google-chrome	firefox
cookies are enabled on my browser and i ve tried both firefox and google-chrome

18284286
stdout	stderr
but i find it cumbersome to use as it throws a subprocess.calledprocesserror if the pipeline returns exit code other than 0 and to capture both stdout and stderr you need to interleave them both which makes it unusable for many cases

18284320
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox yep and google-chrome nope

18284351
post	get
i am trying to use the tumblr_client gem to post images to a tumblr but when i use the photo function as it is described in the examples i get an error saying that i am passing a array not a hash

18284357
icmp	udp
if it fails then something definitely went wrong incidentally an icmp error message is sent back if a udp packet is received that is addressed to a port that is not open for udp or if something actively refuses the packet on the way

18284357
udp	tcp
you d have to use both of the above to check both tcp and udp

18284357
icmp	tcp
note that inetaddress uses an icmp request as ping by default but if it does not have permission to do that it will fall back on attempting to establish a tcp connection instead

18284357
icmp	tcp
however in the case that it does have permission to generate icmp packets there is no way to force it to attempt a tcp connection instead

18284379
switching	screens
after creating entries in the file and having them read back to the screens just for debugging and verification purposees it will return to the while statement below but if i watch the choice function in both the main function and the enterchoice function when i make the first selection the one that works those variables according to gdb do not take on any values until after createmasterfile runs before that it states that it is not in scope after it runs through once choice will take on the original value 1 as it hits while then seems to skip the condition of the while statement then hits the switching statement which somehow changes choice to 0 which then hits the default case which then returns to the while statement and choice takes on a value of 32767 and again seems to skip the conditional part of the while statement and gets stuck in an infinite loop at this point with choice never changing in value

18284396
ready	each
each device can then check in saying ready or not ready

18284409
int	chars
i m currently going through learncpp.com s c++ tutorials and i m seeing that their variable naming trend has them naming int variables with an n prefix int nvalue and ch prefixes for chars variables chars choperation

18284416
implements	extends
so i have a custom classloader to load classes into memory from byte arrays and i have a problem when i attempt to see if a class is assignable from another classloader.isassignablefrom it returns false even if the compiled class extends or implements it

18284417
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
the problem is that this technique works great in google-chrome mac and safari but in firefox the clicks don t have any effect on the video in youtube

18284521
hash	md5
the chances of an md5 clash the hash being repeated are incredibly low so 1 000 rehashes will almost never return anything

18284521
hash	md5
md5 has a 128-bit digest size in other words there are 2 128 possible different md5 hash to process

18284552

18284598
getter	setter
we do this cleanly using java and actionscript getter setter which correctly set the serialized date objects in our dto by parsing the un-adjusted date strings

18284636
int	chars
as you can see the objects i am passing in main method are int string and chars which has compareto methods

18284660
inherited	subclassing
but when blockingclass is subclassing with multiple inherited like above with an object that defines __new__ that __new__ method is still called

18284690
nstextfield	nstabview
i have an nstabview at the top containing some nstextfield and nsbuttons so i have what i ve called a tabviewcontroller with all the outlets actions for anything inside it

18284706
postgresql	mysql
if anyone would like to tackle this you can use the sails mysql adapter or the sails postgresql adapter as examples

18284716
post	get
instead of field you must use term to get the post in fourth

18284729
zfcuser	bjyauthorize
i m trying to setup zfcuser with bjyauthorize

18284730
children	parent
that s just how it works - nodevalue of parent node will always contain nodevalue s of its children

18284736
metaclass	subclassing
or replace ndarray with a module with a class with metaclass that has a subclassing hook that will say that the original ndarray and your class are both instances of the same.

18284793
post	get
i ve been trying to get the resolve property to work like this post by misko

18284806
tostring	getter
assuming you already have getter for all the fields in part and machine all that s really missing is a tostring on partdescriptor

18284812
inherited	subclassing
my course did not cover inherited very well and they did not bother to discuss subclassing at all

18284851
width	height
then you can change the width and height in view area in the inspector

18284870
maven	pom.xml
but full build of the project is done using maven and project configuration in pom.xml

put	get
in my application i have an arraylist that is returned from another class and in the next line i need to get the size of it to create an another array where i m going to put some addresses and it always return the size 0 in the debug mode i could see that more forward in the program the size of the arraylist is correct but there all that i wanted to do is already wrong i have tried to use thread.sleep 10000 and a 10000 blank loop and still nothing please someone help and sorry for my english here it is a little bit of the code

18285077
inherited	subclassing
while formally in computer science theory both of these deal with subclassing the reality is that the c++ rules for these are different because the representation of const t and t are guaranteed to be the same while the representations of and often differ by an offset but may be radically different when virtual inherited is involved

18285085
hex	binary
this binary number translates to 3588381501 in decimal 0xd5e25b3d in hex

18285200
getter	setter
operation should be only by the public functions you have provided like getter setter

18285252
gruntjs	yeoman
i d suggest yeoman or a custom gruntjs script

18285378
for-loop	arrays
i also think you might need to retrieve the information arrays outside the for-loop that is json.getjsonarray should probably be outside the for-loop

18285415
plot	heatmap
i am trying to plot a map for my final project and i am trying to do a heatmap of crime by block in the us

so fadein works cool but fadeout has no effect

18285664
fadein	hide
#text-11 hide fadein 1000

18285730
min	max
because floats are inaccurate maybe you d want to store the min and max of these values and then see if they are close enough to each other

18285741
equals	compareto
what does very much matter but you do not show here is that your equals method on person should return true if and only if compareto returns 0

18290831
implements	extends
in my opinion there is a better way to implements parsers than the traditional methods that results in simpler and easier to understand code and especially makes it easier to extends whatever language you are parsing by just plugging in a new class in a very object-oriented way

google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
firefox ie safari and google-chrome

18291321
implements	extends
set aside the basic facts they both extends inputstream and somehow use a byte array internally and technically either could be implements without using any array its just the most natural way to do it

18291580
scons	autotools
you could probably more easily get mingw to build windows stuff with this than with autotools but it s still really more geared to doing posix stuff and you d need to install python and scons to use it

18291580
scons	autotools
there s counter-intuitive things if you re used to make scons or autotools

18291580
scons	automake
scons is almost a no-go right at the moment unless you re using scratchbox2- it really doesn t have a handle on cross-compilation and you re going to need to use that extensibility and maintain it much in the same manner as you will with automake

18291580
scons	autotools
i can t really expect that out of an scons based project- and i fully expect 1 3rd or more autotools projects to have gotten something wrong that precludes it building right on any context except the host building one or a scratchbox2 one

18291586
children	parent
they give you all of the parent nodes as a starting point and then allow you to use the browsenodelookup to find info on a particular node including its parent ancestors and children

accessor	superclass	accessor	properties	inherited	properties
the idea is that the superclass inherited from dynamicprops and use addprop to add a new properties and set its accessor methods manually based on its name

18292283
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
now in the subclassing instead of defining a dependent properties the usual way we use this new inherited function in the constructor to define a dynamic properties

18292283
superclass	subclassing
the idea is to require the subclassing to create a property defined as abstract in the superclass containing the names of the desired dynamic properties to be created

18292283
accessor	superclass	accessor	properties
the constructor of the superclass would then create the specified dynamic properties setting their accessor methods to generic functions which could customize their behavior based on the properties name as you requested

18292283
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
in the subclassing we are simply required to implement the inherited abstract dynamic_props properties initialized with a list of names or if you dont want to create any dynamic properties

18292315
superclass	subclassing
you cannot refer to a superclass or interface object through a subclassing reference

put	get
typically a property get method will return a copy of what s in some variable or array slot and a put method will copy its parameter into that variable or array slot

18292546

subtract	add
in the second one i want to append subtract the former data in div groups so i can add more or delete them easily but i can t think or find of a solution that puts in group the data from the first form in one div and appends that child div to the second form

18292923
children	parent
well this doesn t work although the parent sprite is not visible the children are not drawn the value of this property remains true

18292923
children	parent
if you are setting the parent displayobject s visibility to false and expecting it to propagate to all of its children you are wrong

18292942
for-loop	loops
you can use a regular for-loop and loops backwards

since the server will discard any post data on redirect you need to track the post data on every submit and re-populate the post data on page load get

18293186
for-loop	loops
my theory i am setting m to np.arrays y.shape and then creating my for-loop to make m equal to the math set within loops thus replacing all the 0 s to the moving average

18293239
queue	fifo
this is assuming you meant a fifo queue and not some other kind of queue like a priority queue

18293255
slideup	slidedown
rather than using .delay method i d use the complete argument on the slidedown or slideup s so that once they re complete you do your scrolling

18293612
portrait	landscape
works perfectly in iphone 5 safari except for the fact that rotating from landscape mode to portrait mode makes the font-sizes smaller than they should be

18293612
portrait	landscape
however if you initially load the page in portrait mode it works perfectly - that is until you rotate to landscape and then back to portrait

18293621
glassfish	weblogic
oracle have made it quite easy to port glassfish webapps over to weblogic but if you really want to learn how coherence works i would suggest you take a look at the code and try to write your own application from scratch using it as an example

18293688
hash	md5
i have a built in two arrays that hold md5 hash of the tweets used and the uri s of the images used which i check against before using results from a new search so i don t use the same thing again

18293688
hash	md5
here is the code i use to check if the tweet contains characters i don t want or isn t in the set of md5 hash

18293688

the set contains a number of md5 hash of strings of text i want to search this set for a hash of a random string i have and only execute code if it isn t already present in the set

18293688

it should search for an image and only if the md5 hash of the uri isn t already in the imagemd5 set it will retreieve the image do some stuff then add the md5 hash of the uri to the set so that the same image won t be used again

18293765

what i want to do is having a special window with a constructor that sets up eg width height etc of the window

18294045
free	malloc
when you get __getgmtimebuf - _malloc_crt with the message _block_type_is_valid phead- nblockuse this nearly always means that some other function has called free on a block that wasn t allocated with new malloc or that something is overwriting the end of the buffer of an allocated block

18294402
width	height
specifying just the height limit squashes the image and the width doesn t scale and vice versa

18294418
accessor	properties
in essence the properties creates a private field and automatically generates accessor mutator methods

18294419
for-loop	arrays
currently i m using an arrays with a for-loop to check each string

18294441
mouse	keyboard
i have made a program using sdl that has a lot of keyboard and mouse input

18294441
mouse	keyboard
i would like to have a separate file for keyboard input and another for mouse input each containing a function that will be called in the main sdl loop

18294450
width	height
be sure to substitute the location of your bitmap in place of the c redwind bitmaps prayerchild.bmp. also substitue your bitmap s position and width height data at x y width height

18294460
floating-point	integer
if the number is interpreted as any integer type int long etc. the compiler will allow it to be used to initialize any integer type in which the number is representable as well as any binary or decimal floating-point type without regard for whether or not the number can be represented precisely in that type

beyondcompare	diffmerge
i ve been looking for a way to use something like beyondcompare or diffmerge or kaleidoscope but so far haven t found anyway to configure it

18294625
width	height
for example the properties x y and width height are non- writable but are respectively parts of the pos and size properties which are writable but non- stored because they are themselves parts of the larger property geometry which is the only one you really need to save and restore and you can check that is this property is both stored and writable

18294654
freebsd	linux
these days it s much faster and most unix-like os s including linux and freebsd use copy-on-write which considerably reduces the cost of a forked child which doesn t modify memory or modifies very little memory

18294654
vfork	posix
vfork was removed from posix in the 2008 edition and should be considered deprecated

18294654
freebsd	linux
as far as i know it is available on recent versions of linux and has been available for quite a while on freebsd and solaris. that may actually call vfork but it will at least handle the details without resulting in undefined behaviour

stdout	stderr
the siege program writes its output to two different standard streams stdout and stderr

18294760
stdout	stderr
to capture both you need to redirect using your shell stderr to stdout so that everything is in the one stream that php captures

stdout	stderr
i have installed siege and verified that it uses both stdout and stderr and that the output redirection works.

18295320
width	height
i ve tried many of the different techniques people used for dynamically setting the webview height to its content height but none of them worked the way i wanted for the width

18295320

18295583
width	height
your images do not have width height until they start loading

18295583

18295684
width	text-align
the key here its width auto you weren t able to use float or text-align to put them in the same line because both widgets have width 100 i am using classnames instead of id s since if you delete and create a new widget the id will change and you will have to update the css in that case

i d not say it s not documented but basically it does the same as app.get does for http get but instead only matches http post requests

18297375
post	get
if you don t know what the difference between a post and a get is you can for example take a look here

your question had fairly little to do with the avr but some mistaken ideas about how compilers and microcontroller work

18297570
avr	microcontroller
i m also getting the impression this was based around the idea that a microcontroller like the avr would be working on individual bits all the time

18297570
avr	microcontroller
but since it s such a common operation for a microcontroller the avr has a single instruction to do this without spending registers on holding v0-v4

18297574

when i put two callback in one file i get

18303631
free	malloc
now besides that unless you are just doing that you d be wasting a lot of clock-cycles because malloc and free are not free operations they take time and of course copying the string will take some operations too

18303631
free	malloc
on top of that the memory allocated with malloc will take up more space than the actual string both because the malloc and free functions need a bit of information next to the memory block to be able to do their job and because typically the size is rounded up to some good size 8 16 or 32 bytes

18303631
free	malloc
which means that you are not just wasting clock-cycles calling malloc and free but you are also using more memory than you actually asked for

18303632
int	boolean
i need to check is some int prime in compile time to put the boolean value as template argument

18303633
free	strcpy	free	malloc	free	strdup	strdup	malloc	strcpy	malloc	strcpy	strdup

depending on the complexity or level of interaction you require this could be done with something as simple as making a get request to a particular page on your web server and supplying the necessary information in the query string alternatively you could use post

18304227
hash	md5	post	get
you probably shouldn t pass these values through the query string of the url perhaps prefer a post rather than a get here and above all else you shouldn t store or pass the password in plain text either hash it first using md5 sha1 or another hash of your choice

if you like you can move some of this logic by having your baseadapter extension implement abslistview.recyclerlistener and set the adapter as recycler listener for the listview or gridview

18304325
int	chars
it just means that you can t use one single vector of int to fill more than 4gb so no more than 1g entries in the vector or 4g chars entries

18304325
integer	unsigned
also if the system was limited for some architectural reasons say to 16mb of memory size_t is most likely still a 32-bit unsigned integer - because most processors don t do 24-bit integers some dsp s may do that but regular 16 or 32 bit processors don t

18304386
stdout	stderr
note that lua -v writes on stderr on windows for linux i don t know so the command for io.popen which only captures stdout must redirect stderr to stdout and the syntax is platform-specific

18307048
integer	unsigned
use the max value of an unsigned 32-bt integer uint_max to be the maximum size of the prime number you want to check

distance	polygons
note also that even in case of triangles using the point equidistant from the vertices can give you points outside and far away from the polygons and is also numerically unstable given any îµ 0 and m 0 you can always build a triangle in which a specific movement of a vertex by a distance of less than îµ moves the center by a distance greater than m

18307215
distance	polygons
in the case of a general not necessarily convex not necessarily simply connected polygons a center that i found useful but that is not trivial to compute is the an inner point that is at a maximum distance from the boundary in other words a most inner point

realloc	memmove
i see this is marked c++ not c but since they do the same thing under the covers it s worth pointing out that you can add elements to the beginning and end of an array by allocating it arbitrarily large and realloc ing and memmove ing between 2 companion arrays if and when you run out of room

ssl	https
as far as i know a httplistener is not a good choice as you need a ssl certificate for it to support https which a proxy usually does not provide

18307935
post	put
hiddenhttpmethodfilter is required only if your form-method is other than post its put delete in that case spring automatically adds _method hidden field with correct form-method

18308085
post	get
but using post instead of get presumably adds one more level of protection for xsrf types of attack it does not you need some form of explicit xsrf protection token with post or with get

18308085
post	get
so if you were not using ssl then post get makes no big difference and when you are using ssl nothing changes attacks leveraging wrong methods aim in other parts services of the system

you have to put that user control in .if you put it outside then it will give error like you get

i think change the css like providing the width and height as not the px format

18308875
children	parent
ideally i would like to modify session.query in a way so that multiple two queries are sent retrieving the parent and all their children entities

18308883
width	margin
properly means minimum width should be enough to fit groupbox.text there should be no gaps below for unknown reason it s not margin nor padding and it looks pretty ugly

18308890
getter	setter
because it doesn t make much sense to define a getter setter that is not visible from the outside in most cases

18308890
getter	setter
however the private keyword defeats this purpose by making the generated getter setter methods invisible to the outside world

18308890
getter	setter
the only reason you would want to use a private setter getter is when there is some additional logic involved

18308911
setcontentview	findviewbyid
most importantly here you will usually call setcontentview int with a layout resource defining your ui and using findviewbyid int to retrieve the widgets in that ui that you need to interact with programmatically

i see in that application that rather many classes have only private constructors and one or more static methods getter setter of the current class object

18315189
floating-point	integer
a 64-bit integer might have advantages over a 32-bit floating-point format in some situations but often the proper comparison is for comparable sizes such as 32-bit integer to 32-bit floating-point and 64-bit integer to 64-bit floating-point

queue	fifo
when you use dispatch_get_main_queue you re adding your dispatch block to the end of a serial queue on the main thread that is executed in fifo fifo order

18316119
queue	fifo
i think it goes without saying that if you use a serial dispatch queue then you have fifo ordering in this queue same as you dispatch_get_main_queue only you wouldn t have to execute on the main thread

18316146
min	max
you have no overlaps when min endtime is less than max starttime

18316297
jboss	glassfish
i think what could be happening is that hudson is running on some application server such as glassfish tomcat 5 jboss jetty 6 etc and it might have either some ehcache or hibernate lib versions that are competing with the ones you re embedding in your app...hence the problem happening only when running tests in hudson

18316795
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
it works great in ie google-chrome safari and firefox

18316972
inherited	properties
this works because setting the value to the attribute instead of the properties will not throw a syntaxerror exception if plaintext-only is an invalid value instead it will set the properties value to the default inherited

18316972
inherited	properties
getting the properties after setting the attribute results in a lower-cased string so setting the attribute value to plaintext-only will result in a properties with the value plaintext-only supported true or inherited not supported false

18316985
min	max
there is maximum of 14 elements listed and each element can have 2 or 3 records 1 or to for spec min and max or just max and 1 for actual reading

please name the typedef and name in struct deceleration different

18317130

you are using same name for the typedef and struct decleration

18317249
openssl	crypto++
first i would recommend using different crypto library like nacl for c c++ or crypto++ for c++ because they provide easier to implement primitives in openssl it is easy to mess up implementation

the leiningen incantation for core.async is currently as follows

18317427
uiwebview	uimenuitem
if it didn t respond to a selector as a uiwebview it won t respond to it as a uimenuitem either

18317481
hash	salt	scrypt	salt	scrypt	pbkdf2	pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash
consider using salt hash or better yet an algorithm design specifically for hashing passwords such as bcrypt scrypt or pbkdf2 which is built in to the framework itself

18317489
folder	directory
the quick fix i used was to just copy all directory in whatever template folder it was complaining about and add a .zip to the end

18317524
prepare	execute
pdo by default will load data as needed when using pdo query or pdo prepare to execute the query and retrieving results with pdo fetch

make sure and copy the code from the superclass verify into the subclassing but change it as follows

18317632
move	drag
if you set this up with a pan gesture you ll need to configure this to drag the cell and animate up or down upon completion but in my swiping example the cell move to just out the top of the 4 inch simulator i used static values

textview	imageview
this is quite similar as a textview and an imageview

18317678
interpolation	splines
i m not aware of any splines interpolation algorithms which work with iris yet though there is a similar interface to do linear interpolation should that be of interest

18317687
beanstalk	amazon-web-services

18317708
hide	show
when a button is clicked you hide all the panels using .lang as the selector then depending on the button clicked use either .lang-en .lang-es or .lang-de to show the selected one

18317739
stdio	fflush
and in general if the reason for calling abort is that you ve detected inconsistent state in your program there s a risk that stdio state is also corrupted and that calling fflush is therefore unsafe

18317739
stdio	fflush
the c standard allows an implementation to fflush stdio streams as part of abort c11 7.22.4.1

18317739
stdio	fflush
since from a practical standpoint it s usually impossible to fflush buffers if abort is being called from a signal handler that interrupted stdio code that has the buffer in an inconsistent state any implementation that attempts to use this allowance is likely to be buggy

18317764
put	get
i m creating a small search tool and i m very confused as to how to get text from a url and put it in my js array

both google-chrome and safari on my laptop render the blue sub-menu on top of the second row

all is well except when the footer section of the subreport on the left does not fit on the page it is supposed to be printed and is moved to the next page

18317836
wordpress	joomla	joomla	typo3
in joomla or wordpress i simply take the template directory and then i copy it into the themes directory but i think that in typo3 this operation could be more complex

18317854
bash	zsh
i need the script that could do activation in current bash zsh because now i m forced to this ugly routine

18317883
google-chrome	firefox
i have a firefox extension which opens a new window and in that window at some point the address should be redirected to a local addon page google-chrome myextensions blah somepage.html

18317883

vb6	vba
i have a function to compare characters that comes from vb6 and i am a novice user on vb6 and mostly work from vba platform

18318031
ready	each
however the more correct approach is to probably use the requiredfieldvalidator for each of those controls so that you can just call this.validate on the page when you re ready and then check this.isvalid on the page and react to it

18318040
google-chrome	firefox
it worked exactly like i wanted in firefox however in google-chrome and i.e

18318063
hide	show
can be show hide or effect

18318063
hide	fadeout	hide	show	fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout
instead of fadeout which hide element we will set mode to hide and instead of fadein which show element we will set mode to show

18318063
hide	show
here is quick jfiddle example how bounce works with show and hide mode

18318141
for-loop	loops
one thing that might go wrong is that maybe php doesn t support for loops where two incrementations happen haven t tested it so if it doesn t just put the at the end of the inner for-loop

18318192
hide	show
show the message before calling the .ajax call and hide it in the success error callbacks

18318236
paperclip	fog
paperclip fog works on my local machine mac 10.8.4 but fails on server ubuntu 10.04 lts

18318273
google-chrome	firefox
as user thirtydot explained in another question there is no way to customize scrollbars in firefox as is possible in google-chrome

18318288
imagemagick	libtiff
i had suspected that it might have been the version of libtiff as the mac has 4.0.3 and the server has 3.9.5 however i ve just run a test on a fresh ubuntu install with latest imagemagick and libtiff 3.9.5 and the problem is still present

18318307
hive	hdfs	folder	directory
when you create external table you define hdfs directory for that table and hive is simply looking in it and can get data from it but hive can t delete or change data in that folder

18318307
hive	hdfs
when you drop external table hive only deletes metadata from its metastore and data in hdfs remains unchanged

18318307
hive	hdfs
managed table basically is a directory in hdfs and it s created and managed by hive

18318307
hive	hdfs
even more - all operations for removing changing partitions raw data table in that table must be done by hive otherwise metadata in hive metastore may become incorrect you manually delete partition from hdfs but hive metastore contains info that partition exists

18318316
for-loop	loops
i have a function e which has a for-loop in this loops i open an image to draw on using imshow im colormap jet then another function m is called in fn m there is another loops where a i m using the line matlab function to draw points in on the image im

18318326
getter	setter
you can achieve it through getter and setter method

18318343
multiplying	multiplication
i also saw on another question that you can speed up each single run by using big num multiplication the least amount of times the way to do this would be keep multiplying until you reach the size of a big num then start multiplying the next numbers until you get a bignum

18318355
getter	setter
even if it looks like there s no point in using the getter setter methods now since they don t do anything interesting you need to think about what might happen in the future when the requirements change

18318359
width	height
however once rotated its height is its width before it was centered which is not 100 of the page

18318382
free	malloc
if the program runs for days and you c++ code use malloc free or new delete to allocate release memory from the heap on windows xp and 2003 by default you ll encounter heap fragmentation problem

18318396
labwindows	cvi
i have looked at cvi samples and although the use of activex controls is handy in labwindows it presupposes that excel is installed on the system

18318431
pull	push
there is no way you can delete a pull request yourself -- you and the repo owner and all users with push access to it can close it but it will remain in the log

18318459
width	height
canvas world and all objects width and height are divided by 2

18318518
min	max
now that you have the data in this format then you can apply pivot to get the max min value for each item in col

18318538
client-side	server-side
javascript is client-side script while php is server-side

18318569
stdout	fflush
the problem is that the stdout of your spawned process needs to fflush it s output buffer otherwise it will sit there until it fills up in which case your code won t execute again

18318571
put	get
i m sure i can put those together separately but can t seem to get the compiler to be happy with my code when executed altogether

18318590
post	get
i can get params in create post action

18318619
public	protected
its protected from public access now but i cannot access it from views which i was doing earlier as mentioned below

18318636

the following code is from the gist on feedzirra to get the updated content from a rss feed

18318644
children	parent
when i need to trigger things in children from parent elements though it s a little unclear to me how i should be doing this

18318644
children	parent
as an aside notice i m using a view property on the parent to keep track of it s children

18318651
boost-geometry	boost-graph
i thought of using boost-graph for handling the graph and to combine it with boost-geometry

18318651
boost-geometry	boost-graph
but afaik boost-geometry does not allow to attach properties to linestrings as boost-graph does

18318668
width	height
i will be doing these anova s on several variables like width and height as well

18318683
hide	show
if you only have a small number of maximum edit controls you could also just create them on the form and then show hide them as necessary

18318714
post	get
the other question deals with sending an array via post and i am trying to do a get request which set to isarray true by default and i want to pass only one of the parameters an array as which that answer does not seem to help me to

18318776
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
technically that s a nested class declared within another class not a subclassing which inherited from its superclass

18318789
postfix	dovecot
here s my postfix and dovecot config

18318797
hide	show
using bootstrap 2.3.2 i ve previously used a toggle button to show and hide text using the collapse plugin but from what i see it only allows me to reveal and hide the entire contents of an element

18318835
put	get
i know that im doing a mistake here coz i cant run the project im trying to build and also what im trying to do here is to get a parsed data from an xml then save it into a an nsdata and then put all those data into a cache so when i run my project it doesnt always load for the data

18318838
google-chrome	firefox
firefox does not allow redirects from http https to google-chrome resources

18318860
versioning	upgrade
i cannot upgrade to a newer versioning of codegear as this would break rtti behavior the application relies on

18318866
int	chars
first we split the string by the chars and make sure that the result doesn t contain any empty strings that s why we have if i and then get the last item from list and we convert it to an int with builtin int function

18318894
implements	extends	superclass	subclassing
if it can vary with multiple implementations that extends the superclass then it should probably be defined as an abstract method in the superclass and implements by the subclassing

18318900
spaces	delimiter
again the url exists in a sentence where words are delimiter by spaces so we have to assume require that the url contains no unencoded spaces which makes finding its end easy

18318927
children	parent
removefromparentandcleanup removes node from its parent s children array while you are enumerating _flyingobjects collection

18318946
width	height
make sure that #searchresults has a width and height and position relative

18318946
width	height
and add a css-class also with width and height and float left to the wrapping container of each searchresult inside the searchhtml

18318998
webclient	httpwebrequest
i ve tried using webclient and httpwebrequest but i can t seem to get past the initial page

nl2br	htmlspecialchars
i have just implemented nl2br htmlspecialchars .

18319105
width	height
i m setting the width height of each div like this

18319105
width	height
the problem now is that every once in a while let say 1 of 6 the printpreview shows only the half or so of the width and a portion of the height goes to the next page so i have double the pages to print

18319106
gdal	ogr
strong preference to gdal ogr or console solutions

18319152
width	height
inside of div#b there are plenty of images floating left and fixed width and height

18319179
ssl	https
so the point i m trying to make is that hosting the services from an https site and the client code from non-ssl based urls will be just as secure as hosting everything from an ssl site

18319185
portrait	landscape
one is for landscape view and the other portrait

18319190
google-chrome	firefox
its still there the dotted outline in firefox and the outline on inputs etc in google-chrome

18319230
versioning	upgrade
when i upgrade my packages pip will now correctly search for and install the latest versioning of pytz

18319230
versioning	upgrade
stop press as described in the pytz bug report the versioning numbering of pytz has now been changed to for example 2013.7 - so once you have upgrade to this the problem should no longer occur

18319231
webclient	httpwebrequest
better use webclient with cookies or httpwebrequest and httpwebresponse

18319295
chunked	transfer-encoding
how can i disable chunking in proxy-client so that instead of transfer-encoding chunked content-length header is passed

18319306
width	margin
the width of an element by default includes it s padding margin and border widths

18319354
folder	directory
i created a bin directory at the project_dir level then created a release debug directory inside the bin folder which solved the problem for me

18319393
flask	django
for web development people in python land tend to go with django and flask as they are the most popular

18319406
uiactivityindicatorview	viewwillappear
calling reloaddata in the table view controller s viewwillappear would work as long as in the cellforrowatindexpath method you re setting the state for uiactivityindicatorview by calling it s stopanimating method or simply remove it from the view for any cell that shouldn t be spinning

18319497
hex	binary
it has to do with the nature of binary and hex

18319497
hex	binary
because hex base 16 is a multiple of binary base 2

18319538
width	height
so i wrapped everything in a grid and hardcoded the width height maxwidth maxheight to be equal to the screen height width

18319538
width	height
so i suspect your code is changing the overall height width of a panoramaitem which is in turn changing the panorama size and resetting the internal scrollviewer

18319576
preorder	inorder
the reason you wanna include the null leaves is because when multiple nodes have the same value the preorder and inorder may not be enough

18319576
preorder	inorder
checking subtrees using preorder and inorder strings

18319576
preorder	inorder
also read this for more info on preorder and inorder traversals of binary trees

post	get
here is an example how to do http request using get method in android if post method is what you need this example is perfect

ubuntu	linux
b with virtualbox i just installed inside the windows 7 host a linux ubuntu sever guest just to run the rails development environment also in the linux machine

18319721

google-chrome	firefox
i am not sure the compatibility with this but it works for me in firefox google-chrome and ie9

18319880
sse	avx
also note that the fact that the avx are a newer than sse doesn t make the avx faster whatever you are planning to use the number of cycles taken by an function is probably more important than the avx vs sse argument for example see this answer

18319977
ssl	https
the standard ssl port is 443 but if you re using a library that parses urls correctly it will connect to that port automatically if it sees https at the beginning

18319981
postorder	inorder
you can do this using a substring check as described in the other answers and using just one traversal pre-order inorder or postorder so long as you are printing the entirity of each node in the tree not just their values

18319981
spaces	delimiter
the only caveats of course are cases where the string representations of the values interfere with the serialization of the trees the value strings contain spaces or parenthesis c. so to make this robust you d want to take appropriate measures with delimiter or escapes

18319993
for-loop	loops
and i want to loops through all the vec entities using c++11 range-based for-loop

18320006
button	checkbox
once the user has selected any combination of checkbox i need to determine the values associated with any checkbox that has been checked after the user clicks on a finished button

18321764
sse	avx
i also don t see the benefit of using sse here in you have a long loop say n 100 you could get the benefit from avx for the most part of it and do the remainder in scalar code up to 7 iterations you code may still have to do 3 of them

18321764

the performance loss is nothing compared to mixing avx sse

post	put
so you should use the helper report_fixed_vulns_path note the plural with the same arguments but with method post put is for update in your case

18322982
put	get
looking through the weakhashmap code it seems that there is no straight forward way of doing this but something of this following form should work this code has not actually been tested but i think it is at least on the correct path also it only implements put and get other operations can likewise be implemented

18322982
put	get
potential incorrectness of the above code aside another caveat is that weakhashmap works by calling its own expungestaleentries method every time you call things like put get or even size

.war	manifest.mf	war	manifest.mf

18323731
war	manifest.mf
from what i can tell the war manifest goal is designed to be used to generate a template manifest.mf which you can then customise and use going forward

18323731
.war	manifest.mf

18325371
inherited	properties
because you re not checking if jack is a properties inherited from prototype or not

18325392
stdout	stderr
ffmpeg is probably writing to stderr instead of stdout

18325663
min	max
you can even use inf and -inf at the to extremes to make sure that you capture the extrema or min z and max z

18325690
onresume	onpause
thats because there s a chance that onstart might not get called even when onresume actually is there s a scenario when the activity might go to onpause only without going to onstop it only happens when activity is partially visible not completelly covered by another activity hence when comming back to activity only onresume will be called and not onstart

i tried creating a gen folder in the root directory and marking it as source but that didn t work

18341622

well the modal is gonna have position absolute so you won t be able to use 100 width and height to fill the viewport

18342014
post	put
i m using post as my request method but i tried put as well and it does not work either

18342034

min	max
i think you are on the right track by iterating over the file and keeping track of max and min values

18342343
median	percentile
to calculate the median and percentile in a continuous way you could build up a histogram inside your loop

18342343
median	percentile
after the loop you can get approximate percentile and median by converting the histogram to the cdf the error will depend on the number of bins

18342366

18342776
google-chrome	firefox
this code works properly on ie and firefox but i have problem with google-chrome

18342788
inherited	properties
you could create a constructor in classtwo that takes a classone and hydrates the inherited properties of classtwo or even approach it with an adapter pattern

18342797
union	distinct
union all will be faster than union as it doesn t perform a distinct operation

18342800

i am building a custom sitemap for a website i am working on the only way i ve managed to apply my custom filters and display the proper pages is to create several loops that check each time if the parent has children then displays them accordingly

18343061
put	get
you will not get the same values out that you put in

18343101
udp	tcp
so it is perfectly ok to have a tcp socket and a udp socket both bound to the same ip port pairs since their transports are different

18343101
udp	tcp
a udp packet cannot be routed to a tcp socket and vice versa they can be routed to a raw socket though

18343130
google-chrome	firefox
i would suggest using indexeddb but as far as mobile devices go only google-chrome on android firefox on android and blackberry browser support it

18343136
google-chrome	firefox
and all my urls are working good in google-chrome and firefox 3.6 which i m using to test hashbang fallback

18343141
put	get
if you can sort your data just sort by contact_col so that all the finance_contact get on top main_contact get just under and the blank ones go to the bottom if the option is actially blank you could get a column next to contact_col where you put 1 for finance_contact 2 for blank_contact and 3 for blank_contact and sort by this column

18343144
popover	tooltip
see the docs for tooltip popover on the bootstrap site.

i m developing on google-chrome safari firefox for mac

18343243
hide	show
i am using jquery to show and hide the edit options for each post

18343243

slight introduction about code the post-menu is the div which handles the show hide events edit-options is the that has to popup containing edit and delete as in it the #edit-post is the div for a textarea submit button which uses ajax jquery

18343314
stdout	fflush
and as stdout is line buffered the buffer filled with will not be fflush and printed out anymore

18343386
bluetooth	usb
if the system bluetooth controller is matched to the bluetooth le usb adapter then the ios simulator will not be able to use the external bluetooth controller for bluetooth le services

18343389
put	get
i know that with most gets simple parameters can get sent back but in this case i found it better to put all my search criteria in one object and send that over

18343434
width	height
because the .product-field-display element is a span wrapping div s chrome is basically making it a non-element height width of 0 and no placement on the page

18343474
portrait	landscape
by default the uinavigationbar should be tall in portrait orientation and short in landscape orientation

18343474
portrait	landscape
most of the time my app behaves like this but sometimes when changing from landscape back to portrait the navigation bar does not resize properly

18343474
portrait	landscape
the navigation bar remains short after rotating from landscape to portrait

18343527
respond.js	enquire.js
my workaround was to remove the inclusion of matchmedia from respond.js and then load media.match and enquire.js after loading respond.js

18343527
enquire.js	modernizr
i haven t tested this with modernizr yet but i was able to get media query support and enquire.js to work in ie7 and 8 with no js errors

18343557
width	height
to set that you can use the width and height properties on the canvas tag

18343602
mouseleave	mouseenter
.hover will listen for mouseenter and mouseleave events

18343602
mouseleave	mouseenter
additionally the .stop method prevents any animation buildups on fast mouseenter - mouseleave

18343618
respond.js	enquire.js
try removing the inclusion of matchmedia from respond.js and then loading match.media and enquire.js after respond.js

18343627
subtract	add
aside from the server-6310 mentioned by matt johnson one other workaround is to use the operator to add or subtract from the utc time zone to shift the time into the correct local zone

18343627
subtract	add
turns out you can add or subtract time in milliseconds

18343658
put	get
put there the full path to canopy s python version which you can get with these commands inside canopy

18343724
width	height
instead i just calculated a few percentages based on the static width height of all my slides and set the wrapper accordingly

18343727
gridview	rowdatabound
i suggest to use the rowdatabound which enables to access all rows in the table and also all rows in the gridview

18343824
mongodb	bson	dictionary	map
unlike php mongodb s bson format has no notion of associative arrays -- there are only arrays numerically indexed starting with zero and objects a hash map or dictionary of key value pairs

18343827
folder	directory
from within the same directory you can do another chmod on the pods folder like so

18343832
portrait	landscape
i have an ios 7 application i am writing and when the app first launches if i rotate to landscape then back to portrait the app becomes frozen unresponsive

18343844
hide	show
i m trying to find my activity s action bar s spinner so i can selectively show and hide it setnavigationmode does not work for my purposes

18343866
google-chrome	firefox
i would also check to see if it works on firefox and google-chrome

18343882
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately after that game has about 30fps from previously 60 fps without coins on mobile firefox google-chrome mobile 20-30 fps

18343911
strstr	substr
you re using strstr in the same manner as substr where the string contains abc

18344018
post	get
also be careful when inserting queries with get post data directly

18344065
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i ve tried it on google-chrome firefox safari and ie 9 10

18344079
folder	directory
i looked in the app directory and i had my app files mixed in with the current releases and shared folder so i m pretty sure i had somthing wrong with my deploy.rb file

18344118
put	get
that will just make your map perform the put get remove operations atomically that means you won t have two such operations running simultaneously

18344136
put	get
if you put a print statement inside the incr method you would get 92

18344152
width	height
so knowing the dimensions of my images key.png and key_pressed.png and the screen width and height and maybe other parameters i don t know

18344183
folder	directory
i want to make some folder out of root directory public_html

18344238

18344261
put	get
for instance if i put in the german misspelled word buxs i get english suggestions bus buss buds boxes bugs bums buys box s buns burs

18344272
box-sizing	border-box
i m trying to resize a div with box-sizing border-box

18344272
width	height
even though i only allow resizing the width the div shrinks everytime the resize event stops height changes

18344278
mouse	keyboard
if i do another action like pressing a mouse button or a keyboard key the focus is given back to the maingui

18344307
width	height
you can set the buttons width height in the layout - instead of just using wrap_content

18344311
width	height
you are sending a rect that has as width 768 and height 1024 starting on 0 and 650 so its a huge element that is causing this unexpected behaviour

18344338
post	get
i was wondering about the safest way to retrieve data from the post or get variable in django

18344341
width	height
i m displaying an iframe overlay with a z-index of 9999 with 100 width and height

18344380
width	height
this locations popup div has a fixed height and width and consequently there is a vertical scroll bar i ve created to scroll down and read the text

18344401
postgresql	mysql
i will use the normal database things in mysql or postgresql but sooner or later i have to hit those other databases and bring them back into django using django s templating and so on

18344462
versioning	upgrade
since 0.2 studio is shipped with its internal m2 repo to provide support and google api libraries so if you upgrade from previous versioning your sdk doesn t have it

18344475
folder	directory
i am not sure i understood your intended semantics of however looking at your start destination folder example i have created the following use case directory structure and the script below to solve your issue

18344491
put	get
you could put it in session and get it from another link

18344510
textview	imageview
i want to add a textview an imageview and a button but i am unable to

18344514
google-chrome	firefox
try and put this code in javascript console ctrl + shift + j in google-chrome k in firefox

18344515
bluetooth	usb
plug in your bluetooth dongle and select the device from the usb menu alternatively you can set a device filter in the vm s settings page

18344530
serializable	deserialization
if it s largely an issue of how long it takes to build your object then the serializable deserialization cycle may not necessarily be faster in all cases

18344545
int	double
as a double 0.0 instead of an int 0

18344593
children	parent
like other people have commented a parent knowing about its children is typically a really bad idea

18344637
width	height
you also need to make the anchor a block element to make it the full height width of its container

18344650
post	get
but tumblr erases the data-layout part when i save the post so i get this

18344688
haskell	scheme
however because i am implementing scheme in haskell i do not have access to underlying pointer values that can casted to integers be used in a hash table or search tree structure to track which nodes i have already followed so as to be able to efficiently prune paths that would result in infinite loops

18344726
post	get
i m new to javascript and trying to get a json object to post on my website

18344763
padding	overlapping
i would like to be able to achieve this with a generic css rule that works regardless of what padding values the overlapping span has if that is possible

18344842
post	get
since not all clients support get with body post is allowed as well

18344867
goto	break
another option is to break up the complex statement into multiple statements and skip the second if if the variable is not defined by using goto

18344870
put	get	post	get	post	put
ok supposing you get the to be selected row from post you could put a condition in the while loop that checks the specific post variable

18344874
int	chars
in other words you re not restricted to using primitive types like int long chars etc

18344917
put	get
if you take the 1st bit of code and just put it in a method you will get it complaining about not being final

18344969
charindex	substr
otherwise you need to loop through with charindex and substr to find the position of each backslash and parse out the data in between

18345008
width	height
i m using jcanvas and i need to resize text by width and height

18345008
width	height
actually the library offers an option to scale by x and y but i need to do the same with the width and height properties

18345014
cos	sin
ndsolve deqn equation or list of equations expected instead of true in the first argument 2 3 cos degree x h t x 3+h t x 2 sin degree x h 0 1 t x + h 1 0 t x 0 h 0 x 1 true

18345016
pop-up	dialog
however instead of the enhanced auth dialog a big gray-bordered rectangle with lots of info embedded in the page with no pop-up for an example check out angry birds or some other popular app facebook is generating two pop-up in a row for mine

18345034
for-loop	arrays
it is straight forward to find the max value and index but using a for-loop to do it for multiple arrays i am stumped

18345043
pop-up	dialog
when this dialog is shown there is no soft keyboard visible and only once the user taps on the edittext does the keyboard pop-up

18345043
pop-up	dialog
the dialog still pop-up with the most beautiful edittext but no keyboard until i tap on the edittext

18345072
ubuntu	linux
i am testing opendbx to connect to mssql server for a project on ubuntu linux

18345099
put	get
if you need to actually get every byte as soon as it arrives and can t afford the cost of read 1 you ll need to put the pipe in non-blocking mode and read asynchronously.

18345099
stdout	stderr
most obviously mixing the two streams together means you can t log stdout to file_out and stderr to log_file or copy stdout to your stdout and stderr to your stderr

18345099
stdout	stderr
but it also means the ordering can be non-deterministicâ if the subprocess always writes two lines to stderr before writing anything to stdout you might end up getting a bunch of stdout between those two lines once you mix the streams

18345099
stdout	stderr
and it means they have to share stdout s buffering mode so if you were relying on the fact that linux glibc guarantees stderr to be line-buffered unless the subprocess explicitly changes it that may no longer be true

18345099
stdout	stderr
but even if that doesn t happen you obviously won t be able to read and log the stderr data until something comes in from stdout

18345125
glfw	glew
you need to link some libraries glfw glew opengl23

18345173
udp	tcp
it s lower level than elb it only supports udp tcp not http s

18345188
versioning	upgrade
meanwhile if you cant upgrade to a newer versioning of informix you will have to rely on one or more select into temp table queries in order to achieve your objective which btw would make your coding more portable across different versioning

18345214
min	max
but the examples only show binding the validation parameters to staticresources such as max min values

18345228
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller

my problem is that this xaml only works when i set the width and height of the canvas to anything other than auto

18345314
width	height
but when i set the width and height of canvasmain to auto then no squares are drawn on the background

18345317
post	get
personally i d find it a lot more readable if you kept the logic in the post version of the method as you re performing something slightly different from the get method therefore not really repeating yourself

18345526
portrait	landscape

create uibezierpath that is a circle create a cashapelayer that uses that uibezierpath and then add that layer to your view layer hierarchy

18347534
uiview	cashapelayer
i think that either a coregraphics implementation or this cashapelayer implementation make more sense than png files or uiview objects with rounded corners

18347544

i see that the answer states that i should reference the bitmaps in java and then recycle onpause and set them back up during onresume

18347640
stdout	fflush
you should be able to write your own formatter implementation which extends org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.optional.junit.junitresultformatter so that it fflush to stdout immediately but i ve never done it

18347652
int	chars
keep in mind that the num_at method needs to give you an int from zero through nine inclusive not the chars code itself which is likely to be 0x30 through 0x39

as suggested by this post you can get the calendar time first

18347660

however my coworker who does front end development is unfamiliar with using a javascript framework such as backbone.js more of a library i know ember.js or angular.js

18347801
ember.js	backbone.js
since we re using asp.net i figured that the i could handle authentication and routing using asp.net mvc delivering seperate views depending on the route and he can handle the data manipulation only however i can t seem to figure out how to seperate routing from the javascript framework i ve looked into ember.js and backbone.js and both of them seem to require routing to be handled on their end for it to really work

now there is a third versioning of my app which is an upgrade to either of the two versioning i described above

18348170
versioning	upgrade
now i understand that you should have the same launching activity name on the new versioning of an app if you want things to upgrade correctly keeping the same launcher icon

18348170
versioning	upgrade
so here s the problem i have this third versioning that has the same launching activity name as versioning a so after the upgrade happens the same launcher icon is used which is what i want

18348170
versioning	upgrade
however when i try to upgrade versioning b which uses a different launching activity name from the upgrade it deletes the old launcher icon and puts in a new launcher icon with the updated name

18348170
versioning	upgrade
if versioning b was in a folder to begin with the upgrade would cause that launcher icon to be removed and then the new launcher icon would be added to the drawer rather with the rest of the applications than the folder

18348204
width	height
my own preference there but i think removing the width and height properties should get what you want if i m not mistaken

18348238

18351061

compare with any of the interfaces in swing awt

18351285

children	parent
so for example if you need the children of the parent you will do something like this

18351298
hide	show
problem is that ie10 doesn t do the effect it only hide the current one and show the next one but the delay between clicking the next button and the showing of the next picture equals the duration of the effect on other browsers so it does do something..

18351521
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is by default the google-chrome and firefox pdf viewer do not have that function and i would like allow the user to drag the page

same story for the gdc error â it depends on the gnu mpfr library which was either removed or replaced with an incompatible versioning during an upgrade

18351557
post	get
now fairly early on i always get a many-to-many relationship between entities tags and post in my database and what i ve found is that getting this relationship exposed via mvc framework is surprisingly complicated

18351600
width	height
i have read several similar questions all involving use of width and height attributes either inline or in a class

18351600
width	height
stripping the code down the width and height of the button are not filling the surrounding div

versioning	upgrade
and it may be worth mentioning here that i am unable to upgrade the framework versioning from 2.0 to 3.0 or 3.5

18351740
noexcept	throw
given that the function is also declared to be noexcept it basically means that the corresponding function also can t throw an exception

18351854
superclass	subclassing
the error code means that you try to access subclassing method use superclass instance

18351854
superclass	subclassing
may be the subclassing has the method but the superclass has not the method this is my own idea

18351877
getter	setter
the encapsulation getter and setter offer are laughably thin

18351885
getter	setter
node.attr could be both getter and setter

18351891
queue	fifo
a task which was queue earlier should run earlier fifo

when i execute the code the show hide javascript get neglected and all table rows elements show up.

18351938
onchange	onkeyup
you can do that by adding an onchange event to your text area that updates it s value if you like this to happen while the user is typing you can use the onkeyup event

18351942
getter	setter
this allows you to implements getter and setter but you get a performance hit because of the overhead they create for every property access

18351942
getter	setter
this answer talks about other problems with getter and setter

18351942
getter	setter
getter and setter are ok but.

18351942
getter	setter
just making boilerplate getter and setter is better but is almost as bad as public properties

18351996
button	checkbox
each node may have a child or a parent node and some options like checkbox and radio button

18352012
portrait	landscape
you may try to listen to uideviceorientationdidchangenotification within your subclass cell to rotate the webview and within your view controller with the table view and run a -reloaddata on your table view in order to properly resize the cells assuming the landscape webview is way higher than the portrait webview

18352024
getter	setter
other important features of php 5 to consider are magic getter setter

uilabel	uibutton
i tried use tableview reloaddata but it only reloads uilabel uibutton is not changing the image when i compare them

18352049
getter	setter
a great profit of using a getter and setter is whenever you need to make changes you only have to modify the getter and setter

18352049
getter	setter
but by using getter and setter you could change the code to

18352055
getter	setter
imo using getter and setter is a good practice and increases code readability too

18352078
qmainwindow	qwidget	qmainwindow	qpushbutton	qpushbutton	qwidget
both qmainwindow and qpushbutton derive from qwidget and generally qwidgets can display themselves independently so don t need to be attached to a parent though it s likely you ll want to group and organise the widgets you re presenting to the user

18352078
qmainwindow	qwidget
the qwidget can now be the parent to all other widgets still without you defining a qmainwindow

18352078
qdialog	qwidget
when you re finished you just delete the top level item which may be a qmainwidget or qdialog or other qwidget based object

18352078
qpushbutton	qwidget
eventually you ll likely want to use layouts that allow grouping of widgets in logical arrangements but to start with if you look at the constructor of the qpushbutton you ll see that it takes an optional parameter of qwidget -

18352078
qmainwindow	qpushbutton
therefore create the qmainwindow and then pass its pointer to the qpushbutton

18352087
ember.js	backbone.js
you mention model so i ll say there are a ton of front end mvc libraries such as backbone.js ember.js knockout etc

18352087

18352433
post	get
using flex rpc httpservice i ve tried changing the call headers and this is how i m making the calls get and post

18352484
client-side	server-side
if the client-side or server-side socket.io have no registered handlers for that event then it will not handle it meaning it will return and do anything

18352484
client-side	server-side
but in case that the client sends a non registered event to server you can always use the message event on client-side or server-side for each message received

18352492

18352556
getter	setter
every getter and setter in your code represents a failure to encapsulate and creates unnecessary coupling

18352556
getter	setter
some people like this blog author will argue that having getter and setter is already way too much information about the insides of the class

18352569

18352871
getter	setter
if you don t provide your own implementation of the property s getter and setter or if you simply synthesize them without providing a variable name objective-c will automatically back your property by a variable with a name equal to _ + property name

18352871
getter	setter
use only getter and setter to access your property so use instead of and remove your the variable that you defined yourself

a bit of background - this script is to hide and show divs as a user scrolls down a page

18370813
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
note that the poor name choice for the system environment variables associated with the server s amazon-web-services public and secret key param1 and param2 is due to the fact that the server for the fineuploader.com s3 demo is running on an amazon-web-services ec2 instance created by amazon s elastic beanstalk service

18370823
put	get
however if i put the exact code into a .sh file and call it from bash i get

18370846

on the efficiency side the code is using a bufferedreader and reading into a large -ish character buffer before transferring into a stringbuilder

18370864

18371072
for-loop	loops
move all loops invariants out of the for-loop altogether that is for example is run len times instead of only 1

18371072
for-loop	loops
lastly do not use for-loop with only if loops variable contained within it - move the first if and last if out of loops and modify the for-loop to run from second to second-last to avoid the dreaded for-case paradigm

18371147
listctrl	textctrl
when i ve got is when the button is pressed textctrl will be refreshed every time the strings is inserted but listctrl just freeze until the loop is finished then it will display the correct strings

18371185
min	max
the reason they are not directly on top of one another seems to be how the api tends to pick nice numbers for the max and min values of each axis

google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this works as i expect it to in firefox and ie 10 but not in google-chrome opera or safari which leaves me wondering if this is a bug in some browsers if what i m trying to do is somehow wrong or if i ve run afoul of an inadequately precise part of some specification or other

18371439
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
it becomes apparent that google-chrome opera and safari can t find the target element during document.ready but calling the same code later via console or function attached to a click event does find the elements

18371455
onfocus	onblur
then you can also eliminate those ugly inline onblur and onfocus attributes and their javascript functions

18371455
onfocus	onblur
if you really needed to use onblur and onfocus event handlers you could write them using jquery instead.

18371462

18371631
min	max
the easy way to get the two lines to align is to set the max value of the income-level axis as the income target used for the percentage so it corresponds to 100 and set the min value equal to the min percentage of that income level that you want to show 0 is the easiest to make work generally

18371643
width	height
the reason i m using is so that the width and height properties stays what they re supposed to be what they would be if all elements were showing the fixed positions and sizes

18371643
width	height
in some use cases i can imagine that the width and height haven t been properly set yet so you might run into some funky outcome there

18371643
width	height
you can solve this by setting the width and height for all the elements before this loop individually

18371650

18372332
wmv	ogg	mp4	h.264
a mp4 file can contain a h.264 video stream and or an aac audio stream but for some reason someone decided that a mp4 file that contains video and audio use the file extension m4v v for video and if it is an mp4 file that only contains audio to use the m4a extension that is a common practice in other encapsulators like windows media which use wmv and wma or ogg which use ogv and oga silly as it seems

with spring di component autowired and cdi named inject you can achieve the same as jsf does with managedbean managedproperty but spring di and cdi offers many more advantages around it you can for example write interceptor to pre-process or post-process managed bean creation destroy or a managed bean method call you can create custom scopes producers and consumers you can inject an instance of narrower scope in an instance of broader scope etc

getter	setter
in this example the setter and getter would be nonatomic and be saved with a strong reference

18379369
getter	setter
on the other hand if you define it in curly brackets only the variable will be created no getter and setter

18380157
distance	polygons
now you have 1 distance repeat over each side of the polygons to get the others

isnull	nullif	coalesce	nullif	coalesce	isnull

bash	zsh	debian	linux
of course talking about linux in general is a bit far fetched as many distributions have different tools most of them use a different shell already by default like sh bash csh zsh ksh ... but if you re talking about debian based linux at least i don t know of any distribution which would provide such a tool

18384307

for-loop	loops
you could simply get rid of the inner for-loop in each of these nested loops

18384815
versioning	upgrade
if you need to use a different versioning you d need to first update the versioning used inside pydev itself it wasn t updated so far because the current jython size is too big -- pydev has currently 7.5 mb and just the newer jython jar is 10 mb -- with libs it goes to almost 16 mb so making pydev have 22 mb just for this upgrade is something i m trying to avoid.

qlayout	qwidget	qlayout	qgridlayout	qgridlayout	qwidget
if your qwidget is an in-the-same-window child of its parent then you could add it to the parent s qlayout qboxlayout or qgridlayout with the proper settings to have the layout center it

18386174
qlayout	qwidget	qlayout	qdialog	qdialog	qwidget
if it s a qdialog or some other qwidget that is set to be its own separately-moveable top-level window then the qlayout approach won t work

polynomial math is a subset of mathematics dealing with mathematical expressions constructed from variables and constants using only the operations of addition subtraction multiplication and non-negative integer exponent

google-chrome	firefox

18386539
folder	directory
used for the js and lib folder in the root directory of a magento install commonly

18386539
folder	directory
i suppose you could tree it out to different folder if you d like since the base magento directory is the working directory with this type

18386567
puts	gets
when they press submit i have some code that gets the values they checked and puts them in an array like this

18386572
hide	show
the probably easier other method is to get all the images at once show your button that says load more and hide the other 2 images

18386572
hide	show
and in jquery just hide the othertwo div then on button click show it via jquery

18386590
for-loop	loops
i would nest one of your for loops in a second outer for-loop that loops over the 5 columns

18386590
for-loop	arrays
the value that you add in each for-loop now 1 16 etc. can be calculated with this column index and the column index can be used directly in the the card 2d arrays

18386614
sudo	passwd
sudo normally requires an interactive shell to enter your passwd

18386614
sudo	passwd
if you re sure you know what you re doing and you ve got your security issues covered try allowing the apache user to run sudo without a passwd but only for certain commands

18386614
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
for example adding the following line in your sudoers file will allow apache to run sudo without a passwd only for the gzip command

18386637
min	max
you will just use the aggregate function max or min to select the subject for each date

18386654
melt	reshape
the reshape library pulls in the melt command which recognises the data into a format usable by ggplot

18386733
quicksort	mergesort	quicksort	heapsort	mergesort	heapsort
of the standard o n log n comparison-based sorting algorithms mergesort makes the lowest number of comparisons just about n lg n compared with about 1.44 n lg n for quicksort and about n lg n + 2n for heapsort so it might be a good algorithm to use as a starting point

18386733
quicksort	mergesort	quicksort	heapsort	mergesort	heapsort
typically mergesort is slower than heapsort and quicksort but that s usually under the assumption that comparisons are fast

18386768
folder	directory
i have the folder help in the root directory of website

18386786
setinterval	settimeout
actually you should use setinterval instead of settimeout using this approach if your ajax call fails you will forcelly abort the loop

18386797
post	get
i want to get an image for each of my post from a rails app

18386845
getter	setter
in java the convention is to provide setter and getter to change an object s inner attributes

18386851
portrait	landscape
however you also mention portrait landscape differences so this gets a bit more complicated

18386851
width	height
this last point raises another question - twice the thumbnails height width or both in which case do you crop or scale if the image aspect ratio doesn t match

18386861
disk	ram
also mediaplayer will have higher latency at beginning of playback as it loads from disk while a soundpool stores resources in ram

so that when orientation changes it will trigger a switching statement to detect app s screens orientation portrait upside down landscape left or landscape right and change the app s window frame respectively to create the ios 6 status bar illusion

18387291
min	max
you ll have to do some modification to them to get them into the result set usually with either min or max such as

18387303
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	add	multiplying	addition	addition	multiplication
once you know how to add you can write code to do manual multiplication by multiplying digits and putting the results in the right place and a lot of addition - but software will do all this fairly quickly

18387303
multiplying	multiplication	multiplication	exponent
as for the exponent you can of course multiplying by the same number millions of times but each of those multiplication would be using the previously mentioned function for doing multiplication

18387316
submit	submission
the preventdefault call is important because it stops the submission of the form so you can call your function before the form submit is called at the end

18387322
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
version 2.0 smaller cleaner code works on google-chrome firefox edge opera

18387417
setinterval	settimeout
i get the general principle - you have an async function that uses setinterval settimeout and given the right condition you clear the interval if applicable and run a callback

18387458
getter	setter
so first yes there is a plugin for knockout that uses getter and setter but it only works in newer browsers

18387458
getter	setter
you sacrifice compatability to ie8 this is unavoidable since those browsers do not support javascript getter setter

18387458
getter	setter
as a final note the getter and setter plugin doesn t make the functions disappear it just hides them behind the getter and setter

18387481
post	get
soju post is very helpful for to get category only 1 level subcategory we should just pass the category id that has subcategories

18387525
post	put
when i put a new post it shows up in node url www.example.com node but not when i enter the full domain

18387553

18387830
post	get
i searched for the answer but mostly it s been talked about the difference between the post method and the get method and where to use them

18387900
unsigned	short	int	chars
it s a pure number or any sequence of bits that fits into an unsigned long int space could be used as a very short string a small chars array a small struct - but being careful of endianness and architecture-specific sizes - could represent an opcode for a device s onboard chip or even be dealt with as a float by type puning

18387900
integer	unsigned
... the cmd argument is passed from the user unchanged and the optional arg argument is passed in the form of an unsigned long regardless of whether it was given by the user as an integer or a pointer

18387903
post	get
once i got to 5.2 first form i began to get errors and was using other people s post to solve my questions but this error doesn t seem to happen for anyone else so here it is

18387903
post	get
when i go to my localhost 3000 post new page i get the same error but for postscontroller#new

18387950
children	parent
in such a case where parent child visibility are set by different style rules the display none setting on the parent will hide all the children--even if parent children are styled independently

18387959
mamp	wamp
i have found that the least painless way to do this is to use mamp or wamp or lamp depending on your os but of course i have no idea what your specific situation is so that solution may in fact make things a lot more complicated rather than less

18388000
width	height
this named range in each employee wb is the same width number of columns but can vary in height number of rows and some of the rows may be empty

18388021
put	get	post	get	post	put
the specific steps that are made are related to sending an http request not to the method which is used get post put delete options head

18388021
put	get	post	get	post	put
there are differences between post and get - but those differences are mainly due to conventions let s take rest web-services for example get is used by convention to get a resource while post is used to create a resource and put - to modify an existing one

18388021
post	get
ie can hold only 2048 characters in the url tomcat apache supports up to 4000 characters - so get requests which are made from a browser are limited while post request aren t

18388050
for-loop	arrays
i wrote a for-loop in python which reads through the file creating a dictionary for each arrays and storing elements like thus

18388054
mouseup	mousedown
i originally created a button that changed the src based on mouseup and mousedown to give it the appearance of being depressed when clicked as well as playing a click sound

18388054
mouseup	mousedown
now when i click the button it depresses correctly executing mousedown then on mouseup it correctly plays the click sound and also downloads the pdf file as i want but makes the button image appear to be broken

18388054
google-chrome	safari
then after running mouseup it s broken using google-chrome or disappears or appears garbled in ie and safari but when i inspect the source the src attribute looks to be identical so i m not sure why it s returning a broken image if the src is the same as it was before

18388067
children	parent
it keeps the main order of first the parent then its children

18388067
children	parent
it only applies the sorting to the children of the same parent

18388118
getter	setter
api to get the active document getactive and use the getter and setter on the text property to modify the document in place without saving it

18388141
mouse	keyboard
and as you ve observed it differs depending on whether you use the mouse within the datarepeater or to from another control on the form or using the keyboard

18388172

18388240
min	max
just be aware that if your min and max are on the same order of magnitude as each other then likely you re on a system with 4mb pages and if your min and max differ by an order of magnitude or more the difference may not be entirely attributable to tlb miss and page fault exceptions

18388350
serializable	deserialization
the difference is the requiredattribute is used solely for model validation where as the isrequired property of the datamemberattribute is a hint to the serializable that says upon serializable or deserialization this property should always be present

18389010
folder	directory
copy the bs4 directory to your pythonscript scripts folder

18389011
put	get
for a static cache that supports a get put api there should be at least synchronization around the get and getifabsentput type operations for safe access to the cache

used debugging diag to profiling for unmanaged memory leaks and of the 500 mb used by the iis worker process debugging diag indicates that the c library has about 43 mb of unreleased memory which it thinks is a leak but does not explain where the rest are being used

18391002
floating-point	fixed-point
on the other hand it s generally easier for a language to support one to three floating-point formats than to support the many fixed-point formats that would otherwise be necessary

18391002
floating-point	fixed-point
perhaps compiler technology has advanced to enough that using a wide variety of fixed-point types might be practical but hardware floating-point technology has advanced enough to largely obviate the need for such a thing

18391069
free	malloc
it s not a leak as a leak is an unbounded increase in memory usage. you might want to benchmark exactly how much time is lost on malloc and free compared to other things the function is doing

if you re doing it without a cgrect you can use floor floorf and ceil ceilf using the f variant if you re using cgfloats

18391730
width	height
as you don t know the rendered width and height of the text though you can t compensate for the position of the top left corner to make the text centered

18391730
width	height
you ll struggle here but once you can find out the rendered width and height of the text you can calculate the correct position using this and the width height of the image

18391738
children	parent
this eliminates the error and also prevents children hosts from being deleted when the parent asset is deleted

18391760
super	extends	super	implements	implements	extends
you are adding field in currentclass your public class com.mysql.jdbc.serverpreparedstatement extends com.mysql.jdbc.preparedstatement not directly implements java.sql.preparedstatement but your are override method com.mysql.jdbc.preparedstatement.executequery from javadoc ctclass.getmethod - the returned method may be declared in a super class

it might be possible to do what you re asking by dynamically loading the library using dlopen accessing the symbol for the function as a function pointer using dlsym and then invoking it via the function pointer

18391825
dlsym	dlopen
the man page for dlopen and dlsym should provide some more insight

18391945

18391968
public	protected
i recommend that you think of the instance variables in the base class as being contained in any superclass as well just as any public or protected method in the base class is accessible from the superclass

18391968
superclass	subclassing
so the instance variable in the base class can be thought of as being part of a block of memory that contains all the instance variables for the object whether they are declared in the subclassing or the superclass

width	height
when iterating over an array you always want to put your for loops in row-major order in this case outer loop for height then inner loop for width so that index calculations are much easier

button	checkbox
this isn t special behavior for bootstrap button this is how all checkbox radios work

getter	setter
i figured the class could not be made thread-safe since even if you synchronize both methods you could have a situation that thread1 would invoke the setter and before thread1 could invoke the getter thread2 might execute and invoke the setter so that when thread1 went and retrieved the result it would get the wrong info

18393331
getter	setter
when you make those two synchronized the getter and setter themselves are thread-safe

18393331
getter	setter
however making the getter and setter themselves thread-safe does not mean that the application as a whole whatever is using this class is thread-safe

18393331
getter	setter
if your thread wants to call a setter then get the same value upon invoking the getter that involves synchronization on a different level

18393355

i figured the class could not be made thread-safe since even if you synchronize both methods you could have a situation that thread1 would invoke the setter and before thread1 could invoke the getter thread2 might execute and invoke the setter so that when thread1 went and retrieved the result it would get the wrong info

so if the class with the getter and setter is like so

128bit	64bit
so it looks like the simd implementations give a 2x or more improvement over 64bit scalar code although 256 bit simd doesn t seem to give any improvement over 128bit simd and that typical throughput should be a lot faster than 5 gb s

i handled it with both keydown and keypress because the charcode property isn t the same on every browser mainly google-chrome and opera didn t check in safari

18404412
google-chrome	firefox
it seems that when i press a keyboard button first the keyboard event is handled with the old textareaobj.value value then the new value is computed so if i output console.log textarea.value.length it shows the old value but in firefox and google-chrome firebug and developer tools the value displayed is the new value.length the true value of textarea.value.length

18404412
google-chrome	firefox
the output was the old value but firebug or firefox web console or google-chrome console is showing the actual value of the length property

18404513
post	get
the only thing i would say is that you might not need to do another get after your post of changed data

18404513
post	get
unless this is some type of shared data model across many users and sessions if the client makes an update and the post goes through the client holds the correct set of data so the additional get isn t necessary

18404543
webkit	gecko
the upshot is that in some cases webkit ends up recomputing style on a lot more elements than gecko does as far as i can tell but in others it ends up recomputing style on many fewer elements

18404543
webkit	gecko
for example given a selector like .foo span and a div that changes class from foo to bar gecko will restyle all later siblings of the div while webkit will not do any work at all if there are no span kids since it would never have marked the parent as being affected by the + in that case

18404543
webkit	gecko
somehow webkit seems to do better than gecko on the html5 single-page spec scripts and i can t figure out why at this point

18404551

it is called karen s directory printer your favorite search engine will find it and once you figure out which options to include exclude it will print out just the folder names with the children folder names under the appropriate parent folder name

you could thus a common-denominator to identify the classes that need to be taken into account in the generation they all implements the same marker interface or extends the same base class and generate one table form for each and either

18407531
put	get
i was trying to get the persistence.xml to not be put into the simulator jar which is maybe not the best solution but we aren t redistributing the simulator as it is only for internal use where we have access to the build s classes output directory with the 2nd copy of persistence.xml

serializable	deserialization
jackson can work independently of jersey so you would want to use jackson for any type of json serializable deserialization

18408036
int	double
however you might even want to simplify that to since most likely both coordinates should be of the same type double int etc. - mixing types seems quite odd to me

18408361
getter	setter
under normal circumstances a plain getter and plain setter examples 1 and 3 in the question will be stepped over if these filters are enabled

18408361
getter	setter
if a special class loader such as jrebel which modifies methods to hook into them is installed and in use it seems to interfere with eclipse s algorithms which determine if a method is a simple getter or simple setter

18408361
getter	setter
by using jrebel the magic that it does confused eclipse making simple getter and simple setter look more complicated than they originally are

18408363

18408568
width	height
that create a blank plot with the default width and height

18408576
bitblt	gdi
so the full story is we were using the windows gdi floodfill function which we noticed doesnt work on printers so what i found on the inet was to create a memory dc compatible with the printer dc and make all my drawing operations on the memory dc and then bitblt it all at once to the printer dc i had to change to use a recursive color replacment flood fill function too since the memory dc only allows what the main dc did

18408576
stretchblt	bitblt
the problem is the memory dc seems to be a pixel or two bigger on the x and y but i dont know what to do when i get the selected bitmap from the memory dc it shows it to be the correct size i would like to use stretchblt but the values i have access to use as params for stretchblt make it no different than calling bitblt

18408578
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
you could extend the use of inotifypropertychanged and inotifycollectionchanged back into your model layer

18408582

i m assuming this is how jackson works for serializable deserialization in general but i really don t know

18408604

if you are declaring some sort of indicator variable it would generally make sense to use a boolean data type rather than an int

18408620
width	height
that will give you an object with width and height properties

18408653
awt	swing
now i know i should have thought of developing this in a cross platform environment before production but disregarding that my main problem now is emulating this application in java using swing and awt gui objects

18408654
filtering	grouping
based on the way one of the tables is loaded the 1 064 is misleading as while the records returned are 1 064 the records have been divided by grouping so the most you would see is is something like 266 so showing 1 to 100 of 145 entries filtering from 266 total entries

18408654
filtering	grouping
the reason why all 1 064 are needed and not just the one grouping is you can switch between grouping and it does this by filtering on the grouping number column

18408654
filtering	grouping
the problem is the code that does that is also used for another table that loads the same records but has the ability to view all the grouping through some regexp filtering

18408655
int	double
i would also make sure that your weight and height properties are double s as well so you don t get zeros from int division

18408687
width	height
in the case of control properties such as height or width this indicates the uninitialized or auto

18408697
google-chrome	safari
application breaks in internet explorer-have not tried in google-chrome or safari

18408825
for-loop	arrays
simple use a for-loop and arrays

18408835
hide	show
what s going on is that your code is calling on an alternating basis your own internal hide and show functions

18408835
hide	show
the .toggle hide show call takes care of that for you

18408835
hide	show
however inside of your hide and show functions you re not actually hiding or showing anything

18408835
hide	show
what you re doing is adding or removing a class which may or may not hide or show something

i would also suggest you to use enhanced for-loop instead of the traditional loops like this

18408883
super	extends
when you want to create a class that is generally similar to the super class the class being extended you extends it and customize it

18408896
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
google-chrome safari nor firefox provide any debugging for websocket connections so i have no idea what the problem is

18408932
gridview	rowdatabound
i have a gridview that works just fine with each of my row commands however once it is sorted it causes the rowdatabound event to use incorrect values rather than the actual values in the row after it has been sorted

18409003
implements	extends
in cases like that it may be better to implements an interface than to extends a common class

18409031

18409951
folder	directory
this looks like it should be targeting the virtual directory which then goes into assetsserver s image folder logos my-logo.png

18409951

here is code to change show hide animation of jquery dialog box

18421253
apache	nginx
instead use #send_file with a web server like apache or nginx that supports x-sendfile

18421321
hide	show
if i ve got this correct no - not without restructuring your html or adding javascript - as the parent div is not show then that will automatically hide any child content no matter what you try

18421351
margin	height
in theory i just need to add x amount of pixels to the margin where x is the height of the banners

uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
my guess is that the super implementation of this method forwards this callback down to child view controllers especially in the case of standard container classes like uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller

18421569
post	get
you should post the snippet and the results that you get vs

18421587

i know it will work properly when image width height will be equal but i don t want to do this because images will be coming dynamically same width different height

18421675
int	chars
the reader already detected that it is on the int | float | chars | bool part and now it needs to check if the declaration and initialization is syntactically valid

18421675
int	boolean	int	chars
update made it a general regex that is applicable to int float chars and boolean values

18421700
getter	setter
i thought it would be neat to override the setter and getter so i wouldn t have to provide code to convert them every time i needed access

18421700
getter	setter
i have verified that my custom setter and getter seem to work fine

18421707

18421839
width	height
the theme is a responsive theme and works well with the range of image height and scaling to the desired image width in the page

18421848
getter	setter
i think the best way to do that it to name your custom getter setter differently than your model attribute

18421915

when rotating from landscape to portrait i d like one content pane to slide below the other currently it blows off the screen and both to stick to the edges of the container view

18422065
width	height
where i really struggled was using height and width constraints

18422065
width	height
i finally gave in and got rid off all height width constraints and used only leading trailing top bottom

18422134
equals	tostring
i have written required converter class implemented tostring and equals methods as i think quite correct

18422147
int	double	atoi	atof
i m ducking the discussion of whether atof or atoi as originally mentioned in the question title but not mentioned again in the body of the question is a good way to convert a c string into a double or int

18422153
post	put
you can always put a check for post variables like below

18422168
hash-collision	key
int32 as a key will have zero hash-collision but that does not guarantee zero hash bucket collisions

18422168
hash-collision	key
be careful of key that produce hash-collision

18422168
hash-collision	key
kvp and tuple can create a lot of hash-collision and are not good candidates for key

is wrong because col1 is not listed in the group by clause and this query won t work on all databases oracle postgresql ms-sql etc. - except mysql why - i ll tell about it later

18422243
children	parent
from the innermost to the outermost because masonry changes children elements height leaving gaps in the parent container

18422246
portrait	landscape
when you animate from landscape to portrait just set it s constant value to the negative width of contentviewone

18422246
portrait	landscape
you ll obviously also have to set it back to 0 when rotating from portrait to landscape

18422248
stdout	stderr
if you want to have both stderr and stdout in real time you ll have to do something more complex with select

18422311
google-chrome	firefox
i ve found that in the google-chrome and firefox mobile browsers an h1 over a certain length increases the font size of all statically-positioned text on the page but not absolutely-positioned text

18422311
google-chrome	firefox
for example on a nexus 4 using google-chrome or firefox the h1 text and statically-positioned div text from the following code renders too large while the absolutely-positioned div text renders in normal size

18422312
width	height
for example if both the content and the imageview are squares width height this is just fine

18422331

18422529
put	get
to get the new behaviour put

18422557
pop-up	dialog
i am still new to how chrome extensions work and i found out that its not possible to have file input in the pop-up dialog due to the fact that the moment i take the focus off pop-up the pop-up window will close

18422665
onmouseover	mouseenter
pinocchio i would suggest you to create some sort of preview droppable design before you drop a new onmouseover mouseenter preview i bielive that would help you in envolve your algoritmn

18422665
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseup	mouseleave	mouseup	mouseenter
i would also abandon using getfrompoint for cross-browsing support instead i would use jquery mouseenter mouseleave to assign the hovering element of the time for mouseup dropping

18422670
int	chars
in c a type is int not chars

18422683
onfocus	onblur
so solution is to use onblur and onfocus events to determine if tab is inactive or not

18422684
imagemagick	wand
the documentation for wand describes it as a python binding for the imagemagick api

18422698
width	height
i m looking to make my background image fit all browser resolutions width the height must remain the height it is on the image

18422749
width	height
a stackpanel unless set to a specific height or width if its orientation is set to horizontal does not constrain the height of its children but is sized according to them

18422857
versioning	upgrade
i cannot upgrade as this is a corporate environment where software installs are controlled centrally and they are sticking with the current rtc versioning 3

18422879
put	get
please store the phone number in a variable and use the variable to put and to get so it will be works - because it is the same object at the same memory place with the same hashcode and the equals true

18422882
width	height
as you can see i just set the side of the squares to half the min between width and height of the container

18422897
post	get
so you need to do 2 things post the file to the server to get its link and then get the file from the server using the link

18422898

full width and constant height

18422902
std	ostream
contruction occurs an instance of is created from std cout std ostream

18422902

hide	show
i m looking to simply hide and image before the page loads and then once the page has loaded to show the image

18422933
int	chars
in c chars constants such as a are of type int

18422933
int	chars
it s guaranteed to be int but if the language were changed to make it chars most existing code would continue to work properly

18422933
int	chars
does the same thing with a which is of type chars being promoted to int

18422933
int	chars
expressions of type chars are usually but not always implicitly promoted to int

18422933
int	chars
when stroustrup designed c++ he changed the type of chars constants for consistency it s admittedly a bit surprising that a is of type int and to enable more consistent overloading which c doesn t support

18422933
int	chars
for example if c++ chars constants were of type int then this

18422933
int	chars
in c++ it s of type chars but without the cast it would be implicitly converted to int anyway

18422933
int	chars
as pascal cuoq reminds me in comments if plain chars is unsigned and as wide as int then an expression of type chars will be promoted to unsigned int not to int

18423003
stdout	stderr
these are denoted stdin stdout and stderr as usual

18423003
stdout	stderr
subprocess.stdout for stderr only tell python to use the same descriptor as for stdout

18423003
stdout	stderr
python just needs to spin off the subprocess connecting its stdin stdout and or stderr to the provided file descriptors

18423003
stdout	stderr
suppose you want to supply some stdin but let stdout and stderr go un-redirected or go to a file descriptor

18423003
stdout	stderr
suppose you want to capture stdout but leave stdin and stderr alone

18423003
stdout	stderr
if you want to capture only stderr it works the same as with stdout

18423003
stdout	stderr
suppose you want to capture stdout and also capture stderr but on the same pipe as stdout

18423003
stdout	stderr
well it has to do this so it s not really cheating it starts the subprocess with both its stdout and its stderr directed into the single pipe-descriptor that feeds back to its parent python process

18423003
stdout	stderr
when they can t only a thread not the whole process has to sleepâ or in the case of select poll the python process waits simultaneously for can write or data available writes to the process s stdin only when there is room and reads its stdout and or stderr only when data are ready

18423003
stdout	stderr
the proc.communicate code actually _communicate where the hairy cases are handled returns once all stdin data if any have been sent and all stdout and or stderr data have been accumulated

18423003
stdout	stderr
if you want to read both stdout and stderr on two different pipes regardless of any stdin redirection you will need to avoid deadlock too

18423003
stdout	stderr
the deadlock scenario here is differentâ it occurs when the subprocess writes something long to stderr while you re pulling data from stdout or vice versaâ but it s still there

18423009
websocket	pusher
you can use a websocket service like pusher

18423013
xmltype	clob
i have used these functions for 100mb of data without problems but i have written the returned xmltype out to files after converting to clob using either utl_file for server side or in client apps in java c#

my problem is that both the folder and the txt file wont create themselves in the directory i specify here is the code for the folder

18423044
versioning	upgrade
i wanted to upgrade ruby versioning

18423044
versioning	upgrade
the thing is it then seemed to force upgrade on all of the other versioning as well where i no longer could use commands like rvm use 1.8 or rvm use 1.9 without having to upgrade those to the latest -pxxx versioning

18423057
width	height
i believe that if the width and height of your view is a multiple of gridsize and you use nsrectfill the artifacts should go away

18423057
width	height
third there s the obvious question as to how you want your board drawn if the view s width and height are not a multiple of gridsize

18423057
width	height
if it is not however you first have to clarify how you want the possible remainder of the width or height handled

18423084
width	height
the width and height properties for text drawings are read-only so you can t change them yourself

18423104
rspec	capybara
i m using rspec factory_girl_rails selenium and capybara gem

18423175

post	put
this functionality is present for post requests after version 2.2 and also for put requests after version 2.3

18423191
stdout	stderr
the output you are looking for is either coming from stdout or stderr

18423191
stdout	stderr
just change stdout to stderr below.

18423198
put	get
in a rdb eg. when i insert relation d-- b i would have to programmatically search for a duplicate object b in the 2nd table or look for a fail code when trying to insert an identical object into it and then get the b s foreign key to put along with d

18423280
int	chars
console.read return an int that represent a chars so using if the user inputs 1 you may have a different value in your length variable

18423288
qtableview	qabstracttablemodel
when one decides to use a qtableview with it s own model deriving from qabstracttablemodel as backend one can speed things up allot

free	realloc
you can ask for some memory at first and when you run out you are going to have to keep track of how many free spaces you have ask for more memory realloc and keep doing that until you are finished

18423426
for-loop	loops
your problem can easily be solved by simply moving the variable into the for-loop which causes it to be initialized with the value branches on each iteration of loops

i am using a background image that i want to cover the user s screen width and height that way the 2nd section isn t shown if a user has a larger screen

18423532
width	height
how do i display a background image that only appears in part1 and covers the entire width and height of the user s screen regarldess of how small or big it is

18423572
width	height
set the background size and set the div to have full height and width

18423602
getter	setter
a big mistake around domain driven design is to create data classes that represent the data of a domain entity such as customer and provide only public getter and setter for the customer attributes

18423608
scatter	graphing
when i record my macro i simply select x f x and the twenty values below for each column select scatter plot and it outputs the graphing i want with f acting as a function of x

18423608
scatter	graphing
when i go to run the macro it always outputs a scatter plot but instead of graphing f x as a function of x it justs plots both sets of numbers as independent series

18423612
mp3	ogg
is there some way to change mod_autoindex so that whenever a file of image types jpg png etc. or audio mp3 ogg it either opens one of those little embedded windows and shows the image or uses a flash or html5 based audio player to play the file

18423623
width	margin
give it a specific width and do margin 0 auto

18423629
width	height
both of the sides move toward it but in this case never reach it since the width 100 is greater than the height 30

18423633
hide	show
after the loop you hide or show the link depending on the boolean parameter

18423634
fadein	fadeout
i have tried using fadein and fadeout but i do not want the image to fade out show white background then fade the new image in

18423680
put	get
put links to original site into the pdf and get profit of this

18423687
width	height
if this causes some unwanted html wrapping effects from the image getting hidden you could also put the a.woocommerce-main-image zoom element in a wrapper div with a set height and width

18423695
width	height
the top of the frame is red the sides are green blue but there s no bottom and the size of the picture in the frame is width 40 height zero ie the line along the bottom edge of the red bit

int	chars
according to the standard iso c99 the type of a literal chars in c is int

18423822
free	malloc
anyway the c++ class doesnâ t use new delete malloc free so it should be fine

18423823
width	height
i figured i d make a height and width column for my data using plyr and ddply but am experiencing odd results

18423823
width	height
here s how i tried setting a height width column

18423823
width	height
following that observation i re-sorted my data as though i d collected data for each unique x while holding y constant instead of the other way around and then re-defined my height and width columns

18423825
width	height
if you want to disregard proportion and just have it fill the parent you can put both height 100 and width 100

18423835
subtract	add
the idea is that when you compute a quantity by adding over a window and move the window one pixel to the right you don t need to add all the items in the new window you only need to subtract the leftmost column from the total and add the new rightmost column

18423861
hide	show
good but when i open the edit form and rejected is selected the reason is still in hide and decision in show

18423902

i changed that to a private variable exposed by a getter setter and all is working perfectly now

18425903

google-chrome	firefox
its working absolutely fine in ie8 and google-chrome as well as firefox

18426109
super	abstract
the reason you can t introduce broader behaviour is that if the method from the abstract type super class or interface doesn t throw an exception and you refer to your object as that type you d get unexpected behaviour

18426127
textblob	nltk
i m using the textblob wrapper around nltk because it s a lot easier

for the statement we are typecasting a chars to an int

18426390
int	chars
and that int is 32 bits then the chars value 0xaa gets widened with sign extension so 0xaa becomes 0xffffffaa which is equivalent to -86 in decimal

18426394
int	chars
line 3 assign value of chars a by typecasting to from chars to int

18426394
int	chars
line 4 outputs the value of chars a in int format

18426411
getter	setter	superclass	subclassing
note that although your specific problem is rather unusual you have a getter and setter that are manipulating shared external state namely system.out but do not have any corresponding shared locks to prevent interference it is actually always a bad idea to call a method from a constructor unless the method is private or final or static or the class is final because a superclass constructor is called before a subclassing instance is fully created so if the constructor calls a method that s overridden in a subclassing the subclassing method will receive an incomplete this object and might misbehave terribly

18426512
mp3	wav
but the browser can not play that i have no problem with wav file but for mp3 it does not work

18426543
for-loop	loops
inside that loops is another for-loop who s number of operations isn t immediately as obvious

quicksort	mergesort
mergesort sorts array a quicksort sorts array b

18427266
terminate	timeout
take the advantage of thread.join int method which takes millisecond timeout and returns true when thread is terminate or false when timeout

18427291
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort is more sensitive to input sortedness in a positive way than mergesort

18427295

getter	setter
the names of the getter and setter methods are derived from the field name

18427885
client-side	server-side
i also think you should choose between showing the modal by php server-side or by javascript client-side as what you re doing now is becoming very confuse even more for a novice

18427885
hide	show
if you choose to show or hide the modal by php it would be something like

jquery does not have any function to consistently detect the correctly width and height of the viewport 1 when there is a scroll bar present

18438403
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
my answer will probably not help resizing a iframe to 100 viewport width with a margin on each side but i hope it will provide solace for webdevelopers frustrated with browser incoherence of javascript viewport width and height calculation

18438403
width	height
in those browsers you can try to use window.innerwidth and window.innerheight to get the correct width and height but i would advice against this method because it would rely on user agent sniffing

18438403

usually the different browsers are inconsistent about whether or not they include the scrollbar as part of the window width and height

this is just one reason one instance why you should implement equals to be consistent with compareto

18448673
width	height	mousemove	mousedown
what is supposed to happen is when you click down the top and left of the selection div is set to the offsetx and offsety of the mousedown event then the mousemove event s offsetx and offsety are used to determine what to set the div s height and width css properties to with jquery

18448673
width	height
when you let the mouse up over the document s div it should change the border to green and report the x y width height to the coordinates span

18448673
width	height
what is happening is that while you move your mouse around the width and height seem to be changing to a smaller height and width and sometimes when you let the mouse up the height and width are set incorrectly

18448721
min	max
and this holds true for all other aggregate functions as well min max count etc

18449211
hide	show
show div b on element a focus and hide element b on element b blur

18449255
puts	gets
beware of ms s std c library s puts and gets and fwrite and so on which if opened in text translated mode will convert any 0x0d to a 0x0a 0x0d sequence on write and vice verse on read regardless of whether you re reading or writing a single byte or a wide character or a stream of random binary data -- it doesn t care and all of these functions boil down to doing blind byte-conversions in text translated mode

18449279

hide	show
i have a toggle switch from this website css toggle on one of my pages and i m trying to make it hide and show a select2 box like a toggle

18449668
integer	unsigned
in addition to the other issues mentioned having unsigned math wrap makes the unsigned integer types behave as abstract algebraic groups meaning that among other things for any pair of values x and y there will exist some other value z such that x+z will if properly cast equal y and y-z will if properly cast equal x

18449668
integer	unsigned
if unsigned values were merely storage-location types and not intermediate-expression types if there were no unsigned equivalent of the largest integer type and arithmetic operations on unsigned types behaved as though they were first converted them to larger signed types then there wouldn t be as much need for defined wrapping behavior but it s difficult to do calculations in a type which doesn t have an additive inverse

18449702
r-tree	quadtree
instead of r-tree or a quadtree i.e spatial index you can also use a quadkey and a monster curve

18449706
factors	matrix
it is true that s the matrix calculation used has ultimately a similar limitation but it does not matter the points movement is the limiting factors if you look at the individual point

18449706
factors	matrix
again not the matrix although certainly if the vector move could do this the matrix would be a limiting factors

multiplying	subtraction	multiplying	add	multiplying	division	subtraction	add	division	subtraction
from elementary school we learned how to count then we learned how to add which is just a short cut for counting then we learned to multiplying which is just a short cut for adding likewise subtraction and division are shortcuts for counting down rather than counting up

18450999
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition
we also learned to do all of our math one column at a time so if you have a processor that can do at least 1 bit math operations you can do addition subtraction multiplication and division as wide as many bits per operand as you desire it may take a lot of operations but it is quite doable and anyone that made it through grade school has the tool box skill set to do such a thing

18450999
multiplication	exponent
multiplication is even easier as you dont have to line up the decimal points you just do the math on the significant digits and simply add the exponent

18450999
multiplying	division
likewise for division that is why you dont see divide on a lot of instruction sets and dont see multiplying on some of the ones that dont have divide it is a cost trade off performance vs power and chip real estate yield etc

18450999
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	addition	addition	multiplication
then floating point is just an extension of that at the core of a floating point operation you still have the fixed point operations a floating point multiplying requires a fixed point multiplication and an addition and some adjustment

i have a ubuntu linux server and want to use phpmyadmin on it

18452746
matlab	simulink
that said considering that there are elements in simulink such as stateflow charts and matlab function blocks that generate and build code under the hood during simulation it s at least hypothetically possible that you might be able to use some of the concepts described above to access the values in your header file from one of those elements during simulation

18452846
width	height
2nd parameter is width x height

18452875
bash	zsh

18452952
google-chrome	firefox
i used the solution supplied in the solution supplied by arun p johny which worked perfectly in firefox and google-chrome

18452965
google-chrome	firefox
as for the difference between google-chrome and firefox it could be any number of things but one possibility that jumps to mind is the performance of typedarrays

18452965
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome have different performance characteristics regarding typedarray construction use which could be causing some of the performance difference you are seeing if you use them heavily which is sounds like you are

18452965
google-chrome	firefox
this is trickier to work around and you should file a google-chrome bug describing the situation and where it s slower than firefox but you could potentially reduce the amount of buffer uploads by looking into instancing or using uniform arrays instead of updating vertexes for positions textures

18452996

18453261
hash	salt
prepend the salt to the given password and hash it using the same hash function

18453310
try-catch	exception-handling
if i resolve the compile error by surrounding with try-catch then each unit test will be working with an uninitialized instance if the exception-handling was thrown

18453318
hash	salt
looks like the salt hash and interation number are stored in the same string and are separated into three strings in an array at the beginning of the function

18453393

sometimes the form is submitted with put request automatically and this- request- is post will return false

18453449
hash	salt
then you do f s x to get your hash this way if i know the hash but don t know the salt i d have to work out how you salt it first if i did know the salt i d have to know how you applied it and so forth

18453449
hash	salt
so suppose you did the simple salt above to passwords so the common password becomes pkakskskwkokrkd and i have my rainbow table a list of inputs and their hash values i probably wont have the salt form in that table but suppose i know the hash and that you put ks between letters i d have to re-create my rainbow table using words but with ks in them and that d take a lot of memory a lot of time...

18453449
hash	salt
to salt it you can hash it several times you can put a k between it as long as it is deterministic the same for a given input

18453449
hash	salt	put	get
if the bank has a salt hash of my pin number they don t break it to get my pin number to compare the number i entered with them they salt and hash the pin number i just put in and compare the value with the result in the database if the hash are the same the pins entered are the same

18453707
hide	show
it s easier to keep the para hidden and only show and hide according to your need for example

18453707
hide	show
to show hide you can use

18453759
min	max	range	max	range	min
in order to create an image out of this you would need to iterate over every pixel and evaluate f x y while finding the min and max value then scale the whole image to have a range between 0 and 1

18453789
put	get
i put together a function that will get all the thumbs and bigs

if you don t need floating-point math for anything else you may compute an approximate fractions base-2 log pretty easily

18454028
put	get
also in your case the the get put functions will be a bit different maybe something like this

18454029
daemons	launchd
launchd doesn t expect that it expects to be running the daemons directly so that it can monitor it and restart it if necessary

18454029
daemons	launchd
here s the typical sequence when you tell launchd to run a starter script rather than the actual daemons

18454029
daemons	launchd
skip the starter script and have launchd run the actual daemons directly

18454029
daemons	launchd
this is the better way to do it because you get launchd s ability to monitor restart stop etc the daemons

18454058
instances	transient
exception in thread application org.hibernate.transientobjectexception object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing

18454067
min	max
what is the best way to get min max values for corresponding index elements

18454067
min	max
the only functions i could find in the documentation are min max functions that return min max within the series while .apply function doesn t take the index argument

18454071
capistrano	bundler
confirmed i m bypassing capistrano and it s a problem with bundler

18454075

index of min max

18454184
width	height
you need to provide a width height to your cells

18454244
for-loop	arrays
this happens because ds1 is already initialized for the for-loop the new elements are not added to this arrays stream and so are ignored

18454249
arbor.js	cytoscape.js
i have run this with the exact options that cytoscape.js reccomends by default and any options that aren t specified should be using the arbor.js defaults

18454265
post	get
so i know that people talk about double buffering on different post but whenever i try it i get a black screen

18454291
for-loop	loops
i thought this would get the amount of separate words from msg.length and then iterate through the for-loop and add a word plus a space to the newmsg string each loops

18454305
for-loop	arrays
if you use a for-loop your arrays needs to stay an arrays

18454340
width	height
using table-layout to fix the width of cells and small padding in selected to prevent increasing height

18454350

18454616
ready	each
so that i can get each form to validate independently i assigned a variable i to it s id and then added 1 to i at the end of the form ready to be used as the id for the next form

18454633
int	boolean
however in python boolean values are represented as the int 0 for false and 1 for true

18454652
for-loop	loops
according to adobe a reverse for-loop is the fastest way to do a loops

18454652
for-loop	loops
i could not create a test where a reverse for-loop was consistently faster than a normal loops but i m assuming adobe knows flash

18454693
ubuntu	linux
i m using the linux ubuntu openjdk development kit jdk

18454706
google-chrome	firefox
i say window because it also forces ie to open in a window not a tab google-chrome uses a tab firefox works like ie

18454774
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly well on firefox and even explorer but in google-chrome it is extremely slow at least on my computer i can t see the animation

18454792
post	get
in the snippet above replace the get with post

18454797
setinterval	settimeout
use settimeout to properly synchronise when the setinterval timeout should execute

18454835

cv vec4i start_index end_index farthest_pt_index fixpt_depth where indices are 0-based indices in the original contour of the convexity defect beginning end and the farthest point and fixpt_depth is fixed-point approximation with 8 fractions bits of the distance between the farthest contour point and the hull

18454838
hlsl	glsl
as pointed out in the comments the approach i originally posted was working but incorrect here s one by aras pranckeviä ius note that the source code in the post itself contains a typo and is hlsl this is a glsl port with the typo corrected

18454867
google-chrome	firefox
because of differ in image resizing algorithms btw on my machine image center is moved in firefox but not in google-chrome - try to use an image of exact size you use in column 258x181px - in that case it wouldn t be resized by a browser and an effect of moving will dissappear

18454872
free	malloc
count the number of trips to the heap both new malloc and delete free

18454886
for-loop	arrays
which results in looping through every element in the arrays in reverse without a third for-loop argument

18454904
youtube	vimeo	src	attr
i tried adding to the urls on the src attr of the vimeo and youtube iframes

18454938

overlapping fadeout and fadein with css for absolute positioning.

18454971
affinity	processors
in other words the application will only run on single core systems or the application takes special measures through processors affinity to ensure that every thread which shares the data is bound to the same core

18454981
quicksort	heapsort
i think the issue here is that your analysis of quicksort and heapsort is not precise enough to show why the constant factors would be different

18454981
quicksort	heapsort
you can indeed show that on average quicksort will do more comparisons than heapsort roughly 1.44 n log 2 n for quicksort versus n log 2 n versus heapsort

18454981
quicksort	heapsort
however comparisons are not the only determining factor in the runtime of heapsort and quicksort

18454981
quicksort	heapsort
therefore the array accesses in quicksort on average take much less time than the array accesses in heapsort

18454981
quicksort	heapsort
the difference is large enough that the constant factor in front of the n log n term in quicksort is lower than the constant factor in front of the n log n term in heapsort which is one reason why quicksort is much faster than heapsort

18454981
quicksort	heapsort
in short - if all we care about are comparisons heapsort is a better choice than quicksort

18454989
awt	swing
java.awt.secondaryloop is an interface to achieve better control of the execution flow in swing and awt programs

18455004
glut	sdl
judging by the discussion in the comments you are not only moving from sdl to glut but also from os x to win32

18455006
awt	swing
swing programs should override paintcomponent instead of overriding paint . â painting in awt and swing the paint methods

18455020
getter	setter
edit to be more clear it shouldn t matter if the keys are implemented as property s or manual getter setter

18455045
width	height
set a new value for the view s width and height constraint constant values and then use myview layoutifneeded inside animatewithduration

18455045
width	height
if the view doesn t have height and width constraints but has constants to the top and bottom and or left and right edges of the superview change those values instead

18455054
getter	setter
make it private and expose getter and setter

18455079
post	get
i m having an issue in my mvc application for making basic crud changes to a database where the object parameter getting passed to my delete post method has blank parameters even though the object returned by the get method is correct

18455110

18455138
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox and google-chrome in ie9 i get the error

18455150
folder	directory
oh it created a log directory here put some dlls here and made an annoying temp folder in my user directory. then i would commit the changes i liked to the repo with a comment and anytime i wondered why some oddly named folder is somewhere i could just check the svn log

18455171
folder	directory
in your case there s no need to download the maven binars because it comes with sts just find the maven folder inside the sts directory

18455182
screens	tablet
if user resizes screens using it on a tablet of phone the left div does not overlap it simply moves on top or something like that

18455201
integer	fractions	floating-point	integer	floating-point	fractions
integer arithmetic usually truncates fractions but floating-point rounds them unless requested otherwise

18455201
floating-point	fixed-point
a fixed-point format has a small range but a floating-point format has a large range

18455201
floating-point	fixed-point
you could manually track the scale with a fixed-point format but then you are merely implementing your own floating-point using integers

18455201
floating-point	integer
many machines and or programming languages ignore integer overflow but floating-point can handle these gracefully and or provide notifications when they occur

18455201
floating-point	integer
for example default settings or low-quality software with high-precision settings may display floating-point values incorrectly but software rarely prints integer values incorrectly

18455211
for-loop	loops
even the printf inside the for-loop is only printed after loops end

18455213
jobs	cron
i know python and django so i was thinking is it possible that i still log all events in google calendar and then i have daily cron jobs which will fetch events from google calendar and then put in mysql database

18455218
stdout	fflush
you can also fflush the stdout buffer manually

18455226
int	double

18455264
post	get
i would pass the book id through on delete post action same as delete get action

18455286
screens	tablet
you can use media queries to do your own special styles for different screens sizes traditionally you can do a mobile tablet desktop high rez set of styles

18455289
button	checkbox
what i m doing above is whenever any of the delete-img checkbox is clicked i find out how many of them are checked and then disable the delete-selected-btn button if that number is zero

18455289
button	checkbox
then in the click handler for the master toggle checkbox i simply set all of the other checkbox to the same state as the master and enable or disable the delete-selected-btn button as appropriate

18455289
mouse	keyboard
note that the anonymous function is just to keep the variables out of the global scope and i m using click handlers rather than change handlers because i vaguely recall that in some browsers when a checkbox is changed via the keyboard the change event doesn t occur until the checkbox loses focus but the click event works with mouse or keyboard

express	node.js
i have a problem downloading a file from a node.js server using express

18468979
express	node.js
the server part node.js using express where i route a post to php mixmovie.php a re-implementation of an existing backend is this

18469010
gruntjs	uglifyjs
you could do all of this with the uglifyjs gruntjs task

18469087
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
if you use google-chrome safari or firefox you can see this clearly just inspect the element and collapse the navbar if all other content is contained within that you still haven t fixed it

18469088
accessor	properties
to make it more general you can also implement the all properties in a dictionary but then you loose type checking and nice accessor methods .

18469100
quicksort	mergesort
the benefit of quicksort over mergesort is no additional memory overhead

18469100
quicksort	mergesort
the benefit of mergesort is the guaranteed o n log n run time where as quicksort can be much worse in the event of poor pivot point sampling

18469103
min	max
first of all your search interval will be since these are your min and max edge weights respectively

18469112
post	get
rather than try and regurgitate the discussion based on similar queries i will post some links here that should get you thinking more about these issues

18469115
mp3	wav
my solution is to create a headerless wav dump of the mp3 and then compare the md5 signatures of each wav

18469115
hash	md5
i created a hash with md5 as key pointing to the original mp3 file spec

18469138
getter	setter
or better still use properties and you don t even need to write setter or getter

18469149
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
it is because you are using getelementbyid and passing audio when i think you mean to use getelementsbytagname either that or you have the wrong id for the audio element

18469175
docx	xlsx
i have successfully set up highlighting in solr4 i am indexing docx xlsx pdf s mainly so just have fields like url title content

subtract	add
hi guys just wondering if you could help me out could you tell me what i am doing wrong here what i am trying to do is add 1 if r is typed and subtract 1 if l is typed for both the lower and upper cases

18469282
subtract	add
to add or subtract 1 from a value

18469427
put	get
i would like to get any error information or know where to put breakpoint to know what is wrong

18469496
hide	show
i tried hide and show which would just alter the css to display that element

18469512
subtract	add
a simple evaluation function would add weights of sidetoevaluatefor s pieces and subtract weights of the opposite side s pieces

18469540
crypt	salt
in your first call to crypt you do not specify a salt

18469540
crypt	salt
in your second call to crypt you pass the cryptedhash as the salt

18469540
hash	salt	crypt	salt	crypt	hash
crypt is documented to generate a random salt if you do not provide one and then prepend that salt to the returned hash

18469540
hash	salt	crypt	salt	crypt	hash
that has the side effect that if you pass a returned salt+hash as the hash for a subsequent call crypt will still pull the correct salt out of it

18469540
crypt	hash
now your environment is using a different algorithm for the 2 calls to crypt since you only supplied the hash in one of them

18469540
crypt	salt
the solution is to just pass a consistent salt to both calls to crypt

18469540
hash	salt
you can stop appending the salt to the string you want to hash and actually pass your user salt as the salt parameter and everything will be fine

18469606
mouseleave	mouseenter
you may also want to use mouseenter instead of hover since the hover callback will run on both mouseenter and mouseleave

18469622
box-sizing	border-box
we could avoid that either by appending a spacer element at the end of #content or use the combination of padding-bottom and box-sizing border-box 2 which is supposed to be supported on ie8 as well

18469622
box-sizing	border-box
nowadays all major modern web browsers support box-sizing border-box declaration including ie8

18469622
height	border-box	width	border-box	width	height	box-sizing	border-box
box-sizing border-box makes uas calculate the width height of the box including padding and borders

18469632
qobject	qlist	superclass	subclassing
it seems to be that if the property is not set as the specific subclassing of qobject as it was created but casted as its superclass when inserted in oparams qlist they are automatically casted is what causes the problem

18469641

18470007
post	get
i can get the top post for a certain day using the code below

18470016
width	height
html4 s is kind of an alias of the css s overflow hidden to do so it is important to set size attributes width height

18470021
free	malloc
in future if the mallocs are for different sizes totally then separate mallocs may buy you the efficiency of coming from different allocation buckets inside of the malloc implementation especially if you are going to free them at different times

18470116
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this works as expected in google-chrome firefox opera and safari

18470118

opera firefox safari and google-chrome works fine

18470227
folder	directory
in order to work you have to clean the asset folder in the main directory to generate once from the asset you ve just changed

18470261
spaces	delimiter
easiest way would be to create a macro that does a text to columns with a spaces as the delimiter

18470295
ati	nvidia
the reason things a breaking is because whatever mesa backend you are using either ati or nvidia also links against clang

18470295
clang	llvm
so at this point all of the built in llvm passes are registered then qt starts up and it creates an opengl context so mesa loads the appropriate dri backend and as it happens on your system that backend uses clang llvm and for some reason it seems that all those constructors run again and llvm notices that two passes actually the same pass trying to register itself twice share the same name and aborts your program

18470314
maven	pom.xml
now i am trying to do the same with maven using the maven-eclipse-plugin to generate the eclipse project files for a from the maven pom.xml

18470343
google-chrome	firefox
i m seeing the same behavior in both firefox and google-chrome

18470356
entities	entitymanager
i think this is because entities were obtained with a diferent instance of entitymanager

18470365
pop-up	dialog
what makes the file appear as attachment and pop-up the save as dialog is the following line

18470384
put	get
put this in oncreate of httpgetpost to get the data from intent

18470386
inherited	subclassing
i think the main benefit of declaring generic types as is that such generic classes will make subclassing to inherited methods which return or accept arguments with subtype s type

18470391
getter	setter
only provides getter and setter for list

18470426
hide	show
i am using jquery dialog currently for voting so i can hide the div contents and show another div contents for voting closed message

18470431

18470489
division	multiplication
the multiplication and division is transitive

18470576
mouseout	mouseenter
left or right mouseenter fires tween right after which never happens because of the mouseout tween

18470576
mouseout	mouseenter
instead of creating a tween everytime you mouseenter and mouseout and destroying them onfinish why not create the tweens once and .play them on mouseenter and call .reverse on mouseout

18470588
post	put
is this considered post or put

18470588
post	put
also i have another operation which remove all existing keys and add the new key is this post or put because it clear records and add new one

submit	submission
i know the solution now the xml file in sample is just for simulating purchase and it won t do anything for you in real store when you want to submit your application in windows store you define products and prices there and it is static i recommend you to start submission a dummy project in windows store then you can develop with a perfect view

18470923
subtract	add
in order to subtract in the ones column i d have to borrow from the tens column so i d decrement the tens column and add 10 to the 1 in the top ones column

18470929
config	ini
one bigger ini yaml file to keep base config of the application

18470936
stdout	stderr
value stderr sends the errors to stderr instead of stdout

18471037
switching	screens
then switching to the main framebuffer and draw a full screens quad using the texture rendered to just before

18471053
for-loop	loops

it has to generate minimum of 10000 files and it should complete generating files in max 10 minutes.

18471092
range	minimum
if i use a macro to filter the range then use another to call a subtotal worksheet function to find a minimum values in the first column i get the expected minimum for the filtered range

18471092
range	minimum
however if from the sheet i call a function to first invoke the filter procedure and then call a function to find the minimum it selects the minimum over the whole range as if unfiltered shown here

18471107
move	drag
problem occurs when i drag it on second sortable but don t drop it instead i tried move back item to first sortable div it move to second sortable instead of first sortable

18471136
hex	binary
i am trying to make a dictionary to convert from binary to hex this is what i made

18471152
stdout	stderr
your system will probably want to speak https via the cgi interface and then speak via stdin stdout stderr pipes to the command line process on the back end

18471186
width	height
uiimage has a size property a cgsize with width and height

18471193

textview	imageview
you can have button textview imageview or whatever layout element you want to put in it

18471257
momentjs	datejs
date parsing and timezone handling in particular is generally not uniform across browsers and it s better not to depend on it - use utc whenever possible or use a separate library like datejs or momentjs

18471259
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
the settings between ie mozilla opera google-chrome and safari are all different

18471341

printf	strncpy
currently i have debugging printf s scattered liberally through the code in fact on every line in this little snippet and it always stops with a sigsegv at the strncpy line

18471381
int	chars	strtol	strtok
then split the current line on the space chars using strtok and use strtol to parse the string into an int

18471387
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
as methods like gethours getminutes of java.util.date class are deprecated and java.util.calendar class is not yet supported in gwt is there a better way to add reduce hours minutes from a date object in gwt without doing string manipulation

18471450
gtk	cairo
see zetcode tutorials on gtk cairo

18471531
google-chrome	firefox
the existing working for firefox google-chrome css is

18471610
hex	binary
127 is the highest signed value that an ansichar can hold so a value of 129 which is hex binary 10000001 would simply be interpreted as -127 which is also hex binary 10000001

18471681
width	height
make your take up the whole width and height as a block

18471716
folder	directory
i have a directory in my computer which is having a numeral as the folder name.

18471716
folder	directory
now when it is fetching the directory name since it has a numeral in the folder name it is automatically converting to a different format and unable to fetch the file from there

18471775
build.gradle	gradlew
with gradlew you can easily pass multiple proguard configuration files and you could just create a method in the build.gradle file to get all the .jar file locations from the dependencies and create a temporary text file that you would then pass into the proguard configuration

18471806
getter	setter
your backing bean doesn t have a getter setter for your field

18471806
getter	setter
backing beans need to have javabeans-style properties with getter setter

18471813
ssl	https
anyway after removing that just to make sure the basic nginx configuration would work it as it had prior to adding the ssl redirects rewrites it will not stop changing the scheme to https

18471876
hide	show
i m trying to show or hide a div based on a selection from a list

18471876
hide	show
i m not quite sure how to handle the observable for the div being passed to a function so it can return a true or false value to show or hide the div

18471900
getter	setter
your custom adapter can be something really simple and you don t have to handle the json at all just use your custom class getter and setter

18471908
octal	hex
it also supports hex and octal overloading in the form of to_hstring and to_ostring just like hwrite and owrite

18472025
x86	64bit
from the dracula menu choose change acl2 executable path... and choose run_acl2 or run_acl2.exe which is located in the installation folder of proofpad c program files x86 proof pad if you have a 64bit pc

18472030
fgets	feof
so for the sake of simplicity assume your array ends up with it s base address at 0x7fffd00 that s 768 bytes below 0x8000000 meaning at a minimum you d have to overflow by that much to get a segfault well you d probably get a segfault when main returns or when you call feof because you filled your stack frame with random characters but we re talking about segfaults inside fgets but even that s not gaurenteed if something writable is mapped to the page above your stack unlikely most oss avoid doing that so you ll get a segfault if you overflow far enough

18472055
google-chrome	firefox
the code renders nicely in apple-webkit browsers but images don t scale down properly to the li bounds in google-chrome or firefox

18472059
maven	pom.xml
when building project maven still knows the location of the central repo because every pom.xml file inherits from the super pom.xml and that is where the default central repo url is defined

18472059
maven	pom.xml
the super pom.xml is located at under org maven model pom-4.0.0.xml

18472185
int	chars
or maybe the pointee type is not a basic type int chars float â and as such does not have a value values are essentially a scalar property a structure or a class or a union do not have values they have members

18472193
profiling	instrumentation
a good way to collect this information with visual studio is to use the visual studio profiling in instrumentation mode

18472343
filtering	grouping
i ended up going with volatile s solution from the comments under the question and adding the images to hidden img tags and then using the imagesloaded plugin on that grouping of hidden img tags to filtering only the ones that loaded successfully

18472344
calloc	malloc
abc and stud store the same value namely the memory address of the malloc calloc

18472346
cpu	affinity
the best you can do is to change the cpu affinity of a process

18472346
cpu	affinity
to set the cpu affinity with multiprocessing s process instances you can do

18472353
google-chrome	firefox
i would use a firefox or google-chrome plugin

18472370
width	height
work around this by simulating the autofit on a single cell with the same width as your merged cell and set the height it gives you

18472402
implements	extends
first make your mouselsntr extends mouseadapter class which implements mouselistener and mousemotionlistener by default

18472421
for-loop	loops
a python for-loop evaluates the expression that yields the iterable over which to loops once only

18472451
versioning	upgrade

18472479
boost	stl
i can t use stl or boost

18472525
post	get
but every time i post to the fnboth function with which 1 i get the same response

18472534
for-loop	loops
if you want the equivalent of a java-style for-loop you have to write the while loops explicitly

18472534
next	except
what actually happens is in effect a try except stopiteration because calling next on an iterator that s done raises stopiteration

18472538
stateless	stateful
to be honest a stateless session just wraps a stateful session and removes some functionality from it you can t pop things in and out

18472610
min	max	range	max	range	min
to calculate the actual range the edges of the histogram you can use the midpoint between the max in bin i and the min in bin i+1

18472629
zoo	xts
your my.dat object has duplicated values and xts and zoo objects must be ordered so all the duplicate values are being grouped together

18472635
width	height
found the answer to this one it would seem that by changing the itemscontrol in shell.xaml to a contentcontrol both height and width get passed to measureoverride

18472668
width	height
sized is just a struct that has a width and height in doubles

18472669
x86	64bit
the application now runs on win7 64bit and 32 bit and xp x86

18472678

18472686
jobs	cron
i m trying to make a generic way of setting cron jobs because i m making a commercial system and it needs to work for everyone

18472695
isotope	masonry
also masonry isotope would make a really cool and fairly simple addition to your plans

18472699
width	height
first you need to set a transparent rectangle background with the width and height of the stage so that the layer can detect mouse events in this case we need mousemove

18472727
textmate	notepad++
open notepad notepad++ or textmate type in the new code save refresh webpage

18472825
nspopover	nsbrowser

18472828
post	get
i don t have an answer to this sorry not enough reputation to post a comment but when i run your python code i get the following warning

18472843
maven	pom.xml
the problem is that kafka beta was built in a way that pom.xml generated with a jar isn t valid and maven could not recognize it and parse properly thus fetching transitive dependencies

18472855

post	get
it must have recognized data coming through and changed the get to a post to make it work

18472926
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

18472973
children	parent
the child form never seems to lose focus by clicking on any other child or the parent since the forms are all children of the parent

18472973
children	parent
as long as the parent has focus then children also have focus

18472994
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

18473019
width	height
i m suspecting the fact that i have the inside the that it is not working properly but i am using that div to constrain the img width and height

i have made many programs using merely a try-catch statement in my methods and it has worked just fine - surely it is these try-catch statements which manage exception-handling right

18491030
min	max
the first one shown by tom s answer sets alternative min and max values for the data set sent to the chart eg

18491030
min	max	range	max	range	min
also the chart s actual axis range is only based on the min max values - the values displayed will include the min max but might go beyond the min max in order to produce clean intervals between axis labels

18491030
min	max	range	max	range	min
if you need to explicitly limit the axis to a specific range where your min and max values are the absolute limits you want displayed then you use the vaxis.viewwindow.min max options

first i used java only to encounter frustration with its negative positive integer overflow because unsigned ints aren t an option

18491598
integer	unsigned
i then employed python after deciding that it s better suited for heavy numerical computation but realized that i wouldn t be able to overcome the unsigned 32-bit integer requirement either as python immediately casts wrapped int s to long s

18491603
foldable	catamorphism
the same function that paulvisschers is implementing which is indeed one of the simplest ways to do what you want can be implemented with a catamorphism if for some reason you want an exercise with foldable s

18492214
hash	md5
it is designed to convert a md5 hash into it s binary representation contained in the lmd5hash variable yes the array is 64 bytes long but only the first 16 will be used by the cipher since i call init with the 128 value which means a 128-bit 16 bytes key length

18492522
for-loop	loops
with the visual studio performance explorer i ve managed to fix a few bugs i ve had but now the problem seems to be due to the number of loops this particular for-loop is doing

18492548
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this is tested in firefox google-chrome opera and safari august 2013 plus internet explorer 7 8 9 and 10

ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu 13.04 g++ compiler

18492631
vbscript	jscript
then the user must specify a flag to tell the function if he wants the pure jscript object or if he wants a vbscript object with arrays and dates converted to their vbscript equivalent

conditional for-loop was introduced sometimes at labview 8.6 before that version the only solution is to use while loops instead of for-loop

18492800
jnetpcap	libpcap
can t read list of devices error is and since jnetpcap depends on libpcap c library wich requires root privileges it s obvious that s the reason why my program could not run

18492816
strdup	malloc
the main problem that i can see is that you dont bind memory for the strings so you have to use malloc or better use strdup function that allocates memory automatically

18492860
getter	setter
there is a particular property on that class that for one of the derived implementations i would like to override the getter and setter

18492860
public	protected
so as another approach i decided to make the property protected and then in the partial class .shared.cs create a public virtual property that effectively wraps the protected one

18492874
ceil	floor
there is also a function floor that rounds to lower number and ceil that rounds to higher number for example

18492878

18492976
omnipay	ci-merchant
if you are starting a new project i also recommend you check out omnipay the successor to ci-merchant as ci-merchant will not be receiving any further development

18493021
hide	show
now in a chunk of javascript in a template each condition in mymodelform.condtions will become a function that listens for a change in the value of a field and show or hide another field in response

18493101
google-chrome	safari
but it works fine in google-chrome and safari

18493117

this drives me mad as well but i finally found the answer - drag and drop a bmp png jpg file into your visual studio project right click it in the solution explorer and select open with - select ms paint and click set as default

18493132
hash	salt
note both entities use the same password encoder that s why copying the password hash and the salt is appropriate

18493135
width	margin
if you set margin or padding in percentage is percentage of width of parent element so you can do

18493135
box-sizing	border-box
and in this you must use box-sizing border-box

18493135
width	margin
there is no way to width containing inside-width + padding + border + margin

18493140
hide	show
the toggle method takes a boolean parameter called showorhide to determine whether to show or hide the element

18493253
hide	show
using show hide toggles the div s display attribute between display block an display none

18493263
children	parent
as each node is visited the copy parent is looked up from the dictionary and the node is added to its parent children collection

18493325
children	parent
if you turn off additivity the loggers that are children of the parent won t cause double logging

18493358
hide	show
use toggle method simply to hide show elements using jquery

18493367
getter	setter
if you ever want to add any extra logic in either the getter or the setter like implementing inotifypropertychanged you would have to write out the whole thing

18493372
bcel	cglib	javassist	cglib	javassist	bcel
some alternatives are bcel javassist and cglib no longer maintained

18493393
getter	setter
so inside it this is not your controller where the successmessage and of course its getter and setter is defined

18493436

both those properties are inherited from test_unit which is the common base class for unit_test and test_suite

18493718
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested with ie 10 google-chrome and firefox

18493747

basically the objective here is if the user check the option for 90 pesos and above or 90 pesos to 1000 pesos the slider will change the min and max range

18493982
folder	directory
to be honest i don t know what the .. does or where my root folder is supposed to be when writing a directory path but these are the ways that i ve seen other people do this

18494027

i have tried to have onsubmit and onclick but both remove the content of the textarea before it gets added to the database so it displays an empty message

18494105
put	get
may get different values depending on what platform is being compiled for so i cannot put it in clear text in the sed statement

18494112
doc	rtf
think of it like the old doc format for microsoft word versus rtf

18494112
doc	rtf
both convey the same information roughly but rtf is an open format that many programs can write out while the old doc format was not initially published i think

18494238
hide	show
i would still declare your methods on the function s prototype like you attempted but you ll have to declare show and hide methods on a new errormessage type

18494238
hide	show
i think something like this is the best and most efficient because instances of errormessage will all share the same show and hide methods thing to do if i understand your needs correctly

18494295
free	malloc	free	strdup	strdup	malloc
note that storing malloc d data including the result of strdup and asprintf on the parser stack that is as also implies the necessity to free it when you re done with it

18494307
post	put
i want to put in a conditional statement in the below code in order to prevent the php post from running if there is no selection of the branches radio buttons

18494362
children	parent
i m actually working on an app that needs to link an exercise to many subcategories and the subcategories are children of a parent category

18494367
width	height	children	parent
to my understanding if a div s width and height properties are not defined the parent div will equal the result of the arranged children elements width and height properties added collectively and respectively

18494367
width	height
the width of the div should be the width of the child svg as it is the widest and the height of the div should be the height of the child divs 2 of them and the height of the svg

18494367
width	height
i have not defined the width and height properties on the svg rather i did so on the css

18494547
width	height
i have made an interactive data grid and when i want to disable it such as when i bring up a dialogue in front of it i append a transparent div to the grid s outer container with height and width stretched so that it is not possible to click on anything

18494549
maven	pom.xml
in my approach i did not included sonar maven plugin in pom.xml file since i want to use jenkins sonar plugin

for-loop	loops
as long as you only ever loops over it with a normal for-loop or .foreach which you should be doing anyway you shouldn t have any issues

18494569
put	get
a way to get around this issue is to put all subs etc that you want to run after pulling the bloomberg data into a different sub

18494641
mouse	keyboard
the event queue will contain every message relevant to the application including things like mouse button presses mouse motion events keyboard events and window events like resize and expose

the play icon show hide correctly but i am not sure what is happening with seektime api

18494748
int	boolean
i cannot figure out how to access to the type between the brackets of class in order to evaluate how to build my sql statement in case of class string i need to enclose the third element of the tuple in quotes in case of class int or class boolean i just need to return the value as string with no enclosure

18494795
width	height
when a does not have its width and height defined both properties are set to auto

18494795
children	parent
if its children are wider than the specification says they should protrude out but they won t affect the width of the parent

18494795
children	parent
for each parent you want to expand and each of its children you will need to apply display inline-block

put	get
i put an alert to show the content of what the get method read and it displays a blank dialog

18495061
for-loop	loops
in my solution combination based no of for-loop checks reduces to 6.243e15 for outer 12 loops

18495062

at first i had an interface drawable that had one method draw that would accept a graphics context object and the implementing entity would draw itself to that context using the graphics libraries i am using swing awt in this case

18495239
subtraction	addition
i ve tried an .each and a .map function which allows for the calculation addition and subtraction based on checked of the total but transfers over to the next row s line-total which obviously defeats the purpose

18495257
google-chrome	firefox
this happens universally across google-chrome firefox and ie

18495283
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
fix use custom free malloc realloc functions

put	get
you ll need to put the listener on the button and then get the value in the field at that point like so using your code

18495345
std	ostream
creating a separate ostream object is not required as std cout is a ostream object itself

18495367
button	checkbox
i simply need to be able to save which checkbox the user has checked when he navigates between the links and back again until he finally at some point clicks the add all submit button

i thought about making the second part of the page a scrolling div similar to this answer but unfortunately that approach seems to require that i know ahead of time the height of my header div and i do not - the reason being that it is possible the height will change based on the width of the page so if the page is not wide enough part of the header will spill onto the next line

18499096

these include all properties even those inherited through the prototype chain

18499096
for-loop	arrays
instead you should use a regular for-loop to iterate over an arrays

factors	mean
even if you forget subpixel positioning and kerning etc which mean that characters in the drawn string will be different sizes depending on their context in the string and position on screen and cleartype settings measurestring has a habit of adding padding and fudge factors so you can t easily get the desired info out of it

18499371
16-bit	64bit	x86	64bit
if you want the bytes in that particular order on a little-endian machine you will have to get bytes one by one and shift if you wanted a whole 64bit value it may have been possible to use a byteswap instruction on x86 but i doubt it s enough value in that when you then need to undo that by shifting and masking the 16-bit you didn t actually need

18499444
portrait	landscape
also if the view controller is shown in landscape portrait the image would change in size shown

i m a phalcon enthusiast but actually tasks seem to me something to create cron jobs

18514258

18514572
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition
decimals are closed over addition subtraction and multiplication but not closed over division

18514572
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition
to answer the question you actually asked just as multiplication can be built out of addition in a loop division can be built out of subtraction in a loop

18514578
rvm	bundler
use bundler for this with rvm or rbenv

18514683

18514870
calloc	malloc
use calloc instead of malloc if you want this to be true

18514870
strcpy	strncpy
in general use strncpy instead of strcpy - it s safer

18514959
antlr	parser-generator
the resulting is lalr 1 as long as you define a separate terminal for every sequence of dots. in practice this would be done by using predicates in the cfg so you could create a parser with a parser-generator which allows predicates antlr does for example but i d personally use a bottom-up generator to avoid fiddling around with left-recursion elimination.

18514973
plot	errorbar
the errorbar in your plot are correct

18515095
for-loop	arrays

18515145
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari

of course we could get it through the api but that wouldn t be optional as our site has no facebook login functionality and we d prefer users to post without having to authorize anything

18515180
hex	binary
is returning a string of text and because you re not hex decoding it your keyspace is limited to all possible 256-bit strings rather than all 256-bit binary values

18515280
text-align	background-color
important for fields such as text-align color border background-color and cursor wait

18515349

18515440
content-length	content-type
observe that you are missing the content-type content-length parameters within the header

18515447

the error appears on the php echo nl2br line after creating and adding the substr and the href the won t echo

18515903
post	get
pps. for those who want to get related information i ve collected a lot of links so if i get at least 10 reputation i can post them here

18515968
post	get
in very general product with reviews will be quite similar to any blog with post and comments so maybe some video tutorial will help you to get the concept

18515999
dictionary	map
instead insert it into a map dictionary like in the example below note can be done more efficiently but this shows each step taken explicitly

18516009
cpu	processors
also you re free to assume any kind of processors extension common in consumer cpus up to avx2 current haswell cpu as of the time of writing this if it helps in finding a good answer

18516032
padding	overlapping
it seems that my padding is overlapping and you can only click on the padding to the left of the link whereas the padding on the right becomes the left padding of the link the the right

18516065
disk	ram
git clone out of memory even with 5.6gb ram free and 50 gb hard disk

18516154
for-loop	arrays
because the for-loop is looping over the dom arrays for links each link is placed at an arrays index

18516200
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you can t set an identifier of a segue that s created between a uinavigationcontroller or a uitabbarcontroller

18516285
nl2br	substr
separate the substr and nl2br calls to avoid an error killing the loop

18516288
udp	tcp
i feel that both tcp and udp will be very slow

18516288
udp	tcp
i came across zeromq which seems to have less overhead and is faster than tcp and udp

18516315
post	get
if i change the form method post to get

18516317
width	height
i have the following code which sets up a container which has a height that changes with the width when the browser is re-sized to maintain a square aspect ratio

18516410
post	get
i just want to try to prevent unauthorized use of my api and i can t think of a way to do that with javascript since anyone with a dom inspector can scrape any credentials from any variables or can monitor any server traffic post or get data.

18516432
updatepanel	scriptmanager
note if you use any controls that employ ms ajax updatepanel as containers for your textbox - you have to use scriptmanager instead

18516474
width	height
which may have a dynamic content height and or width

18516474
width	height
in order to make the height of a container element changes with its width respecting the aspect ratio we could use a percentage value for top bottom padding property

18516484
width	height
this solution only works for square images because a percentage margin-top value depends on the width of the container not the height

18516511
datediff	difference
datediff will return the difference in days

18516555
freemarker	velocity
instead create a template jnlp file with jsp velocity freemarker or a similar template engine and fill in the jnlp s fields dynamically such as from a database

18516565
ssl	https
i heard about google and its super powers but the amount of results treating about ssl and https and so on is too d high

18516568
post	get
as we know from this post in rails you can get the previous url by calling

18516569
google-chrome	firefox
in most cases this isn t a problem and in google-chrome everything works fine however when trying to get the left position of the element within firefox as the viewbox is square firefox reports the left position of the viewbox rather than the svg element

18516631
accessor	properties	subclass	accessor
i understand how to subclass pfobject but i am not certain how to perform additional custom code in an accessor while still calling the generic implementation of that accessor as defined and dynamic-ally added by parse which does the proper thing depending on the properties s type pfrelation and so forth

18516653

you re reading sizeof unsigned bytes in a short

18517574
unsigned	short
short isn t guaranteed to be the same size as unsigned hence when reading the bytes next to your short garbage data is read

to fix this either pass your argument as an unsigned or when using sizeof use sizeof short

18517581
superclass	subclassing
an alternative if you create the full class hierarchy is to create a superclass vector that is not modifiable and has no modifying methods like set and two subclassing immutablevector that guarantees immutability and mutablevector that is modifiable

client-side	server-side
the filtering is done client-side in javascript but for security reasons i am also doing the filtering server-side

this means that processors don t need to do anything special to implement subtraction if they already have addition

18518095
addition	twos-complement	subtraction	twos-complement	subtraction	addition	subtraction	add
they can simply find the twos-complement of y recall flip the bits and add one and then add x and y using the addition circuit they already have rather than having a special circuit for subtraction

setinterval	settimeout
i know i should change settimeout to setinterval and i will someday but i want to understand what is wrong here

18518154

caliburn.micro will take care of the convention based binding from the button click event to the viewmodel s method with the same name

18520346

pay attention to the push and pull classes you re setting for each column at the lg size you need to reset those that were set in smaller sizes

18525350
pull	push
so for the first column you need to reset push not pull and for the second you need to reset both

18525350
pull	push
bootstrap uses the left and right css properties to push and pull the columns respectively and when you re at the medium size breakpoint both properties are set since values from smaller sizes are propagated to the larger ones when this happens it s defined in the css specification that the left property push has precedence and the right property is effectively ignored

18525648
hide	show
besides that my idea is to wrap every question in a div and show hide it when you need

18525656
min	max
then you will have to pass length into the methods to determine min and max and to print

18525656
min	max
if you don t do this the rest of the fields will be 0 and can mess up the proper min and max values

18525666

also the physical width and height are in millimeters not pixels and screen depth is color depth of your display 18 in my case

18526690
super	extends
if you then extends them from other activities its superclass is going to be called via its super method

18526742
hide	show
the script hide any column in a range which have their title field blank and show those that are not empty

18526763
implements	extends
an aside for code hygiene better not extends a view to implements its role as comboboxeditor even though here you need a subclassed jpanel to avoid the problem so it s arguably borderline - - instead implements the editor and let it use the tweaked panel

18526930

18527008
coalesce	isnull
you can just wrap the replace with an isnull or coalesce 1

18527008

the only place i d recommend using isnull rather than coalesce is when you re creating a computed column in a table or within a view the second parameter you re passing is non-null and you want the column s definition in metadata to be not null

18527013
post	put
by default cake uses put method for edit action and post for add

unzipped and pasted the paypal folder in my project directory

18528381
versioning	upgrade
my final piece of advise would be to upgrade to a newer versioning of sql-server where you can use row_number

18528409
nsscanner	nsregularexpression
other approaches would include things like nsscanner or nsregularexpression but this is straight forward and flexible if you need the rest

18528417
gridview	rowdatabound
you can use rowdatabound of the gridview which gets triggered for every gridviewrow after it was constructed and databound

18528577
coalesce	isnull
isnull takes only 2 parameters whereas coalesce takes variable number of parameters

18528577
coalesce	isnull
coalesce is based on the ansi sql standard whereas isnull is a proprietary tsql function

18528577
coalesce	isnull
validations for isnull and coalesce is also different

18528577
coalesce	isnull
data type determination of the resulting expression â isnull uses the first parameter type coalesce follows the case expression rules and returns type of value with highest precedence

18528580
getter	setter
objc automatically synthesizes the getter and setter and automatically creates a new variable blindly using the same _name _but _with _an _underscore in front when you do the property thing -- it s magic -- bordering on the almost too helpful side of things

18528580
getter	setter
handy for non-newbies but incredibly confusing for newbies -- just believe that the getter and setter is made and that a _new _var _is _available

18528596

18538724
width	height
the browser does make use of the width height so there is a performance hit but it is usually worth it for the sake of responsiveness

18538726

below is a link from telerik that displays info about the radwindow and its navigateurl

18538896
awt	swing
the most commonly used methods of clip like start and stop operate asynchronously meaning they do not block so it should be okay to call them from the gui awt swing thread

18538900
width	height
the reason width height attributes help is it means the browser can lay the page out before the image has loaded otherwise you get a jump effect

18538904
width	height
the reason why it is said you should give image height width is that

18538904
width	height
browser render height width before image so keeps a vacant container on the site before loading of image...so structure of the website don t disturbs while loading the website

18538906
client-side	server-side
yes it s possible to create server-side meta-templates of client-side templates

18538964
client-side	server-side
php is a server-side language and this is a client-side problem

18538991
pop-up	dialog
i occasionally get requests to implement or modify notifications to display expanded messages like the dialog pop-up on ios

18539019
put	get
that way the contents of menu.php will get evaluated and be put into your foo.php file as if it were copied and pasted

18539065
mouseout	mouseleave
in this case use mouseleave instead of mouseout

18539065
opera	google-chrome
note that mouseleave support has been added to blink google-chrome opera 15 quite recently that s why it s not available in google-chrome 29 but is already there in dev google-chrome

18539107

antiforgery token makes sense on post while your request is a get request

18539164

i ve looked in php sessions but i don t really understand how can i enable the user ability to add subtract from the variable once the page has been loaded

18539199
do.call	lapply
generalization to any number of lists would require a mix of do.call and lapply

18539242
getter	setter
each piece of information can be read and set from storage classes example interface addressbook provides access to elements of the type interface contact which have getter and setter for some stuff

18539243
button	checkbox
where you have already set to be the checkbox element targeted by that button

18539250
width	height
if that s the case instead of using coregraphics to draw the dots what i d recommend you to do is to create a uiview subclass that knows how to draw one single dot and that it s whole size width and height correspond to the diameter of the dot

18539257
public	protected
exposing ids in the urls is always a somewhat less than ideal situation to start with as these may be revealing information that s not necessarily supposed to be public and they also invite tampering to discover other records which may not be protected properly

18539297
jobs	cron
archive the entire home directory of the shared hosting account and include the contents of that user s cron jobs databases email and other information

18539297

if your account was using a framework like joomla drupal wordpress or something similar take this time to upgrade to the latest versioning

18539339
ant	maven
the build-automatically option in eclipse is not the same thing as an ant or maven build system

18539339
ant	maven
as for maven ant

18539339
ant	maven
i am a big fan of ant and i have hated using maven

18539362
hash	md5
or do i have to write maybe a perl script that goes and loop through each file content and perform md5 hash content and then compare

18539370
getdate	dateadd
passing that through dateadd month -24 getdate yields 08 30 2011 02 18 14pm

18539402
pop-up	dialog
again the request does get sent correctly although i am seeing the same problem as is being seen here when the dialog pop-up and i can see the request on the recipient s facebook acct

18539403
post	get
it looks like according to the cors spec get and post requests should transparently follow 302 redirects

18539430
ssl	https
since i m using ssl all port 80 http requests are rewritten to https

18539491
webkit	gecko
slimerjs - similar to phantomjs uses gecko firefox instead of webkit

18539622
linefeed	delimiter
as for your problem read reads a record until the first delimiter -d default linefeed and then splits that up into fields by

18539659
boost	stl
as far as i know there is no stl boost direct equivalent of smallvector

18539705
width	height
i can see that extjs tries to calculate the height and the width for the grids

18539705
width	height
in case of height it s correct but for width it s not the calculated width is equals to my browser s width not to the sum of columns which are in the grid

18539715
wtl	atl
you ll want to use atl with wtl

google-chrome	firefox
i ve made a simple web-service that returns geolocation and it works just fine when it requests from ie10 google-chrome firefox

18539880
cos	sin
in stead of calling the cos or sin every cycle of the loop create variable before the loop which contains the value of cos angle or sin angle already

18539885
textview	imageview
you should define on all of the child objects in the item listview textview imageview etc.

18539907
serializable	deserialization
java s serializable api assumes that the types are available on deserialization

18539910
implements	extends
public class mainactivity extends fragmentactivity implements ontouchlistener

18539948
hide	show
because then i can show and hide the rectangle and image

18539964
sudo	passwd
i figured it out by having the user type their sudo passwd and executing the command like so

18539967
gif	png
but i want some restriction so that user will only upload some kind of files like png jpg and gif only

18539986
getter	setter
a val is a private field with an auto-generated getter method and the only difference for a var is that is has a setter as well

18540027
highcharts	dygraphs
we checked dygraphs highcharts but for some reasons we are not using it

18540091
punctuation	words
the words class needs to distinguish punctuation for the ending beginning of sentences increment valid words and increment each syllable

18540148
google-chrome	firefox
the problem though with canplaytype is that it returns maybe in google-chrome and probably in firefox

18540148
mp4	webm
then this function will let us add a mp4 and a link for webm or ogg

18540203
int	chars
type chars and then compared against the int constant eof the

18540203
int	chars
type chars on widening to int is implementation-defined

18540214
division	multiplication
replace all temporary values with calculated results fo multiplication and division and at the end add substarct rest

18540243
boost	stl
if you re using stl boost or anything else with a lot of templates you ll also have the specialisations for every type you used them with often the entire class - not just methods with weak linkage

18540282
pull	push
that should be possible with apply-templates although you may need to use the pull processing method instead of push it may not actually be possibly with apply-templates...

18540294
children	parent
if this node1 has a parent parentnode and this parent has other unselected children node2 node3 etc

18540320

i made a bufferedreader when i logout i have 200 coins and when i login i get 545453 coins or other amount i am sure it s the bufferedwriter please help

18540354
ienumerable	iqueryable
in addition we are now using iqueryable instead of ienumerable which means we don t have to enumerate the source before calling this method

18540395
ienumerable	iqueryable
you can use the ienumerable iqueryable extension method defaultifempty for this

18540415
ord	chr
i ve made a simple script in python which shifts the letters up 5 spaces in the ascii table using chr and ord

18540419

18540447
free	malloc
look very carefully at every place you call malloc in your program and ensure that you call free for each array afterwards

18540532
min	max
found a cool way to set the min and max date for datepickerdialog

18540545

question inside my xml for the list items where the textview text1 is located i have included an imageview

18540573
min	max
it might be too late to answer but the it is easy to set the min and max date for datepickerdialog

18540611
put	get
is get operation in chm guaranteed to get correct value of put by

18540621
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome the x is in the correct position top right however when testing in firefox it seems that it ignores it entirely placing the x instead on the bottom right

18540636
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
the notes on say i need a canary build which on mint linux ubuntu seems quite hard to install

18540671
mouse	keyboard
i m interested in reading dev input eventx device s for different input events mainly keyboard and mouse

18540671
mouse	keyboard
the only thing i can think of is creating a state of all the keyboard keys and mouse buttons and then create a new thread for reading keyboard and mouse states those threads might be blocked from time to time and from my main process access the state of the keyboard and mouse

18540698
accessor	properties
to see this take a look at the following il code for the iamdynamic properties s get accessor method which we will use later for testing purposes

18540708
hide	show
ideally would love to call show or hide on the div and the other div automatically adjusts itself to 100 width

18540746
setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout	clearinterval	settimeout
instead of settimeout use setinterval and clearinterval like this

18540798
post	put
the client disconnected while sending the post put body 39 more bytes were expected

18540820
move	drag
i am trying to create a small container where the user will be able to move the mouse drag his finger in order to control the renderer dom element in another container

18540824
keydown	keyup
keyup keydown or keypress

18540862
strcpy	malloc
if run it should allocate an indeterminate but probably very large amount of memory with the second malloc based on the conversion of an address to a size_t and then invoked horribly undefined behaviour by using strcpy on memory which was never properly initialized

18540887
put	get
it certainly is guaranteed as long as the put has completed before the call to get

18540890
google-chrome	firefox
the following code produced correct output on firefox 3.6 but failed to do so empty string in both ie 9 and google-chrome 31

18540905
curb	libcurl
it worked for a while but i keep getting libcurl curb errors

18540911
min	max
by first calling setdate with a value for the last day of the month previous to the desired display date and then calling it with the desired date it seems to work consistently as expected make sure this date falls between the max min dates of the calendarview

18540937
subtract	add
i have a table in which i m trying to add and subtract multiple text fields using jquery on keydown or blur

18540937
subtraction	add
while i can add successfully i get all wrong results for subtraction

18540938
post	get
admittedly it is odd to use a post for a scenario that suits a get but in a get you can only send information via the url i.e route values and the querystring

18540953
hide	show
as for using delay and making this work hide and show will work just as the animated jquery methods if a value for the duration is passed even if that value is zero

18540958
width	height
i m using the jquery .css method to set the height and width of an element to 30 of the container div element minus 10 pixels

18541008
hide	show
in every browser but ie it finds the image and removes the hide class and adds the show class

18541028
portrait	landscape
it seems it may have something to do with rotation and scaling or initialization since if i rotate to landscape and back to portrait the image seems to correct itself

18541050
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
this works in firefox google-chrome and safari but ie does not support the nth-child pseudo class

18541054
int	chars
your sscanf doesn t support hh which means it s converting as an unsigned int and trying to stuff that into an unsigned chars -sized variable causing undefined behaviour

18541103
integer	unsigned
for some reason it s broken with unsigned integer types

18541105
subtract	add
in the .sub handler sum is negative so you need to add it to val in order to subtract

18541167
equals	charat
charat x returns a string containing a character at the position x of the string this but does not return a link to that position thus it is not equals to c s notation which returns a link to a byte where the character is located

18541320
getter	setter
anyway you can keep your header file as it is but you will have to code explicitly the property getter and setter in the .m file

18541324
subtract	add
my approach with javascript is to obtain the current translated value in string form strip the rotate degree from it and add or subtract 30 degrees from it depending on whether or not the right or left arrow is pressed

18541339
int	boolean
if fields are implemented with wrapper classes int boolean and so on

18541345
qvboxlayout	qwidget
i have a qwidget which contains a qvboxlayout and that layout contains a qlabel and qtoolbuttons

18541357
width	height
your 5 images have width 1 and height 1 in ie si i guess there is some other code modifying it

18541365
google-chrome	firefox
in javascript as of es5 so i think that s supported in ie9+ google-chrome and firefox you can use the map and filter functions on an array

18541407
hide	show
i am trying to slide a div to the left when i show it and slide it to the right when i hide it but i don t want to use jquery

18541407
hide	show
here is my show hide js

18541441
folder	directory
ensure that all images are present in the right directory folder

18541470

18541557
post	get
post those parameters the username and the password along with the cookie that was returned with get request

18541568
google-chrome	firefox
i want to know if common browsers such as google-chrome or firefox have the ability with some plugin to test or check valid and invalid css property

18541587
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup
the event listeners in this case are mousedown and mouseup on the object itself and mousemove on the document body but what s best practice in the general case

18541622
int	chars
i got some errors in my mfc doc view app with conversion lpctstr parameter sznewchr the error error c2664 int atl cstringt find wchar_t int throw const cannot convert parameter 1 from const chars 2 to wchar_t

18541678
mp3	wav
this works fine with wav files but gets an error with mp3

18541680
google-chrome	firefox
in modern browsers google-chrome firefox webkit it doesn t matter - when dom elements are disposed so are the event handlers tied to them since both are handled by the same memory manager

18541697
put	get
the only way that i have found to assure that i get into the code of my module is to put a pdb.set_trace in my module which i would prefer not to do

18541715
stdout	stderr
i am trying to run a shell script and capture the pid stderr stdout and the exit status of the shell

18541774
gson	jackson
also check for gson or jackson which are third-party json parsers

18541794
hash	salt
during registeration i hash and salt password using sha 512

18541794
hash	salt
but i don t know how to create login form using hash and salt password

18541824
foldable	unfold
i could write an instance of foldable for cofree so i can apply cata to a free monad obtained from unfold coiter

18541857
hash	salt
you have to store the salt in your database along with the username and the password hash

18541857
hash	salt
query the database using a where condition on the username to retrieve the salt and the password hash

18541865
debian	mint	debian	linux
in lmde linux mint debian edition f5 refreshes the desktop but this question probably belongs in unix.stackexchange.com

18541884
slideup	slidedown
i think it has something to do with the slideup slidedown function but i can t figure it out.

18541900
children	parent
to be able to design for android you must know what components widgets are at your disposal what properties these components have and how they behave in relation to their siblings parent children etc

18541901
ng-show	ng-class
i dont want to paste a template in directive with ng-show ng-class stuff because business logic is but tricky so it is easier to do it using link function

18541919
chown	chmod
i ended up temporarily chmod 777 on opt chef and usr bin as well as chown -r myuser opt chef

18541925
put	get
when i declare this function in the header file if i put it before the class definition i get an error saying the objects haven t been defined

18541936
button	checkbox
however if the state of the checkbox does not change from form load to pressing the ok button then there is nothing to update

18541936
button	checkbox
so with .net i am trying to do the same but having trouble coming up with a routine that would tell me if the .checked state of the collection of checkbox was the same on load as it is on button click

18541940
dictionary	map
conceptually they re identical according to what is the difference between a map and a dictionary

18541955
implements	extends
the code above extends a documented class rather than implements the interface

18541970
post	get
if you check your routes you should get the syntax for a user post route if you have defined the nested route correctly

18541987
subtraction	addition	division	subtraction	division	addition
i have solved this problem for addition subtraction division square roots xor and hex

18541987
exponent	modulo	logarithm	modulo	multiplication	exponent	multiplication	modulo
i would like any advice for calculating multiplication modulo exponent scientific notation and logarithm

18541991
post	get
post can also be used to get some data from the server

18541994
put	get
2 if you insist on the scenario aforementioned you put a sound sound forward declaration before the non-member function to get the type recognized

18542002
pop-up	dialog
after the user installs the application and launches it for the first time a dialog will pop-up but after the user click the ok button to dismiss the dialog

18542007
width	height
be aware that the images only start scaling if the height of the browser window changes not its width

18542031
free	malloc
abstractions and hardware below malloc are free to use discontiguous memory

18542049
uilabel	uitextview
i have a uitextview in a and a uilabel in b

18542049
uilabel	uitextview
i want the user to enter some information into the uitextview in a press the button transition to b and have that information show up in the uilabel in b

18542049
uilabel	uitextview
if i move the uilabel from b back over to a then i can easily mirror the uitextview input into the uilabel......but if i move the label back over to b nothing happens the label never changes

18542100
getter	setter
i have the colorball class with all the proper setter and getter

18542170
puts	gets
you could certainly write a program which does puts and gets into a hashmap in a large number of threads but logging volatile fields other locks and other timing details of your application may make it extremely hard to force your particular code to fail

18542173
ssl	https
indicate that the request should or should not be sent over https ssl

18542183
width	height
it will have a width and height

18542210
int	double
the arguments you pass to the function can still be instances of int and double and java s autoboxing feature will do the translation for you throwing an exception if they are null

18542343
google-chrome	firefox
i made a little form for search using bootstrap 3 and it is perfect on google-chrome but the alignment is not very good in firefox i am using version 23 the code is

18542412
ubuntu	linux
i have a c++ application lets call dummy1 which i want to debug in cgdb a curl interface to gdb in linux ubuntu 12.04

18542441
return-value-optimization	nrvo
the copy move constructors are usually elided because of return-value-optimization nrvo but they still need to be defined which is somewhat confusing

18542441
return-value-optimization	nrvo
if return-value-optimization nrvo was in the standard the copy move constructors would be no longer required in this case

18542449
portrait	landscape
i d be very interested in any ideas - if it s any help - the system they employ is very very bad for portrait images - it s obviously only built for landscape

18542449
width	height
a static 10 works okay for this image - but with another it produces something vastly different making me think that the width height aspect ratio are tied to the cropping percentage

18542469
hide	show
in this loaded form i have a div that i need to hide show based on a select form field

18542535
pop-up	dialog
first i wanted to test the installation process as well but it doesn t seem possible to click the add button when the installation dialog pop-up using selenium

18542555
int	double
no you can t divide by zero in math but in java infinity is correct for new int 1 new double 0

18542555
int	double
new int 0 new double 0 would be undefined nan

18542604
qgraphicsview	qdial
however you can place the qdial in a qgraphicsview and rotate it as an item in the scene

18542611
folder	directory
however when i look in the runtime folder in the python directory for gtk-2.0

18542617
tostring	getter
i also already have the getter getcounter1 getcounter2 and the tostring just don t want to flood.

18542621
ilist	icollection	idictionary	icollection	idictionary	ilist
exposing binary tree as specific interface may be overkill too - if you need it to represent some sorted structure ilist icollection or maybe idictionary maybe enough

18542628
gitolite	gitosis
they re used mostly for storing repositories remotely by github or tools like gitolite and gitosis

18542665
range	minimum
this sets the minimum for the yaxis to 0 this is unlikely to be false in this case and the minimum range to 450

18542687
google-chrome	firefox
it is tested and working in google-chrome firefox and ie8+

18542687
google-chrome	firefox
i created a jsfiddle demonstrating a combined solution using feature detection where pointer events are used if supported currently google-chrome firefox and ie11 and the browser falls back to adding events to child nodes if pointer event support isn t available ie8-10

18542753
getter	setter
i can create an object class called number then use getter and setter such as number.setplayernumber and then use number.getplayernumber in my if statements to determine the winner

18542763
getter	setter
here s the truth about getter and setter though

18542763
getter	setter
the downside to immutable objects is that there is no role for getter and setter in them see note

18542834
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
everything is working as expected in firefox google-chrome safari and opera

18542863
int	boolean
thus evaluates to 0 typed int evaluates to 10 typed int which leads to 0 || 10 typed as int || int and that doesn t make sense in java - one or both in this case of the operands values supplied to the operator were invalid because java only accepts || when it is typed as boolean || boolean

18542887
addition	multiplication
addition and multiplication are both commutative but not associative

18542890
haskell	elm
i m currently writing an online game where i use haskell for the server-side backend and elm for the frontend rendering

18542907
put	get
if i just put the alert fires but i can t get anything to work with the function

18542907
google-chrome	safari
i ve tried in safari 6.0.5 and google-chrome as well

18542913
getter	setter
there s also hardly any point to creating an entire class that just encapsulates a single number and provides getter and setter you could do this with a simple integer if you really wanted to

width	height
the second thing to do--omitted in the instructions--is to change the height and or width properties in the #supersized and #supersized li properties to reflect your new desired height and width

18543248
width	height
in my case changing the slider height and width properties in the site main.css--which was the bottom entry in my css link files did not affect this property as the framework did not directly address the #supersized id

18543283
children	parent
the exception is the parent of the banana its sequence of children contains two elements corresponding to the banana and a third element here named branch between them

18543294
unsigned	short	int	chars	int	double
the implication here is that only bool chars double float int long long long short and their unsigned counterparts are fully supported along with struct s via nsvalue

18543294
getter	setter
note that i cut corners for the purpose of demonstration and that this code will only work with sel attributes that have appropriately named getter and setter and will not directly check for instance variables unlike the default kvc implementations

18543297
versioning	upgrade
the versioning number for .net 4 and 4.5 is the same 4.0.30319 as 4.5 is an in-place upgrade to 4.0

18543611
curb	libcurl
instead of using wget and then trying to parse the headers after the fact i d recommend using curb which relies on libcurl

18543611
curb	libcurl
libcurl is a very good alternate tool for the same sort of tasks which because of curb integrates nicely with ruby

18543623
ember.js	qunit
i am trying to setup ember.js with qunit to write integration tests

18543627

int	chars
the answer given there was an int not chars matrix but the code here is pretty much the same format

18543774
for-loop	loops
you failed to actually change the control variable in your for-loop which can be done in the final expression or loops body itself

i do what i need then return an object matching the methods return type and all the http json encoding decoding is done for me so i only need to worry about the json client-side working with my classes server side and treating the methods like any other server-side method

18543870
client-side	server-side
i want to learn to love php but this could be make break for me because everything i do now ends up being client-side js dom and server-side data management

18544333
width	height
a call to self.view.bounds.size will get you the correct width and height for the new orientation

18544352
min	max
just define min and max values for x axis

18544375
comparator	comparable
then you could declare the relevant classes as implementing comparable for the natural order and use comparator objects to implement the other orders

18544375
comparator	comparable
by the way a comparator probably should not implement comparable and vice versa

18544375
comparator	comparable
if a comparator implements comparable that implies you are trying to order instances of the comparator object itself .

18544375
comparator	comparable
you still seem to be confusing the purpose of comparable and comparator

18544425
getter	setter
to the contacts class and implement a getter and setter method accordingly

18544479
sorting	filtering
pagination and filtering is working perfectly but sorting is not working

18544493
comparator	comparable
note that a comparable object can only implement a single comparator method so you only get one option - the natural obvious option

18544493
comparator	comparable
also if the objects you are sorting do not implement comparable or you are mixing types that do not like to compare to each other in general this is to be avoided but perhaps you want to be able to compare books and authors in a single list in some special case you need to use comparator

18544501
comparator	comparable
if you implement comparable you can write only one sorting logic in comparator method

18544503
children	parent
also in your recursive function you might want to declare the parent first and then then children

18544504
haskell	elm
you could use aeson on the haskell side and then write functions to from json using elm s json library

18544504
haskell	elm
another option may be to try reusing the code produced by haskell s deriving read and porting it to elm

18544531
comparator	comparable
comparable and comparator

18544554

i have seen tutorials but most of them deal with for-loop to apply matrix concept in a 2-d arrays

18551826
free	malloc
you could also use malloc free or new delete so it will be on the heap but.you need to make sure it was successful

18551881
for-loop	loops
1 rewrite the for-loop so that you iterate through the batches and have an inner loops iterating through the records

18551900
codeblocks	turboc++	g++	gcc

18552357
width	height
the rectangle reveals that the grob width and height are not correct

18552378
udp	tcp
if your system is sufficiently hard real time that a single round-trip latency matters then tcp is a poor protocol and you should be using udp instead

18552378
udp	tcp
nagle is a tcp only algorithm so it would not affect udp

18552416
width	height
i know it must have something to do with the uiwebview dimensions in my code above but is there a better way to simply display the webview on the entire screen without specifying a specific screen height and width

18552479
width	height
i d like to be able to adjust the overlay s frame to move it across the map and transform its height width and thus distort the image as necessary from user inputs

to get the right letter of the alphabet you first compute the right ascii value using ord shift it by and then get the character you need by converting the ascii value to a string using chr

18552555
getter	setter
also keep in mind that as you access your struct within your loop it s not just the instructions within the getter and setter you have to worry about

18552562
setlocale	strftime
i summarize here what i have found facing a similar problem since here there have been apparently no constructive answer a wrong one indeed setlocale does change the output of strftime and it can be useful for others

18552570
cout	ofstream
cout is not of type ofstream so you cannot bind an ofstream reference to it

18552570
cout	ofstream
output_stream should be type instead which will allow it to refer to either cout and a file stream since ofstream is a subclass of ostream

18552584
getter	setter
if you want a getter and a setter actually getter setter-like functions use this

18552588

18552823
google-chrome	firefox
see my fiddle for an example with coffeescript tested on firefox and google-chrome or this other fiddle that uses jquery

18552848

for example if the arrays is set to hold up to 50 elements but an unknown amount of them are already full what does the for-loop look like that allows you to begin filling in more data on the first open element

18552858
int	double
operators in scala are actually methods + is a method of int and long double ... in scala oo foundation

18552880
int	double
when i try to use a numericarray of type int numericarray with the operator when the factor argument is a double

18552880
int	double
i thought in c++ it was a simple matter of default protocol where int double double

18552907
folder	directory
also i ve tried the solution here built-in gallery in specific folder but it just shows one image not all images within the directory

18552909
int	double
so in the above expression 2.5 which is a double is going to be converted into int as it is passed to the overloaded as argument

18552909
int	double
that also means 2.5 double becomes 2 int and factor is basically 2

18552909
int	double
what if t is double and u is int

18552956

you can also change the foreach loops to a for-loop which would remove that exception but could have other consequences like a null reference exception

18553332
addclass	removeclass
you could check addclass method here and removeclass method here

18553334

integer	unsigned	floating-point	integer
fragment outputs can only be float single-precision floating-point vectors signed or unsigned integers or integer vectors or arrays of any these

18553902
int	chars
with gcc s -wconversion warning it looks like chars and shorts are implicitly converted to int

18553902
unsigned	short
i looked into if further and unsigned short unsigned short 0 results in 0xffff

18553902
unsigned	short
where as unsigned short 0 results in 0xffffffff

18553907
udp	tcp
if it returns 0 then a 0-length packet was received impossible for tcp but possible for udp

18553908
pop-up	dialog

pop-up	dialog
however when i try again to push with the correct password in mind the dialog doesn t pop-up again---it seems to try again using the incorrect one i had previously typed

18553928
crypt	hash
the first difference between the two would therefore be that crypt is only for calculating the hash

18553928
crypt	hash
crypt is needed for verifying the hash but again you have to make your own implementation

18553928
crypt	hash
secondly crypt allows you to create bad hash using obsolete hash types

18553928
crypt	hash
crypt in providing flexibility also allows the programmer more room to make mistakes in choosing the wrong hash type and unless you constantly monitor security warnings you may not even know that what you are doing is wrong or that perhaps a new and stronger hashing algorithm has been implemented in php

18553957
children	parent
the solution consists in the fact that parent disabled children s touch events then intercepts these events

18553957
children	parent
that methods will disable touches on children so the parent will manually handle them

18554007
width	height
when the width or height goes negative the rectangle is filled

18554042
free	malloc
say you were trying to use a malloc free -compatible api for interaction with c clients that allow specifying custom c-style allocators

int	double
if both operands are int the result will be an int which will be truncated and then it will be cast in to a double

18554051
put	get
i wanted to run through and put all of the rates in at the different weights and all but i couldn t even get this part to work

18554054
integer	unsigned
the integer promotions 6.3.1.1 basically say that all integer types smaller than int are promoted to int if int can represent all values of the original type or unsigned int otherwise

18554112
getter	setter
the api of the product object hides the fact that the specifications are stored in a collection and provides getter and setter for each individual specification

18554112
getter	setter
if i make the specifications a set i have to implement the getter and setter like this

18554112
getter	setter
i did try maintaining a hashmap internally and having the getter and setter for the specifications accept and return sets with a conversion taking place in the getter and setter

18554132
google-chrome	firefox
this should be enough to let the drop work in firefox and google-chrome

18554143
folder	directory
i am in the parent directory and the images folder is in there

18554155
implements	extends
some may argue that the strategy pattern should be implements at the class level rather than by extends an instance of a class but this way strikes me as easier to follow and is less likely to screw up other instances that need to choose other strategies

18554164
google-chrome	firefox
works in ie8+ | google-chrome | firefox

18554268
post	get
have a read at architecture of the world wide web volume one and uris addressability and the use of http get and post by w3c

momentjs	datejs
as mattjohnson noted datejs has been abandoned but you can use alternatives like momentjs

18554404
folder	directory
moving up a directory assuming you re in a sub folder users perhaps you can use the

fadein	fadeout
you can use jquery fadein on open and fadeout on close but if you want to do it with pure javascript i recommend reading this source code

18554420
spaces	delimiter
your problem is that evidently spaces are regarded as delimiter by default hardly surprising

18554426
globalization	localization
i have an mvc website which i wanted to implement a globalization localization

start by setting the sliders min value to 0.5 and max to 1.5 and linking its value changed control event to an ibaction set up to look something like this

18554711
for-loop	loops
third the outer while loops is not really necessary though you can add it but a simple inner for-loop will suffice

18554730
portrait	landscape
if i tilt the tablet to a new orientation from portrait to landscape or vice versa then the entire activity is recreated and the new table shows all the correct data

18554782
google-chrome	firefox
i recommend debugging with the developer tools in google-chrome or with firebug in firefox

18554823
for-loop	loops
in your case each iteration through the while loops creates a for-loop

18554833
folder	directory
therefore in order to support having sub folder within your partials directory you will have to add another rule to your app and define a function to handle rendering this template

18554839
integer	unsigned
this should probably also have a free function to_scalar or something which returns an unsigned integer type given either an individual flag or a flag_bits set

18554842
int	chars
i am receiving an exception when i insert to many hex chars into a string that is being converted to an int value

18554889
post	get
i assume xml over http service can either be accessed using get or post method

you could use a double or if you ll always be storing int you d probably be better off with a long int

18555042
width	height
if two rectangles have the same height and width they are equal and have the same hashcode

18555042
width	height
when i try to call contains on a new rectangle with same height and width it returns false

18555043

18565682
integer	fractions	division	multiplication
first of all being red an integer strictly smaller than 7 will always result in 0 that s because writen this way you are instructing the compiler to perform an integer division followed by an integer multiplication that is ignoring decimal fractions

18565682
unsigned	short
furthermore you use unsigned short as a synonym for std uint16_t and likewise unsigned int as a synonym for std uint32_t what is not required to hold on every platform nor even between different compiler versions on the same platform so i would strongly recommend using the aforementioned fixed size integers which can be found in

18565699

subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
this will filter numbers only though i would suggest that you make buttons that add the number to a plain text view so the user never has the option to edit the text unless they are using the buttons you make if all you are doing is making an add subtract multiplying divide calculator then it would be a much easier way of doing it

18575137
width	height
my previous answer can only take you as far as finding the height width but it does actually not change the height width of the div itself

18575137
width	height
so after the width height is found using my previous answer here is how to change the width height of the div in question

18575137
width	height
when you are done editing your text you can update width and height by calling a function defined below

18575137
width	height
this will set the height and width of your div to be equal to the height and width of your text area

18575137
width	height
by doing like so you can change the height and width of any giving id according to any other in your project

18575208
post	get
this function can t take post id or post object as parameters so you have to add to get access to it

it works correctly on google-chrome firefox safari and so on

18575221
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
this is exactly what s happening in ie 10 and firefox but when i run this in safari google-chrome the contents keep on shrinking as if there is no min-height

18575221
google-chrome	safari
since this is happening in safari google-chrome both of which use the webkit engine i am inclined to believe it is a webkit problem

18575235

this means that using printwriter to write lines of text and bufferedreader to read lines of text would make more sense

18575405

jruby	rubinius
this gets interesting if you run your server with a different implementation of ruby like jruby or rubinius

18575671
jruby	rubinius	jruby	mri	mri	rubinius
jruby is pretty speedy and while rubinius is slow compared to mri multithreaded rubinius processes data faster than mri

18575671
jruby	rubinius	jruby	mri	mri	rubinius
for puma i would say the bottleneck is your choice of interpreter mri vs rubinius or jruby and the type of work your server is doing lots of cpu bound tasks vs non-blocking io

18575671
puma	unicorn
i don t know what the best worker amount is for unicorn or puma in your case

18575821
ssl	https
with ssl interception you ask for an https connection to for example www.google.com the company s switch router proxy hands you a valid certificate naming www.google.com as the endpoint so your browser doesn t complain about a name mismatch but instead of being countersigned by a mutually trusted third party it is countersigned by their own certificate authority operating somewhere in the company which also happens to be trusted by your browser since it s in your trusted root ca list which the company has control over

what i want to do is make those columns take up half of the width of the screen each and then have its child contents fill their own cells width height

18576906
width	height
here width and height you can provide according to the device s screen size for different devices by reading screen sizes programmatically

18576912
width	height
if you re trying to alter the size of the image set the height width attributes on the image not the header

18576932

18576976
geocoding	geocode
i am using google geocoding api v3 to geocode addresses

18577001

since svpulltorefresh is built on top of uiscrollview it works for anything else that is also built on top of uiscrollview like a uitableview or uicollectionview

18577085
width	height
you ll also need width and height

18577085
width	height

16-bit	64bit
i realize that there will likely be no special converter programs or anything easy like that for such a task but it imperative that i find some way to get a 16-bit program to run in 64bit windows

18577121
16-bit	64bit
the idea i had for this project was to decompile all the code from a 16-bit program copy it and re-compile it into 64bit code

18577121
16-bit	64bit
basically i want to make a 16-bit program run in 64bit windows without emulators

18577131

your app should be able to deal with multiple calls to onstart onstop onrestart onpause and onresume without getting confused

18577297
distance	polygons
polygons have finite area which means to calculate distance from them you need to pick a point somewhere on the polygons to use as your reference

18577297
distance	polygons
the simplest solution would be to use some measure of center for the polygons and test against that then it could be as simple as using euclidean distance

18577297
distance	polygons
for a more accurate measure of distance you might want the distance to the closest point on the polygons

18577297
distance	polygons
the example i mentioned above can be extended to give you the distance from the exterior of a bounding circle by subtracting the radius from the distance to the center of the polygons

18577303
children	parent
currently i am giving the parent issue a relationship with all of its children siblings

18577435
hide	show
here s my simple jquery code in which is used to hide show a dynamic element

18577455
portrait	landscape
i prefer the later mainly because it handles all the portrait and landscape modes

18577468
width	height
the 50 attributes are moving the div to the center of the page but it is moving the top left corner of the div to the center so you ll need to subtract half the height and width of the div to make it center properly make those adjustments to the margin-top and margin-left properties

18577540
gruntjs	yeoman
my gruntjs file is the vanilla one provided when you scaffold an angularjs app with yeoman no plugins or jquery just angular

18577648
for-loop	loops
but then i tried rewriting it into a for-loop and it gets stuck in an infinite loops

18577655
for-loop	loops
i also read that if the object is very large a for-loop or any type of php loops would slow down the insertion process

18577712
width	height
edit just to spare you confusion the indices i and j need to be in 0 height and 0 width respectively where height and width are the dimensions of the array in y and x

18577721
int	chars
you just wouldn t be able to access smaller amounts of data using standard c syntax without bit masks and bit shifts or bit-fields because other data types like short int are defined in terms of chars

18577722
translation	localization
i am building a django app that uses django s translation features to provide localization to multiple languages

18577743

min	max
not individual min max values for a field

18577819
ready	each
on dom ready wrap each overflow scroll element with a wrapper with position relative

18577819
width	height
on touch start for each ancestor with overflow scroll set overflow visible position absolute get calculated height width and apply these as inline styles and set top to be the negative of scrolltop â and set the wrapper s overflow to hidden this means it will be in the same position it was in the first place but unable to move through scrolling

18577819
ready	each
if any scrolling elements are wrapped over after dom ready you will need to apply a wrapper for each

18577842
joomla	phpbb
there are others like joomla phpbb etc

18577851
python-requests	beautifulsoup
i have a multi-threaded application which runs http requests using the python-requests library and beautifulsoup

google-chrome	firefox
mixed content is blocked by default in the current versions of firefox and google-chrome not checked ie

18577873
vmware	virtualbox
two off the top of my head that you could use are virtualbox by oracle or vmware

18578150
chown	chgrp
i used chown and chgrp to set owner and group to both www-data and root - neither worked

18578175
factors	matrix
the former makes sense because you have a mix of different types factors integers logicals and a matrix can only hold one type

18578175
do.call	lapply
if you have more columns you can use lapply and do.call to generalize the approach

18578192
post	get
however i have done as they have said and still if i do a post with values i do not get to the desired controller method

18578192
post	get
if i do add data to the post then i get an internal server error

18578213
width	height
while display none should be slightly faster because the browser doesn t have to make the calculations to fit that element in the flow of the page in reality this is only true if you re making lots of after-loading changes to the width height of the element with javascript

18578228
for-loop	arrays
if you are going to stick with the arrays the ugly for-loop is your best bet for compatibility

numbers with decimals are double and dividing an int by a double produces a double

switching	screens
the currentpageviewmodel value before and after the splash screens changes losing its binding while switching view

udp	rtp
make sure that the endpoint where you are sending the media the rtp stream itself - udp ports 10000 - 60000 is allowed in the remote firewall

18589521
udp	rtp
make sure that you are accepting all udp rtp ports from the remote systems - this can be tricky and i usually recommend allowing all udp ports from 1025 to 60000 on an sbc such as the one that you have - it is not risky as you cannot place or receive a call without signaling which you have protected on ports 5060-5080

18589521
rtp	sip	udp	rtp
a sip trace will show you the problem ip address and i would bet allow you to either open the firewall to allow said endpoint and or persuade you to open rtp to that server by opening the udp ports referenced above

18589524
initializer	class-method
but then to make them available for external use without initializer which is impossible for modules after all i extend the a module with itself which makes those methods become its class-method too

18591038
filtering	grouping
...however all this shouldn t really be necessary as it can be managed easily through the pre-defined csrf filtering in filters.php just add that filtering to the desired route or route grouping and you ll be protected without having to get into the details of it

18591056
for-loop	arrays
you could also use a for-loop counting from 0 to the arrays length since php automatically uses numbers as keys if you don t specify any but the above solution is probably more readable and will work with named keys

18591096
children	parent
do note that in your example a binary tree would suffice to represent the data as every parent has at most two children but i would have thought that you might encounter situations where this is not the case

free frees the memory space pointed to by ptr which must have been returned by a previous call to malloc calloc or realloc

18591227
for-loop	arrays
above arrays is just first iteration of for-loop so the above values get inserted into first arrays element

18591285

width	height
you just need to set the width and height of the parent div for that define the line-height of the span to know exactly the height of 2 lines

post	get
it could be the router was built for sale in an area that doesn t allow payload encryption and it was physically disabled by cisco during manufacturing or the chip is just broke and the reseller loaded it without encryption to get it to pass post on boot up

18602645
folder	directory
when i go back to the root of my searchable folder and click on another directory that is when i get the error and the line is highlighted

18602648
rar	zip
if you are copying many folders with files inside it can be usually better to just create a zip rar with the folder and files copy it to network path and unzip it

18602663
getter	setter	inherited	subclassing
well my answer to interviewer s question is - private members are not inherited in subclassing but they are accessible to subclassing or subclassing s object only via public getter or setter methods or any such appropriate methods of original class

18602663
getter	setter
the normal practice is to keep the members private and access them using getter and setter methods which are public

18602663
inherited	subclassing
here inherited simply means it is available directly in the subclassing to play around by newly introduced methods in subclassing

18602663
inherited	subclassing
if we try to use private variable x of parentclass in subclassing s method then it is not directly accessible for any modifications means not inherited

18602663
getter	setter
another simple example is clock superclass has hours and mins as private members and appropriate getter and setter methods as public

18602667
voip	rtp
you then need to send that encoded speech out over the network to the other end of the voip call and hence need to pack it into an ip packet typically using the rtp protocol

18602671
ciimage	uiimage	ciimage	cifilter	cifilter	uiimage
image.cgimage can return nil if the uiimage is backed by a ciimage which would be the case if you created this image using a cifilter

18602677
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
using a negative margin works in google-chrome and safari but not in firefox or ie

18602686
unsigned	short
the stack says that it is trying to read an unsigned short from your amf and it can t as the stream has no more bytes to read

18602689
nunit	moq
it would look something similar with moq and nunit

18602734
rolify	cancan
i have cancan and rolify set up with activeadmin and now it s time to force authorization on my controllers

18602756
google-chrome	firefox
works well on google-chrome and firefox

18602758
memcpy	strcpy
i hope this helps also consider using strcpy or wstrcpy instead of memcpy

18602774
ssl	https
under https ssl click manage certificates.

18602788
getter	setter
if xposition is already wpf certificate property all you have to do is create a property in your usercontrol with getter setter with setter calling inotifypropertychanged

18602833
post	get
i apologize guys i just don t get how to post questions here properly

18602842
lisp	smalltalk
however since smalltalk blocks donâ t support the equivalent of lisp â œrestâ arguments the curriedwitharguments method would have to explicitly enumerate and handle all arities we realistically expect to use in block invocations

18602846
width	height
i have the long lat bounds of the openstreetmap svg image its width height and the openstreetmap scale number although now i realize it might not mean the same as the scale in d3

18602858
rar	zip
yes you can have that app copy the zip rar to a network directory

18602858
rar	zip
at which point you should always zip rar and transfer...which would make the entire exercise rather pointless

18602930
google-chrome	firefox
this will work in firefox but not in google-chrome although it will work in google-chrome if you remove jquery

18602952
strlen	strncpy
if you familiarize yourself with the string manipulation functions that are available to you in such as strlen strncat and strncpy you shouldn t have much problem

18603005
folder	directory
in the paths tab add empty windows folder to your project representing each of the lib directory then in tools - deployment - configuration map those directory to your lib directory

18603018
post	get
i can t restore the post parameters here since it is a redirect and results in a http get request

18603055
mouse	keyboard
i m trying to get synergy to load when my mac starts up so i can use my mouse keyboard to log in

18603089
spaces	delimiter
modify the way the command line works so that it doesn t interpret spaces as delimiter for arguments

18603147
post	get
too load the next 6 thumbnail images from the database i have it setup so if there is no selected class in the ul then i load a php script to post the next 6 but i cannot get that to work

18603156
width	height
to create one you have to specify the width and the height of the bitmap to one of the createbitmap methods

18603156
width	height
but just in case i am wrong i guess the error will still be related with the fact that the bitmap holds the width and the height of the bitmap which determines the size of the byte buffer used to decode the bitmap

18603156
width	height
to troubleshoot try your very own same code to decode images of exactly the same width and exactly the same height

18603205
easygui	pygame
i am using osx mountain lion and i am using default python with pygame and easygui and command line tools installed trying to make my first app using kivy and i need cython to make the gui

i created a folder under the test directory to store some files needed for our tests

18603262

i have done some basic jquery code when clicking 3 time on next button it hide and when you click on previous button it show but than it doesn t run the 3 click loop

18603275
implements	extends
public class mainactivity extends fragmentactivity implements

18603278
folder	directory
you should have a client folder in your meteor root application directory

18603289
implements	extends
i ve considered extends edittext and implements something to use the textwatcher but i m again not sure about the best way to go about this

18603317
int	chars
you are converting numerical chars values to int s here

18603336
subtraction	addition
so far my addition and subtraction work

18603336
division	multiplication
but my multiplication and division do not

18603336
put	get
this is because the first two numbers i put in get added and them the operation is done

18603371
x86	64bit
note windows 32 bits x86 folder and windows 64bit x64 folder

18603411
post	get
everything works fine for requests that do not include an image but when an image is included in the original post i get

18603416
filtering	grouping
this isn t working for me but that appears to be due to a problem with one of my grouping - if i filtering that one problem grouping out it works fine

18603425
google-chrome	safari
i assign the back div an opacity of .25 and the front div an opacity of 1 -- but the front div still is not opaque in google-chrome and safari at least.

18603435
int	chars
but the chars value is implicitly converted into an int before the call to toint16 anyway so it is effectively converting the chars code into its int equivalent into itself

18603464
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
suppose i have an expression formed by integer variables and arithmetic operations addition subtraction and multiplication

18603464
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
i know that each multiplication takes m seconds and each addition subtraction takes a seconds

18603469

go to localhost 3000 blog post index and i get error no route matches get blog post index

18603525
range	median
i have created a a range chart in the visual studio for ssrs 2008 r2 and to this i added a median line

18603525
range	median
however the ssrs will happily ignore any formatting i set for this median line unless the same setting for the range formatting is set to none automatic

18603583
width	height
im trying to have a div re-size so that the height stays the same width as the height

18603583
width	height
the width changes size because of percentages however the height is changed using jquery

18603583
width	height
basically i want the width and height at 1 1 ratio to stay the same but scale to the size of the browser window on any change on either property

18603586
hide	show
so when i go to use my onmouseover onmouseout functions it only hide show 1 of the array elements

18603599
mouseleave	mouseenter
that problem is quite easy to fix if you remove all fiddling with inline styles altogether and use another class - for mouseenter handler to set and mouseleave to remove

18603605
google-chrome	safari
i ve noticed that for the html5 audio element what works on the latest version of google-chrome for pcs will not necessarily work on the default browser in android google-chrome for android or safari on ios

18603678
subtract	add
the number of input devices not only varies from machine to machine it is possible that someone might add or subtract a usb device while the program is running

18603698
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
1 is the name of the file i m importing from my apache nginx and lighttpd boxen all use this same format

18603745
width	height
edit the problem turned out to be not setting a height and width for the imageview

18603749
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
last of all it s better in javascript to use a for-loop on an arrays instead of a for-in loops

18603819
for-loop	arrays
changed to use for-loop rather than for-in - safer for an arrays

18603828
width	margin
by specifying the width and margin we easily give the right-most button enough room plus 4px

18603829
fadein	fadeout
my questions is when i hover on the menu it should fadein slowly and when hover out it should fadeout slowly

18603829
fadein	fadeout
i am also trying to use a timer so that when the user hovers on it it doesn t fadein or fadeout repeatedly

18603856
width	height
does anybody know how you can let a background image grow with the browser in terms of width and perhaps height as well

18603858
width	height
i can manually minimize the documentpane area but if possible i would like to fill that small area with another anchorable window so that layoutdocumentpane s width and height are zero

18603874
int	double
assume i am working with objects that have excusively numeric properties int and double like this

18603881
propertychangelistener	jcombobox	propertychangelistener	listeners
if you are worried about being notified when if the model changes you would need to attach a propertychangelistener to the jcombobox and monitor for the model property and update your data listeners accordingly.

18603884
versioning	upgrade
i suspected my editor pspad was adding spurious and invisible char codes or something so i upgrade to the latest versioning

18603887
for-loop	loops
therefore i have changed the existing by modifying the setentriescount from 10 to 30 start index from 2 to 2+i and kept everything in a for-loop so that i can extract info in loops

18603889
children	parent
then just mass iterate over each user or just the parent of memiozed entries and if it has values memiozed for all its children add them together and memoioze that value

18603905
button	checkbox	post	get
i believe checkbox and radio button don t send a get post data if not selected checked you can verify this by doing a var_dump print_r on _get _post so you should do something like

18603914
post	get
it was as creative as i could get with my limited knowledge and was done in another area than what my original post referred to

18603992
versioning	upgrade
if you cannot upgrade you ll have to wait a bit so we can convert answers to that versioning

18604028
pop-up	dialog
a word of caution pop-up dialog are a ui concept transplanted from desktop apps

18604182
sorting	filtering
take a look at how to use tables sorting and filtering

18604200
put	get
i noticed that when i install packages even globally they and their dependencies get put in .npm and are never removed even after uninstalling packages where the dependencies are no longer needed

18604207
pdfsharp	itextsharp
i have checked out pdfsharp and itextsharp which both don t look too complicated but there is an executable out there wkhtmltopdf which seems to by far have the best reviews

18604245
folder	directory
you need to ask hdfs if the folder is a directory not bash

18604334
width	height
the column will have a fixed width and the height will have to be cropped off proportionally to keep the image in it s original height to width ratio

18604348
width	height
this will keep the images in your site to a fixed width use max-width in case you don t want all of them to be the exact same width and the height will adjust itself accordingly to maintain aspect ratio

18604391
inherited	properties
this has a massive maintainability issue because when i add a new class that inherited from baseclass such as classc i need to add a new xmlarrayitem attribute to the rootclass.classes properties and to every other list that is used

18604420
nofollow	noindex
the page that the captcha contact form is on is not indexed noindex nofollow with the yoast plugin

std	ostream
nop or at least the standard library doesn t provide a default implementation of for container and std ostream

18604448
client-side	server-side
to do what you re trying to accomplish you ll have to make a client-side button whose ondblclick event calls the .click function of the server-side button s rendered element

18604465
width	height
if you really need scripts enabled in the page you could create an iframe with 0 height 0 width no borders etc

18604465
document.write	window.open
there s also the option of using window.open with document.write dom methods or whatever you like

hash	whirlpool	hash	md5	whirlpool	md5
i want to raise a question here regarding md5 hash and whirlpool hash

18604481
hash	whirlpool
i also learned a little bit about whirlpool hash

18604481
hash	whirlpool	hash	md5	whirlpool	md5
one more question i need to know any applications that use both md5 and whirlpool hash in their program

18604489
integer	unsigned
in particular variables and functions were of integer type by default -- and there was no unsigned keyword

18604489
int	chars	int	double
it had only four fundamental numeric types chars int float and double

18604489
integer	unsigned
furthermore signed integer types just tend to be more useful than unsigned types

18604491
multiplying	add
my problem is whenever i write the add or multiplying method in my rational class eclipse gives me an error

18604491
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	add	multiplying	addition	addition	multiplication
as i understand it the operators + - can only be used on primitive datatypes and since my private instance variables are biginteger s they are nonpprimitive datatypes and any addition or multiplication will have to be done through the add or multiplying method

18604491
multiplying	add
the error for the add and multiplying methods are the same and it says the constructor rational biginteger biginteger is undefined

18604492
width	height
your image doesnt have a height it only has a width

18604492
width	height
something like when the window height is this big the image use and when the window width is this big use

18604540

post	get
i am using this app for myself only so i am using mysql instead of rss so post go dialectally on fb as it get posted on my site .

18604568
google-chrome	firefox
this might be just a bug in google-chrome seems to work in firefox once you actually .setdata

18604577
int	chars
will always be not equal to eof since neither true not false equals eof so the program should infinite loop printing the chars that randomly showed up here since you never initialized c int c

18604604
cfstring	nsstring
the format specifiers supported by the nsstring formatting methods and cfstring formatting functions follow the ieee printf specification.

18604607
width	height
if you are setting it in an xml you can just set the width and height to a set amount like this

18604639
listener	eventhandler
one of the problems i have run into is that i created one class eventhandler to serve as the listener class for the entire program because there are components in each jpanel class northpanel and keypad for instance that need to communicate with each other

the post you reference shows a way provided in scala to get around this type erasure issue should you really need to ensure that you have a and not any other sub-type of some

18604688
button	checkbox
upon clicking specific checkbox radio button it will trigger the checked of other certain checkbox radio button

18604696
google-chrome	firefox
note however that in browsers like firefox and google-chrome by default the padding gets added to the width of the element

18604709
width	height
if you know exactly where you want the top and bottom of all elements to be which is seems like you do its usually easiest to use top bottom left and right rather than width and height as padding adds to the width and height and will cause nasty overflows

18604724

here the all the 3 objects are of extc class.extc class have actually 5 instance methods.process1 chars ch process2 chars ch process3 chars ch process1 int n process4 int n

18604792
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup events

18604824
serializable	deserialization
i have done this in my own project to handle the serializable and deserialization of a complex inheritance

18604824
implements	extends
implements ixmlserializable on your own is much more better if you have some dynamic mechanism in your framework like extends the classes by types that are loaded during the runtime of the program or if you dont want to edit your attributes every time

18604824
serializable	deserialization
and at deserialization time you can create the object via activator and the type you have serializable

18604827
portrait	landscape
the ux should be similar to youtube s so in portrait there is video playing at the top and some aditional views below it etc. and in landscape all there is is a fullscreen video

18604864
put	get	post	get	post	put
we have created a controller that is based on the paymentterm entity which allows the standard get get by key put post and delete for working with single instances of the paymentterm entity

18604864
put	get	post	get	post	put
however our ui team would like to retrieve a collection of payment terms easily done with the standard get collection manipulate it locally and then put or post the entire collection back to the server rather than having to make a series of put post and delete calls to the server

18604938
japplet	jdialog
the solution is not to dig through the source code of the swing jframe or better jrootpane which is what the jframe method will call but rather to either call the method on the right object a jframe derived object or other jrootpane using object such as a jdialog or japplet or to find another way to get your object of interest by studying the classes and methods available to you in the package of interest

18604949

18605022
avr	microcontroller
but this will require an avr in-system programmer a piece of hardware that program microcontroller to burn the bootloader

18605026
bash	zsh
if you define functions that way rather than using the syntax all of the common bourne shells bash zsh ksh 88 and 93 will localize variables defined with typeset and aliases to typeset like integer

18605026
pthreads	fork
the use of typset in combination with the alternative function definition syntax is the best solution there as the true pthreads mechanism requires the additional overhead of fork a new subshell

18605067
subtraction	addition
subtraction becomes addition when you use two s complement

18605079
postgresql	mysql
i would recommend reading source code for postgresql or mysql and see how they implement advanced sql parsing

18605095
rspec	capybara
once you are confident that you have enough unit tests you can start looking into using cucumber capybara or rspec capybara for feature testing

18605109
hide	show
just to add further i am using cascading dropdown for country and cities i am not sure if that is causing any problem i am also using two panels one has the form control and after successful submission i hide this panel show the other panel with success message all this code with updatepanel

18605144
width	height
either set layout width and height for the parent layout static or do it for the imageview

18605145
filtering	grouping
since the capture cards audio is routed into the demux i am not sure if the dvd-dv audio filtering is separate and can be controlled as a grouping of channels routing into the windows audio system

18605242
disk	ram
if your data is well balanced it means you are already handling more tps than you would if you were querying against old data - remember only data actually being used is loaded into physical ram - if you aren t reading some old data then it ll just quietly sit there on disk

18605269
post	get
when using get method though the full name of the property have to be used in uri because the formatter for fromuri is used while for post method jsonformatter is used

what is the highest performing query that joins a double precision foreign key to an int primary key

18605347
int	double
in this example fk is a double precision and pk is an int

hide	show
the code puts the data into separate divs calls isotope on each one then hide or show them based on some buttons that the user clicks

18605399
union	distinct
to emulate union you need just to add distinct

many-to-many	one-to-many
one-to-many many-to-many allows - join select and subselect

18605401
many-to-many	one-to-many
one-to-many many-to-many allows immediate layzy extra lazy

18605420
width	height
you should give the view a fixed width constraint and a fixed height constraint from the menu editor -- pin -- width and likewise for height then delete the horizontal and vertical space constraints leaving the centerx and centery constraints

18605493
min	max
you can use of arrays#sort method to find max or min number in the array

18605493
min	max
sort method sorts the array in ascending order.then the first element of array is min number and last element of array is max

18605535

add type option as post to your ajax since you are retriving the value as post ...default is get

18605819
width	height
i notice that you re creating bitmaps that have integral width and height by multiplying the scale factor by an initial width and height and then rounding or likely truncating to the nearest integer

18605819
width	height
however you then do a scale transformation by the floating point scale amount so the scale amount won t quite match the actual bitmap width and height

18605826
equals	gethashcode
as a final note i would consider overriding the equals and gethashcode methods of object

18605833
equals	gethashcode
just overriding equals and gethashcode should suffice

18605838
shapefile	geojson
i converted a shapefile to geojson then tried to create a svg image and bind my geojson data using d3

int	chars	int	double
now lets assume my arraylist has the values chars int double and serves as the schema for reading my binary file

18605918
int	chars	int	double
that means for the first two bytes in the byte array i want to interpret as a chars the next four as an int and the next 8 as a double and this will repeat itself until the file is over

18605924
google-chrome	firefox
you can use that library and develop an extension to firefox google-chrome and perhaps together with ativex-components to ie

width	height
this is a continuation of height equal to dynamic width css fluid layout

18608804
width	height
therefore i d like the element to automatically reduce the width of the element in case the height is too big

18608804
width	height
everything works ok if the height is high enough width works properly and aspect ratio is kept

18608804
width	height
as you can see here the width is reduced which in turn reduces the height to avoid scrollbars while keeping the aspect ratio at 16 9

18608813
cvs	svn
either do cvs svn clean or manually delete all the class build files

18608845

int	double
you can join int and double directly

18608884
int	double
round double returns a double anyway not an int

18608884
int	double
the joins will succeed only for the double that represent an int

18608884
int	double
if you want to join 6.000001 to 6 cast the double to int to join values in the range 6.0 6 7.0

18608884
int	double
the type cast makes more sense if the double are supposed to represent int

18608884
int	double
but if the double are supposed to represent int you shouldn t be getting values like 6.000001 in the first place

then your setter getter wouldn t have retain release messages included

18609264
cpu	processors
to compensate for this the chip will have a read cache between the flash and the cpu so that most reads from flash as it is read-only will be performed without the processors having to wait for the data to arrive

18609264
disk	ram
when a hard disk controller is ordered to read data into ram it does so with a great deal of autonomy

for-loop	arrays
of course allocating an arrays and filling it with a for-loop would probably some milliseconds faster than using linq

18609569
rtp	rtcp
add another week if you ve never worked with rtp rtcp before as while they re not complex per-say properly responding to the feedback you get from rtcp can be challenging and is somewhat of a dark art though quite critical to ensuring optimal network utilisation and media quality

using em to measure the height and width of the #block also has the added advantage that if the font size is changed then the box resizes to fit the text accordingly

18609889

your current limit is probably 63 once you take into account stdin stdout and stderr already being opened and i don t know of a system that goes that low so it s probably your ulimit but you need to be aware of the other limit

18610094
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged	implements	extends
therefore you could extends the class and manually implements the inotifycollectionchanged and inotifypropertychanged interfaces yourself to get the best of both worlds

google-chrome	firefox
that s when i realized that google-chrome and firefox don t wrap tables around floated elements the same

18620111
google-chrome	firefox
in fact google-chrome does it right and firefox doesn t

perl	tcl
there are interpreted languages out there such as lisp tcl perl etc. that make it easy to define a lambda proc sub within your code during runtime and to evaluate it within the same session

18620183
popupwindow	pop-up
as far as i know it is not possible to use the popupwindow class to create a pop-up that will only block some of the screen behind it

18620283
onkeyup	onkeydown
you have to detect the shift key on your own using onkeydown and onkeyup

18620294
fadein	fadeout
i want to add a fadein and fadeout of showing up div but i don t know how to achieve this

18620304
portrait	landscape
note that this is important to do in any fragment since every time the layout changes from portrait to landscape or vice versa the fragment will be recreated

18620349
google-chrome	firefox
but it does seem like adding will make firefox behave more like google-chrome in this specific case

18620351
width	height
this is happening because google maps api needs to know the width and the height of your control elements to know where to position them - when the map is rendered

18620388
fadein	fadeout
you should be able to add fadein and fadeout effects to the .hover mouse events

18620435
put	get	post	get	post	put
the specification of rest is that we use the http methods which he calls verbs. get post put delete

18620435
post	get
a direct request would be limiting it or you would be using at most two method verbs - get and post

18620437
int	chars
this is because you are trying to print a int array where each element has a size of 4 byte 4 chars on 32bit machines at least

18620455
spaces	delimiter
a complete token is preceded and followed by an input that matches the delimiter pattern which is a blank spaces by default

18620773
x86	64bit
the only way i ve been able to get php 5.5 to work with apache 2.4 on windows 7 and 8 is to make sure apache and php are both either 32-bit x86 or 64bit x64 and that apache and php are both thread safe ts

18620780
post	get
as he noted in tutorial this is necessary he means no_capybara option when using one of the http request methods directly get post patch or delete i can understand by this that in the submitting a patch request to the users#update action there is a patch method in use but what is the relationship between sign_in method above and this line of patch method in my understand i think that sign_in is used before using patch so why we should add this option of no_capybara

18620784
range	minimum
for instance if the search region is -100000 100000 golden finds the minimum in 25 function calls as opposed to 200000 - the dependence of the number of calls in golden section on the range is logarithmic not linear

18620784
range	min
so if the range is sufficiently large other methods can definitely beat min by requiring less function calls

18620816
uicollectionview	reloaddata
i have tried implement the searchview into an section header of the uicollectionview but in this way i can not use reloaddata while a cell of the collection view is the first responder

18620926
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i am experiencing this in safari firefox google-chrome

18620937
accessor	ivar
without accessor you need to audit every place you assign the ivar directly and make sure you re releasing the old value correctly

18620987
ubuntu	debian
make a package .deb on debian or ubuntu .... for your libyours and that package will depend appropriately on other packages

18620989
children	parent
for some reason if the parent iframe src is set last it s asynchronous it also replaces the src of the children s iframes with its own

18621011
integer	unsigned
it could be unsigned it could be a small integer type or a large one

18621011
integer	unsigned
therefore the best way to achieve what you want is to #define all constants as unsigned integer literals

18621041
folder	directory
i have a directory with many folder containing hundreds of .sph files

18621121
portrait	landscape
i m trying to display an xpsdocument in a landscape mode but the viewer always display it in portrait

18621121
portrait	landscape
i used a word application to configure the document portrait landscape + pagesize then export it to an xpsdocument

18621142
jobs	cron
your cron.sh will only set up magento cron jobs up to 20 minutes ahead and so the 12 30 job will not get scheduled but since magento s cron.sh is set to run on the hour it will never get scheduled

18621173
getter	setter
and one great feature of using controllers is the getter setter it auto creates for your refs

18621180
unsigned	short
in short your code is only legitimate if both structure types have an unsigned int for their first member

18621355
onresume	onpause
i have tried to stop it by using close within overriden method onstop onresume and onpause

18621363
int	chars
because you declared a as an int so those signle chars you initialized would result in an error

18621390
folder	directory
one thing that i noticed when first trying your code on my downloads folder was that it threw an ioexception when it encountered an item in the directory list that was actually a directory itself

18621399
createelement	each
i was trying to avoid writing each property out with createelement writeelement

18621407
puts	gets
when you add another go sendenum 0 c it actually gets a value on the second channel receive puts it into the y variable prints x and y out and the program finishes succesfully

18621452
post	get
i wrote an autocomplete plugin for my website which takes a file path and and the search data and then does a post to get results

18621512
hide	show
however when i m using the library and i include button.hpp i get this error from the setshown calls in show and hide

18621512
hide	show
i can fix the problem by removing the inline from show and hide and defining them in the source file like normal or by making setshown inline as well

18621526
ioexception	printwriter
p.s you no longer need the try-catch around the output.println as printwriter s print and println methods don t throw ioexception

18621563
postorder	inorder
most of the questions and articles i have seen say that we need pre-order and i-order or postorder and inorder

18621632

get all post of type cpt1

18621650
width	height
this example uses an array of objects describing the url width and height of each item in the list

if you are having problem running your app in the backgrounding i suggest reading the backgrounding multitasking guide

18621851
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i have tested on the latest version of safari google-chrome and firefox

18621894
hide	show
you could use it if you would have some toggle function that show hide template but i think that template by default is ng-show true

18621915
google-chrome	firefox
you know what i think i ll even go about and let empiricism do its thing google-chrome ie10 9 8 will fail firefox will be okay

18621918
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
when i test it as a plain html file it looks ok in various browsers firefox ie google-chrome safari android phone browsers

18621925
for-loop	loops
in the second for-loop you set found true but loops will keep going meaning the last number it searched if it was false then found false also changed it to mat i j instead of mat row col so it doesn t check the same one every time

18621926
children	parent
i ve gotten the class names used for the parent container and its children but searching for occurances of those in the javascript docs using opera s dragonfly didn t yield any matches

18621935

18622004
pop-up	dialog
i have a modal pop-up dialog box that loads a form to be submitted to the database

18622008
google-chrome	firefox
this issue only happens in ie everything works just fine with firefox and google-chrome

18622039
converter	multibinding
after some testing it seems that when a child binding in a multibinding fails due to unsetvalue or failure to find bound property the child binding s fallbackvalues get passed into the converter on the multibinding

18622039
converter	multibinding
i don t understand this requirement as the multibinding converter can take values from bindings that don t match that type

18622039
converter	multibinding
with this in mind the easiest workaround is to modify your multibinding s converter to handle multiple types

18622112
int	boolean
i have many situations where i d like to multiply with boolean true value and treating it as int of 1 or -1 would also make it

18622120
int	boolean
and on the public void onprogresschanged seekbar seekbar int progress boolean b method i call to determine where the thumb is positioned

18622140
hide	show
i was trying to show the text field if yes and hide it if we select no radio button

18622152
int	chars
already tried to read chars and int but nothing worked

18622184
width	height
in uiscrollview however it seems to use the size width of the frame if the constraint is centered centerx which is why my subview centered normally within the uiscrollview but when adding constraints to right-align a subview it uses the contentsize width height

18622189
onresume	onpause
the process of my app is to saving the object onpause and getting the object onresume

18622193
sorting	grouping
i ve tried a ton of combinations of grouping sorting and moving the subreport in and out of the header and detail sections but to no avail

18622227
getter	setter
i use delegate of attribute setter getter and dirty tests where needed like

18622304
oncreate	setcontentview
let me guess you didn t call setcontentview r.id.xml_file_layout in your activity oncreate - just after the call to super.oncreate savedinstancestate

18622344
post	get
there are so many examples of passing data from one page to another using get and post in php

18622373
inherited	properties
uiimageview inherited from uiview whose user interaction properties is set to yes by default however uiimageview s user interaction properties is set to no by default

18622373
uipangesturerecognizer	uipinchgesturerecognizer
here s an example of how to create a uiimageview with a uipinchgesturerecognizer a uirotationgesturerecognizer and a uipangesturerecognizer

18622389
superclass	subclassing
the issue i have is that when creating an instance of the subclassing atomcontent in this case i get back an instance of the superclass and thus superclass methods are called rather than those in the subclassing

18622426
apache	nginx
here are two possible answers 1 setup ports directly with docker and use nginx apache to proxy the vhosts or 2 use dokku to manage ports and vhosts for you which is how i learned to do method 1

18622476
post	get
you can pass variables via get and post

18622483
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and ie always have access to event and event window.event but firefox has neither unless passed and set explicitly so i was wondering if there was a way to prototype event objects to copy themselves into the global space

18622501
google-chrome	firefox
this is working in ie firefox and google-chrome

18622517
google-chrome	firefox
video is working in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

18622598
coffeescript	haml
i have source code for an app that uses ember coffeescript haml with rails

18622627
google-chrome	safari
found a posting by optimus.prime and this resolves it - the answer is that when you have dialogs the widgetvar should be different than the id - otherwise safari and google-chrome do not render the page

18622643
folder	directory
here i have multiple sub folder in the root directory

18622645
int	double
the you assigned it to would allow both double and int to be added to it but the actual contents of a might be float

18622672
jsf	wicket
but i do know a cost comparison of some java web frameworks spring 9k wicket 59k gwt 6k and jsf 49k

18622681
folder	directory
the problem i m having is that when i update my database version i have to continuously change the names of the new directory so my scripts that point to old folder have to be updated

18622700
mouseout	mouseleave
instead of using mouseout use mouseleave

18622730
ssl	https
the best approach to solve https over insecure ssl certificate it s use a node-curl module and set ssl_verifypeer to false

18622752
min	max
i need to find the best path in graph from vertex a to vertex b with assumption that path quality is calculated as min value of edge weight on path and next the best path is that which has max min value

18622794
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
my code works in firefox and internet explorer and will do either part 1 or part 2 in google-chrome safari if i remove the other part

18622837
post	get
my goal is to be able to get get post data on both the server side and the client side

18622837
post	get
now if i can just find a clean way to get the post data to be available on the client

18622844
range	median
but i had figured out a workaround to make the median its own part of the graph so it s not tied to the range

18622844
range	median
i do not consider this the answer though it does answer my second question since it takes quite a bit of extra work but if someone must have a median in their range graph and google takes them to this question i thought sharing this would be worthwhile

18622844
range	median
to change the border and marker formatting for the derived series change them in the underlying range the range graph type seems to ignore these properties at least as far as i can tell. note that setting the borderstyle on the range to none will keep the median from showing up at all no matter the other settings

18622844
min	max
then i had to use max min in combination to get a single table i could use in a chart

18622844
range	median
create your range chart as you normally would then add a new value for the median

18622845
post	get
what i want is a powershell library that can easily send get post requests and easily manage cookies between requests

18622870
ssl	https
you can stream video and anything else over a https ssl -encrypted connection

18622870
google-chrome	firefox
webrtc official page see here for webrtc draft will support encryption on connection but currently this technology is relative experimental and unstable but available in both google-chrome and firefox normal versions

18622874
google-chrome	firefox
works now in google-chrome and firefox

18622886
post	get
then you might get the post array in the php script

18622979
rspec	capybara
there s a have_select matcher if you use capybara with rspec

18622989
mdpi	hdpi
the picture is in mdpi and hdpi and my testing device samsung galaxy s i think it s no more than hdpi

18622999
width	height
win- size array width 960 height 400

18623056
google-chrome	firefox
i recreated your page and tested in 3 browsers google-chrome firefox ie8

18623070
int	chars
if it s possible please explain why because it seems to work fine here in codeblocks but it doesn t make sense for me because they are from different types one is unsigned chars and the other one is int

18623088
put	get
as soon as i put the horizontal alignment to right the textboxes get crushed like this

18623147
int	chars
yes you can assign chars to int because chars is 8 bit wide int is 32 depends on the architecture but on pcs and 32 bit arms it is 32 bit wide

18623160
mouse	keyboard
note also that this function should only be called inside the functions that process keyboard or mouse input events

18623185
width	height
i am not familiar with the php api but it looks like the source width and source height provided are wrong may be you can calculate as

18623197
qtableview	qlistwidget
i am interested in styles for qbuttons qtableview and qlistwidget

18623213
apple-touch-icon	favicon
edit other similar files might include crossdomain.xml favicon apple-touch-icon

18623214
hide	show
the problem was fixed by taking the content of this sub-template and putting it in the same html file as the map it is overlaying and then toggling hide show for that content

18623239
width	height
i have an object with width w and height h

18623242
listboxitem	textbox
if you wanted to put all the items in the listbox into the textbox with a newline in between each listboxitem you could do something like this

18623297
stdout	stderr
the invoked program will use the current stdin stdout and stderr objects of your ruby program

18623322
folder	directory
downside of this schema is complex inserts since when adding a new file or folder directory parents must be filled by getting ids of parents from neighbour files or directory

18623336
migrate	upgrade
i would like for my installed packages to migrate seamlessly once we have upgrade

18623376
opera	firefox
use firefox firebug or opera dragonfly to check if big images are exist and are accessible

just extends from this trait org.specs2.mutable.beforeafter it comes with before and after methods implements them here is a link to documentation docs

18623450
post	get
i can t get the following code to pass a like parameter a return just the post starting with jazz

18623461
width	margin
not to work but you can use width and margin to make sure it prints fine

18623468
777	tmp
you can easily change the permissions on the files prior to your tar command although i generally recommend people never use 777 for anything except tmp on a unix system it s more productive to use 755 or worst case 775 for directories

18623538
capistrano	rvm
the dev server has a gemset for my project called vcc but as is clear across the internet capistrano does its bundle install into shared bundle rather than the rvm gemset

18623564
inline	inlining
if you use link-time optimization where cross-file inlining is done by the linker then the inline hint for the compiler is not very useful anyway

18623564
inline	inlining
there s no portable way to force inlining - in fact most modern compilers ignore the keyword completely and use heuristics instead to decide when to inline

18623573
google-chrome	firefox
browser compatibility should also be noted from the previous answer which i m upvoting however the case here in firefox google-chrome is what i ve written

18623643
stackmob	kinvey
instead of using a baas parse quickblox mobsquad kinvey stackmob i have decided to build out the backend using the aws ios sdk

18623716
hide	show
one not recommended solution to ensure each radio button show hide the correct p element is to use css classes to differentiate each p and element

18623774
ubuntu	linux
i m running my cakephp app on a linux server ubuntu 3.7 it s cakephp 2.3.7 and php 5.3.1

18623854

18623862
submit	submission
i am have created a form that submit to a spreadsheet and i ve created a script that should display the submission on to an html page

18623886
many-to-one	one-to-many
so first off i want to clarify that i am trying to make one-to-many relationships not many-to-one

18623934
inline	inlining
skipping whether you should be inlining at all for the reasons you give the standard way to inline in cocoa is to use the predefined macro ns_inline - use it either in the source file using the function or in an imported header

18623974
put	get
note that neither the get nor the put creates any attachment between the item in the list and the item which is read or written

18623976
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome will update a bit more briskly

18623976
setinterval	clearinterval
i ve used similar to what bfavaretto suggests with setinterval and clearinterval to manage the individual frame tweening on animations for ie because of it s hesitancy to paint successive updates - esp with the likes of the jquery ui progress bar

18623977
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
bufferunderflowexception is an unchecked-exception it extends runtimeexception so it doesn t need to be declared to be thrown and neither it needs to be handled

18624071
spaces	delimiter
you can use strtok to split the string specifying your delimiter in this case a spaces

18624099
button	checkbox
when the checkbox is checked it should remove the attribute disabled from a button near the checkbox

18624192
button	checkbox
in your case checkbox is not a children of button so you cannot use closest

18624195
next	except
if we match an or next we do the match or template which is almost identical to the and except it outputs the word or

18624206
pop-up	dialog
when you run this code a dialog will pop-up asking if you want to allow access to the item

18624221
phpdocx	opentbs
i don t use phpdocx or make pdfs from my opentbs stuff but it looks like phpdocx has hardcoded the relationship name into their image recognition

18624236
hide	show
something that has worked for me in this situation is to put a class on the button i want to show hide instead of relying on the id

18624250
tiff	png
for ocr purpose i would scan a document at 300dpi b w or grayscale and uncompressed tiff or png format

18624320
min	max
it might replace the condition on the chart1_mousemove method although not the min max x y calculations required for moving between the different systems of reference chart and chartarea ones anyway

18624351
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this works fine in firefox google-chrome and opera but window.opener is null in ie8-10

18624436
html5lib	beautifulsoup	lxml	html5lib	lxml	beautifulsoup
an external parser lxml or html5lib and use beautifulsoup with

18624436
lxml	html5lib
solution is to install an external parser lxml or html5lib and use

18624440
google-chrome	safari
however if i view the site in google-chrome 29 or safari 5 my social div logo image and featured post image are positioned differently than expected

onmousedown	onmouseup
where it breaks down is firing events such as onmouseup onmousedown etc

18624494
width	height
1 get aspect ratio from width and height of image php or js

18624522
multibyte	substr
also be aware of whether you re in utf-8 or a single byte encoding such as latin-1 which becomes important when using substr you don t want to chop in the middle of a multibyte utf-8 character

18624631
disk	ram
it s the operating system s job to have that block of memory in ram when addressed but it might swap it out to disk at its discretion

18624645
mandrill	spf
you should be able to omit the mandrill info from your spf record because it s already included by virtue of including the mailchimp one that mailchimp record includes mandrill too

18624653
for-loop	loops
i ve started by creating a for-loop to run from numbers 1 to 20 then i know i have to create another loops that divides a certain number by every number between 1 and 20 if the modulus of these two numbers is not 0 then skip to the next number increment by 1 until i find the smallest number

18624659
int	double
int and int double has both instances instance num int and instance eq int and program is valid

18624661
post	get
size attr instead to get the featured image for any post

18624673
stdout	stderr
you re using zsh s operator which redirects stderr and stdout

18624678
superclass	subclassing
and the compiler is waiting for you to assign any object that passes th is-a test to this variable type and since b extends a it is-a a any subclassing is-a superclass

18624678
inherited	subclassing
thanks to polymorphism inherited no need to change any thing of your code just subclassing any class and create your own implementation to it s methods and live with it

18624692
pop-up	dialog
when there is a facebook app present then it logs in through facebook app and when there is no facebook app present web dialog pop-up and asks for the user name and the password

18624719

suggestion in the javascript use a setinterval instead of a recursive settimeout and keep a reference to that interval around so you can clearinterval later and stop the polling

18640862
inherited	properties
you also could give a plain object an own tostring properties that shadows the inherited one and is not a function but i guess that would ve trown a distinct error

18640868
google-chrome	firefox
i found that it s better to use window.innerheight instead of because of different behaviour between google-chrome and firefox

18640902
union	distinct
union is the same but with a distinct applied to the combined sets

18640902
union	distinct
it would affect performance of the union all but may not affect union too much on top of the impact of the distinct because the optimiser might choose a distinct implementation that will return an ordered result set

18643295
post	get
the same applies for post http post and any get or post

18643341

18643466
int	double
since the super class s constructor doesn t take int double and string but rather it takes string double int representing name drate and hours

18643466
int	double
i suggest that your child class constructor accept in the parameter all the information needed for the super constructor a strinng for name double for drate and int for hours plus additional parameters the additional information for the new child class fields

18643492
width	height
put the grid view in a scrollviewer and let the height of the gridview be auto ie it will take the height of the entire content and width of the grid view to a specific one so that t cqn take only 3 items

18643679
gson	xstream
by the way xstream is originally meant to be serializing xmls you might try to use a dedicated json serializer library gson for instance

18643708
treemap	treeset
you can use a treemap which allows you to specify a comparator in its instantiation and will keep your elements sorted based on this comparator or a treeset if you wish to exclude duplicates

18643756
lodash	underscore.js
i know it s fun to use lodash underscore.js but if you have to use 2 functions instead of just using a regular loop you re better off using old_school coding style

18643777
min	max
your alternative if you don t want to set max and min values to your elements that use percentages would be to not set fixed widths on elements in the case of stack overflow it s content width is fixed at 980px and most everything else is fluid

18643802
bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
png tiff bmp you can at least determine the orientation of the image bitmap itself by doing this

i noticed also that on firefox and ie the little arrow expander at the top-left of each fieldset is tab-navigable but not with google-chrome

18643987
int	chars
you have compared to 1 but you re comparing apples to oranges specifically a chars to an int

18643988
width	height
for both method i provide though the container the li will still take up the full image s width and height

18643988
width	height
percentage width and height are calculated using the width and height of the image s container

18643988
width	height
in your example link the image s container the li has a width of 600px and no height value is given

18643988
width	height
on pc browser your width 75 height 75 is rendered as width 75 of 600px which is 450px height 75 of an undefined value which the browser understood as height auto

18644015
for-loop	loops
however the easy way to do what you want is to change your for-each loops to a for-loop that has only two iterations

18644039
width	height
so changing your elements width and height attributes

18644052
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your database tables depending on a database versioning namley the oncreate and onupgrade methods

18644052
versioning	upgrade
newversion will be 3 oldversion will be 1 for users upgrading from versioning 1.0 - so for those the upgrade from versioning 2.0 will be needed two for users upgrading from versioning 2.0 oldversion will be 2 so you only have to create your third table

18644059
viewdidappear	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear
neither viewdidload viewdidappear or viewwillappear are fired upon returning to the table

clang	llvm
is it clang or is it llvm directly

18644119
mouse	keyboard
the functions are used for selection and keyboard mouse interaction with the items in the view

18644211
implements	extends
you extended a class which has abstract methods methods without body in order to extends this class you must implements the methods

18644243

google-chrome	firefox
my code seems to run perfectly on ie9 but not on firefox and google-chrome which is bizzare as in most cases i ve read it is generally the other way around

18644374
children	parent
the way i did it was to implement the inavigationaware interface on the parent viewmodel and in the viewmodels of those scoped regions views and then on the parent viewmodel onnavigatedfrom method call the onnavigatedfrom of the children viewmodels

18644374
children	parent
bear in mind that you have to keep a reference of the children viewmodels in the parent viewmodel which i believe is not a bad practice

18644374

serializable	deserialization
however i ve tried to test use gson with class lacking default constructor and both serializable and deserialization work without any trouble

18645061
next	except
next level would be comparing the false case with p 4 and the true case with p 64 - this leaves you with exactly 3 options in each branch that could be covered by a logical or except the one between 32 and 64 which can be further broken down using p 48 this one isn t a round power of 2 so it works only on some cases i guess only where the msbs are equal

i then load it with simplexml in php but when i print the array that it created it only parses the parent and not the children

any	set-intersection
main difference between this method and alecxe s or ã scar lã³pez s solution is that it all short-circuits and doesn t create any set or list in the memory while set-intersection returns a new set that contains all items that are common with omit set and it s length is checked to determine whether any item was common or not. set-intersection happens internally at c speed so it is faster than normal python loops used in all

my initial thought was to simply brute force down from some large enough value of variable but i quickly realized that the number i m goal seeking may contain a fractions component so simple integer decrement may not work

each tooltip is initialized on absolute position on document ready top and left are already but the tooltips are hidden so on mouse hover the tooltip is just shown

18646151
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval can also be used just cancel it when done instead of starting a new timeout but i find the settimeout approach slightly easier to show conceptually

18646151
setinterval	settimeout
the difference is that setinterval will try to always run at time iteration timeout which can - in degenerate cases - be noticeably more consistent than multiple settimeout calls or as pointed out alnitak it can stack cascade harmfully

18646163
hide	show
it states control of the dialog deciding when to show hide dismiss it should be done through the api here not with direct calls on the dialog.

18646568
post	get
the register_globals feature added variables to the global scope whose names were determined by aspects of the http request get and post parameters and cookies

18646568
post	get
firstly register_globals itself is unlikely to unexpectedly produce a null variable since the get post and cookie values will always be strings with still returning true from isset and variables in the session should be entirely under the programmer s control

18646570

now incase your wondering why i have put this condition in this is because i get an indexoutofboundsexception due to the index incrementing to 5 when making this comparison

18646867
octal	binary
and just another example if your input is a string in hexadecimal octal or binary notation is_numeric will return true but your database might not even support this particular notation mysql does not support octal for instance so you will not get expected results

setinterval	settimeout
it would be better to use setinterval or call settimeout recursively until a count of 1000 is reached so that you only have one active timeout at a time

18647066

this makes sense for server-side code but not for client-side since the app secret cannot be shipped with client code that can be easily unpackaged decomplied intercepted

one wacky solution is to create an abstract super class that does gives you the normal property synthesis

allegro	sdl
directx is basically a middle man between you and the hardware it lets you communicate with the hardware devices you re using like the graphics and video cards without having to know too much about them but you should still have a good understanding of how they work before you try to create complex 3d animations and such so if you re just starting off learn how to use the programming language and then start off with a simpler api or library like sdl or allegro for example directx is long and complicated and you should learn to walk before you run d good luck and happy programming

a button will react to both mouse and keyboard input

18656188
pop-up	dialog
the pop-up dialog as below

18656216
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox but if i switch to google-chrome or ie button is enabled even if i submit an empty string

18656224
content-disposition	content-type
that php file should contain the proper headers content-type content-disposition etc

18656236
superclass	subclassing
that s not possible because you are trying to call the method subclassing on superclass reference

super	extends
a better way would of course be to create a class by extends the super class if you are going to do these kinds of stuff

18656271

arrayiterator	arrayobject
unfortunately implode does not like being given an arrayiterator or arrayobject

18656955

as your textview is in another secondactivity .firts you need to fetch it via xml through setcontentview and findviewbyid but as firstactivity has already it s own

maven	pom.xml
conceptually i would say maven is designed around the pom.xml file which is a model of the project that is being built

18657061
gson	jackson
edit instead of jackson you could use google gson that works in about the same manner

18657066
width	height
with auto layout the approach is to define two constraints that specify width and height

18657171
equals	compareto
of course we are ensuring that equals will not be calling compareto in return

18657203
omnixml	nativexml
you might want to have a look at nativexml or omnixml

18657235
implements	extends
when compiling a class or interface that extends a parameterized class or implements a parameterized interface the compiler may need to create a synthetic method called a bridge method as part of the type erasure process

the only local-list ienumerable rather than iqueryable operation which entity framework supports is contains which is translated into an in statement on the sql side

18657268

when i do get method i receive some answer and then i do post method which changes the answer of the get method and then i check once again doing get method but still it gives me the same answer from first get somehow it has been replicating the get answer from the first method

18657307
maven	pom.xml
if you are using maven to define your dependencies simply update the version of drools you want to use in your pom.xml

18657308
min	max
now i need to find the min _dabg-event-start-date and max _dabg-event-start-date

18657314

hash	md5
i hash my passwords with md5

18657389
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5

imagine a user temporarily removed their sd card or plugs their phone into a computer...i think it s fair that you wouldn t expect google play to hide show apps depending on the current external storage state

18657592
std	ostream
you haven t posted all the code but i notice you are not qualifying ostream with std

18657627
put	get

18657648
versioning	upgrade
the server has a virtual host which has been recently upgrade to include some features which are only available in more recent versioning of rails

18657699

inputs have a popovers which show up when input is focused and hide when blur

18657745

18657811
nsis	uninstaller
this is important to delete this directory if a user decides to uninstaller the application using nsis standard uninstaller

18657825
equals	gethashcode
no constraints you have access only to equals object gethashcode gettype and if you have the constraint class . of these two are virtual equals object gethashcode so you ll use the correct version the third isn t normally overwritten gettype so you ll probably use the correct version

18657826

18658007
ubuntu	debian
however if we have q_t declared with using the example does not compile using gcc 4.7.2 debian wheezy and gcc 4.7.3 ubuntu 13.04 but the replacement of using statement with typedef statement makes it compiled

18658018

i added a data-show attribute that contains a jquery selector in this instance its a class name with this you can determine which elements to hide and which to show

18658019
udp	tcp
i m not sure if this would include udp which is generally connectionless but certainly a quick test shows tcp connect disconnect send and receive events

18658065
comparator	comparable
if your class does not implement comparable you can provide a comparator and call

18658100
hash	salt
having a fixed salt doesn t help matters as whilst the passwords may be the same between the two users the result of the hash will be different from previously but would be the same for both users

18658100
hash	salt
salting the password with a deterministic string per user it must be deterministic as you have to use the same thing for the user each time now means that even if alice and bob have the same password their hash may differ perhaps if the salt was their username

18658100
hash	md5
if you consider a 16 byte hash such as md5 which really shouldn t be used for cryptographic purposes but you already knew that that gives you 128 bits of entropy

18658112

width	height
if you want the two circles to not have a height width specified you can try this

18658816
width	height
i feel like it will need as much babysitting as setting height and width though

18658826
for-loop	loops
in addition its better to use a while loops instead of a for-loop which checks for the eof

18658862
int	chars
this gives chars a certain level of permeability with 8 bit int

plot	heatmap
i d like to plot this in heatmap style

18660764

18662335

firefox has a very solid implementation but not yet complete safari only a very partial implementation

18662335
firefox	safari
neither firefox nor safari support content mathml

i may be wrong but i think that doctrine s entitymanager doesn t allow you to add mapping for additional entities on the fly

18662633

2 instead of ng-switch use ng-if which actually removes the element from the dom rather than hiding it like ng-hide or ng-switch

18662680

width	height
in this code after creating the object rect1 3 4 we create rect2 5 6 with doing this logically i think 5 and 6 are replaced instead of 3 and 4 in the memory sections that width and height are pointing to so 3 and 4 are not available anymore but they are

18663281
width	height
every object has separate memory locations for width and height so there will be no overwriting

18663281
width	height
in this case width and height get the same values as rect1 s which will make all three objects to point to the same memory locations

18663281
width	height
in the case of rect2 the default constructor will not be called so no new memory will be allocated and in the case of rect3 old values of width and height will be lost and the variables will be updated with the memory locations from rect1 which will lead you to the memory leak because memory allocated in the default constructor of rect3 will never be freed

18663289
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox respect it

18663302

in this code after creating the object rect1 3 4 we create rect2 5 6 with doing this logically i think 5 and 6 are replaced instead of 3 and 4 in the memory sections that width and height are pointing to so 3 and 4 are not available anymore but they are

int	chars	int	double
i assume you realize that chars can only hold the int part of the double and that too till 255 in most cases that is why typically double are converted to chars to strings if you want the complete number

18666310
int	chars	int	double
so what you are really looking for is to cast the int part of the double to a chars so a lexical cast would do the trick or itoa stringstream functions

18667048
jar	war
separate the project into two the one building the jar and the one building the war

in your jar project add a plugin goal execution that copies the war to your package

18667048
jar	war
you need install because it ensures that the latest version of the war project will find its way into your local m2 repository for the jar project to pick up

it takes a spaces delimiter list of values and loops over them doing what your code specifies

18667504
implements	extends
pinnedheaderlistadapter - extends compositecursoradapter and implements the interface for the pinnedheaderlistview

18667548
instances	transient
this is a transient form instances which means my application doesn t automatically commit the values of the form back to the database

18667552
int	chars
except that the whole point of allowing unsigned chars as an aliasing type and of defining that all-bits-0 means 0 for int types is to make code like this work

18667558
parentviewcontroller	navigationcontroller
i tried logging self s navigationcontroller parentviewcontroller and presentingviewcontroller but they all return null

18667569
pop-up	dialog
and in that partial view i have buttons that when click fire a pop-up dialog modal window which has a partial view attached to it

18667573
int	double
this will save time for conversion double - int and twice decrease number of adding instead of pair k-- and d1 mc.theplayer.posx + k -- there will be just d1 - 1.0

18667637
urdu	arabic	hebrew	thai
then higher numbers cover less european languages such as russian japanese chinese thai urdu arabic hebrew etc etc i m not sure exactly in which order these are

18667644
google-chrome	firefox
with this snippet of html the topmost google link is included in every element under it when shown in firefox and google-chrome

18667647
width	height
first of all each tile has 32 width and height

18667655
client-side	server-side
server.js is only for servers with node.js is a technology for server-side and not client-side

18667662
ubuntu	debian
on debian and probably ubuntu

18667670
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried google-chrome firefox and ie and nothing

18667675
kde	gnome
there is no fix for this when running eclipse on unix kde gnome etc

18667686
google-chrome	firefox
according to alohci in the comments google-chrome and firefox s behavior matches the html5 spec s adoption agency algorithm for this scenario

18667699
client-side	server-side
however the code provided should still accomplish what you wish with your existing code both client-side and server-side

18667707
children	parent
edit to clarify what i m looking for is not an empty view for the complete expandablelistview which can be set with setemptyview but for parent groups with no children

18667719
width	height
and set width and height for the container if necessary

18667741
maven	pom.xml
1.5 is maven s default according to another question on the topic but i thought i had fixed that in my pom.xml -

18667742
typo3	fluid
although this question is fairly old by now i didn t see it until now and you probably already found out more about what fluid powered typo3 offers

18667742
typo3	fluid
the features you ask for tv-style fces low coding overhead and especially the last one which is more regarding the process than the tool are exactly what fluid powered typo3 is all about

18667742
typo3	fluid
if you want to save time and be consistent when creating content pages and plugins fluid powered typo3 which is the umbrella name for all those twenty-something extensions will do exactly that for you

18667742
typo3	fluid
i can recommend taking a few minutes to read the new tour i published on fedext.net - the url is - it primarily speaks to developers who ve touched on extbase and fluid earlier but even if you re used to just working with typo3 the main points should make sense

18667761
maven	pom.xml
this is handy if you re using the maven appengine plugin and don t want to update the pom.xml file whenever your ip changes

18667767
width	height
qsize serialize the width and the height

18667782
versioning	upgrade
if you are on versioning arya then you will need to download the contents within your box scp or nitrous mac app terminate the box followed by creating a new box in order to upgrade

18667813
getter	setter
the way i d do it is to create a custom legenditem subclass that has a custom property with a getter setter pair that takes a value of type function

18667846
for-loop	loops
in a php loops a for-loop for each iteration i retrieve 1000 rows that match specific ids with

18667851
hide	show
i also made the show hide functions separate callable functions so i could reset the click listener within the hideinput function

18667868
int	chars
you should likely maintain buff as an array of unsigned chars rather than int

18667893
width	margin
you need to give your #dealercards a width and margin 0 auto

18667899
subtract	add
the geometry shader can then add or subtract vertices from the model transform the results into projection space and then pass them to the pixel shader

18667907
typo3	fluid
i myself am the creator of the fluid powered typo3 framework formerly known as fed and would of course recommend that you take a look at what this framework can do for you - it s capable of great things not the least of which is saving you a lot of time while at the same time allowing you to create even more consistent templating for pages and content - and even backend modules

18667907
typo3	fluid
you may want to have a look at - especially the tour of features which tries to explain the point of fluid powered typo3 in as few words as possible

18667907
typo3	fluid
after that the examples from the documentation will give you a much clearer picture of what fluid powered typo3 can do for you

18667946
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome doesn t keep focus after a click but firefox and ie do

18667951
getter	setter
this is partially supported but not using the dot notation for properties - you must use the getter and setter methods directly

18667951
getter	setter
second you make all references to properties use the getter or setter methods directly and do not use the dot notation for non-property methods you just call them as usual

18668027
superclass	subclassing
the major point of polymorphism is that you can have an object reference of a superclass say object refer to an actual object of a subclassing here circle and you can call a method on the superclass reference not care what the actual class is and the method of the class of the actual instance is called

18668068
qregularexpression	qregexp
even if you needed you should use qregularexpression rather than the much slower qregexp

18668071
int	boolean
if all int are valid then use a boolean flag which you can set in the try-catch blocks

18668082
getter	setter
i read that placing atomic on a variable essentially causes the synthesized getter and setter to use locks similar to using synchronized methods in java

18668139
put	get
you could apply the closure again and you ll get a new value reflecting the current value of hogs but you d have to assign it a name put it in a variable to reference it again

18668181
google-chrome	firefox
in latest google-chrome or firefox the image data uri does not load display when opening file ... my_notebook.html locally and google-chrome console reports failed to load resource for the img tag

18668187
children	parent
i am working with parent and children the mummy and daddy type

18668277
cos	sine
first the taylor series is not the best fastest way to implement sine cos

18668277
interpolation	splines
edit2 you can try to make a coarse sin grid and use gsl routine gsl_interp_cspline_periodic for splines with periodic conditions to splines that table the splines will reduce the errors in comparison to a linear interpolation you need less points on your table less cache miss

18668280
children	parent
then for each attempt to populate the children property of a single parent object it will make another database call

18668318
background-image	background-size
i have a div of fixed size that has a background-image inside of it and i use background-size contain to size the image to fit inside of it

18668417
width	height
if you use auto for the width property as done in the example with the height it will fix the word break problem by allowing the width of the div to change although in page layout it is usually more important to constrain a width much more than a height

18668428
post	get
i guess ill post the code ive been trying to get it to work with so you can all see

18668480
nsmutablestring	nsstring
immutable objects and functional transformations â there are memory management reasons as well but that s partly why nsstring nsarray etc are specifically distinct from nsmutablestring nsmutablearray etc

18668484
client-side	server-side
php is run server-side not client-side

18668494
hide	show
maybe i am not understanding fully but it seems like you should just make a separate textblock control and programatically hide show each databound textblock when the button is clicked

18668494
hide	show
then that event will check the booleans value and show hide the correct textblock

18668514
addclass	removeclass
but for some reason whenever i use addclass or removeclass such that it causes right to go from -5 to 0 there is no transition

18668522
width	height
just make sure the view s width and height are constant

18668523
hide	show
when another name is clicked the previous bio returns to hide and the current one changes to show

18668547
gridview	rowdatabound
on the rowdatabound of the outer gridview sub routine vb.net

18668563
multiplying	add
the problem is that you re not converting your lists to numpy arrays so you can t add to or multiplying by scalars

18668565
free	malloc
finally replacing by with subsequent testing of the success of malloc and usage of free tempdata

18668586
post	get
i read about the post loadermanager with multiple loaders how to get the right cursorloader but simply checking the id will not fit my case

18668595
folder	directory
edit i have set home to point to my windows home directory and there is a .ssh folder in there with id files that work under a gitbash shell

18668642
int	double
notice that the tuple can have a mix of types like int with double so converting to a list might not always work

18668660
sorting	filtering
jquery has built in filtering and sorting that you can use to transform the data or write your own in javascript

18668661
hide	show
i d just hide all three at the beginning of the change handler and then show the specific one that needed to be show

18668682
tcplistener	tcpclient
i have a client application that uses a tcpclient to send a file to a server application that uses a tcplistener to receive it

18668698
children	parent
as you can see there s no children attribute showing the submissions that belong to this parent

18668731
puts	gets
for each url it gets a list of products links and puts them in an array

18668736
config	ini
i have an ini file that contains the config of my app

18668740
nstimer	nsrunloop
like sosborn said nstimer s depend on nsrunloop s and since gcd queues create threads that don t have run loops nstimer doesn t play well with gcd

18668742
spaces	delimiter
and blank spaces are the delimiter although is kept in the result

18668814
post	get
1 change your ajax call to a get rather than a post

18668814
post	get
or change your action name to post profilemodel objprofilemodel but i think a get in this case is more restful as you are doing a search

18668824
minimum	max	min	max
after getting the the 5 numbers i must be getting the min max and the average of the minimum and maximum numbers inputted and not all of the five

18668831
int	chars
a couple things i learned were that you can perform calculations on 8-bit chars variables with a max value of 255 unsigned so i didn t need to change it to an int array however i did because it gave me more headroom to work with without worrying about clipping the values at 255

18668836
post	get
i ll try to post an example if i get one working

18668846
children	parent
originally it was a parent project with 2 children projects

18668853
spaces	delimiter
i have a big 300 kb text file containing words delimiter by spaces

18668865
perl	tcl
a number of scripting languages such as perl and javascript and tcl have mostly dispensed with the explicit distinction between integers and floating-point numbers though the distinction is still often drawn in the workings of the interpreters with conversions occurring implicitly when needed

18668882
division	multiplication	division	subtract
i cannot think of anything for the third argument other than self-assignment adding or subtract zero or multiplication or division by one

18668893
for-loop	arrays
i m trying to start off by generating this 2d arrays then using a for-loop which uses a mutator method to set each room number of the arrays

18668901
subtract	add
next after every move you add +1 for player 1 or subtract -1 for player 2 as following

18668915
submit	submission
if you need to submit form without reloading page you have to use ajax submission

18668955
distance	polygons
rather than converting the circle to a series of polygons and then using that polygons intersection class i might consider an alternative approach leveraging that you can detect the intersection with a circle by leveraging the fact that you can look at the distance between the relevant points in the polygons and the radius of a circle

18668955
distance	polygons
if the distance between any of the polygons s vertices and the center of the circle is less than the radius of the circle then the polygons and circle intersect

18668955
distance	polygons
does the polygons encompass the circle this is that special case where the distance from all of the sides of the polygons would be greater than the circle s radius but the circle and polygons still obviously intersect

18668955
distance	polygons
the only complicated part is to check to see if any side of the polygons intersects the circle namely that the minimum distance between the sides of the polygons and the center of the circle less than the radius of the circle

18668955
distance	polygons
to calculate the distance of each side from the center of the circle i might therefore iterate through each side of the polygons and for those sides facing the circle s center for which the circle s center is perpendicular to the segment meaning that an imaginary line perpendicular to the polygons s side that goes through the center of the circle actually crosses the line segment you could

18668955
distance	polygons
if that distance is less than the radius of the circle then you know that the polygons intersects the circle

18668957
email	dkim
if you check the email headers i d expect that no dkim spf signature can be found and that is required even for self-testing

18669048
textview	imageview
i have a listview with imageview and next to it a flowlayout it does the same with linearlayout though i extended the base adapter such that it adds the images from a db query and also i add dynmically textview to the flowlayout or linearlayout it doesnt really matter since it do the same thing for both problem is everytime a view gets recycled meaning leaves the screen and then gets back to it the textview values are being duplicated...i cant understand why and lost any hope in android mobile os as a general and mankind.

18669050
width	height
i m using jquery ui dialog and i want to resize dialog relative to window height and width but when i use or they both track modals resize too

18669050
width	height
so when my updates dialogs height width modal triggers resize thus firing another resize on itself

18669099
free	malloc
the program runs correctly but i didn t free memory from my malloc calls and in fact i can t figure it out how to place free

18669099
free	malloc
i tried to free array_right and array_left but i got error telling me i can only free the pointer directly allocated by malloc

18669191
memcached	apc
you ll want to leverage off of caching as much as possible - database file apc memcached etc

18669191
apache	nginx
good options are apache nginx litespeed

18669191
apache	nginx
i ve used apache nginx before

18669191
apache	nginx
keep in mind that nginx configuration is different than apache so htaccess rules have to be written in the nginx format and saved into the site config

18669200
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
this is mostly useful in relation to single-table inherited structures where you want a subclassing to appear as the superclass

18669206
width	height
but i dont see anything i want to programmatically set the height and width in the array adapter

18669212
post	get
1 create a javascript post get back to the server

18669216

portrait	landscape
i m trying to compare the aspect ratio of a container against the aspect ratio of a series of images and add a class portrait or landscape to the images

18669335
udp	tcp
the recv call typically used with tcp sockets or recvfrom call typically used with udp sockets are blocking -- so they should provide a nice blocking context to your nothingisrecvd case and would allow you to get rid of the while true loop

18669341
min	max
max and min were incorrectly initialized may be anything when you initialize them

18669345
maven	pom.xml
i have successfully deploy both in the same jetty instance using the same port using the below maven pom.xml configuration

18669346
prepare	execute
that is echo or vardump the contents of the variable containing the sql text before you prepare execute the sql statement

18669346
min	max
it s possible you have the min and max values swapped or have the longitude and latitude swapped

18669346
prepare	execute
in order to debug this you need the actual sql text that s being sent to the database to be prepare execute

18669359
stdout	stderr
if you launch it from command line then you can use redirect stdout and stderr into file as follows

18669363

int	chars
the assignment reuses the memory of the chars s and terminates their lifetime so an object of type int becomes over the space previously taken by the chars s

18669550
freemarker	velocity
every page sends the same header either through a templating system jsp velocity freemarker etc or because it s hardcoded that way

18669551

for instance when i add a folder containing a movie and other files to my movies directory i want to be left with the movie file itself deleting the other unneccesary files

18669634
min	max
1 min and max should be initialized

18669635
ioexception	filewriter
this is due to the fact that when you create a new filewriter object it throws an ioexception which has to be handled under a try and catch block

18669684
try-catch	exception-handling
basically you were trying to create a bufferedreader outside the try-catch block and because actionperformed can t throw any type of exception-handling the compiler is complaining

18669724
imagemagick	im4java
the class is fairly simple it just delegates the calls to imagemagick via im4java

18669736
width	height
as far as modifying the bufferedimage i would suggest looping through the width and height representing the x and y and get the rgb of each pixel at row column using bufferedimage#getrgb int int and modify the color and set the color at that location using bufferedimage#setrgb int int int

18669748
paramiko	subprocess

google-chrome	safari
i can t speak for the safari path i m assuming in osx or similar but on windows 7 the following code will open a new tab in google-chrome

18669907
floating-point	fixed-point
the glvertexattribpointer ... variant has no trouble taking a gl_int data type but it is going to convert it to floating-point and it may normalize fixed-point values in the process hence the extra parameter

18669907
floating-point	integer
more concisely use glvertexattribipointer for integer vertex attributes and glvertexattribpointer for floating-point

18669964
int	chars
the x format specifier is for int not chars

18669964
int	chars

width	height
as salman a mentioned in the comments the original solution has a flaw - it doesn t work well if the img s height or width or both are at least 3 times larger than the containing div

18674144
width	height
the reason is that when we set the img s left and right or top and bottom coordinates to be -100 of the containing div the overall allowed width or height of the img can be at most 300 of the containing div s width or height because it s the sum of the div s width or height and the left and right or top and bottom coordinates

18677603
mp3	wav
the reasen why i don t want to use wav is because it s + - 1mb for a sound file i am g oing to use a lot of them and i can t afford a big hosting plan so i would rather use mp3 instead

for single digit input in a chars simply subtract 0 and cast the result to an int

18677666

with int the data is meant to represent a number like 1025 but it could just as easily be manipulated as if it was something else like a couple chars or a float

google-api	google-oauth
problem i m facing is that i registered one application on google api and it generate a clinet-id plus javascript-origin and redirect-url also defined at time of creating google-oauth project in google-api

18677874
width	height
regarding the length and width of the heatmap i m a little confused as to what you re specific problem is but you can export your image using the jpeg command which takes height and width as inputs

18677874
width	height
so if you know the height and width of the jpeg you re trying to match this heatmap too you can just specify the height and width of your jpeg output

18677968
children	parent
by splitting your data so that parent and children are in separate paths you can more easily utilize angularfire and angularfirecollection together

18677968
children	parent
query the parent data with angularfire query the children with angularfirecollection

18677992
spaces	delimiter
however it doesn t help you because you re looking for both quotes - single and double - and one of these always in html is a delimiter of the attribute value - if you need spaces inside the attribute value as you do

18678207
innodb	myisam
which lead me to switch my table from innodb to myisam and use geospatial abstractions to represent my coordinate point

18678207
innodb	myisam
firstly i switched from innodb to myisam which is better designed for mysql spatial extensions

18678209
int	chars
the original function merely checks whether or not the string consists of valid chars only the extended function adds two int for the numbers of valid chars at the beginning of the list to be skipped when checking the first and last chars in practice it simply calls the original function 3 times in the example below it ensures that the string begins with a letter and doesn t end with an underscore

18678284
getter	setter
secondly if your code above is complete you are lacking public getter and setter for userselected

18678299
getter	setter
so i ve faced some problems extendedclientaction class on the server side has constructor and fields which has getter and setter

18678299

before they were added to the language type names consisted of keywords int chars double struct etc. and punctuation chars and so were easy to recognize unambiguously

18678424
ready	each
when constructing a class that s a subclass anything except new object java needs to start at the object constructor and work its way down to ensure that all of the internal state of each class is ready for its subclass to use

18678427

when you write a subclassing the compiler automatically inserts the call to super-constructor constructor of the superclass as the first line in constructor of the subclassing

18678430

obviously doing so would be the type of thing that virus trojan s spyware etc does and i don t see any reason why you would want to do that in a legitimate application

18678536
google-chrome	safari
the browser has to make room for the vertical scrollbar not all browsers safari and maybe google-chrome on os x may render the scrollbar on top of content i didn t test for a long time so i m not sure

18678558

i m using jquery to show and hide sections of a search page

18678660
hide	show
i have a html.textbox and html.checkboxlistfor that i show and hide base on form input when the form is submitted it will show hide the textbox if there is nothing entered in the textbox and same goes for the checkbox section if not checkboxes are selected when the form is submitted the checkbox section is hidden when the page redisplays

18678660
hide	show
i m also using a jquery .click function to show hide these search options as needed

18678665
puts	gets
i m writing a program that at one point makes a command-line call to another native application gets the output from that application and puts it into a jtextpane as a string

18678678
put	get
to get this to work you have to add script put put.php to your virtual host for the project per documentation

18678681
getter	setter
a property declaration tells the compiler to define a getter method and possibly a setter method

18678681
getter	setter
if you declare a property as atomic the compiler adds additional code to the getter and the setter so reads and writes to the property are thread safe and can be accessed from background threads

18678681
getter	setter
it is also possible to write a custom getter or setter method that invokes your own code instead of the compiler-written code

18678681
getter	setter
you simply add a method body to your .m file that has the same method signature as the getter or setter and the compiler uses that method instead of the automatically generated one

18678697
screens	tablet
i can also move about quarter cell further along the x-axis on the tablet shown in the screens shots

18678700
getter	setter
aka you had to write a getter and setter for each ivar

18678700
getter	setter
lastly not that property not only tells the compiler to implement your getter and setter but it also automatically provides an instance variable with the same name but prefixed with an underscore this is only if you have implicit synthesizing of properies enabled...more history

18678703
google-chrome	firefox
it exactly works in google-chrome and firefox

18678744
awt	swing
swing programs should override paintcomponent instead of overriding paint as mentioned in painting in awt and swing the paint methods

18678752
qmail	exim
some mtas to look at are postfix qmail exim and sendmail

18678758
hide	show
you need a nextimage and previousimage which show and hide the images with styile s display attribute these using that array and var

18678778
typedef	struct
or typedef struct str1 str1

18678782
hide	show
which div you hide or show in your ajax success callbacks depends only on which link was clicked not on the results of the query

18678799

a count would take up perhaps 4 bytes for a 32-bit int while the null chars is just a single byte or two bytes if you re using unicode strings

18678866
getter	setter
i have all the required getter and setter in my user pojo class

the rendering of following page will be blocked in google-chrome and firefox that i have tested by the slow external style sheet

18687285

it seems as though both google-chrome and firefox also block the running of the block due to the css delay

18687336
put	get
i was wondering if anyone could show me with jquery how i could put an e prevent default on the submit button so that if the submit button is triggered i can get it to instead do something else other than submit say have an alert

18687373
button	checkbox	inherited	properties
actually checkbox is inherited from button which inherited from textview that s why it has all the text-related properties

hash	salt
create a hash of password with a great random salt

18687445

if you want need in-postgres hashing installing bcrypt is the way to go as the default installed hash are old and broken md5 etc

18687455
width	height
use getwindowmanager .getdefaultdisplay .get height get width

18687482

to get the min and max price you can simply write two functions

18687500
width	height
i would like a black colored div that maintains a 3 8 width height ratio of the visible screen

18687500
width	height
what i really mean is that the widget will maintain a fixed size width height of 3 8

18687526
express	node.js
i have built some basic apis with the node.js express framework

18687552
post	put
i ve already tried to put outside the doingthebackground what need to be done putting in the pre and post but i cant do this because of the networkonmainthreadexception problem that just force close the program on new android versions

18687556
for-loop	loops
if you are okay with some workarounds you can use a for-loop instead of foreach loops where you can add an index to each control name and model binder could bind them properly

18687573
maven	pom.xml
i am trying to do a maven clean install on my parent pom.xml file by using the below command-

18687585
post	get
if a get variable is supplied then the post search is automatically performed

18687588

two rows having a max number of ones equal to 1 their scalar prod is 0 0 two columns having a zero t1 and t2 both have the same number of 1 no min take one of them aside let s take t1 and remove it from the table

18687614
g++	gcc
this was compiled using g++ gcc 4.7.2

18687614
subtract	add
i have a subtract function and i m writing an add function and i thought i could just do this

18687618
jlist	jlabel
your renderer could allow for the display of multiple lines as your gui shows and a jlist has improved efficiencies over say a jpanel with lots of jlabel since it doesn t display actual components but rather the rendering of a component

18687618
jlabel	jtextpane
no the cell renderer would use a component that allowed for multiple line display perhaps a jtextpane or a jpanel that holds two jlabel

18687621
maven	m2e
i ve seen that others have had this problem where maven doesn t show up for them in eclipse after installing the m2e plugin but most of the solutions seem to suggest doing something like configure convert to maven. but maven is not showing up for me in the configure list nor is it showing up in console open console or the file new list

18687632

18687849
google-chrome	firefox
but it s causing google-chrome and firefox to crash if date1 is changed before date2

18687866
folder	directory
to avoid infinite restart because sails writes into .tmp folder you can create a .foreverignore file into your project directory and put this content inside

18687873
post	get
the reason is when the user post s the form the get somevariable is still there so the get handler is re-entered and then the post handler code is processed but by then the get handler re-initialized the form which confuses the user since they just got done changing the form s values away from the initial settings

18687873
post	get
in other words when the form is submitted the post array is being correctly filled but the get array hangs around for the ride with its old variables still there including somevariable

18687887
folder	directory
keep in mind that the published folder id can t always be retrieved as one of the parents of the public file because the file can be organized into a different directory from the user i m accessing it

18687901
getter	setter
the key here is that the getter setter for the utilities class in the base abstract class doesn t allow it to be overridden thus every inheriting class uses the utility class as defined by it s constructor

18687924
post	put
if doesn t exist a relation between post and post category please post how you want to put these tables

18688132
google-chrome	firefox
when a connection is dropped the browser will either say its waiting for a response that never happens google-chrome or just says the connection was reset firefox

18688132
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome starts to drop connections at under 30 seconds of spamming safari on an iphone 4 ios 5.1 rarely makes it past 3 refreshes before saying the connection was lost but safari on an ipad 2 ios 5.0 seems to cope the longest but ultimately ends up dropping connections as well

18688181
apache	nginx
however if error_log is not set php will pass this error onto the web server application apache nginx etc. which usually results in the error being logged to the web server s error log

18688211

i know iplimage is opencv and not emgucv but i m doing this in c# and using the opencv dll s

18688222

if it finds this folder the method will return the root path to it and if the folder isn t a subfolder of this directory the algorithm will return false

18688282
post	put
edit just to be clear the username variable used in the find method is actually declared in my full code the code i ve put in this post is a cut down version to illustrate the structure and error checking

18688422

following the same lines suppose i have a parent class p and i inherited it in a subclassing sc something like this

18688749
int	chars
if your java client library for freebase doesn t include the necessary decoding method you ll need to write one yourself to take the four digits after the dollar sign interpret them as a hexadecimal int and then convert that to a java chars which also uses unicode code points internally

18688766
put	get
so i d probably put the shell_exec within a function that i would then not bother testing but in the tests for your parsing logic i would stub the return value of this function to be able to test what you do when you get various output

18688798
for-loop	arrays
finally you should move the declaration of shared memory arrays outside the for-loop and a final assignment to the output matrix was also missing

18688802

18689027
for-loop	while-loop
as a short hint your for-loop is equivalent to the following while-loop

18689027
for-loop	while-loop
that means the condition of a the for-loop is evaluated in the same way as the condition of a while-loop

18689162

18689742
pickle	dill
i think you could use dill to pickle the interactively defined class and not have to worry about pxlocal magic using dummymod and faking of namespaces

18689742
pickle	dill
to pickle a class interactively just do import dill and then build your class as you first did

18689756

i don t want to use addclass with a fade in and removeclass without a fade out because i feel like the code will get too lengthy and unruly

18690111
stdout	stderr
best practice when invoking processes is to read both stdout and stderr in separate threads

18690111

18690190
google-chrome	safari
however it shows very weird behavior with safari desktop safari mobile and google-chrome mobile

18697383
addition	multiplication
so in the sse code it can do one sse addition one sse multiplication two sse loads and one sse store simultaneously

for avx it can do one avx load through two 128-bit loads on ports 2 and 3 one avx multiplication one avx addition and one 128bit store half the avx width simultaneous

in other words although with avx the multiplication and additions do twice as much work as sse the loads and stores are still 128bit wide

int	double
here the default values initialization for a and b have been declared respectively as int and double

18701206

although you do not specify the template arguments the compiler takes default values of the arguments a and b which are int and double and the code executes without any errors or warnings

18701240
post	get
when i follow the advice in that post i get some really wierd behavior

18701253
getter	setter
this assumes that all the data is accessible in public properties with plain getter setter which you don t in your example but you should do

18701260
width	height
i ve also modified the code to apply an absolute width and height to the .flip div so that you don t get the double rotation in firefox as the div collapses when the element rotates

18701272
jobs	cron
i want to get rid of cron jobs they just don t feel right

18701292
prng	random
i am using this variable to introduce some entropy in a prng pseudo random number generator

18701569
disk	ram
after loading which i think was very fast cause it took around 30 seconds pretty much the same time as counting lines with the unix tool wc the process was taking around 4gb of ram the size of of the file on disk 2.2 gb

18701571
thin	unicorn	thin	webrick	unicorn	webrick
before cedar request from outside where handled by nginx thus being a front server which in turn asked local rails server thin unicorn webrick whatever to produce the page

18701571
apache	nginx
what heroku does now is to directly expose rails server to outside world with no classic webserver like apache or nginx in the middle

18701571
thin	webrick
that s what happen when you run rails server it starts a webrick or thin server directly bound on port 3000

18701574
getattr	setattr
and like ani says you should use the getattr and setattr functions to get and set the custom attributes

it is worth noting in newer versions of sas there is proc http that allows you to better handle requests get and post and responses from web servers

18701922
folder	directory
actually the sencha command should be run from the framework directory touch-x.x.x folder rather than the cmd directory

18701980
google-chrome	firefox
this is the code i have that works in google-chrome firefox ie on windows

18701993
cpu	processors
i m trying to implement this in c# and so far i can query the cpu usage in percentage but that doesn t do since different machines might be using different processors

18702048
switching	screens
it can not delay simply changing the drawing on the screens but it needs to delay the whole boolean from switching because i am going to use the isbeat boolean in the final game

18702048
switching	screens
when a beat happens isbeat will switching to true and give players a small window of time to tap the screens before switching back to false

18702109
maven	m2e

you need to move the assignment of the edittext into oncreate method after setcontentview r.layout.activity_main

18702227
margin	text-align
i m trying to center my header link product name but when i use text-align center margin auto etc it still doesn t move

18702228

space between slides is also off for portrait-sized images but this is likely because i m using a combination of portrait and landscape

18702233
int	chars
for the chars pointer i write sampleclient but for the int i write

18702234
inherited	properties
an example sub task would inherited from this task and provide additional properties

18702241
folder	directory
the working directory should point to the eclipse workspace folder containing the package that is to be tested eg where pnp is the name of the package not the name of the go file that contains the test

18702247
maven	pom.xml
if not you can add more repositories in your pom.xml in order to tell maven hey look for my dependencies in this other repo too

18702266
int	chars
this is because s format specifier expects a chars pointer while d expects an int argument

18702327

ideally i would be able to run a left buffer s contents without saving the file through node -p via stdin read stdout and stderr into the right hand side buffer which would not be editable

18702338
fadein	fadeout
you could use fadeout on the other hand since its implementation is the opposite of fadein putting the display none on the style for you

18702378
inherited	subclassing
having a rule in a subclassing will affect the run of the subclassing including all inherited tests

18702378
superclass	subclassing
however if the superclass is run independently of the subclassing the rule will not be present and therefore not affect the tests

18702405
children	parent
saving a parent doesn t save children

18702486

i needed to consider two cases that depend on the aspect ratio of the large image portrait and landscape

18702643

ok so i have set up my site it looks great in mobile tablet landscape desktop etc etc but on ipad in portrait mode it is stretching the content to fill the screens

18702816
portrait	landscape
i have worked around it by decreasing the media query width so that now the portrait tablet receives the same view as the landscape tablet

18702878
sum	coalesce
if you are concerned about the sum being null then use coalesce

18702878

free	malloc
malloc in c and new in c++ allocate persistent memory from the free store

18702916

i had drawable hdpi mdpi xhdpi.

18702960
setinterval	settimeout
you should use setinterval rather than repeated calls to settimeout

18702960
setinterval	settimeout
you can t necessarily rely on the timing of settimeout or setinterval to be perfect for comparison

18703027
width	height
you can use the same image with a lower height and width attribute as your thumbnail image

18703033
portrait	landscape
this ensures that both portrait and landscape orientation pictures will fit into whatever size div you decide

18703040
uiview	subviews
the layoutsubviews method is also called in a subclass of uiview since a view may have subviews that it needs to layout

18703045
box-sizing	border-box
first we set the box-sizing of all the elements in page to be border-box because its easier to calculate the sizes of the elements this way

18703051
firefox	safari
typeahead does work in firefox and in safari

18703207
put	get
then in your asynctask put every point data you get when you parse into the list

18703212
int	boolean
most of my methods return strings int boolean etc and i bet that holds for 99 of developers sure we sometimes return complex objects arrays etc

18703226
mouseup	mousedown
by splitting mousedown and mouseup there is less runtime parsing no checking events less code per run of each etc

18703226
mouseup	mousedown
this just maintains the mouseup and mousedown combination checking the event type to see which it is

18703226
mouseup	mousedown
notice in this option when you have two different events you need to make it a string mouseup mousedown vs mouseup mousedown .

18703256
width	height
in android you just provide a width and height for the scene and the graphics are scaled up or down based on the device

18703259
min	max
make sure you use an appropriate aggregation such as max or min to get a predictable result on each column

18703272
jobs	cron
it is better to rebuild suggestions manually using cron jobs by adding to the spellcheck handler

i only do what is necessary...no need to add ids and attributes to everything to hide show the appropriate things

18703330
postgresql	mysql
for example id in the sample table is the primary key so we know it is unique in the table so the following query conforms to the sql standard and would run in mysql and fail in many dbms currently at the time of writing postgresql is the closest dbms i know of to correctly implementing the standard

i thought about multiplying the decimals by 100000 doing the math then dividing by 100000 but this only works with addition and subtraction

18704182
getter	setter
so assuming you have a rendertable property getter + setter in yourbean the toggletableview must change it in order to dinamically define if the component is to be rendered or not

this will give you only the width and height of the workarea

18704665

inherited	subclassing
the confusion arises because technically the subclassing inherited the private fields because the private fields exist in the subclassing so that when you call getn it returns the value of n

18704825
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
the thing is it does exist and since it were declared in the superclass it technically was inherited by the subclassing

18704825
getter	setter	superclass	subclassing
