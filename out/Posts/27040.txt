21123691

the width changes to fit but the height doesnt

21125901
onresume	onpause
if you clean it up in onpause set it up in onresume

21125901
oncreate	onstart
if you clean it up on onstop set it up in onstart or possibly the combination of oncreate and onrestart

21125901
oncreate	ondestroy
if you clean it up in ondestroy set it up in oncreate

21125901
onresume	onpause
in the case of a camera you do not want to hold onto it when you are not in the foreground as other apps cannot access it while you have it so i would go for the onresume onpause pairing

21125904
int	double
you ll have to write overloads for int double etc

21125928
put	get
with php i can get the 2 separate datastructures and put them all together but i would like to do this more dynamicaly by making a sql query with a time dependacy so i could query for 1 hour or 24 hours and still get a nice graph

i want to get all the post from the user s friends but only the ones that he has the permission to see

21125945

this only happens when referencing a nested class in the definition of the outer class when using it as a parametric type but also when extends implements it which will result in another error once the compiler can resolve the class or when using it as or in an annotation

21125946
put	get
i put some system.out.println inside the constructor of all those classes in order to see how often they get registered loaded

21125986
xmp	jfif
it seems that the fstop app can t read dates from the xmp files so it was either reading them from the jfif app12 ducky segment at the beginning of the file or if that didn t exist it was reading the file timestamp

21125986
xmp	jfif
i switched to imagemagick but that faced the same problem - i could strip profiles and load change an xmp profile but couldn t immediately see a way to get it to create update the date values in the jfif segment

for-loop	arrays
i have attempted to do this by slicing the rows of the arrays and iterating through these rows with a for-loop

21126231
xstream	jackson
the way i do it is either using xstream or jackson api preferred to serialize the java object to either a xml or a json file

21126231
junit	testng
for example see my xstream data provider i wrote for use with testng or junit parameterized tests

21126247
int	chars
below is a program which compares two strings and puts them in a int matrix which visually shows if there are any matching chars

21126249

versioning	upgrade
for people that have control over which jython versioning upgrade to 2.5.3

21126389
children	parent
the d.value returned by partition for parent nodes is by default the sum of values for all children nodes assuming you ve properly set the value accessor function to return the data variable that you want to use for size for leaf nodes

21126389
children	parent
so if you position your nodes based on the original x value you ll end up with parent off to the far left of their children

21126405
post	get
get all post where userid s friends are authors and where userid has permission to see the post

21126422
x86	64bit
if you change your target platform to x86 instead of anycpu your code will be emitted as 32bit code also on 64bit systems and you could use just the 32bit dll of sqlite

21126452
put	get
put this into a php file and make a request for it and you get a list of image tags in this case

21126466
sudo	passwd

21126483
hive	hdfs
i have data in hive that i ran an aggregation on and stored on hdfs via

21126505
public	protected
since assemblies may be a concept which is out of range of javascript i don t take the internal modifier into account but public protected and private

21126525

addclass and removeclass also work like a charm

21126551
ubuntu	centos
i m in the process in migrating from gitlab 6.0 on ubuntu 12.04 to gitlab 6.4.3 on centos 6.5

21126602
min	max
it s a simple linear scale so that 0x000000 is the min value and 0xffffff is the max value

21126695
min	max
i can obviously do multiple queries select into the table as above and then do another query to figure out the min and max periods

21126695
subtract	add
if we can place y within the table and figure out y s period_number we can easily do the math to figure out what to add subtract to that value

21126695
min	max
if y is outside the bounds of the table we define y to be the max min of the table respectively

21126756
integer	unsigned
the unsigned integer n

21126759
debian	centos
for example a centos and debian box from the same company

21126759
debian	centos
the centos will timout while the debian will work fine

21126781
folder	dir
for step 1 you will need either the dir function or the files property of the folder object

21126896
macports	homebrew
my best advice would be to use macports or alternatively homebrew to install all the dependencies needed otherwise it s a real pain in the neck to chase them all down manually

21126907
google-chrome	firefox
works great but something on main stylesheet of site adds a blank space at bottom of div in google-chrome in firefox this doesn t occur

21126928
put	get
if they don t then you can consider to put them on separate instances to get the advantages mentioned above but you have to be ready to pay the price especially in terms of administration

aggregate-functions	sum
sum is an aggregate-functions your just adding 2 numbers

21127186
google-chrome	firefox
it happens in my ie google-chrome and firefox running on a windows machine

21127188
google-chrome	firefox
one of those is the search bar that is being used which search is required i am guessing somewhere behind the scenes there is some kind of javascript used to manipulate the content because when javascript is enabled i can not type anything into it in ie7 firefox google-chrome etc works fine however when i disable javascript everything works fine

21127196
post	get
when using post you get the transaction stub from the headers in the options request response the transaction name from the svn-txn-name header in the response to the post and execute a proppatch against the url

21127233
erd	diagram
many people use erd and class diagram interchangeably

21127236
maven	pom.xml
in maven i had to add the following to the pom.xml and then build cleanly to be able to find the mapper and reducer classes in java

21127260
exponent	modulo
the official key id that is the content of the x509v3 subject key identifier extension in an x509 certificate is the sha1 hash of the der-encoded asn.1 sequence consisting of the modulo and exponent of an rsa public key

21127282
for-loop	loops
i have tried a while loops a for-loop and a timer reset and restart but none appear to enable me to continually loops the feed

21127300
put	get
before i put the site out there i want to implement the authentication so people can t get to it until i release it

21127349
firefox	safari
-david hyatt architect for safari and webkit also worked on mozilla camino and firefox

21127356
lxml	elementtree
alternatively lxml has a wrapper around elementtree and has good support for namespaces without having to worry about string formatting

21127358
prepare	execute
you should prepare your query once and then execute it multiple times with different parameters

21127359
hide	show
i made a jquery command that hide the answer and when you roll over the flashcard it show it

21127368
hikaricp	c3p0
in no particular order you might use hikaricp bonecp or c3p0 or apache dbcp

21127387
int	double
i m getting this error array1 undeclared first use this function array1 undeclared first use this function and warning converting to int from double

21127433
maven	pom.xml
just create a maven project setup pom.xml add a xxx.gwt.xml and make sure web.xml contains a reference to it

21127496
for-loop	arrays
store the values in an arrays and then run a for-loop to print all the values

21127631
width	margin
set a fixed width to ul and center via margin auto

21127658
getter	setter
-it is not very common practice to declare an inner field a public variable i m referring to products in customer make a getter setter

21127658
int	double
-also in your small example you seem to mix the ideas of double and int both represent numbers but only the first has decimal point

21127674
stdout	stderr
the problem is almost certainly that your command is writing to stderr as well as to stdout and you re only capturing stdout

21127674
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout and stderr specify the executed programâ s standard input standard output and standard error file handles respectively

21127674
stdout	stderr
valid values areâ additionally stderr can be stdout which indicates that the stderr data from the child process should be captured into the same file handle as for stdout

21127674
stdout	stderr
as a side note if all you want to run is run a program and get its output merging its stderr in with its stdout you don t need to create a popen and call communicate on it

21127698
width	height
will this require measuring the dimensions width and height of the image to place the image at the required location.how does android place such large images by default with respect to a normal small touch point

21127704
for-loop	loops
then the for-loop loops over the iterable returned by that evaluation

21127724
int	chars
try or try declaring allbits as chars not int

21127773
listview	gridview
adding footer shouldn t be a problem for gridview or even listview change control template and add footer as the header

21127776
std	ostream
finally if writing the buffers to a file is really the bottleneck and you want to stick with the standard c++ library it may be reasonable to have a writer thread which listens on a queue filled with buffers from a suitable stream buffer and writes the buffers to an std ofstream the producer interface would be an std ostream which would send off probably fixed sized buffers either when the buffer is full or when the stream is flushed for which i d use std flush explicitly to a queue on which the other read listens

21127806
for-loop	loops
then the while loops is equivalent to the for-loop

21127832
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome and firefox

21127842
post	get
+1 for pekka s comment on using invisible element in the form instead of having get variable passing through post form

21127862
getter	setter
of course the getter setter

21127888
put	get
but if i put the body of functionb inside functiona i get the file with string value

21127914
inherited	subclassing
i believe what you re actually getting back from your findelements call are remotewebelements so attempting to cast them down the inherited hierarchy to the more specific subclassing is doomed to failure

21127949
portrait	landscape
i am working on an app where app is required to auto-rotate in ipad only i.e landscape and the portrait mode which am able to achieve

21127971
integer	unsigned
in fact unsigned integer types are required to work this way in c

21127971
multiplying	multiplication
in python making each multiplication up to 4x slower usually less but it can be that high is no big deal because python spends more time fetching the bytecode and unboxing the integer objects than multiplying anyway

21127992
onchange	onkeyup
tried onkeyup and onchange

21128106
integer	unsigned
the type of unsigned integer of size_t can vary depending on platform and may not be long unsigned int everywhere which is covered in the draft c99 standard section 6.5.3.4 the sizeof operator paragraph 4

21128106
integer	unsigned
the value of the result is implementation-defined and its type an unsigned integer type

21128133
hide	show
my jquery to show and hide an image will have to look something like this i think

21128144
post	put
after searching for a while i just put uploaded files to folder . assets post and it worked correctly

21128150
for-loop	arrays
i have a feeling this may be easier by using multidimensional arrays and searching using a for-loop

21128177
width	height
these options take into account both the height and width when scaling the image

21128178
hash	salt
the usual solution to this kind of issue is to store a partial value hash unsalted or with a fixed salt alongside the randomly salt full value

21128178
hash	salt
there s no magic answer that ll let you send a hash value to the server and have it compare it to a bunch of randomly salt and hash values for a match

21128178
hash	salt
in fact that s exactly why we salt our hash - to prevent that from working because that s also pretty much what an attacker does when trying to brute-force

21128178
hash	salt
either live with sending the ssns as plaintext over ssl for comparison to salt hash stored values knowing that it still greatly reduces exposure because the whole lot can t be dumped at once

21128271
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
even tho all of the solutions point to mousedown - mousemove - mouseup events

21128313
range	minimum
i am trying to display the object that corresponds to the minimum cost of a range of non-adjacent cells

21128321
for-loop	arrays
i m trying to manipulate an arrays inside a for-loop where i want to add an item to the end of the arrays and delete an element at the beginning of the arrays like this

21128361
width	height
--sx 800 and --sy 800 scales the each framed image to max 800 height or max 800 width and links to the full image

21128382
junit	mockito
i am using mockito framework to create mocking objects for writing junit for my adobe cq5 project

21128404
put	get
the various overloads of put get and delete all support transactions

21128404
put	get
the methods that manage transactions according to implicittransactionmanagementpolicy are delete key... delete iterable get key get iterable put entity and put iterable

21128404
put	get
the overload of prepare that takes a transaction parameter behaves the same as the overloads of put get and delete that take a transaction parameter

21128404
put	get
however the overload of prepare that does not take a transaction parameter unlike put get and delete does not use an existing transaction if one is already running and does not consult the implicittransactionmanagementpolicy if one is not already running

21128414
width	height
in your case if the image width is 200px and height is 100px

21128434
rar	zip
open .jar in rar or any zip application

21128461
post	put

i got a hex digest using vim for the file septentrio binary format file for those who care

21128505
min	max
if you want truncation with runtime sized min max it seems like you should re-evaluate the design

21128524
junit	testng
junit has data providers and annotations that are almost exactly like testng using a 2-d object array list

21128564
children	parent
if the tree nodes are doubly-linked if nodes can reach their parent as well as children there are depth-first solutions whose only state is the current node

21129253
sfdc	salesforce
i m not sure i fully understand your issue but if it s simply a matter of docusign envelope or recipient status not being updated reflected within related objects in sfdc then it s most likely that your docusign connect settings aren t configured properly.if you haven t done so already i d recommend reviewing the docusign connect for salesforce guide for information about how to configure connect such that docusign pushes status back into sfdc in the scenarios you specify

21130410
int	double
say i need a block of 3 double s and 5 int s

21130410
int	double
the alignment probably works out ok in this example but what if i switch it around and take the int block first and the double block second that will shift the alignment of the double s assuming 64-bit double and 32-bit int

21130410
free	malloc
i d like the block to be a valid block obtained by malloc so the user can call free when finished

21130450

your approach by splitting words by a space is as you already noticed not working for punctuation

21133271
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
google-chrome firefox and safari all parse this as just hdplayer_setup.exe and not something broken like utf-8 hdplayer_setup.exe so it seems to be a valid case

getter	setter
with the newest versions of xcode there is no need to perform synthesize for declaring a setter or a getter

21133410
getter	setter
it is done automatically for the programmer if the getter and setter is kept at default

21133410
getter	setter
however i have been taught i need to declare the synthesize when overrides both the getter and the setter

21133435
ord	chr
i think you want to use chr and or ord functions

21133459
x-tag	polymer
one way data-binding should 3 just work while two-way data binding will require either a custom directive to use object.observe or node.bind to listen to property changes or for angular to add support for node.bind which would allow angular to generically two-way-bind to any element from s to polymer elements to x-tag elements

21133494
for-loop	arrays
in the for-loop i need to increment the arrays index...how do i go about it....if the uid is set to 1 it works perfect but in case of any other number i cannnot just get the logic..

21133662
getter	setter
overrides both the getter and the setter

21133662
getter	setter
once you use synthesize you are using the setter getter provided by the compiler

21133662
getter	setter
if you create your setter getter without synthesize then you need to write both the methods if you have readwrite property

21133683
int	double
if you want to be able to convert floating-point numbers from qstring to int you need to convert your text to a float or double first then use normal rounding truncation to convert to short

int	boolean
c# made the decision to completely separate int operations from boolean operations

21134496
int	boolean
you cannot for example do you must do to explicitly move from int to boolean

21134496
int	boolean
now the last three do indeed only make sense in boolean contexts and so with c# having a stricter separation between boolean and int values they are no longer applied to int

21134496
int	boolean
but if we re going to talk about the difference between operators with boolean and int arguments we should include the boolean use of | and because they do come up sometimes through typos

21134853
portrait	landscape
some images will be portrait and some landscape and they will be in a container div that also may be portrait landscape depending on browser size

21134853
width	height
it doesn t matter if the image should be stretched to fill the box either 100 width or 100 height and if the ratio s do not match then clipping will occur through css overflow hidden

21134853
width	height	portrait	landscape
my method was to get the ratio of the container box ie portrate or landscape and get the image ratio portrait or landscape compare them and adjust the css width height accordingly

in this fiddle html+css you can see that if you mouseover the link both font and background slowly rea-animates but if you mouseout only the font re-animates again

21135911
int	boolean
since you cannot arithmetically add boolean the symbol + is sometimes used in logic to denote the or operator which is | in c++ c++ will automatically promote both boolean to int and then perform the addition

21135911
int	boolean
in the case decltype t u your return type is bool and therefore another implicit cast happens forcing your int of 2 to become a boolean value true or 1 when converted back to int

21135918

filterinputstream does not have a public constructor it is protected - you can see the javadoc so you can t instantiate it directly

other words create the one-to-many relations refering the pairing objects from boht ends and many-to-one from the pairing object

i think what was happening was that the jar files weren t being bundled into the war at war creation time

21136111
google-chrome	safari
with both safari and google-chrome where the default font rendering uses subpixel-antialiasing any css that forces gpu based rendering like the suggestions above to use a transform using translatez or even just a scale transition will cause safari and google-chrome to automatically give up on subpixel-antialiased font smoothing and instead switch to just antialiased text which looks a lot lighter and thinner especially on safari

21136111
google-chrome	safari
-webkit-font-smoothing subpixel-antialiased now has no effect in google-chrome and degrades text in safari

21143312
put	get
you need to put an int in before you get to imer or cenar

21143320

21143481
children	parent
your parent entity has a one-to-many relationship to it s children

21143481
children	parent
so technically the relationship is a unidirectional one from the children to their parent

21143481
children	parent
jpa implementations can emulate a bidirectional relationship if a properly annotated children field is added on the parent side but it is not necessary

21143481
children	parent
if you need to traverse from a parent to it s children you can add the field

21143481
children	parent
if you only traverse from the children to the parent do not add it

stdout	stderr
right now i have some code that uses popen.communicate from subprocess setting and to run a command and capture both stderr and stdout

21143587
stdout	stderr
the problem is that communicate not only waits for the command to exit it waits for stdout and stderr to be closed

21143587
stdout	stderr
i want to only wait for the command to finish without waiting on stderr stdout

21143587
stdout	stderr
but i still want to capture any stderr stdout output given while the command was running

21143587
stdout	stderr
this will deadlock when using stdout pipe and or stderr pipe and the child process generates enough output to a pipe such that it blocks waiting for the os pipe buffer to accept more data

21143619
rss	feed

21143678
nsstring	nsdata
you are calling this message on nsdata not on nsstring

21143678

21143756
button	checkbox
this code works fine whenever i execute it with a button but when i try to use a checkbox within the form to execute it it does nothing

21143770
put	get
but looking into another scenario the messages i would be getting in the queue are from a 3rd party according a standard schema.the schema would remain same and there is no change in that.but i have seen some where i get some format exceptions and since its not committed the message is back to the queue.at this point this message would be a bottle neck for me as the same messages is picked up again and tries to process the message.every time the service would pick up the same message and gets the same exception.so this loops infinitely unless that message is removed or put that message last in the queue

21143791
for-loop	loops
all you need is a double for-loop and make sure to start the inner loops at the index of the outer loops that will omit one after you ve gone through all of its permutations

floating-point	fractions
these values come from the parameters that specify the floating-point formats such as how many bits are available for the fractions and exponent fields and how much the exponent is biased

21147876
int	double
thus limiting the switch only to native data int double float etc. and strings

21147905
implements	extends
it is generally recommended to implements runnable instead of extends thread since java only has single inheritance

21147916
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
if your column you were wanting to get the max value on was a number you could use an aggregate but aggregate-functions avg min max or sum can only be applied to attributes of type integer float money bigint or decimal

21148006
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
nsoperation subclass instanciates nsurlconnection which performs synchronous request and retrieves data

21148078
post	put
the only items that are returned automatically through the post are fields that have been put in a for helper

21148078
put	get
this way the model item is put in a for helper so it gets posted back to the controller and you get the benefits of the kendo dropdown

21148082
folder	directory
in my mind which contains a little programming knowledge i would install a library or package into a folder or directory and then have a require_once statement make reference to that library

21148084
width	height
first i observe that the x y width and height values describes a rectangle containing the circle

21148084
width	height
the center of the arc is the center of the rectangle whose origin is x y and whose size is specified by the width and height arguments

21148084
width	height
so first i start by calculating the x y width and height values

debian	linux
debian gnu linux 7.1

21148302
width	height
what you should really do is just check the width and height of the window

21148302
width	height
if the width is than the height then it is landscape

21148302
width	height
if the height is more than the width then it is portrait

21148339

21148355
google-chrome	firefox
the ie webdriver takes much longer to execute these tests than the firefox and google-chrome drivers

21148355
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome four browser instances launch when the tests begin

21148355
google-chrome	firefox
my goal is to make ie consume available threads as soon as they become available like firefox and google-chrome

21148391
google-chrome	firefox
both firefox and google-chrome provide utilities to download a certificate for a domain

21148417

maven	m2e
i am currently trying to create a m2e maven-archtype-webapp project in eclipse but i notice that it does not generate the maven libraries under the java resources directory

21148577
maple	maxima
from literals floating point on the rosetta code web site it looks like j maple and maxima provide a literal syntax for arbitrary precision floating point numbers

21148577
decimal	ieee
however most programming languages will convert a literal decimal number in source code into an ieee floating-point number

21148577
floating-point	fractions
however more than a few people unfamiliar with the ieee floating point representations of numbers -- or similar floating-point representations which have largely faded into history -- are a surprised to learn that one-tenth isn t exactly one-tenth when it is converted into a binary fractions

21148577
maple	maxima
for that j maple and maxima seem to have what i am seeking

21148577
floating-point	fractions	rational-numbers	floating-point	rational-numbers	fractions
it provides a rich comprehension of numeric types and operations as well as numeric literal notation which includes rational-numbers expressions and which appears to provide for treating decimal numbers with a fractions part as rational-numbers rather than floating-point literals in all cases

21148577
haskell	ocaml
for myself i will be spending more time reseaching haskell and revisiting ocaml f# which may be viable intermediate choices between julia python like languages and a language like haskell -- how those programming languages may fall across some sort of spectrum is left as an exercise for the reader

21148577
haskell	ocaml
if ocaml f# offer comparable expressive power to haskell in the cases in which i have an interest they may be a better choice just on the basis of current and likely future adoption rates

21148581
division	multiplication
as roddy said you would probably benefit from keeping the digits as numbers instead of characters reasonably you would be implementing more calculations than displays in bigint and you will not need to convert things for each calculation just imagine what it would be like to handle multiplication and division like you do add

21148581
subtract	add	subtraction	add
you might benefit from implementing the subtract method before trying to make add do subtraction

21148589
hide	show
i have an input element and there is a blur event on the input element to hide the div and just show the value from input as a text in the div which works fine

21148596
rpm	yum
the yum program contacts a remote server and downloads rpm files and installs them for you

but one alternative option is to download the rpm s that you need and install them with rpm -i instead of letting yum do that for you

21148610
int	chars
when you want to convert an int to chars so you can pass such int as parameter you will do

21148610

you use sprintf to print your int into a chars variable and then use it

21148648
gruntjs	mimosa
as a possible alternative to gruntjs i would suggest looking at mimosa

21148686
put	get
depending on the type of the exception i get i might want to just catch it and put the bad incoming queue message into an db error table and continue the transaction

21148686

21149121
superclass	subclassing
normally tables that store class hierarchy superclass and subclassing together require a separate discriminator column

21149121
superclass	subclassing
if you split it into 3 separate tables superclass and its two subclassing you will get a normalized model

21149121
superclass	subclassing
if your example is a simplified presentation of your real data model and your subclassing differ substantially then normalization will be more economical in storage space and offer faster execution for queries that rely solely on superclass data

21149142

21150392
for-loop	loops
i forgot that in python cython a for-loop does not automagically create a new scope and that loops variable is nothing special

21150419
hide	show
it is also generated by a component object when that object s addnotify removenotify show or hide method is called

21150437
xslt	xquery
you could then perhaps select one representative document for each top-level element name and use a tool to generate a schema for that document then run a similar query to validate all the documents in that group against that schema for this you will need a schema-aware xslt or xquery processor

then parent can check all their children to see if any of them are visible

21154677

and we can rely on s dirty checking to ensure all the children are properly set before the parent final visibility is determined

certainly for transformations that benefit from matrix algebra you should keep stuff in arrays but as soon as you re wanting run parallel analysis on subsets of your data or plot stuff by factors in your data you really want to melt

21174936
min	max
if the chances are high that you should change only at a few or one of these indexes you could use a heap or a min max if there s only one place to change

21174936
min	max
if d is 1 or -1 the best place can be found easily with min or max

21174936
min	max

how and where to malloc or realloc

21175745
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
in the first case you can use malloc or realloc in the function but you should also free the allocated memory before return unless your code stores the value in a global variable in which case you can delegate to some other code to handle the free but it had better be very clear which code has the responsibility and in any case using global variables is probably not a good idea

i read in different sources that a common thing to do for a process that would become a daemon is to redirect stdin stdout stderr to dev null in order to prevent the daemon from spamming the console which makes perfect sense

i m currently using a custom control to display text on a page and then allow administrators to edit this text via a pop-up dialog at the same point

21184686
width	height
the imageview must fit all the width of the linearlayout so i used match_parent for the width and it must keep the aspect ratio so i used wrap_content for the height and setadjustviewbounds to true

21184686
width	height
but something is not working because the width of the imageview is correct it fits the width of the linear layout but the height of the imageview is wrong the image is being cutted in the upper and the lower part

21184686
width	height
edit it only works if i specify the width and the height of the imageview with absolute numbers

21184686
width	height
for example if i put 400 400 is the 50 of the screen the layout width width and 583 height it works but if i put match_parent for width and wrap content for height.

stdout	stderr
calling open 2 creates another file descriptor that could possiblly replacing stdin stdout stderr

stdout	stderr
when writing output to dev stdout or dev stderr on windows phantomjs goes through the following steps as seen in the render method in phantomjs src webpage.cpp

21185279
stdout	stderr
in absence of dev stdout and dev stderr a temporary file path is allocated

21185279
stdout	stderr
call qstring fromascii on the byte array and write to stdout or stderr

21185279
stdout	stderr
in system.cpp the system class holds references to among other things file objects for stdout stdin and stderr which are set up to use utf-8 encoding

21185279
stdout	stderr
note that this fix only applies to writing to stdout - if you want to you could always apply it to stderr but it may not matter quite so much in that case

21185303
range	max	range	min	min	max
however it s simply an elaboration of that because range min max should return true if and only if both min and max are not included -- you simply have to test both points or alternately if one of the a range in the database endpoints is contained within range min.max

21185303
min	max
assuming there are indexes on the min and max columns then the order of algorithm would be o log n where n is the number of rows in the database as opposed to o n if you search every row

21185303
range	max	range	min	min	max
assuming range min max results in 2 variables range_min and range_max i think you can do something like

finally get the width and height

21186297
width	height
maybe these values width and height can be 0 so you have to do it

client-side	server-side
is it a client-side solution by javascript or jquery or can be handled server-side by php

selecteditem	selectedindex
so you have some data in timeinput.dataprovider so i think the clean solution would be just to find the wanted item in this dataprovider say the value with 4 30 and then just set it as selecteditem or index to selectedindex this will make the dropdown scrolled to this item when opened

inherited	subclassing
if you need to cast from base class to subclassing you haven t succeeded in creating a good object oriented design and you should explore methods to avoid the cast since the inherited structure implies that the caller shouldn t need to care about the actual subclassing the need to cast violates this principle and should therefore be avoided when possible

i m trying to send emails to users from my site just like how craiglist does it. e.g when user a responds to a post by user b an email gets sent out to user a informing him that user a has responded to his post.user b can then press the reply button in his email client like gmial hotmail and the reply email will get sent to user a and any further correspondence will be strictly between the 2 of them with my server only sending the initial email.

i tested similar thing trying to slideup slidedown a tr using jquery on previous ie versions ie7 and below not sure about ie8 and i can tell you that under ie it s impossible to have such effects for tables

21195468

these requests are visible in all other browsers dev tools firefox ie and in fiddler but not in google-chrome

21195814

division	modulo
here s a solution that uses the modulo and integer division

21196033
put	get
essentially you put a service boundary on things that you want to be able to change separately the same single responsibility principle you know from oo - the size of a service should be so that its utility the benefit you get from it be more than the overhead it creates

21196046
for-loop	loops
when the for-loop is executed with bounds in the thousandths place it loops through the for statements 3 times as i expect it to

dr request to example.com static js is handled by nginx while request to example.com dynamic category.php is processed by lighttpd apache

21196383
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
i was thinking of changing the current setup of lighttpd for http and apache for https by using lighttpd for both http and https however i was also thinking of serving static files with something like nginx which is perfect for such content with only one working thread

21196387
int	double
in go given the lack of generics and the ability to declare such a type contract you have to write a function that operates on a list of int a list of double a list of string etc

21196402

i worked some more on this today and found that you can do it if you upgrade the plugin to the latest versioning at least 1.0+ this won t be available on maven central instead use jcentral

21196562
google-chrome	firefox
following change color and appearance of drop down arrow will work very well in google-chrome and firefox although ie11 is behaving a bit oddly possibly also other ie versions

prepare	execute
you could also prepare your statement once and then execute it multiple times but combining would be more efficient especially with a growing number of inserts

21196700
folder	directory
if the file you saved is right then you have to execute the cmd.exe and go to the python33 folder using cd c python33 or where you have it once you re in the right directory write python path.py where the path is the right path of the file.py or you can just move the file into the cmd

21196718
put	get
this may be too basic but if you put these three formulas in you should get the desired result assuming you dont have duplicates in a or c

21196735
int	boolean
any positive int will give a true when compared with boolean true so the if test is always valid

21196743
nginx	lighttpd
you could do something like configure a reverse proxy for certain paths in lighttpd to go to a different port which nginx owns but this will still push all the data through lighttpd and just use more resources than having lighttpd serve it directly

21196804
hide	show
it would be useful to show selection controls when there is no data but hide the selection controls when there is data

21196854
google-chrome	firefox
compatibility google-chrome firefox 28+ ie11+

21196881
inotifypropertychanged	icollectionview

i m trying to add an int to a chars array

21196936
ant	maven
we are required to use myeclipseblue and that maven or ant is not used to build the project

21196961
put	get
so if we put together those pieces of advice we get something like this

21196965
int	chars
edit to answer the second part of your question you re casting an int to a chars which only holds one digit as it were

21197014
int	double
numpy interprets your arrays as being of int type because there are no explicit floats but octave would treat the arrays as double

21197025
spaces	delimiter
will save all the lines in pattern spaces delimiter by newline

21197171
getter	setter
2 create a getter and setter for userno

21197175

int	chars
your function int priority chars ch does not have a return statement for every possible input

21197360

i m using a jquery and css to set width and height to grid columns and its inside elements

21197395
hide	show
practically i want that certain slider show hide depending on the ui.value but the if condition is not working correctly

21197494
width	height
you need to decide on a limit for either your width or height not both obviously

21197494
portrait	landscape
add checks and calculation alternatives for landscape portrait orientation as needed.

21197522
min	max
even if it s a n varchar field 6 months you can still use the min and max aggregates or at least you can in t-sql

21197548
debian	linux
now i have to move my apps from windows xampp server to linux probably some kind of debian distro - don t know it yet

it should be able to know what i m currently looking at for eg a pdf file or a lecture video in vlc and get the name of the respective file start time end times etc and finally post to db

21197617
addeventlistener	onload
since you are not using jquery use the built in addeventlistener to listen for the onload event in both scripts instead of setting window.onload

21197652
getter	setter
this doesn t help us however since there are no portable functions to inquire about the buffering mode of a there are only setter no getter

21197658
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicspixmapitem
i have a qgraphicsscene with a qgraphicspixmapitem on it showing an image

21197658
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicspixmapitem	qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsview	qgraphicspixmapitem
now i d like to map this point to the original image coordinates using any combination of the qgraphicsview qgraphicsscene qgraphicspixmapitem

21197658
width	height
img_coord_pt is 0 0 when i click the top left corner of the image and image width image height at the bottom right corner

21197694
width	height
when the viewport is a normal size it works out fine and if one were to incrementally decrease the size of the viewport the inner div s width adjusts properly but the height stays the same

21197696
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
avoid java.util.date java.util.calendar and java.text.simpledateformat classes

21197767

adding session.rollback to the except block will remove the object that cannot be saved to the database from the session allowing the next object to be saved

21197779
gtk	cairo
try having a look at how to draw a cairo surface onto a gtk widget here

21197782

21197879
google-chrome	firefox
i have a simple game that works fine in firefox and when debugging in flashdevelop but in google-chrome fails to start

21197891
mdpi	hdpi
if you use 9-pacthes provide alternative densities to mdpi hdpi xhdpi xxhdpi too

21197898
post	get
i would also rather use post than get because the session string is sensitive info

21197970
spaces	delimiter
you ll want to use the split function because raw_input doesn t separate the input by spaces or any other delimiter

21198002
google-chrome	firefox
i have a class for ie cardexp an one for google-chrome firefox etc.

21198051
folder	directory
another alternative better is to remove all the files in that directory and put your entire folder and files of a new clear publication

21198091
filewriter	printwriter
printwriter is more effective than filewriter and filewriter is needed anyhow but this will work also if you want to do multiples people then just for-loop it and dont forget to close

21198095
width	margin
then in your style sheet add a class of full_width li img and set the width of your images and add margin 0 auto like

21198131

awt	swing
take a look at painting in awt and swing for more details about how painting is done in swing

21198193
portrait	landscape
the uibarbuttonitem has an image for portrait orientation and another image for landscape orientation

21198193
portrait	landscape
however if the view for the uinavigationcontroller first appears in landscape orientation say by presenting it in landscape orientation or by dismissing a view controller that is covering it up in landscape orientation the portrait image is used instead

21198198
folder	directory
but what i wish to do is check to see if a string is a directory as well as being absolute without the folder existing for example

21198214
crossover	mutation
q1 i am using a single random number generator for crossover and mutation probabilities

21198214
crossover	mutation
i ask this question because the crossover rate i chose is 0.7 and mutation to be 0.01

21198214
crossover	mutation
if a number generated by the random function lies under the border where it satisfies mutation the same number also satisfies crossover

21198223
treemap	linkedhashmap
linkedhashmap is faster for insertion because it wonâ t have to unnecessarily compare values while inserting like treemap as stated by ejp

21198223
treemap	linkedhashmap	children	parent
and since linkedhashmap only needs a link for the previous and to the next key while treemap needs a link to the parent node and 1+ links to children i think that treemap will also consume a slightly bigger memory

21198231
google-chrome	firefox
note it works for firefox and google-chrome

21198237
getter	setter
you have to declare x and y as properties in your interface and implement the getter and setter in your implementation

21198287
stdout	stderr
standard output stdout and standard error stderr are nearly always the first and second output streams coming from a process respectively

21198313
crossover	mutation
you should generate new numbers for each gene for crossover and mutation step if you use the same single random number for multiple purposes you will limit the explorable solution space

21198325
jobs	cron
once i enable clustering in quartz it will distribute the cron jobs to the various servers in the cluster

21198387
crossover	mutation
q2 this is up to you but generally the genes are mutated randomly independent of each other mutation happens after the crossover but i think you already know that

21198388
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsitem
qgraphicsview maptoscene maps screen coordinates to scene coordinates then use qgraphicsview itemat to get the item and qgraphicsitem mapfromscene to map scene global coordinates to item local coordinates

21198393
post	put
this blog post gives some good support on why not to put tons of stuff in the app delegate

21198404
nsoperationqueue	nsblockoperation
i do this within a nsblockoperation running on an nsoperationqueue so i am not needlessly blocking the main queue

21198425

21198456
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
but in webkit based browsers safari google-chrome opera rather than pushing a too-long span to the next line the span gets clipped

21198457
put	get
it turns out all that is required to get this to work properly is to put the span elements on the same line in the html

21198538
post	get
i get a jumbled response for the post showing in firebug

21198546

post	get
so after using left co 2 to get the two characters in col all i had to do was to check col against the four color codes and post the right info for that line

21198574
hash	md5
then you need a method to compute the md5 hash for a piece of text and return a string containing its hex representation

21198596
width	height
now when i toggle the display property to inline intending to make the element visible it is setting both width and height of the element to -10px

21198596
width	height
i even tried hard-coding width and height into the .on class but that is being overridden somehow

21198627
stdout	stderr
it does print to stderr but under normal circumstances the stderr stream goes to the console just like the stdout stream

21198627
stdout	stderr
however the reason you should use stderr instead of stdout for error messages is because you can redirect it

21198687
width	height
just enclose the width height with quotes

21198784
disk	ram
the idea is that that way the variable is stored on the disk instead of in the ram

21198806
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
since these are obfuscation techniques combining layers of them indeed makes reverse-engineering more difficult than just applying a single technique

21198888
macports	homebrew
homebrew has less of a stranglehold on your machine doesn t require as much reading as macports

21198935
width	height
display inline resets height and width

i tried using snoop and i can see my specialcontrol in there somewhere with a contentpresenter that s not expandable no sign of the checkbox or the button

21198965

docker does do some management of daemonized containers if the systemd shuts down then when the docker daemons starts it will also restart any containers that were running at the time the systemd shut down

21198977
bower	npm
i m new to using npm and bower building my first app in emberjs

21198977
bower	npm
this so answer says bower is for front-end and npm is for backend stuff

21199026
bower	npm
npm and bower are both dependency management tools

21199026
bower	npm
but the main difference between both is npm is used for installing node js modules but bower js is used for managing front end components like html css js etc

21199026
bower	npm
bower unlike npm can have multiple files .js .css .html .png .ttf which are considered the main file s

21199026
bower	npm
edit grunt is quite different from npm and bower

21199026
gruntjs	package.json
if it is a node module like gruntjs request then it will go in package.json otherwise into bower json

21199028
put	get
below is what i have tried but i am not able to get the text spinner item and put it in the format

21199046
width	height
since you already use jquery you can just calculate the proper width and height

21199057
letter-spacing	word-spacing
manually adjusting the letter-spacing and word-spacing is ugly and ineffective

21199062
put	get
i set up a desktop mobile css i put the desktop on index.html and the mobile on m.index.html but the desktop is coming up on both desktop laptop and mobile.how can i get the mobile to work

21199070

in terms of the jquery request without server-side scripting the post request is not significantly different from a get request in that the content of the file found at the url is returned as the body of the response

21199088
width	height
form some reason the link is taking up the width and height of the entire page and has a padding of 20px on the top-left and top

21199120
put	get
i have been able to get the static nested class using getdeclaredclasses and i would normally get the private field barray with getdeclaredfields and setaccessible but i can t seem to put it all together to be able to iterate through barray from outside the class

21199127
width	height
depending on the effect you are trying to get you can change the height width of the link to inherit or you can change the position to relative

google-chrome	firefox
compare that example in various browsers and you ll see that in firefox the columns are split as evenly as possible by height where as in ie an extra item shifts from the second to the first column and in google-chrome two items scoot over there

21199156
highcharts	highstock
i was checking out the possibility of implementing a zoomable line chart using highcharts something that highstock line chart does and came across this example in the demo

21199177
integer	unsigned
if the native integer size was smaller than 64-bit you could use the same theory but you d have to loop over the array sizeof cachedarr sizeof unsigned int times

21199177
int	chars
it should be noted that with doing any chars to int type casting you may need to take into consideration alignment if the chars data is aligned to the appropriate word-size boundary

21199197

you can put the links in a list or a file and use requests to get the html then use beautifulsoup to find the image you want extract the src attribute and use requests again to download the file

21199200
minimum	max	min	max
however i think that is not possible for a fenwick tree to perform minimum maximum queries that is because it relies on the fact that the acummulative frequency from a to b is f b -f a-1 and that property is not valid for the min max functions

21199266
post	get
i m trying to post a piece of json data to ajax and get a upvote_message in return

you can encode arbitrary strings by encoding it in binary and then hex

21199397
for-loop	arrays
the way i did this was to make an arrays and instatiate it to 123456789 then shuffle that arrays then you can go through this now shuffled arrays with a for-loop and pull out as many numbers as you need to make a new string as long and as unique ie 4 digit 5 digit unique random number

21199399
hide	show
you can hide and show them as much as you want and they will keep their original order

21199430
mouseout	mouseenter
lastly to have our controller listen to the dom we use .on instead of deprecated .hover syntax which is just sugar for the mouseenter and mouseout events

java.util.date	simpledateformat
these classes supplant the troublesome old legacy date-time classes such as java.util.date calendar simpledateformat

21199465
yesod	hamlet
i normally give the same base name to both my hamlet and julius lucius files differing extensions of course so yesod handles the inclusion automatically

21199489

21199758
width	height
using a element to position the image in each icon so you only have to define the image url height and width once

21199758
width	height
the height and width can be anything you want although scaling down will of course look better than scaling up

21199758
width	height
if the height width ratio doesn t match the icon it will be squished or stretched but you can prevent that with a preserveaspectratio attribute

21199782
django	web.py
google app engine has support for some web frameworks django web.py webapp2 and others but it doesn t include them

21200631
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
to summarize +initialize is called by the runtime on every class so for a superclass with n subclassing it will get called n+1 times on the superclass once directly and once for each subclassing that inherited it

21200653
google-chrome	firefox
this issue is on both google-chrome and firefox browsers

21200675

what they cannot all do is address memory with 64bit addresses or 32-bit addresses in the case of 16-bit and 8-bit cpus

21200715
floating-point	integer
what can matter if the author of the program is not aware of cpu architecture issues is that without careful specification data sent by different cpus can send their bytes in different order like the 8-bytes of a 64-bit integer or floating-point number and or assume the bytes are in a different order

21205453
for-loop	loops
in your case you are converting the variable to a 32-bit unsigned and shifting it right 1 bit at a time a suitable for-loop would loops over the bits in a 32-bit unsigned

21205455
gedit	sublimetext
however both sublimetext and gedit at least the versions of them i m using on ubuntu sublimetext 2 and gedit 3.6.2 poorly highlight json - they use the same color for keys and values making any log drilling quite painful and really impossible to go through in any remotely humane manner

21205467

note that byte order in png is big-endian 255 - 000000ff and in gif is little-endian 255 - ff00

21205646
getter	setter
beside getter setter design madness it seems that nullpointerexception is caused by fact that booksinshelf is static which means that it belongs to entire shelf class instances of this class share value of this field so when you add book to one shelf and increment this field it will be incremented for all instances of shelf

21205676

be sure to support gcc clang and icc

21206330
clang	icc
if your code breaks under icc its probably because the compiler optimizer removed some undefined behavior see clang s undefined sanitizer below on how to locate the offending code

clang	icc
after you get through compilation with gcc clang and icc run the program under valgrind

21206330

21207128
keydown	keyup
to solve your problem simple set a bool true on keydown and and the bool false on keyup

21207161

usually you d use a for-loop for something like that because you know before you start loops how many times you need loops to run

21207228

easymock	powermockito
you ll have to add in something like powermockito which integrates well with easymock

21208217
mouse	keyboard
i ll post here stripped versions of functions - for keyboard input only without extra handling mouse ime etc

21208237
post	get
looks like you ve configured a get method instead of a post method

21208308
int	chars
how is possible to add sub chars from int and what s the meaning behind it and thanks

21208312
wildfly	jboss
if you are developing a java ee application ie web application served by an application server like wildfly jboss then you can use the ejb scheduler

21208325
stdout	stderr
the transform function throws an exception as well as sends a fatal error to stderr stdout

21208329
udp	tcp
if you would design your program in a pipeline pattern then i think you would be able to easily switch initial tcp udp input stage with any other library

21208361
int	chars
chars are in turn stored as int ascii value so that you can perform add and sub on int which will return ascii value of a chars

21208365
google-chrome	safari
however when i run it in google-chrome and safari it turns out different

21208387
hash	md5
how to compute md5 hash for file in c# in next way

21208463
public	protected
stop using var in php classes it is deprecated use visibility modifiers like you did in the database class private public protected

21208464
put	get
when i put it on the next line and run it again i get a little white space between the divs

21208469
int	chars
and as it turns out when you do chars math subtracting any alphabetical chars from any other alphabetical chars of the same case results in bits being flipped in such a way that if you were to interpret them as an int would represent the distance between these chars

21208469
int	chars
additionally subtracting the chars 0 from any other numeric chars will result in int value of the chars you subtracted from for basically the same reason

21208501
hash	md5
normally md5 and other hash don t work like that

21208515
istream	getline
istream getline istream is string str char delim

21208515
istream	getline
istream getline istream is string str

21208533
min	max
its code point value unicode - min u0000 and max uffff

21208533
min	max
its ascii value min 0 and max 65 535 inclusive

21208533
int	chars
for example the chars a can be represented by its int ascii value 65

21208533
int	chars
as a note a short is a 16-bit signed int so even though a chars is also 16-bits the maximum int value of a chars 65 535 exceeds the maximum int value of a short 32 767

21208533
int	chars
and the minimum int value of a chars is 0 whereas the minimum int value of a short is -32 768

21208533
int	chars
for all intents and purposes it converts the chars data types to int values and then does basic arithmetic

21208533
int	chars
the d chars can be represented by its int ascii value of 68

21208546
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari

21208613
oncreate	onstart
i want to put builder from onstart to oncreate for make toast. br

21208632
oncreate	onstart
oncreate still can t see the value of builder since it s created later in onstart

21208659
oncreate	onstart
oncreate is before onstart in the lifecycle your builder will be null in oncreate

21208659
oncreate	onstart
just show the toast in onstart after building your string or move all of your code to oncreate

21208663
oncreate	onstart
onstart is called after the oncreate so it is not possible to show datas retrieved in onstart function inside oncreate

21208707
width	height
these 4 div s that clip on sides and bottom top should have width and height in percentages but this div that should be in middle should have 800x600px width height

21208712
division	multiplication
and this is were i got the unicode for the division and multiplication signs from

21208717
pull	push
instead of having downstream developers push into the upstream repository enable incoming git connections to downstream machines as well and fetch or pull downstream changes into the upstream repository

21208749
typedef	struct
the reason my typedef wasn t recognized by the compiler was because i didn t recreate the precompiled header file after defining the struct and including the header file in the source of the precompiled header so the compiler kept using the old one

21208777
matplotlib	pypng
however i cannot use the python image library pil for this task and so am using pypng to read the logo but after much searching i cannot find a way to convert the image to a matplotlib compatible one for use with figmimage to overlay the logo on the chart

21208777
matplotlib	pypng
the pypng docs show how to convert an image using numpy for use with matplotlib but their examples are python 2.x and i don t know how to convert the example itertools.imap for use with python 3

21208786
public	protected
returns an array containing the names of the public and protected instance methods in the receiver

21208786
public	protected
for a module these are the public and protected methods

21208830
width	height
you can use position absolute or position fixed to clip those divs on the sides of the screen and just give them percentage width height

21208830
width	height
note i was just making estimations as to the values of the percentages used but for the center div its top and left margins should be negative of the half of the value of its height and width respectively

21208905
filesystems	btrfs
unfortunately the btrfs filesystems has a peculiarity that after any delete command it doesn t immediately free the disk space

21208931

nrvo and return-value-optimization are the keywords you want

21209044
punctuation	words
i want to use python to count the numbers of words that occur between certain punctuation characters in a block of text input

21209044
punctuation	words	next	except
...because the first sentence which has no punctuation except the period at the end has 23 words the for example phrase that comes next has two and the rest ending with the colon has 14

21209091
screens	hdpi
start with some screens size as your base target device for 4.7 inch hdpi and create a single layout for default screens in layout folder and declare dimensions in dimens.xml in values folder

21209091
mdpi	hdpi
also if you have got separate drawables for various size like mdpi hdpi etc you can place them under drawable-mdpi drawable-hdpi etc

21209093
put	get
i can t easily put a bound on the amount of nesting that might arise but i d say it would often get into the hundreds and in the lifetime of the software may reach the hundreds of thousands for certain branches

21209129
post	get
i create a simple user entity and a controller to implement the post method get method works fine

21209169
std	ostream
it might be used with implementations for std ostream that don t handle stringyfied formats

21209178
inherited	subclassing
i have uiviewcontroller subclassing in which i implement a delegate i then implement the delegate method in my childviewcontrollers the viewcontrollers who inherited from the subclassing but i never receive a message only if i implement the delegate method directly in the subclassing parent viewcontroller

21209189
folder	directory
i am a noob at php and apache in fact i just bought my first domain today and i was wondering if it is at all possible to redirect a user to my home page when they attempt to access folder that i have in my root directory but don t want them to see

21209189
folder	directory
i have a folder within my root directory named images with it s file path being public_html images

21209214
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i have a container that holds fluid width equally spaced divs the text-justify method that works great in plain html but when generated by jade it fails to space them out tested in google-chrome firefox opera

21209224
spaces	delimiter
using 0 as the delimiter paired with xargs -0 option ensures that all filenames - even those with embedded spaces or even newlines - are passed through as-is

21209242
google-chrome	safari
it happens in both safari and google-chrome

21209278
std	ostream
the compiler can t find any operator which takes as a left argument std ostream and as right argument compo

21209282
firefox	safari
then when you press on the back button tried on safari and firefox it returns with the class animated and bounceoutup but i want it to com back with the original class animated and bounceindown

21209285
versioning	upgrade
the advantage however would be to keep the code near to the original one and being able to upgrade once a new versioning of the bundle would be released

21209288
printf	getchar
i m dusting off of my c skills for an upcoming class and i came across this weird output with printf after building a string using getchar

21209289
scaleanimation	rotateanimation
if it weren t specific to scaleanimation it would not have been named as such especially because rotateanimation does not extend scaleanimation

21209293
windbg	mdbg
you can use wmemoryprofiler which exposes the mdbg class managed debugger which is basically windbg + sos loaded and use a managed application to control the debugger and execute comamnds on it

21209304
int	chars
getchar returns int type but you declared c is of type chars

21209307
width	height	int	chars
you can achieve this by simply reading aways the first 26 chars and then saving the width and height in int variables

21209307
width	height
so this will read away the first 26 characters whatever they may be and save you much trouble in reading the width and height which is actually what you want

21209313
for-loop	arrays
i want to figure out a for-loop or something to be able to iterate the arrays such as this

21209336

i am trying to store a 15 bit int in those chars but i must leave the 8th bit of the first chars untouched

21209365
innodb	myisam
a myisam table or mysql version 5.7 and beyond and either innodb or myisam

21209367
google-chrome	firefox
it works on google-chrome firefox and ie9 and up

put	get
control.monad.statevar has a typeclass which lets you get and put iorefs and strefs identically

21209395
calloc	malloc
7.20.3.3 2 gives no indication that the memory allocated by malloc is to be considered to an array cf 7.20.3.1 for calloc

21209480
ddms	adb
if you use intellij idea like me - run monitor from tools- android other way idea built in adb conflict with ddms

21209496
width	height
how do you get width and height of an image imported into pygame

21209496
width	height
but i dont know how to get the width and height

21209539
daemons	systemd
notice that systemd 3 popen 3 are library functions not systemd calls which are listed in syscalls 2 ... calling both fork and execve on bin sh ... and that daemons 3 is a library function calling fork twice etc.

21209545
min	rank
a simple way to get the indices of a rank 1 array arr for elements greater than value min is

21209584
int	boolean
that is if both operands happen to be boolean they re int either 1 or 0 so bitwise stuff applies

21209599
put	get
because there is an upper bound to the size of what can be put in intent extras you should look into another way to get the image into your imageview

21209674
getter	setter
in python you can have getter setter that behave like usual properties

21209675
width	height
there are 2 methods available for getting the width and height of a surface

21209675
width	height
the first one is get_size it returns a tuple width height

21209675
width	height
to access width for instance you would do and for height

21209675
width	height
the second method is to use get_width and get_height which return the width and the height

21209688
post	get
using _request gets get or post

21209690
post	get
it contains the data from both post and get

21209805
button	checkbox
i am creating a form which asks users to accept terms and conditions and would like to disable the submit button until they click the checkbox but can t get it to work i m not great at javascript

21209809
int	chars
getchar returns an int not a chars

21209813
typedef	struct
since the compiler still has some liberty as to where what member is actually stored it doesn t quite suffice to pass the stringified typedef sort of thing objctype encode struct yourstruct because there is a good chance that you won t be able to make sense of the actual struct itself owing to compiler optimizations and such.

21209830
super	extends
as per my understanding type unknown is introduced to resolve the co-variance not supported in generics and it should fit any type of collection and means that you can have collection of types t or the class which extends means you can have collection of types t or super s of t

21209830
super	extends
as per my understanding both extends and super includes the type declared so in this particular case as my list is of type string

21209863

21209903
min	max
i ve tried varying my stereo mark size the max min disparity values etc

21209926
super	extends
as per my understanding both extends and super includes the type declared string here so in this particular case as my list is of type string .

21209950
screens	mdpi
what you re seeing on the screens is that a typical mdpi device is 320 px while a typical xhdpi is 720 px

21209950
screens	mdpi
but on the mdpi screens 2 buttons would be 360px and not fit

21209961
folder	directory
find monomac.dll in src folder and copy it to your project directory

21210108

working on my website i have made a row of 5 little squares that use the background-image and background-position properties using a spritesheet of social icons to create a list of external links

21210154
tstringgrid	tpanel
you could simply place the tstringgrid inside a tpanel and align it to alclient then use the published resize event of the tpanel for any actions

21210172
width	height
there is width and height and probably pixelformat could be used to calculate the bits per pixel

21210209
chown	sudo	hdfs	oozie
try sudo chown hdfs hdfs oozie-workflows hive-site.xml considering location and name of your oozie workflow folder

21210221

hide	show
i want to hide two images partially behind my center main div just like it is show on the picture i included the images are blue and the center div is brown the darker blue color is the part of the image that is supposed to be hiden behind the div .the two images are included in the html as tags .they have to be as they currently are part of the html and not injected via css

21210307
width	height
employing one dimensional filters decreases the two dimensional filter s computational complexity from o m 2 n 2 to o 2m n 2 where m and n are the width and height of the filter mask and the image respectively

21210327
width	height
my div height and width is in percentages

21210327
width	height
i have to put some images in those divs but the problem is i don t know how to calculate which height x width of images i need

21210371
versioning	upgrade
to get the an upgrade versioning of mercurial i am entering the command below which throws an error

21210388
tesseract	leptonica
to install tesseract you need leptonica and leptonica in turn needs various libraries

21210419
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
on the server the download is ok in firefox but in google-chrome or safari the file is corrupted and i m asked if i want to try and repair it which doesn t work

21210419

jobs	cron
go to your cpanel select cron jobs and use the following command to create it

21210562
printf	strncpy
another way to fix the strncpy bug would be to fix the printf call

21210576
google-chrome	firefox
i managed to get this working in google-chrome and firefox too by appending a link to the to document

21210584
int	chars
example to test the first bit of a chars in a system where 8 bit chars are much slower to access than 32 bit int

21210596
post	get
here is a link to get a general idea you ll see the few test blog post up top and would ultimately like that to be the latest two and then be able to go to a page that displays all of them as i said before

21210702

i have a shell of a put request but i am not sure how to get the current org that i am view out of the array

21210753
mp4	webm
i am trying to add multiple video levels mp4 and webm at the same time along with multiple video sources hq and sq but all the scripts that i have seen contains only one option

21210805
hive	hdfs
as per my understanding both hive and hbase are using hdfs to store the data

21210843
chown	sudo
to do a chown you must be the owner or a super user try sudo chown -r

21210929
apache	nginx
this is excellent for quick prototypes or one-off work but as has been mentioned throughout this question you should use something like apache or nginx in production

21210947
hive	hdfs
hive is simply a sql-like abstraction for interacting with the data in hdfs

21210964
range	max	range	min	min	max
i have a range element with min value of 100 and max value of 500 to zoom a page

21211022
put	get
if your classes are quite small you should put them in one single file called tastyfood.py and you ll get the same behaviour without folders

21211046
superclass	subclassing
operation s constructor calls super s which it is allowed to do because it s a subclassing in fact it has to since there s no nullary constructor in the superclass

21211054
orientdb	neo4j
ok back to neo4j orientdb is very immature

21211058
super	extends
if not just call the super method on whichever adapter you extends

21211100
onresume	onpause
now on my onpause i want to save the current time and then onresume proceed from that time

21211100
onresume	onpause
if i m correct i save the current timertime in the playtimepref string at onpause and open that on onresume

21211130
post	get
i don t know how to get a handle on the store to create the new post object though

21211165
width	height
remove min width and height from image and add

21211205
for-loop	loops
i understand the while loops perfectly although corrections and best practices are welcomed but the for-loop logic continues to elude me and i would like to fully understand this before moving on

21211213
packets	multicast
intelligent switches can benefit from peeking at igmp packets to know which interfaces multicast packets have to be forwarded to

21211213
packets	multicast
multicast packets can traverse a router if it s configured to route multicast search for m-bone

21211223
int	chars
main int argc chars argv with this function and it will be called

21211234
mathml	mathjax
but if you want something like a typographic fraction you could use mathml with mathjax

21211246
post	get
i m getting the last 10 post from my wordpress site and i m able to get the data from it successfully in android and set it to a textview

21211262
mouse	keyboard	move	drag
by looking at code from demo examples i can draw primary canvas items bind keyboard and mouse events like drag focus move to them

21211263
for-loop	loops
also there s no reason for the nested for-loop since the while loops will handle all you need

21211320
implements	extends
you also do not have to create a parcelable object because objects that do not extends or implements parcelable cannot successfully be passed in an intent even though you will not see any errors

21211362
subtract	add
i ultimately want to be able to add edit and subtract items just for the record i am using this property as it hopefully will be cheaper in billing - but i can t test it until i have my app up and running

21211422
super	self
for this case specifically super foo self .who_knows is not a good thing at all

21211458
google-chrome	firefox	hide	show
i ve only tested the code on google-chrome firefox and ie so far and i tried javascript to detect ie and hide the menu and show a different one but it also didn t work and older browsers won t be a problem because css3 transforms won t occur leaving the first links in the place or so i suspect

21211482
put	get
i set up a desktop mobile css i put the desktop on index.html and the mobile on m.index.html but the desktop is coming up on both desktop laptop and mobile.how can i get the mobile to work

21211508
width	height
basically inner div height and width are bigger because of borders.

21211515
width	height
it s because borders add to the elements height and width

21211515
box-sizing	border-box
box-sizing border-box

21211526
for-loop	loops
loops variable update condition the last part of the for-loop - the part never runs on the first iteration but does run on every other one at the start

21211534
for-loop	loops
we setup a for-loop setting and we will loops while k is less than 10 and after each iteration 2 will be added to k

21211535
box-sizing	border-box
box-sizing border-box

21211535
box-sizing	border-box
if widths are percentages but you need a fixed size border box-sizing border-box

21211536
for-loop	loops
you can also depict a for-loop as a while loops

21211550
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i ve tested this out on google-chrome firefox and opera they all do the same thing

21211579
spaces	delimiter
if you want the spaces to be the delimiter just replace getline cin count

21211616
matlab	simulink
i made the following model which is not finished yet however i m new to matlab and simulink and there are a few things i don t understand

21211660
implements	extends
when you implements extends a class the parent class in this case datetime will pass its methods to the child class owndate unless you override them

21211675
apache	nginx
thing is though i use nginx not apache

21211675
apache	nginx
however i d like to know if this is correct or if there is another better way of converting this apache rules to nginx

21211676
unsigned	short
for byte and word sized parameters the most plausible options are char unsigned char and short unsigned short

21211676
int	double
for double word sized parameters type may be int unsigned int long unsigned long but it may be a pointer as well

21211694
post	put
i cant put in my php or html code here because then it wont let me post my message here

21211701
children	parent
the invariant here however is that the parent s index must always be lesser than its children

21211710
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
if you have code in your viewwillappear animated method or your viewdidappear animated method that resets the state of your view controller then that is the problem

21211715
put	get
think of it as a sausage maker - you put a pig in one end and get a sausage out the other end

21211778
mouse	keyboard
it creates event listeners on the keyboard mouse so that the player can interact with the map i.e

21211808
hide	show
now that it is done i need to disable the animation that it doesn t slide just hide the current and show the next one

21211822
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
while this works perfectly in google-chrome and opera when i follow the link in firefox or midori and then go back by clicking the back -button in the navigationbar the link still appears like being hovered over

21211835
postgresql	mysql
i have an application that supports multiple databases mysql oracle sql server postgresql

21211930
single-quotes	double-quotes
approaches that will not work are using ast.literal_eval it doesn t understand null or just using regexes to replace all single-quotes with double-quotes strings won t be escaped properly

21211978
children	parent
parent children

21211992

the idea you have there will never work as sudo 1 does not read passwd from standard input unless it s a terminal

if you really want to make this happen i recommend against it you should do edit etc sudoers in your target machine to let you run sudo 1 without it asking a passwd for things you need to be done without a passwd

21213131
sudo	passwd
for that you should not let yourself run any chmod command lines without a passwd but instead create a script in target machine for example â usr local bin do-my-promiscuous-chmod then tell sudo to let you run just that script without asking a passwd

21213131
sudoers	passwd

arun s answer works but in my opinion the mouseover event should be used instead of mouseenter because with mouseover while the user moves the cursor inside #footer the event will trigger again whilst with mouseenter if the user scrolls down the page with the middle button without moving the cursor no event will be fired on mouse movement until you leave the element and hover on it again to trigger the mouseenter

21217389
free	malloc
are not as fine-grained as malloc and free they work by 4k blocks for example

21217389
free	malloc
as a result most implementations of malloc and free are not simple one-line wrappers around os primitives but instead will keep a pool of allocated pages and handle most requests internally

21223546
getter	setter
have a look at the getter and setter design pattern

21223546
getter	setter
generally a typical class using getter and setter would look a little like this

21223546
getter	setter
when implemented in context you gave you can expect your code to look similar to this with your getter and setter in the mainactivity class looking like the above example

21223565

21223967
width	height
your situation seems slightly different but given that you are disabling scrolling and wanting the current div to occupy 100 width height of the screen it sounds like you only want 1 div to be displayed at a time so the code that i used should work for you

21225242
hide	show
i want to show the buttons on hover and hide them when moused out i tried the following code but doesnt work

21225247

to create a new installer setup.exe that will upgrade a current installation if it exists there are a few things to do

21225419
installation	upgrade
the key in the way it knows to upgrade a current installation is the upgrade code

21225419

width layout standard action like show_faces true share true height 80

21226024
free	malloc
this will probably give you more errors than it will solve in this case but if you are heartset on returning a pointer to a matrix you could malloc the memory for the array and then return it but you would have to free it afterwards

21226024
width	height
note that in this method you cannot use syntax because the compiler doesn t know the width and height

21226035
draggable	droppable
it uses jquery and jquery ui and heavily depends on draggable and droppable

21226048
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it out in google-chrome and firefox are there any other browsers that might not parse the css if i do this that i am not aware of

21226053
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox etc that script is a .dart.js file

21226073
lodash	underscore.js
none of them should be surprising if you re at all used to functional programming although if you re used to tools like underscore.js or lodash the parameter orders might seem backwards

21226082
width	height
however when the screen s width is reduced eventually the image loses it s ratio because the width is squished while the height still remains 100

21226082
width	height
in other words it the width is the limiting factor the image should use 100 width and maintain ratio but if the height is the limiting factor than the image should use 100 height while maintaining its ratio and it should be able to switch between these

21226090

hide	show
ideally as data is added removed on the client the pagination mechanism would show hide accordingly again only displaying if there are more items than the pagesize

21226613
post	get
it s not really forcing a user since embedding a image that http get request or post request via form submission or javascript is not that difficult

21226678
mouseleave	mouseenter
as t.niese said using mouseenter and mouseleave might be an option for you or anybody with similar requirements i modified the jsfiddle code so it might give a hint to who ever is reading be aware that is buggy but you get the point

21226749
ant	maven
i have a simple web project not integrated with ant or maven or anything i wish to run sonar on my project

21226784
pull	push
the actual reason it fails to work is because there are no 12 column push or pull classes defined in foundation for small medium large or any media size range. thus when the media screen size is small in your case the push and pull classes are silently ignored by css and you end up with two columns on two rows in the original order

21226784
pull	push
the general rule is that you canâ t push or pull columns from one row to another

21226784
pull	push
when you add push and pull classes the css right and left attributes are added to those described above

21226784
pull	push
the offset determined by the specified push or pull class is used to calculate the relative shift which is used to reorder columns if necessary

21226784
pull	push
if you play around a bit with the lower numbered push and pull classes 1 through 11 you can see more clearly how the columns are pushed part way off a row

21226829

21227871
width	height
i ve wasted several hours debugging it i ve learned some parts of the vnc protocol for that matter since i ve found out that it somehow reads the width and the height of the remote device from the wrong location in the netowrk stream

21227871
width	height
readsecurityfailurereason which reads some extra bytes that are needed for the code to work but on release ctrl+f5 since in visual studio release while the code is being debugged it will probably work ok those extra bytes will not be read so the width and height will be read from the wrong location on the stream causing it to be 0px over 0px

21227955

21228375
post	get
the general convention is to use getparams regardless of whether the data was sent via get or post because technically your code shouldn t be concerned about that

21228388
post	get
also from my own experience i know that some web servers like apache allow to configure the maximum get post request size but this depends on which web server you are using in the backend

21228388
post	get
suggestion use post instead of get if you need to have bigger request size than 2000 characters

21228388
post	get
verify whether your web-server sets limits to get post request sizes or not

21228405

post	get
neither answers really helped me get to the bottom of the problem but the op-answer of the second so post said after further investigation i found out that request processing thread sometimes steals dbcontext from other thread but i m not sure how this really applies

21229036
getter	setter
instead initialize the array in the object s init method and provide a custom setter getter

21229103
multiplying	modulo
instead of dividing and multiplying you could simply utilise modulo

21229236
maven	pom.xml
or maven pom.xml

21229252
for-loop	loops
also since the items are sorted prefer using a while loops instead of a for-loop

21229333
accessor	properties
while consumers can read the properties using the properties accessor methods getproperty they cannot modify the properties using any of the mutator methods setproperty

21229336
hash	md5
i am confused that adding an element in veca seems to change the md5 code of vecb and so their hash are still the same

21229369
fgets	strtok
you could read the lines with fgets then split them with strtok and finally scan the separate fields with sscanf

21229391
hash	md5
you re building the md5 hash for veca in both cases

21229457

21229707
for-loop	arrays
you can iterate over arrays lists with a for-loop like

21229716
gridview	rowdatabound
so in the rowdatabound event of the gridview you can write a code similar to this according to your syntax

21229732
gson	jackson
for small web services this is not a problem but if you have to marshal many and or big objects you could think about using jaxb + jackson or gson

21229742
ubuntu	linux
i have verified this trivial strategy works on linux 3.8.0-35-generic kernels on x86_64 in ubuntu as well as 2.6.9-104.elsmp on x86_64

21229797
ssl	https
also if you want to expose your proxy service using ssl you need to enable the https in the proxy service

21229810
sorting	filtering
second they then use copy_if to do a filtering copy of the data--but copy_if does nothing to take advantage of the sorting

21229810
sorting	filtering
alternatively they do the filtering first but do so by copying all the relevant data to a newly created vector then sorting that copy of the data

21229810
sorting	filtering
short of an exceptionally horrible implementation of std partition filtering then sorting should always be at least as fast as sorting then filtering -- and if a significant amount of the original input gets filtering out filtering first is likely to be significantly faster

21229810
sorting	filtering
it can clearly save quite a bit of memory compared to creating a filtering copy then sorting the copy

21229855
for-loop	loops
if you have some troubles remembering it think a for-loop as just a while loops

21229871

width	height
so it is ok to colorize the area with a lines of height or width or 1

21230037

width	height
1 vmin is equivalent to 1 100 the size of whichever is smallest out of height or width whereas 1 vmax is equal to 1 100 the size of the larger value

21230682
width	height
if a user s screen had a resolution of 1000x800px 100vmin would be equal to 800px and 100vmax would be equal to 1000px as the height here is the smaller unit and the width is the larger unit

21230682
width	height
100vmin here will set the width to full size of the screen s height or width whichever is smallest and this may not be the desired effect

this is provided by qcoreapplication or qapplication if you re using widgets

21233218
gridview	rowdatabound
the main logic is in the rowcreated and rowdatabound events of the gridview

21233218
gridview	rowdatabound
when the gridviewhelper is created a reference to the target gridview is saved and the rowdatabound event is bound to the method that does the hard work

21233218

this is required because when enableviewstate is true if the page is in a postback the gridview will be rebuilt from the viewstate and won t trigger the rowdatabound event

google-chrome	firefox
example fiddle borders included only for debug purpose tested on firefox and google-chrome

21233628
put	get	post	get	post	put
usually to post delete get or put .json query packets the following method is used

21233658
width	height
this is high-productive in reading width and height in every jdk

21233685
post	get
since its xml you can use an ajax post get and parse your xml data from the receiving end and you will want to have an object that holds your xml data in case you want to save

thanks to martinr for encouraging me to pull my finger out on this answer and to correctly identify that you cannot just close stdout stderr as the next open will re-use those file descriptors but to redirect stdout stderr to the infamous dev null

21233896

21233983
ssl	https
if you have enabled ssl all actions annotated with nophttpsrequirement will redirect to https

21233990
xfce	kde	xfce	gnome	kde	gnome
the first pass is to exclude the x11 gnome kde lxde mate xfce and games categories using the same categories view technique as above

21233990
kde	gnome
then using the search box as we did for the cross-compiler exclusion above remove packages matching gtk gnome qt and kde optionally excluding those in the devel debug or libs packages if you need those

21233990
geany	gedit
finally you ll have to switch to the pending view and manually exclude a bunch of packages that weren t caught by either of those two broad exclusions abiword calligra celestia dia evince geany gedit geomview gimp glabels gnucash gnumeric kalzium kmymoney kolourpaint konqueror krita kstars lyx marble pidgin qupzilla scribus skrooge spectacle stellarium tellico and vinagre

google-chrome	firefox
it is unlikely to be google-chrome though if firefox and other browsers do not have the same behaviour then something interesting is going on.

21234062

but the call sequence of activity callback is very strange it will call onstart onresume onpause onstop then recall onstart onpause suddenly

21234220
jtable	jlabel
i use this icon for a jlabel in a jtable s custom renderer

21234243
for-loop	loops
subseting with a variable is working perfectly without the for-loop but when loops is included it does not work as expected

21234243
for-loop	loops
if i then try to loops through the list with a for-loop updated code - solved

21234285
width	height
this doesn t change anything and if i try using the code from the answers of the linked post the imageview becomes invisible 0 width height because the heightmeasurespec is 0 and measurespec.getsize heightmeasurespec is also 0

21234294
google-chrome	firefox
this new dom api is available in firefox and webkit nightly builds as well as google-chrome 18

21234309

21234337
rss	feed
their rss feed does not mention the actual status of the given service

21234359
maven	pom.xml
one way to achieve this is by setting the forkcount property of maven surefire plugin to 1 if you are running the junit tests through maven surfire plugin or not specifying it at all in the plugin declaraton in your pom.xml file as the default value is 1

21234371
libs	buildpath
import startapp .jar and go to project preporty java buildpath libs insertlibrary and then sellect order and export then sellect jar move up then fininsh

21234493

21234501
hash	md5
anyway you could generate a key using hash function like md5 or sha256

21234516
width	height
also you should use the buttons x y width and height attributes

21234531
valgrind	memcheck
what valgrind memcheck the default tool basically does for monitoring memory leaks is - monitor each memory allocation and whether the allocated memory is freed later

21234571

you would first need to post in the person with all the details to the persons endpoint and get back the id

21234830
children	parent
a node has the property childnode containing all its children and the property parentnode pointing to the parent

21234830
children	parent
the json format does not support references so it will need to follow the properties until an end is reached but because a child points to its parent which has a list of its children this is an endless loop thatâ s the reason why you get the error

21234834
hash	salt
use one-way hashing whenever possible rather than using reversible encryption and when you hash properly salt your hash

21234850
cifs	smb
does anyone know library to browse and upload download stream on smb shares smb cifs protocol from ios

21234859
width	height

21234890
post	get
it s the first time for me to try to get a rest call to work thru post from firefox

21234904
folder	directory
you should only need this if your html is in the same folder as the javascript file as your html file only knows the files in the same directory

21234911
post	get
client should not click on login only credentials re post through curl and client get

21234962

21235097
hide	show
i d like what ever currently show divs to smoothly continue their hide behavior when i stop hovering or hover 1 of the other 2 divs

21235114
listview	gridview
basically the problem lies in the fact that the gridview listview child automatically requests parent focus scrollview when you hack and resize its content with expandableheightgridview which happens after layout is rendered and hence you see that animation when trying to scroll it up with scrollto happens after layout is created and after gridview is resized so any generic callback is useless to handle this programatically

21235114
listview	gridview
so then the simplest solution i found was to simply disable focusable property on the listview gridview with

21235114
listview	gridview
that way when you first enter the activity focus will default and not rely on listview gridview

21235128
rss	feed
however you can parse the rss feed easily with something like google feed api

21235199
google-chrome	firefox
current versions of google-chrome firefox and ie do not support utf-7 at all they render an utf-7 encoded html document by displaying its source code as such since they do not recognize any tags

21235298
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox

21235491
folder	directory
but if you add files from different directory that have the same name the nested folder will be added to your archive

21235500
width	height
this is achieved by having one outer div with overflow hidden and another with overflow auto and appropriate width height

21235501
put	get	post	get	post	put
as rest uses universal post get put request how do you extended backbone model with other api calls ie

21235540

21235664
post	get
all three need to be edited post hoc to get the final table you want but they are all pretty close

21235670
width	height
height or width when set to 0dp are mostly used in combination with weight

21235670
width	height
you want to fill all the available space for height then use the above code and like wise the same case for width

21235678
filesystems	ntfs
note that ntfs has its roots in posix and posix allows multiple filesystems entries that differ by case because the filesystems is case sensitive regarding object names

21235698
client-side	server-side
the same for checking values as email addresses where a client-side validation is usually welcomed but the server-side one is mandatory

21235721
outputstream	inputstream
you must use the unformatted read and write methods in inputstream and outputstream respectively

21235752
draggable	droppable
note the draggable can only be dropped into specific droppable areas where they get accepted otherwise they will revert

21235755
width	height
create constraints that fully define the width and height of the scroll view content

21235799
google-chrome	safari
as far as the google-chrome safari issue your event delegation was only being applied to that first existing element

21235816
for-loop	if-statement
i also tried putting the if-statement inside the for-loop but this did not work either as then it runs for all entries

21235821
min	max
you can then do operations like sum min max etc

use firebug with firefox or use the developer tools in google-chrome or safari or ie to examine the theme source code

21235980
int	chars
this is because chars - 0 gives the int value of the chars

21235980
int	chars
using the fact stated above the int value of a chars between 0 to 9 can be calculated by the above expression

21235997
margin	font-size
the problem is that all inline child elements get a huge margin above them even if their font-size is much smaller

however if both googletest and gmock were also built as shared libraries this won t work as they need to be also loaded

21237341

copy both libraries googletest and gmock to the module s build directory

21237341

build both googletest and gmock as static libraries instead

width	margin
i have tried to use gettextextent on each cell to obtain the expected width of the text adding some margin from 2 to 10 pixels and the expand the width of the column if it is lower than the calculated text width

21238503
width	margin
special treatment is applied to the first column items.caption to take into account the display of the icon i add the width of the icon plus margin to the width of the cell s text

21238503
width	margin
the only thing that seems to work is to add an arbitrary large margin 20 pixels to each column width but of course that produces columns that are larger than they should be

21238503
width	margin
in all cases i add a margin to the resulting width i tried values as high as 20 pixels

21238503
width	margin
i also take into account the possibility that the view use icons in which case i add the width of the icon plus the margin again to the first column

21238522
width	height
the key being that you have negative margins of half the width and half the height to properly position th element fixed size only

i still don t know how to do it with javascript for some strange reason it never works but i just inputted the textarea inside the html code with a and used jquery to hide it at the load of the document and show it when clicking a button

21238839

that way the bind is made only once an not to the elements supposed to respond to but their parent so you can dynamically delete or add as many children as you wish and they will magically respond to the event

domxpath	domdocument
i ve tried using various domdocument and domxpath commands mostly from different answers here on so but so far have been unable to achieve what i need

21239046
children	parent
assuming your definition of immutable is fields cannot be changed beyond the constructor what you are asking for is impossible because in order for the parameter to exist it must consist of already-constructed children with null parent

21239046
children	parent
a lazily evaluated sequence of children is also impossible because defining it would require a reference to the parent that doesn t exist yet

21239046
children	parent
the only way around this is to make the parent constructor responsible for constructing the children

21239046
children	parent
the opposite children constructing parent is impossible because the parent would already be constructed by the first child after which its children collection could not be modified -- and if this were a many-to-many relationship there would simply be no solution

21239046
children	parent
however if you change your definition to only parent and children can change each other s fields you can simply make these generalized protected fields in a common base class or confine the classes to an assembly and make them internal fields

21239158
hash	md5
i ended up calculating a md5 hash from the different meaningful properties of my object and using it as id so backbone relational would know it shouldn t consider the object as a new one

21239159
button	checkbox
because i have a listview with checkbox button and textview so i am telling the viewbinder to check if the checkbox value is filled in the fav column in the databse then it should check the checkbox and set it a tag so that i can call it later and work on it and if it s empty it will keep the checkbox unchecked

folder	directory
for future reference this directory contains the following folder and files

21239211
width	height
i also don t use the width and height attributes when drawing the charts

21239219

the problem i just realized i m having is that if the fields are grouped with a wrapper that is using an ng-if to show hide their contents the results are not consistent

21239247

i got this show hide div working well

21239247

i looked into redis but it didn t look like i could do the type of sorting filtering needed on a set of objects sorting an associative array on a specific key that could be a number string etc

21239301
folder	directory
i am writing an app in vb.net visual studio 2013 and as a final step it has two copy a folder with several files inside into a certain directory in an iphone

21239318
portrait	landscape
still when i run the application and i change to orientation from the default portrait to landscape mode the layout refuses to change to the identically named layout in the layout-land folder which has a different color background to make sure

21239334
width	height
something like a graphical block-copy operation in addition to needing source- and destination drawing contexts and a copy mode also needs to have the source x y width and height and destination x y width and height

21239334
width	height
grouping together the two groups of x y width height into type rectangle reduces the parameter count to a much more reasonable five

21239334
width	height
if however one wishes to have a type which can hold its bounds as an aggregation of variables which are independent from anything else in the universe but which can be conveniently worked with independently but also passed as a group then a struct which simply exposes fields x y width and height would be ideal

since you are calculating median of some values i would suggest you return a numeric value instead of integer as max score + min score 2 can return a decimal number value

children	parent
i am currenlty developing a webapp in which i would like children windows of a parent to be able to communicate with each other

21240371

one method that just came to mind would be that when the parent closes to change the parent of the children to one of the other children ie parent re-assigns parent to be a child window

21240400

it s most likely going to be some caanimation subclass like cabasicanimation cakeyframeanimation or catransition but is built to work with anything that conforms to that protocol

21240415

put	get
the slash should be backwards like this c test ftp_test get without the middle space i put it that way because the html parser in this page change it to only one slash

21240549
getter	setter
i m thinking the best way to do this would be to have a state property with a getter and a setter but i can t quite seem to get the syntax right

21240577
width	height
the height and width ensure that the content will be read by screen readers

21240587
client-side	server-side
the best practice is validation form data on server-side and client-side

21240602
move	drag
since your bordered rect is a group you can move drag the group

21240713
portrait	landscape
that particular user-control is a pane in a window and the window can be either in portrait or landscape orientation and i didn t want to have two user-controls for each layout -- that seemed dumb.

there is one folder for each language so spanish is in a folder called es and inside of the folder is one index.html this file points asset files from parent directory

21248926
width	height
having tried the afterload solution suggested by carl without changing the doctype because as jfk stated that is not an option at least in my case things have remained more or less the same the fancybox now opens at the specified width and height in firefox even keeping the style of the video element but that style gets ignored by all browsers and the video does not scale in a way that it fills the fancybox entirely when the browser gets resized

21248926
width	height
carl solution keeping the original doctype doesn t seem to work with html5 videos because no matter which width and height you indicated the video always shows inside the fancybox at the width height of its poster image ruling the fancybox aspect ration when you resize the browser

21248926
width	height
what i have done was to use ffmpeg to get frame width and height of the video injecting them into the data-width and data-height of the fancybox anchor and adding aspectratio true to the fancybox javascript

21248960

binary addition is identical for unsigned and twos complement there is no such thing as signed math in an adder nor is there such a thing as subtraction but the flags are taken off of the overflows in different ways

21272562
subtraction	add
a subtraction simply means invert the second operand and invert the carry in of the lsbit invert and add 1 that is why we have and care about twos complement it makes the hardware so much easier

21272562
subtract	add
sometimes the carry out is inverted if the operation was a subtract sometimes not so the inversion or not of the carry in on the lsbit for add with carry vs subtract with borrow if your instruction set has one is directly affected by this

21272562
subtraction	addition
but it all boils down to twos complement vs unsigned and for addition and subtraction they are computed differently

21272562
division	multiplication
for multiplication and division this is not the case a signed multiplier and unsigned multiplier are different use the wrong one you can get the wrong answer likewise if those have overflow flags then you need to compare them to the operation

21272628

folder	directory
mapping to a path outside of your webroot will likely cause permissions issues for a number of reasons i wont get into here...though i see that you have set up the media folder as a virtual directory

21276815
folder	directory
i would look at using a relative path for imagebasedir - or better yet not using this attribute at all but rather just having your media folder being in a constant location as your virtual directory

21276832

when i put this check divs always get open and visible

min	max
the function return false if the value is less than the min bound or greater than the max bound

your functions would technically produce different results should the double values exceed sizeof short int on a given platform

21278062
int	double
both of the functions have possibilities to lose data as you re truncating losing precision from a double to an int or short

21278062
int	double
meaning how you write the output of your functions to the file can also severely affect your files in both c++ and c# with regards to outputting numeric types double int short

post	get
it s a trivial task to get k and b for a given starting ending point of the line not going to post it here

21278204
min	max
but at any time i need to know current max key and min key

21278204
min	max
distribution is not uniform instead max and min are frequently removed and inserted

21278204
min	max
so i need something smarter than just scan entire map for a new max min when current max min is removed

21278263

building on lizzan s answer here is a version using the square root of both width and height to get a proportional sizing

21278297

stateless	stateful
besides the stateful operations there is also a number of stateless operations

21278489
stateless	stateful
all stateful operations are gathered in one single stateful service while all stateless services are grouped in an arbitrary set of services possibly by which area they target

21278489
stateless	stateful
both stateful and stateless operations are grouped into smaller services but stateful and stateless operations are still separated so that no service contains both stateful and stateless operations

21278489
stateless	stateful
why force a strict separation of the stateful and stateless operations at all

21278489
stateless	stateful
this gives a number of services with mixed stateful and stateless operations

21278494

the actual dimensions of the htmlcanvaselement are defined by its width and height properties which are different from the css style-declaration

21278728
width	height
setting the css attributes different to those of the canvas width and height will result in scaling the canvas by the browser as if you were zooming content

21278728
width	height
to match your expectancy what you d want is to explicitly set the width and height of the canvas to match the percentages you d expect from the css declartions measure the dimensions in pixels of the canvas parent container let s assume 320px width in this example multiply it by the percentage of choice let s say 90 which is 320 .9 288 pixels and set it onto the canvas width property do the same for the height et voila

int	double
the language definitions permit some slack in floating-point evaluation so it is theoretically possible that d+.1 is evaluated with excess precision instead of normal double precision and then converted to int or short

21284188
int	double
however this would result in different results only in very rare cases where d+.1 evaluated in double precision rounds up to an int but d+.1 evaluated in excess precision remains just below the int

21284188
int	double
this requires that about 38 bits 53 bits in the double significand minus 16 bits in the int portion plus one bit for rounding have specific values so we would expect it to occur only about 1 in 275 billion times by chance assuming a uniform distribution is a suitable model

21284188
floating-point	integer
in fact the adding of .1 suggests to me that somebody was trying to correct for floating-point errors in a result they expected to be an integer

21284188
floating-point	integer
adding .1 suggests they were trying to calculate something they expected to be an integer but were getting results like 3.999 or 4.001 due to floating-point errors so they â œcorrectedâ it by adding .1 and truncating

post	get
you can also fix this problem by putting sessionattributes user before the owning controller of your s get and post method

superclass	subclassing
i don t know off the top of my head if this would allow you to leverage a jsoncreator in superclass to avoid repeating the id and name properties in the subclassing but i figure it s worth a try

21289904
fadein	fadeout
you should use callback method of fadeout to set data and the fadein

21289924
int	chars
because eof is a special sentinel value implementation defined but usually -1 as an int type it can t be distinguished from the value 255 if stored in a chars variable

21289924
int	chars
also on a related note chars literals in c like a have the type int

21289924
int	chars
so you will see chars usually passed to and returned from c standard library functions as int types

21290095
erlang	elixir
it looks like the underlying erlang libraries would not immediately support passing a function reference as the 3rd parameter so this may not be completely trivial to fix in elixir

put	get
i was wondering if it is possible to put multiple inputs in joptionpane.showinputdialog and then get the user input and if the user has given a wrong input for one of the questions then provide them with a error asking them to re-enter that specific data again

21290312
melt	reshape
the basic idea is to use the melt ... function to reshape your original data into long format where the values in the four columns solid liquid elec and heat are all in one column value and the column variable indicates which metric value refers to

21290326
cpu	processors	cpu	affinity	affinity	processors
please bear in mind that its the os and not the jvm responsible for cpu affinity - which is why i suggested that you first figure out how many cpu s you have and then perhaps use schedutils to configure processors affinity for a certain process

21290326
affinity	processors
install schedutils to confgure processors affinity

21290326
cpu	affinity
you can assign cpu affinity via schedutils as follows 2 is second proceccor and 23564 is process id

21290376
voip	sip
voip basically uses something called sip session initiation protocol which is signalling layer of the call and a lot like http

21290376
voip	sip
setup your app to use voip and then look into something like pjsip as your sip library

21290376
voip	sip
then on your local network have a sip server i m sure there are plenty open source implementations that you can register your iphone against so your server knows where your phone is pretending to be a voip phone

21290376
voip	sip
then the server can send a message via sip to the handset as if it were instigating a voip session

21290376
voip	sip
sip was designed just for creating sessions not just voip

post	get
the relevant get and post parts of my controller

21290445
superclass	subclassing
a further challenge that i have not had to deal with luckily would be if you wanted to create a superclass for multiple existing models - in that case you may not be able to keep the same id for all instances as some instances in the two different subclassing might clash on id

21290459
width	height
you have set the width and height in the css styling and not inline as attributes

21290459
width	height
so attributes width and height are empty

21290459
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
as of jquery 1.8 this may require retrieving the css width plus box-sizing property and then subtracting any potential border and padding on each element when the element has box-sizing border-box

21290505
portrait	landscape
small and extra small devices classes can work for portrait tablet view and small and medium devices classes can works for landscape mode you need to try various combinations

i have two separate tag database tables tags id tag and tagrel tagid postid that contain the tags and i m trying to figure out a better way to show the tags for each individual post in browse.php without running a separate query each time to get the tags for each individual post

21290735
width	height
this works fine when the width and height of the string doesn t exceed the size of an a4 page

21290735
width	height
therefore i need a way of wrapping any text to the width of a a4 page and if the height exceeds the height of a a4 page then the text needs to be carried over to the next page

entities	entitymanager
this way happens i close an entitymanager and there is entities in the background which i edit copy so modify and after it i want to persist or merge it with a new entitymanager

21290807
entities	entitymanager
if i feel good the entitymanager is only a bridge path to persistent context and the entitymanager can be replaceble there is no real or strict bond between the managed entities and the entitymanager in this sense .

min	max
i have a problem i need to convert coordinates using shift and after that convert them back to original but it returns not the same value min max values can t be changed..

21290868
portrait	landscape
i m trying to get navigation between views that support landscape or portrait orientations working using a navigation controller and pushviewcontroller and ios6+ code and have a problem where after pushing a landscape view controller onto the navigation controller stack the view controller view correctly is in landscape but the device is still in portrait orientation

21290868
portrait	landscape
imagine an arrow pointing left to right on a landscape screen here it points from down to up on a portrait screen so the dimensions are correct - it s just the device should be in landscape mode so the arrow points left to right - if that makes sense

21290868
portrait	landscape
pushviewcontroller works fine when i navigate from portrait to portrait view - the new view slides in nicely - it s when i switch from a portrait to landscape view controller than things break

21290868
portrait	landscape
this doesn t work however because the view is now in landscape mode but the device is still in portrait mode so the view is at 90 degs to what it should be

21290868
portrait	landscape
at the moment i can t get the device to update along with the view so the interface is in landscape but the device is still in portrait

use the following command to see predefined macros supported by the gcc and g++ compilers

21291023

so instead you need to drop a whole bunch of breadcrumbs and then when the problem occurs you look at what the breadcrumbs tell you try to get some clues about where the problem is occurring or what it might be and then often that leads you to put in more breadcrumb info until eventually you narrow in on what is causing the problem

21291464
children	parent
stack panel is a type of container which can keep on growing as many as children you add into it and provides equal space for each of its children so the scrollviewer requires a height here to tell the parent to define the space limits

aggregate-functions	sum
edit regarding your comment you have a column in your select that is either not in the group by or not an aggregate-functions sum avg etc

21291469
floating-point	integer
a call to printf cannot be converted by the compiler to a call to the write system call - the printf library function contains a significant amount of logic which is not present in the system call such as processing the format string and converting integer and floating-point numbers to strings

21291469
x86	64bit
the exact calling conventions for system calls e.g which registers are used for the call number and arguments how errors are returned etc are different on different architectures operating systems and even between 32-bit and 64bit x86

other objects don t have to worry about how trafficlight works internally they only have to know to use the proper getter setter methods

you can create properties with custom getter setter that don t use instance variables or that use existing instance variables for example if you had a person class that had a firstname property and a lastname property you could create a new read-only property fullname that concatenated the first and last name and returned the result.

21293597
ant	maven
also if you are having dependency issues then you may want to look into a project build manager like maven or gradle or even ant

21293605
calloc	malloc
even so i would consider alternatives like using calloc instead of malloc .

21293608
hex	binary
firstly the input of your or is ffffffff in hex notation which means that in binary bitwise terms it is 11111111111111111111111111111111

21293608

however converting hex to binary is a trivial task since it is a straightforward replacement of each hex digit with four binary digits

hide	show
because of a particularity of the project i have to unbind the directive listeners right after the first event being fired either for show or hide inside the event handler

hide	show
i only fire a single show hide event

21293650
hide	show
show on the first http request hide when the count reaches 0

21293650
hide	show
when the loader hide event is handled the loader is gone and i won t show it again unless the page is refreshed but i still have background http requests to refresh data on the current page

21293650
hide	show
those requests will still be intercepted and fire new show hide events which are no longer required handled

fadein	fadeout	next	except
it seems to be working ok except that i can not get the current displayed image to fadeout prior to the fadein of the next image

21293747
fadein	fadeout
initially all the images were placed in a stack in the #holder div and then fadein and fadeout worked as i expected but i need to have the images in an array and load as required because there will be several different values associated with each image

21293747
fadein	fadeout
i probably have made some fundamental mistake or i do not understand how fadein and fadeout properly work as i am not an expert in javascript and jquery and i just get by by looking at examples on here and similar sites

rss	feed
you can then parse the rss and display the information you require there are quite a few out there zend_feed zend feed zend framework2 simplepie all depends on your needs

21294359
width	height
the browser loads the image according to the height i declare and scales the width accordingly fitting the div tight around it

21294359
width	height
in chrome the image loads its height correctly but remains the width of the original image so it is stretched

getter	setter
if you do limit access to solely through the class itself you lose any getter and setter or other free things that come along with properties

21300054
getter	setter
this means that if mygizmoclass were to have as part of it s model an you would be forced to create custom getter and setter for this property and keep it either as an ivar or property in an interface extension in the .m file private of the singleton class or as an adjacent static variable

int	double	int	chars
indeed there will likely be hundreds of files within gcc in which parts of the implementation of an int is defined each operation cast to chars uint double float etc plus times subtract divide etc on each of the dozens of architectures x86 x86-64 powerpc will need to have code generation optimisations widths and more defined

21303577
getter	setter
setter getter contructor and object state in general are implementing details for your concrete classes not for the interface

21303577

you can use an index and a while loops instead of a for-loop if you want loops to also loops over the elements that is added to the list during loops

21303992
integer	unsigned
the only integer types you can cast to are signed integer and unsigned integer

21303992
integer	unsigned
this is a pain because if for whatever reason you really need an auto incrementing bigint id which increments past 4294967295 then an unsigned integer won t be a large enough type to cast to

21304038
salt	md5
but not in the form as described in the documentation md5 + + salt

21304051
int	double
because dbobject is effectively a map of string to object you need to cast the values that come out of it hence the ugliness in the first bit of code in my answer - with numbers it will depend on how the data was loaded into the database it might come out as an int or as a double

but that was without thinking that only page #1 is the result of a post method not the subsequent paginated requests pages which are got through get method

21304936
post	get
the conclusion is remember page #2+ calls are get and the request data that you may have used and were working for post are no more valid creating a different set of conditions now reducing your recordset and creating a total count that may be 0 voiding the pagination system hence the 404

21305665
width	height
1 update cart table and add three fields width height and final_price

21305665
width	height
2 overload cart class and add properties for width height and final_price

21305665
width	height
also you will need to override the method which fetch all products from the cart and check if a cart product has custom price or width and height

21305665
width	height	post	get
you may need to modify ajax-cart.js to get width height and final price values to post to the cart controller

21305665
width	height
also you may need to modify blockcart.tpl file where you can show width and height etc in the blockcart

21305665
width	height
data is posted to cartcontroller so you will need to override it and receive width height and final price from the posted data

21305665
width	height
you will need to place appropriate checks if width height and final price are available or not to detect the custom price product

21305665
width	height
5 you will need to override ordercontroller to populate the shopping cart page products list with width height and final price

21305665
width	height
6 in all above theory we have added product to cart and populated blockcart and shopping cart page with width height and final price data

21305665
width	height
in order product table add same fields as cart_products table for width height and final_price

21305665
width	height
so here you will need add width height and final price info in the order products db insertion code

21305665
width	height
also you will need to supply these variables to the email templates so the customer can get the width height and final price of the product in the email also

21305665
width	height
10 and finally not actually final p you will need to make changes in the pdf invoice generation so that width height and final price are shown in pdf invoice also

21311193
dlsym	dlopen
if you are opening the library with dlopen then you are responsible of creating variables holding the symbol pointers yourself via dlsym but it allows you more flexibility like changing those during runtime loading plugins or other functions that are unavailable at compile time

it seems to me this involves many steps create branch locally push to github pull to the server and then checkout that branch

21311607

the haskell platform is not meant to be a rolling release and in particular base should not be upgrade because it is tied to your versioning of ghc

21311620
google-chrome	firefox
youtube embeded video not working in all my browsers firefox ie and google-chrome

21311666

you should change your for-loop to start at zero continue loops as long the index number is lower then the arrays length and add one to the index for each loops i++

21311670

nodevalue is a little more confusing to use but faster than innerhtml

21311965
implements	extends
note that it s not necessary to extends any particular class when writing your own implementations of userdetailsservice userdetails and for the purposes of debugging it s probably easier to just implements the interfaces directly

21312002
keydown	keyup
you should use keydown or keyup

21312013
width	height
you can get widget size in dp but i don t how get resized widget height and width

question summary how could i get the values from the array and put them in for example my already created add functions see below

21312090
sorting	filtering
so in case of a product page this will probably be at least a productid in case of categorypage productlistpage this will be probably categoryid pageid pagesize some sorting parameters filtering parameters if you use filtering etc

21312090
sorting	filtering
as an example i would use outputcaching for product page but i would consider using this for categorypage productlistpage especially in case of using filtering paging sorting etc

21312144
spaces	delimiter
i have not implemented the shell creating a child process to run each command part but this is just a code to break the string entered at the command prompt by the user into the appropriate arguments by using a spaces as a delimiter which will then be passed to the file corresponding to the command say ls -l as command line arguments

21312171
versioning	upgrade
issue resolved seems like problem was with angularjs versioning 1.2.2 now upgrade to angularjs 1.2.9 working fine

21312178
system.in	system.out
i would wrap system.in and system.out in an object which you can then inject

21312218

javascript loop-problem with settimeout setinterval

21312240
post	get
i ve read a number of post about shifting bytes but was a bit confused and i am looking to get going in the right direction

ssl	https
there s precious little information out there for ssl if you re not doing https and of course even less if you re doing c++ on the 400

21312567
jar	war
you can use compile scope inside jar modules and providedcompile inside war module

21312567
jar	war
war s providedcompile scope will override jar s compile scope

21312578
post	get
you will have to use get or post in your ajax request otherwise it won t work

21312601
unix	bsd
once upon a time there were two main and somewhat competing versions of unix - system v and bsd

21312601
sysv	systemd
but realistically sysv stuff is so embedded in so many systemd you have to have serious doubts that it will ever go away

21312601
sysv	systemd
from the outside the posix versions have an advantage in that they utilize the file systemd and can be maintained with standard command line functions like rm rather than relying on separate utility programs ipcs that sysv requires

21312612
coalesce	isnull
alternatively you can isnull or coalesce nulls to the same and group by same

21312632
umbraco	examine
in umbraco i use examine to search in the website but the content is in french

21312674

qquickview	qqmlcomponent
it will generate qtquick2controlsapplicationviewer class which do not use qquickview but simply qqmlcomponent

21312797
min	max
as you ve already mentioned you could use percentage widths to build a fluid layout and then restrict fix specific div sizes with max and min values

21312797
width	height	min	max
here is a working example with the banner boxes restricted to max 300px width and min 400px height i added some padding and borders so you can see what is going on jsfiddle

21312797
min	max
in the end you d still have to adjust your responsive media queries to deal with your fixed elements but this way you d only have to change a few min and max values

21312820
isnull	nullif
another alternative which is pretty much exactly the same as stuartlc s answer is to use nullif instead of isnull

21312870
getter	setter
i thought there was a solution not to write all the getter and setter for each variable something like

21312911
getter	setter
you can declare your property as public then mark the getter or setter individually as private

21312928
post	get
i m trying to get the comment count on a wordpress post as a php variable

21312930
getter	setter
if you want the getter to be public but the setter private then do

21312942
width	height	ati	nvidia
the problem is something related to the video card an intel video card will present you the same width and height for different monitors basically the primary s if you use allscreens i .getdisplaymode whereas the nvidia and ati amd ones give you the actual resolution values corresponding to each monitor using the same function

21312971
google-chrome	firefox
from my recent testing the newest versions of the major browsers firefox v26 google-chrome v32 ie v11 all only download the font format file they need

21312971
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome both seem to prefer woff files but also seem to work with tff or otf files although woff fonts are smaller size so you should prefer those

21312971
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
otherwise you could do as tom van der woerdt suggested and use only eot and ttf which should work in firefox google-chrome safari ie droid and ios

21312971
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome follow this rule but ie is non-conformant

21312979
put	get
i m parsing delimited files files to get information that i will put in a database table

21312979
put	get

21312998
accessor	properties
thus marking the properties private makes both the accessor and the mutator also private which is why you cannot access them outside of the class

21313031
width	height
my layout needs to be dynamic so setting a static width or height for the text is out of the question

21313057

it is likely that wav is using a more compressive codec such as mp3 or ogg internally

21313088
mp3	ogg
i don t know of a service provider interface for the ogg format but if they are encoded as mp3 you might be able to get it working using the mp3 spi

21313098
textmate	sublimetext
if you re using an editor like sublimetext or textmate 1 there s a good chance you may use

21313098

21313617
superclass	subclassing
but if any subclassing constructor calls a superclass constructor which throws an exception then the subclassing constructor must either catch the exception or throw it

uicollectionview is like uitableview only loads cells displayed on screen

21313629
inherited	properties

if you want to define properties that will be inherited by all instances you need to define them on the prototype of the constructor

21313630
width	height
this is calculated as 9 16 0.5625 for youtube for example meaning that the height of the container is 56.25 the size of the width

superclass	subclassing
the subclassing has to provide the superclass as an argument for the constructor

21321566
opcache	apcu	opcache	apc
especially with opcode cache zend opcache or apc or user cache apcu in place there will be possible interference between these applications and serious security issues can quickly appear due to the fact that the php parent process has access to the caches of all the other applications

21321599
versioning	upgrade

in neo4j s model properties can be a primitive boolean byte short int long float double chars or string or an array of one of these primitives

21321760
realloc	malloc
there are really only two possibilities here - either is being modified to something other than the return value of a malloc or realloc which invokes undefined behaviour when you pass it to realloc or the heap is getting corrupted somehow in which case pretty much anything can happen

listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
use a gridview or repeater or listview for multiple records

21337651
children	parent
i think it refers specifically to wrappanels as children rather than parent elements.

21337727
dojo	gridx
i moved the css files from gridx resources claro gridx.css and other locations within the dojo library to a known relative location temporarily in order to eliminate the possibility that the css files could not be resolved

21337727
dojo	gridx
based on the results of experimenting with a non-worklight project where i was able to materialize the grid with modules and also realizing that with either type of project web or worklight i was able to resolve dojo and gridx objects even though the javascript resources are configured differently i decided to try a local require statement to specify the dojo modules in the immediate context and it worked

21337727
dojo	gridx
so in summary i had to explicitly require the gridx classes in the custom function rather than in the dojo require statement in the main.js

21337741
clang	llvm
clang and llvm have a very active community and it s possible someone will pick the bug up quickly

21337755

in some compilers for 8-bit microcontrollers there is an option to disable c standard conformation to speed up maths since always promoting a chars to int to do the maths may cause unnecessary operations and slow down the process

some of these heap objects represent data int boolean chars list nodes etc. and some of them represent haskell code that hasn t executed yet due to laziness

21338089
width	text-align
first your #title has not width set so it has the width of the text it contains if you use text-align center

21338089
width	text-align
so you need to set width 100 on #title to and then text-align center

21338102
maven	pom.xml
additionally per the first potential solution i tried to add the following to my maven pom.xml

21338125

public	protected
public is higher than protected so there s no problem

21338131
bash	subshell
i originally claimed that not all bash subshell run in their own child process but that turns out not to be true

21338131
bash	subshell
as kojiro states in his answer some shells - other than bash - do sometimes avoid creation of child processes for subshell so generally speaking in the world of shells one should not assume that a subshell implies a child process

21338131
bash	subshell
it looks like using command substitution always adds an extra subshell in bash - as does enclosing any command in ...

21338131
bash	subshell
below is what i still believe to be correct from my original post when bash creates subshell

21338131
bash	subshell
bash creates subshell in the following situations

21338131
bash	subshell
bash 4.2+ has shell option lastpipe off by default which causes the last pipeline segment not to run in a subshell

21338144
width	text-align
text-align center doesn t work for you as you d expect as you haven t set the width of the title div

21338144
width	text-align
so to change that add width 100 and then add text-align center

ssl	https

use the fat jar with application jars place the additional jars on the filesystems and somehow include those as additional jars that need to be added to classpath

21340843
superclass	subclassing
superclass can t know anything about their own subclassing except for the constraints that being a subclassing of the superclass imposes on the subclassing

21340843
superclass	subclassing
what a superclass can do however is enforce what methods its subclassing have

21340843
superclass	subclassing
if a method exists in a superclass then it must exist in the subclassing because you can t remove methods in subclassing

21340843
superclass	subclassing
if you re using a concrete superclass as your base class then you simply have to implement a method that does nothing in the superclass and all the subclassing will have it

21340843
superclass	subclassing
you can call the method from the superclass and be certain that the subclassing has an implementation of it

21340843
public	protected
it has to be protected or public

21340843
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
any subclassing that inherited from the superclass will now be forced to implement an init method

21340843
superclass	subclassing
as in the earlier example this ensures that all subclassing of this one have an init method and it s therefore safe to call init from the superclass

21340843
superclass	subclassing
note due to the peculiarities of how php s zend engine is implemented it s theoretically possible to call subclassing methods from superclass when the superclass doesn t know about the subclassing method

21340843
superclass	subclassing
even if php remains that way forever it s still a very bad practice to be calling subclassing methods from the superclass without knowing for certain that the subclassing implements that method

21340861
keydown	keyup
i think you need to set a flag for turning or accelerating on keydown and clear it on keyup

21340873

21340905
hide	show
in the example instead of show and hide i ve done red and blue so that it s clearer what s happening

21340905
hide	show
now what i expected to happen was that clicking on either button would cause the show and hide red and blue to reverse

21340913
hide	show
the idea was to overwrite the functions that handle showing and hiding errors to use slidedown and slideout instead of show and hide

21340913
fadein	fadeout
this could be applied to fadein and fadeout as well

21340924

what you re providing it via that inputstream is a pfx file a pkcs#12 file not a der or pem encoded certificate

21348144
pkcs#12	pfx
my advice is to use openssl pkcs#12 to extract the necessary certificate from the pkcs#12 file and place it into a separate file then change the code to load that instead of your pfx file

what happens is with that type erasure the setdata method in the subclassing is no longer an override-equivalent for superclass setdata method

21349132
implements	extends
bridge method is often generated by the compiler when a type extends or implements a parameterized class or interface and type erasure changes the signature of any inherited method

21349132

it gets rid of the inner loop which you didn t need in the first place and doesn t create an istringstream in each iteration

21349594
memcpy	memmove
even if the worst thing happens in the future and your string is copied it isn t copied now that copy can be turned into a memmove memcpy which is blazing fast most likely faster than reading the contents of the file from the hard disk so file io will most likely remain the bottleneck

21351793
abstract-class	superclass
i d like to rely on the abstract superclass in my application layer because it does not differentiate between proxied-a and non-proxied-a but then hibernate won t let me - entity instances cannot have a relation to the abstract-class because it is not known to the persistence context

multiplying	add
you might not need multiplying since it can be done with jump and add instructions

21352903
multiplying	add
but when you re compiling for a chip which has a hardware multiplying you d have to analyze the il to determine this was an add loop and covert it back into a multiplying

21352903

to add to chistians good advice it is not neccessary to use getter and setter in simple cases like the self.name

let s say we have a plainoldjavaobject with a field value that we want for some reason to test the validity of setter and getter for

21355383
getter	setter
ultimately if you have a lot of setter and getter you ll have to do code like this since if you rely on the assumption that your setter and getter just work like you are in your tests above your test cases may be invalid

21355401
getter	setter
managed properties cannot be injected the expected equivalent is to provide a named bean with getter and setter properly defined and leverage that from the ui

if you pan drag to move the graph the scale won t change at all

21356139
width	height
the element itself doesn t have any height or width and so can t respond to user events directly it only receives events from its children

21356139
width	height
you don t often see scales in the force-layout examples because the force layout object allows you to set a width and height directly and then creates d.x and d.y data values within that range

21356139
width	height
set the layout width and height to your visualization width and height and you can use the data values directly for positioning objects in the display

21356139
range	minimum
the initial domain of the scale will therefore by the expected maximum and minimum values from the layout while the initial range will be the maximum and minimum coordinates on the visualization

21356139

uinavigationcontroller will alter the height of its uinavigationbar to either 44 points or 64 points depending on a rather strange and undocumented set of constraints

21356279
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
your problem therefore is that the uinavigationcontroller is detecting that its view s frame is contiguous with the uiwindow s top at the beginning of the animation

21356279
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar	uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
because this frame would be visually contiguous with the uiwindow s top the uinavigationcontroller draws its uinavigationbar with a height of 64 points

but if you still insist on using post instead of get you should know that you can use post method instead of get and it does the same but you would face with some unforeseen problems

21356677
post	put
begingetrequeststream is only for post and put methods

21356678

min	max
this is max for min just flip the comparison sign i ll leave that to you

21357594
put	get
so maybe what is happening is that the scratchpad doesnt fit on your local memory but when you put lookup-gap 2 you get half of the size so it fits more on the local memory than before so the gpu can make these operations local

21357617
int	double
i would suggest keeping the temperatures as a double throughout rather than converting them to int

21357640
folder	directory
created a directory named admin in my templates folder

21357694
subtract	add
all you need to do is add or subtract a constant binary string from each line

21357721
for-loop	loops
i ve moved my for-loop around and it either puts my display text into a neverending loops or the program stalls after asking for number of scores to be entered this is where it is now

21357727
width	height
use it in a way that you use constraints with a width of 250 in your case and some very high amount in height let s say 10000

21357727
width	height
then it returns the actual width which may be slightly smaller than 250 and the height needed

21357747
width	height
now the problem is that i want it to change the height of the iframe every time the width of the browser changes

21357769
haxepunk	openfl
i m using openfl version 1.2.1 and haxepunk 2.4.5 with a new project created with haxelib run haxepunk new test

21357769
haxepunk	openfl
try to see if the problem is related to the versions of openfl haxepunk it may be a bug that s already been fixed

21357803
viewdidload	viewdidappear
it works perfect and i ve been able to call it from viewdidload which was quicker than calling the deprecated thumbnailimageattime from the viewdidappear

21357867
onresume	onpause
just as you should in onpause and onresume i think

21357879
google-chrome	firefox
this is a bug that exists in css and in google-chrome and firefox s implementation of css

21357879
children	parent
when you have a parent element that has backface-visibility or is transformed its children can not be fixed

21357925
pop-up	dialog
i m trying to get input from a dialog that pop-up after selection of a pop-up menu item

21357959
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
these new classes supplant the notoriously troublesome classes of java.util.date java.util.calendar and java.text.simpledateformat

21357971
vlookup	sumifs
i m looking for a clean er way than using sumifs with a third row to calculate the sum of the results from say a vlookup that checks both the first and the second row for matching criterion

21357974
hide	show
and then i tried to manipulate it by adding the icon on the top left that allows you to show hide the list

21357974
hide	show
the problem is that when i launched the application the list was already show and when i tried to hide it by clicking on the icon the application crashed

21357993
folder	directory
probably your permissions aren t set correctly for the phpmyadmin356 directory and or files within that folder

21358002
put	get
note node has no application-wide global namespace that things get put into by default

21358031
implements	extends
the extends function is implements in many javascript libraries backbone underscore and jquery for a few

21358031
inherited	properties
if you want inherited you use the object or its constructor s prototype properties

21358105
tiff	png
export any part of the drawing or whole as a pdf jpeg png or tiff image

21358115
min	max
for instance for your record model class you can compute the min and max value for price attribute using the following syntax

21358132
implements	extends
my current idea is to implements a class that extends persistentdatetime and override the nullsafeget method so it maintains the timezone of the datetime that is passed to it

21358154
width	height
the last view has very little space in height and since adjustviewbounds is set its width is reduced by the same ratio as its height

21358155
matplotlib	scipy
i m trying to plot 3 derivatives using numpy scipy and matplotlib

21358202
lisp	scheme
for example you can implement your own oop class implementation or you can program in a functional style like you would do in scheme or lisp

21358212
graphics2d	bufferedimage
first i m thinking that could use a blank image bufferedimage specifically and it s graphics2d context to draw the fractal offscreen and then pass it to the ui which draws it to the screen

21358221
min	max
i am trying to write a small bit of code that outputs min of three numbers max of three numbers and surface areas of a cylinder when given r and h

21358230
ubuntu	debian
pulling off this webpage if you are using ubuntu debian just do

21358258
rdf	owl
owl is a more advanced language than rdf

21358262
mouseover	mouseout
you can then call your mouseover mouseout functions like this

21358276
width	height
if you make the corner radius figure proportional to the width or height etc then this will give you a constant roundness for the image

21358285
jlist	jtable
in this example a single tablemodel has several listeners including the jtable itself and an adjacent jlist

21358312
super	extends
i thought this was the correct way to inherit and extends a super class

21358327
range	minimum
for each row representing a product i need to know the minimum range of prices in which the product price is contained by product category

21358358
google-chrome	firefox
when i navigate to the folder via a browser firefox and google-chrome it s not there

21358407
inherited	subclassing
this is where you can benefit from inherited make a base class with the elements common to all your cell types then make the individual cell types its subclassing like this

21358408
width	text-align
i m not sure where you want the span to appear but in this example it has a width of 100 and has text-align center for horizontal centering

21358431
ubuntu	debian
i got a intel g2020 cpu that run windows 7 64 bit i want to install 64 bit ubuntu or debian in virtual box but while the system boot it prompts that the kernel require an x86-64 cpu but only detected an i686 cpu

21358443
entity-relationship	diagram
of course you want to avoid the other extreme of 10s of tables or entity-relationship diagram before coding

21358451
queue	fifo
1 use a fifo queue or priority queue depends upon your business logic

21358484
realloc	malloc
neither malloc nor realloc have anything to do with the automatic storage the stack

21358484
realloc	malloc
one should not expect the position of the top of the stack to change in response to calls to malloc realloc or for that matter any other function

21358484
realloc	malloc
malloc often gives you more memory that you ask and stores the actual value in a special location that realloc can access at a later time

21358484
memcpy	malloc
that s the reason why it may perform better than simply calling malloc and memcpy

21358487
realloc	malloc
it s not uncommon and in fact a bit expected that a malloc call followed directly by realloc would not change the address of the pointer

21358489
free	realloc
sometimes if you re increasing the size of the allocated memory realloc can check if there s free space above the existing space and still return the same pointer and avoid copying data

21358489
free	realloc
mostly it s only when there is no free space above the allocated memory that realloc must copy the data somewhere else and return a different pointer

21358494
isometric	draw
i have a script attached to the main camera in my unity scene that enables me to draw an isometric grid centered on the origin point using good old opengl lines

21358498
nsbuttoncell	nstablecolumn
i have a nstableview with an nstablecolumn with an nsbuttoncell a checkbox inside it which generates a new instance of nsbuttoncell each time a row is added which i configured in ib

21358511
google-chrome	firefox
the way this works in both firefox and google-chrome is just to use the exact same html as you used for your #test1 but on top of that also using the css before pseudo-element instead of using the #container and #wrapper

21358523
post	get
there is no effect of clicking its just http get and post requests

21358556
post	get
i can t get my django app to post to the db

21358627
cout	cin
instead use using std xxxx if you dont want to write std cout std cin etc every time

21358647
range	max
my graph size x coord max in range 35-45 numbs

21358654
uilabel	uibutton
i have never heard of anyone adding a uibutton as a subview of uilabel

21358693
jtextfield	jtextpane
from what i ve seen on the rest of this website i would need to use jtextfield and jtextpane

21358761
google-chrome	firefox
well i think that firefox has the right behavior and it s a google-chrome problem

21358768
jtextfield	jtextpane
you need jtextfield and jtextpane only if you want a gui for your game

21358836
subtraction	addition
0 - +1 subtraction replaced by addition and negation 0 + -1

21358855
folder	directory
lets say the script is placed in folder c temp a but i want the script to excute and change the file extensions of files in a another directory d xxx b

21358873
folder	directory
this can be found in the frameworks directory in the folder nav area

21358911
hash	md5
i have a background worker that checks a list of files for byte size and md5 hash

21358915
textwatcher	charsequence
what is the difference between using a textwatcher and within the the ontextchanged method setting a string value equal to the charsequence argument and simply using gettext method

21358987
min	max
max var5 and if more than one result then where min var3 var6 to var12 from that same row

21359000
implements	extends
res1 res2 can extends the abstract class and implements the interface

21359021
oncreate	onstart
what i expected is it should have worked as how activities are switched and onstart is used rather oncreate

21359058
width	height
i get the screen height and width then find the center of the screen

21359068
children	parent
if an element s children are floated they are essentially taken out of the flow of the document therefore if the parent doesn t have defined dimensions it will collapse upon itself

21359085
oncreate	onnewintent
onnewintent is called instead of oncreate if it isnt already running the it calls oncreate as usual

21359107
superclass	subclassing
i have a class structure in java where one class extends another and the subclassing can have more variables than the superclass does

21359107
superclass	subclassing
in a function i created i accept the superclass as a parameter and so i don t know if the object i am passing in is an instance of the subclassing and i cannot test to see if it is for a few reasons

21359126
ubuntu	linux
if you look at the proc file system there is a file at path proc version which spits out a string linux version 3.2.0-56-generic buildd batsu gcc version 4.6.3 ubuntu linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5 #86-ubuntu smp wed oct 23 17 31 43 utc 2013 describing the version of the kernel running

21359128
for-loop	loops
in the while loops a for-loop is used to go through the list of files starting at the 2nd element - notice and does the comparisons

21359128
for-loop	loops
unlike a foreach loops the contents of the collection can be modified in a for-loop

21359128
for-loop	loops
after the for-loop is completed the original file is moved and loops continues until there is only one file left in the list of files that match what you are looking for

21359151
put	get
if i put the email address back in and submit the form the url now points to and i get the error

21359160
width	height
so far i ve thought that i have to get the dpi first and set the width and height so the end result is 300dpi

21359160
width	height
so if someone wants to print a 4x5 area at 300dpi then i have to take the width and height x current resolution to get there

21359193
post	get
i want to get the xpath of a facebook post using htmlunit

21359193
post	get
i just want to get the xpath of the span containing the post with text hi

21359197
post	get
it would be better to post this problem here and get the programmer to fix it

21359232
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
then i made an arrays of opacities and a for-loop and kept the opacity that i want on each loops

21359263
post	get
i m stuck trying to figure out how to get my post to display under the same subject

21359310
put	get
if you put that in your browser you will get results however trying to do so in code fails

21359335
width	height
you can get the height and width using the sizewithfont method as shown below

21359335
width	height
cgsize is a c structure so you can access the height and width as follows

21359336
subtraction	addition
but when that carry pass into the other alu the function table will switch from addition to subtraction

21359337
int	chars
java implicitly converts this chars to an int - but it s not the int that you want it to be

21359364
background-image	background-position
you can then just set the background-position so that the background-image is in the correct place and then apply the styles you want to the li itself

21359364
width	height
i ve used inline styles in that demo for the background-image and width height styles because i assume you ll want to use different images for each li

21359456
bower	npm
i tried installing bower npm module

21359457
apache	nginx
under apache its works fine but recently i m changing my site to nginx and i got this error

21359484
hash	salt
you will need to store the salt somewhere so you can re-generate the hash once the user returns to the application

21359509
subtraction	addition
because arm uses two s complement representation signed and unsigned addition similarly subtraction are the same thing

21359517
ddms	adb
tried listing devices both in eclipse ddms and from cli using adb

21359519
versioning	upgrade
after adding i have test upgrade to a current new versioning from old versioning that s no problem no any crash

21359548
int	double
i want to read a double value and a int value from a console application in c#

21359554
fadein	hide	hide	show
you can also use toggle slidetoggle or fadetoggle functions instead fadein for show hide property

21359592
strdup	malloc	strcpy	strdup	strcpy	malloc
you can also use strdup instead of malloc and strcpy if you know the systems this code will run on support it

21359592
int	chars
this is undefined behavior because it isn t guaranteed that the chars pointer can be treated as an int pointer .

21359606
folder	directory
when i took bubbles.html out of the templates folder and opened it from a different directory the page loaded correctly

21359623
int	chars
if you want them interpreter as single-digit int there s no way to do that directly but you can do that in two steps as well read it as an array of 2 strings treat each string as a sequence of chars broadcast np.vectorize int over it

21359644
for-loop	arrays
i am thinking maybe using a for-loop to fill the arrays but i am not sure how to have it fill all the different countries

21359649
put	get
if i put the next code after list object i get 2 errors

21359744
hash	salt
if you d like to go with simpler approach generate a fast hash based on set property the user s id and an application-wide salt

21359774
width	height
width is 20 height is 10

21359774
width	height
i have tried messing with the numbers within the maploaded width height and switching the x and y around but nothing seems to work

21359793
gtk	fltk
most toolkits qt gtk fox fltk ... handle this somehow

21359793
kde	gnome
in practice it is well standardized this is why you can run a qt or kde application on a gnome desktop or a gtk application on a kde desktop

21359801
parallels	bootcamp
the only way to run the binary on os x is to either compile an os x binary version of it or to have your friend use parallels or bootcamp to run windows and then run your app there

21359822
chown	sudo
tl dr - i typed this sudo chown -r www-data www-data var www

21359822
chown	chmod
i do not think it was a combination of trying to chmod the chown the tmp directory and this

21359828
folder	directory
copy the directory for the imported pebblekit into the libraries folder and rename it to pebblekit

21359845
width	height
the issue is that when i pack all my images i set the max page width and max page height to 4086

21359845
width	height
problem solved when i reduced both max page width and max page height to 2048

21359868
int	chars
problem 2 you are tryig to compare the chars entered from console to numbers directly which does not work as when you read the chars from console it will store its ascii value not direct integer.for example if you enter 1 from console it will be stored as 49 in int variable ch acii code of 1 is 49 so when you compare with 1 it does not match

21359873
postorder	inorder
i understand how to print the tree inorder postorder etc

21359891
google-chrome	firefox
you can check this behavior using some other browsers such as firefox or google-chrome it will ask you if you want to resubmit the data

21359892
jtextfield	jlabel
when i added jtextfield jplane misbehaved and even jbutton and jlabel stoped showing

21359893
min	max
use the built-in min and max functions like this

21359898
google-chrome	firefox
note i have tested in firefox 26.0 google-chrome 32.0 on ubuntu 12.04 lts

21359899
setinterval	settimeout
i understand that javascript does not have a delay 500 method which would delay execution for 500 milliseconds so i have been trying to get around that by using settimeout and setinterval

21359930
jtextfield	jlabel
when i added jtextfield jplane misbehaved and even jbutton and jlabel stoped showing.

21359995
range	max	range	min	min	max
note the values for range name min max and step are all dynamically generated from the function s properties

21359999
width	height
in order to determine whether the rectangle is horizontal or vertical i use the height width ratio extracted from a minarearect

21359999
width	height
however i have noticed that sometimes if i let the program run on a loop over the same image the values for width and height for the same stationary rectangle swap where it reports the previous width value as its current height and similarly for the previous height value

21359999
width	height
this renders the code unsatisfactory because it can no longer use height width ratio successfully

21359999
width	height
here is a sample output notice the height and width between iterations

21360037
put	get
i get that i can put in myimage.png whose size is 568 x 320 and myimage 2x.png whose size is 1136 x 640 and at run time ios will show the lager image if the device has a retina screen

21360039
build.gradle	gradlew
note in gradlew build system minsdkversion and targetsdkversion defined in androidmanifest will be overridden by what you define in your module s build.gradle file

21360045
superclass	subclassing
one way is to use a superclass to declare a subclassing variable

21360128
comparator	comparable
you can however implement the comparable interface and provide a comparator method that will tell you which earthquake has a larger magnitude

21360138
post	put
not sure where to put this but i will go ahead and post it here as a side answer

21360139
hide	show
so in keyboard hide method configure all maybe show cells state and then reloaddata will help to show cell correctly

21360155
min	max
the mechanism allows you more control of the upload than the query string authentication mechanism can provide including specifying redirect pages for success and failure acl and min max file sizes

21360193
int	double
this at once defines complex int complex double complex rational etc

21360193
int	double
note that this does not define how to add a complex int to a complex double

21360193
int	double
addition + still has the type so you can only add a complex int to a complex int and a complex double to another complex double

21360203
prepare	execute
bundle execute rake test prepare

21360210
width	margin
how do i make it so that it detects the contact before it happens - i ve tried working with the tank s margin and subtracting it s width so that before it makes contact it calls an event but it has been unsuccessful and completely stopped the collision function working

21360247
stdout	stderr
the main scenario where this is marginally applicable is cross platform projects where you would like to keep most of your common code in main however on some platforms mainly embedded ones you would like to duplicate what the other oses are doing before main - setting up environment variables wiring standard file descriptors stdin stdout stderr to custom descriptors on your system allocate your own custom memory manager - allocate your own stack for running main and so on

21360250
versioning	upgrade
data stores created with any previous milestone versioning can not be used with 2.0.0-rc1 unless a manual upgrade is performed

21360276
setinterval	clearinterval
the clearinterval method is used to stop further executions of the function specified in the setinterval method

21360381
asterisk	pbx
for example asterisk pbx abuses of constructors because is strongly based on modules it injects a constructor on each module at compilation time

21360441
ng-app	ng-controller	ng-view	ng-controller	ng-view	ng-app
ok just found the problem for some reason the only way to get the page to stay in the ng-view is to have a on it with ng-app and ng-controller defined

21360458
post	get
need to get and check for strings get or post only

21360467
screens	tablet
however if you do that smaller devices would have tiny components and make them all squeeze into their small screens while larger devices even tablet would have huge ui components

21360500
width	height
you could find the mid point of the rectangle fairly easily just average the height and width

21360503
width	height
iframe src smspoolwebsite.com width 700 height 1300 frameborder 1

21360503
width	height
the width and the height of the iframe itself cannot be changed in size otherwise my website breaks doesn t look nice but the available width is just a little bit not enough

21360519
fadein	removeclass
what i was hoping would happen was that the first .fadeout would fade out the the removeclass would stop the css from hiding it and the final fadein would fade it back onto the page

21360600
uipagecontrol	uipageviewcontroller
btw the is no uipageview only uipagecontrol or uipageviewcontroller

21360634
google-chrome	firefox
you can see some of my trials here will be deleted later - test them out in for example firefox and google-chrome

21360646
width	height
specifically using javascript to change the width and the height when the picture is clicked on

21360646
width	height
as you can see in the documents below i tried using measurements from the clients browser size to get the correct width and then getting a ratio from the picture to assign a height

21360646
width	height
the only problem is that when i try to get the height and width of the image the functions only return 0

21360646
google-chrome	firefox
this occurs in the most recent versions of google-chrome firefox and internet explorer

21360700
for-loop	loops
don t use a for-loop cat for reading files use a while read loops

21360712
mp3	wav
i can use pysox to convert the wav to mp3 using the following code

21360734
inherited	subclassing
the reason object.tostring implemented like this is that as the base of the inherited chain it really doesn t know what information of the subclassing should be added to the return value of tostring

21360738
width	height
when you are working with rotatedrect you should remember that it doesn t have real width or height because they can be swapped if you add 90 degrees to angle

21360738
width	height
as a result using width or height of rotatedrect to initialize box is problematic to say the least

21360740
width	height
if you want to make an element fill the entire space you can do so by setting its display attribute to inline-block and set the width and height to 100

21360780
put	get
i insert a gridview into my project i put a button to get the id of clicked row but everytime it returns 0 value

21360810
inherited	properties	public	protected
if the method you want to redeclare is not declared as final and some methods properties of the class are not private but for example protected or even better all public - use objects inherited

21360856
post	put
i m trying to make a routing system for my web app in express.js and i need to know if i m going to need to use app.get post put delete.apply to programmatically setup multiple functions for one route

21360875
int	chars
i m trying to encrypt file by adding some int a key selected randomly for every chars on it

21360885
nginx	lighttpd
i am migrating my server from lighttpd to nginx in lighttpd i used to put fast cgi configuration in one file called fastcgi.conf

21360886
gruntjs	package.json
now before you actually run the gruntjs make sure that you got all npm packages in your project directory and package.json is in correct shape

21360896
width	margin
third works because you have a fixed width defined along with margin auto

21360896
width	margin
nest the fixed width element inside 100 width element using margin auto

21360943
folder	directory
note that to see the appdata directory in windows explorer you must set explorer to show hidden files computer organize folder search options view advanced settings show hidden...

21360952
width	height
component.getwidth and component.getheight for getting width and height of the said component

21360962
abc	subclassing
subclassing an abc requires you to implement its interface

21360994
rss	feed
tried searching and found php rss feed show images but when i add the code from that answer i get nothing in the rss module

21361017
post	put
i have put all post parameters you put in your queries in mysql_real_escape_string functions

21361035
put	get
on the left side pizzas i put two s in each so i could get the left-float and right-float effect

21361066
rss	feed
i get the content for my list view through a rss feed and my custom font is meera_04-2.ttf

21361132
for-loop	loops
but when the next for-loop the i will automatically be set to the first item in the list when loops starts

21361133
for-loop	loops
after the for-loop adam reference columbus the last element of the list because target variable adam is not delete after loops

21361149
matlab	freemat
it s a bug of freemat see here and here it runs well under matlab

take a good look at my code and then realize it s much easier to use config ini to handle this task for you

21366402
config	ini
as i said the only reason i didn t use something like config ini is i had to make sure my code works with just the standard perl modules

21366423
inherited	properties
the general rule of thumb is that each view should have it s own viewmodel you can reuse viewmodels via inherited or adding properties but again a view deserves it s own viewmodel

and the according getter setter etc

21366706
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
i ve been making a page with 4 elements and the problem i ve encountered is that when resizing the browser window the width of the elements and the margin between them change as i expect but for some reason the elements can start overlapping vertically even though for example the height of the black element div class a is 13 the height of the green element is 86 div class c and the green element has an absolute position and margin-top value of 14

21366715

21367189
bluetooth	usb
so in particular i m not interested in the trivial enumeration of all serial ports which would only reveal a list of com + the corresponding number but the real name of that device and probably its device id where information can be found about whether this is connecting via usb or bluetooth

21367189

instead of having getter and setter he had code similar to what i have at line 37

21367317
google-chrome	firefox
i m new to using ajax and my code works in internet explorer but not in firefox or google-chrome

21367324
getter	setter
you ll then need getter and setter to access them from outside the class

21367324
getter	setter
however from inside the class you can use them without getter or setter no problem

21367348
put	get
i need to get rid of the empty space on the left and put the text in the middle of li vertically

this will work just fine in google-chrome and firefox however in opera safari and all versions of ie nothing comes through

21367387
getter	setter
you don t need getter or setter if the attribute is visible to the public but that doesn t mean it s a good idea

21367399
hash	md5
also i noticed there is no md5 hash on the css links

21367400
floating-point	fractions
i m trying to do subtraction of binary digits in fractions or in floating-point

21367400
floating-point	fractions
since i haven t seen any direct way not dec to bin to convert a binary fractions digit to its 2 s complement i tried implementing the solution from this lecture on 2 s complement of binary fractions wherein you get the bit by bit complement and add the floating-point part the background principle of adding the fractions part wasn t explained

21367429
getter	setter
his instance variables the variables declared at the beginning of student were public which allowed him to access and change them directly without the use of setter and getter

21367451

21367517
min	max
for a quadratic equation of the form y a x 2+b x+c the max min occurs at x -b 2a

21367608
min	max
note if you consider polynomials outside any restriction interval from -inf to +inf then they are unbounded in the sense that their max or min or both is inifinity

21367608
min	max
probably you are interested in the finite max min if they exist

21367608
min	max
you could check if the max or min is supposed to be infinite but you won t find this out from the algorithm above because computation imposes a numerical bound on values

21367608
min	max
if the polynomial has an even degree one between max and min is finite

21367736
width	height
you can use .setvideosize width height

21367755

21367881
google-chrome	safari
here is a larger version that works on safari google-chrome - adding fetile so you can see the effect a little more clearly

21367932
int	double
it might make sense to use an int loop to make sure you deal with the right number of partitions instead of comparing a double x to double boundaries

21368110
config	ini
in case you would like to try a different ini module config inifiles will create the same hoh as above

21368170
gif	png
i m pretty sure from the values i would have to use under rgb that those values would get changed when going back and saving as a gif like in how to create a transparent gif or png with pil python-imaging

21368235
ubuntu	linux
the default ubuntu snmpd configuration specifically denies just about everything useful with this configuration limiting access to just enough information to tell you that the box is a linux box

21368330
folder	directory
first in the include_path then php will search the current directory first always although in most cases the file will be located in the somepath foo includes folder

21368330
folder	directory
at the beginning of your include path and use . abc.php explicitly when you are including a file from the current directory special case not one of your â œnormalâ includes then for all other of your include files that you just include using baz.php xzy.php and 123.php php will not have to search the current directory first â which is useless since those files are located in your special include folder

21368433
bionic	libc
the android libc bionic provides built-in support for pthreads so no additional linking -lpthreads is necessary

21368448
inherited	subclassing
accordingly to inherited from a will add exactly zero bloat to a subclassing instance

21368468
uiview	subviews
as you can see i have tried various things like removing all the subviews before adding a new view to the cell or setting - uiview setclearscontextbeforedrawing yes on both the cell and the uitextview and even setting the placeholder value to nil without success

21368511
submit	submission
if you run an ajax call on the submit handler of a form the ajax request will fire but then the form will continue submission thus refreshing the page and never firing your callback function

21368511
submit	submission
instead you should call event.preventdefault at the end of the submit handler function to prevent the browser from submission the form normally with a new http request

21368560
addition	modulo
so although the algorithm looks complicated all that it does is digitwise addition modulo 3 without carry

21368573
folder	directory
i transfer all the files under lib in sdl2-image extension to lib folder of the codeblock istallation directory and all the files under include i.e-sdl2 folder of sdl2-image extension to include directory of the codeblock and all the files under lib of sdl2-image extension to the exe directory of the program made

21368575

21368696
xls	ods	doc	odf
while exiftool one of the best tools in metadata space can be used to extract metadata for doc ppt xls or odt odf ods files it does not support writing modifying metadata for these document types

21368702
hide	show
after all the problem is that although the tab content is show due to the hide tabhost part the scroll doesn t allows you to see the entire content

21368711
superclass	subclassing
the level of control the subclassing has during superclass construction is which superclass constructor gets called and what parameters it gets via the initializer mechanism

21368753
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it doesn t happen in firefox ie or safari only google-chrome

21368841
post	get
i ve read multiple post on stack trying to find the solution but i can t seem to get my code to work

rails-api	rabl
working on an api using the rails-api and rabl gems basing understanding off railscasts 348 and 322

21368929
getter	setter
getter and setter should be able to be given as lambdas

21368948
maven	pom.xml
according to maven documentation when multiple executions are given that match a particular phase they are executed in the order specified in the pom.xml with inherited executions running first

21368961
rsa	aes	des	rsa	des	aes
aes keys are just cryptographically strong random bytes des parity bits and rsa prime number calculation keys are not

21368991
post	get
when i break this code to post the data over network using jerser client api and try read it back on the server using jersey i don t get the value that i posted

21369013
implements	extends
you should extends org.eclipse.ui.part.editorpart rather than implements ieditorpart from scratch

21369056
glfw	glew
i am also using glfw glew xcode and vs2012 for each machine

21369095
getter	setter
you could agree to some kind of structural interface for getter and setter and then implement something like this

21369097
int	double
you should probably store an exact double as a member and set the underlying slider to the appropriate int equivalent

21369097
qslider	qwidget
furthermore you should probably inherit from qwidget instead and have a qslider as a child as you do not want users of your class to change the integer range of your internal slider

21369113
decltype	auto
i rarely see decltype auto but when i do it confuses me because it seems to do the same thing as auto when returning from a function

21369126
put	get	post	get	post	put
btw - a great standard for designing simple web services especially those related to entity crud is the rest pattern - where an http post is used for an entity create a put for an entity update delete for an entity update and get for retrieving an entity

21369131
decltype	auto
i could just have easily use auto instead of decltype

21369145
width	height
use a hidden view with no height or width in the center and put the text views on either side

21369155
median	max
i don t want to use the filter as the count mean median and max in the inset will be based on the reduced sample rather than the entire sample and will make no sense

21369156
width	margin
you have 10 nav items that are each 64px width + 22px margin wide this totals to 860px wide 160px too large

21369170
decltype	auto
decltype auto follows the decltype rules for deducing reference types based on value categories

21369190
hide	show
i am trying to get this value inside of the constructor and trying to hide show some controls inside my user controls but its not working

21369192
decltype	auto
decltype auto returns what type you would get if you wrapped the return clause in decltype

21369192
decltype	auto
auto returns by value decltype maybe not

21369209
google-chrome	firefox
the google-chrome in the article on mdn does not refer to google-chrome but to extension code that runs with google-chrome privileges look here for other meanings of google-chrome in firefox

21369210
folder	directory
the root directory is your main folder the lowest case denominator

21369217
single-quotes	double-quotes
thus the shell-active characters are protected by single-quotes and only the parts that we want the shell to mess with are in double-quotes

21369238
google-chrome	firefox
this information would be specific to google-chrome canary or firefox

21369241
tooltip	scrollbar
now the tooltip works fine but if i make the window big hover an image on the edge and then make the window small again so the tooltip div is outside the body it creates a scrollbar horizontal

21369241
tooltip	scrollbar
or if the window is small enough so the tooltip gets outside of it it also creates a scrollbar thought this is fixable by some javascript checks

21369242
inherited	properties
the expander control inherited from headeredcontentcontrol which means it has header properties which you can customize

21369252
decltype	auto
decltype is significantly more versatile that auto and can always be used in place of it

21369252
decltype	auto
therefore i think it s pretty safe to say that decltype should only be used in cases where it s completely necessary so if auto produces the wrong result you should use decltype

21369252
decltype	auto
also you can t as of yet use auto in return types and parameters so you can use decltype there as well

21369252
decltype	auto
another thing to consider is that decltype isn t really necessary unless you re writing library code auto is nice for everyday programming if you want to make your code more concise it s up for debate wether using as much auto as possible is good but it s virtually necessary when working with unutterable types like lambdas

21369287
super	self
self super initemployee nsstring thename withid nsstring theid

21369287
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing

21369319
debian	linux
i am using linux debian to compile

21369333
getter	setter
i would leave standard accessor methods getter setter for its default purpose to access fields and create another class called

21369336
required	placeholder
it s not the placeholder but the required flag that makes the input light up red

21369348
integer	fractions
as you likely know int means integer whole numbers with no fractions component

21369348
int	double
languages will sometimes do implicit type-conversion so when the variable storing the value is for example an int when your numbers are of type double the portion after the decimal point gets chopped off

21369373
hide	show
this show the spinner whenever we are about to go to a state that has anything to resolve and hide it when the state change is complete

21369426

however do keep in mind that all that division does is repeated subtraction

21369475
ppm	pgm
it should based on ppm or pgm files p2 standard

21369476
put	get
i need to call the web service several times to get data and then put those data into my database so i ve got the following code

21369548
getter	setter
your instance variables are generally private which is why you would create a getter setter to access them

21369552
wav	caf
also if needed to know the same error occurs when i switched to from wav to caf

21369552
wav	caf
i took the same code and adjusted it for wav caf and m4a files and it failed every time with a the operation is not supported for this media. error

21369583
background-position	background-size
specifically it seems to transition the background-position property correctly but skip the transition frames of the background-size property

21369689
post	get
then i go to the sub and send a post request to get the results in json format

21369694
width	height
the wrapper is what i mean should have the minimums set because nowhere in your css is a width or height mentioned

21369718
post	get
when i post my listener back from the fragment to the activity to show an item has been clicked i repeat the above paragraph add the fragment f2 add it to the backstack let it get displayed

21369731
opera	firefox
checked in firefox opera dwb and geany internal browser webkit

21369738
superclass	subclassing
you don t have to do it exactly this way where your subclassing is basically your superclass with some additional members but in this case it seems appropriate

21369754
execvp	fork
then i fork a child process and execute the command using execvp

21369761
width	height
i m trying to center a block of text that has an unknown height and table-cell will also not work for it width needs to be 100 of the parents

21369850
srt	subtitle
how to convert subtitle from srt to ass format

21369859
inherited	subclassing
inherited is very useful when the object does not change type during runtime for example when you create an equity -object you can be quite sure you do not want to turn it into an fra even though both are subclassing of securities

21369859
inherited	subclassing
in my previous example the security subclassing might inherited from a top-level asset class but the methods used for putting a market value on an asset should be put there by a behavioral pattern such as the strategy pattern since you might want to use different methods during one runtime

21369895
width	margin
you can virtually reduce width of second image to zero with negative margin

21369898
folder	directory
i think that happen because iis intercepts the requests and treat the bundle name as a directory and since the content folder really exists it returns the forbidden error

21369917
folder	directory
i also created a blank file in my personal directory because i know github doesn t store empty folder

21369963
width	height
i want it to expand width height to the content that it holds

21369989
base	fractions
and the answer to that question is because this is a binary computer and it uses base 2 not base 10 there are conversion problems with 0.001 when going to base 2 you cannot exactly represent that fractions in an ieee floating point number

21369989
base	fractions
in base 10 we know that if we have a fractions with a factor of 3 in the denominator and lacking one in the numerator to cancel it out we end up with an infinitely repeated pattern basically we cannot accurately represent that number with a finite set of digits

21369993
debian	linux
i ran into the same problem trying to install.packages rjava in r version 3.0.2 as long as i tried to install as ordinary user linux debian

uid_t is after some typedefs defines defined as __u32_type which is defined as unsigned int that is on my gentoo linux system

21370190
int	chars
i have a string declared as chars 20 folds which is assigned its value from a command line argument that looks like x y z where x y and z are all int

21370211
folder	directory	folder	dir
just create a resources directory like src test resources and add the log4j.xml file to that dir and then make that directory a source folder

21370306
implements	extends
i then try adding another class helloglassservice which extends android.app.service and implements one abstract function

21370396
integer	unsigned
it says that ino_t is an unsigned integer type used for file serial numbers

21370396
integer	unsigned
for both uid_t and gid_t it says that the type is an integer type no mention of signed or unsigned used for user ids and group ids

21370418
ng-view	ng-include	ng-switch	ng-view	ng-switch	ng-include
new angularjs developers often do not realize that ng-repeat ng-switch ng-view and ng-include all create new child scopes so the problem often shows up when these directives are involved

21370472
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
you can t use the for-each loops also known as the enhanced for-loop to set arrays variables since it uses a temp variable inside of loops

21370473
for-loop	loops
i recommend the for-loop but any loops while do

21370479
min	max
that appears to be what you re doing by passing in the extent max and min of the data instead of a sorted list of all possible values

21370562
width	height
i ve built the below to store and retrieve height and width values for different panes in an vs2013 mvc view

21370573
atomic	compare-and-swap
the second referenced paper shows algorithms using nominal subtypes of node in atomic compare-and-swap operations

21370593
width	height
the width is 500 and the height is 666

21370593
width	height
so according to my calculation i need to loop 64 times 8 rows and 8 columns and for each sprite its width is 500 8 62.5 and its height is 666 8 83.25

21370593
width	height
since getsubimage accepts only int parameters i was forced to put the width as 62 and the height a 83 and i think this is why it truncates my images

21370620
post	get	retrofit	okhttp
this works great when i m sending requests directly with okhttp and other get requests with retrofit but when i use retrofit to do a post request i get the following error

21370635
std	ostream
â std ostream fraction operator std ostream const fraction â must take exactly one argument|

21370635
std	ostream
is std ostream const fraction just plain wrong

21370642
put	get
i get this our put

21370669
pickle	dill
dill is probably a better choice for pickling then pickle itself as dill can serialize almost anything in python

21370698
pull	push
you can have developers pull from push to that repository rather than the repository in the elastic beanstalk instance

21370699
public	protected
and if you really want an opinion i put private first and then protected public and default

21370719
button	checkbox
once you get a simple form in try doing the same adding in an example of the component types you use like tabbed panes button checkbox etc

21370734
for-loop	arrays
a couple of comments first of all you should initialize you arrays outside of the for-loop so that it only does it once

21370741
put	get
now the text inside of the above code that i m trying to get out is this i will put before and after the text i m trying to parse

21370769
width	height
so i m making a game and i want the canvas to be the full width and height of the page

21370769
width	height
i wrote up a function to get the width height of the page

21370769
width	height
the trouble comes when i m initiating my kinetic.stage object and i have to set the width height

21370769
width	height
when i set the width and height of the stage to the width or height properties that are returned by getwindowsize i get scrollbars which is very annoying and i have to subtract 25 from each value

21370774
titlebar	window
if you wish to have a custom window design custom close zoom minimize buttons with the ability to customize the titlebar i would highly reccommend inappstorewindow 1 for the task

21370807
int	chars
don t bother converting the string to an int just loop the string and check that each chars is individually in the allowed list or range

21370813
rss	feed
p.s i already read several posts about parsing rss feed via ajax and jquery but none of them worked for me

21370836
disk	ram
reading a row from disk takes about 100 000 times longer than reading the same row from ram

21370836
disk	ram
a disk seek takes about 10 000 000 nanoseconds of course some disk are faster but the best of them are still thousands of times slower than ram

21370836
disk	ram
but ram is volatile the data in ram is erased when the computer loses power and ram is far more expensive than disk per unit of storage

21370836
disk	ram
so we typically have big disk for instance 1 tb to store a lot of data and a somewhat smaller amount of ram typically 16-64 gb on a database server to store the most frequently-accessed data

21370836
disk	ram
so even if your ram is much smaller than your disk you could assume you can read data that s already in ram 90 of the time or more

21370838
retrofit	okhttp
your best bet is to provide your credentials to retrofit via a requestinterceptor instead of okhttp s okauthenticator

21370870
inherited	subclassing
subclassing extend abstractemployee to inherited its state but provide their unique implementation for how their annual earnings are calculated

21370921
countdowntimer	timertask
you should use one timertask and put all your ui updates into that single timer instead running multiple countdowntimer s for essentially the same job since you re already doing all the math to determine when time is up for any particular item you might just run one timertask and once a second have it update everything

21370925
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
the function receives three arguments the jqxhr in jquery 1.4.x xmlhttprequest object a string describing the type of error that occurred and an optional exception object if one occurred

21370951
width	height
if you want the canvas to be the entire width and height of the screen then presumably you d never want scrollbars so couldn t you just do

21370964
put	get
and then added a home.php to my website and put some stuff in it but i still get it works

21370971
maven	pom.xml
if you execute the publishm2 sbt task on a project that using the plugin the generated maven pom.xml file contains a dependency of the plugin

21371026
versioning	upgrade
firstly you should upgrade to a much newer versioning of jquery 1.3.2 is very old the latest versioning with old ie support is 1.11.0

21371026
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your jquery library to the latest versioning the above will not work without it

21371029
photoshop	fireworks
you can use fireworks or presumably photoshop to create an all black .png image just a black box

21371030
folder	directory
this worked fine but the problem is i don t seethe directory out2 in the application folder

21371070
uicontrol	uibutton
when your left or right callout accessory view objects are subclasses of uicontrol which should be the case for you as it sounds like you have a uibutton the map view will automatically notify its delegate when the accessory views are touched

21371074
folder	directory
you also never cd to the downloads directory1 folder so your mkdir would create directory in cwd

21371083
inherited	subclassing
conceptually you want to inherited it but it is a variable only in the abstract-class and becomes an invariant for the subclassing

21371092
google-chrome	firefox
how can i fool the website to just think this is a normal request made from a browser firefox google-chrome

21371092
google-chrome	firefox
and how do i make it look like a http request from firefox google-chrome or whatever

21371108
width	height
you are times the width by the current row i and the height by the current col j

21371108
width	height
i would suggest creating a simply look up file which contains the row column as the key and the width height of the cell possibly even the x y so you can simply pick the sprite straight out but that s up to you.

21371123
maven	m2e
newer versions of m2e complain if a maven plugin does not provide a m2e lifecycle mapping

21371206
x86	64bit
during debug it dawned on me that i am compiling for 64bit but have office x86 loaded

21371232
width	height
...the avcaptureoutput returns a uiimage that not only has a different width height than the video preview but it also has a different aspect ratio

21371245
google-chrome	firefox
i need a google-chrome or firefox add on or other method to determine when the content i am viewing is loaded from local browser cache or from the web server

21371246
int	chars
is illegial in c because bits is actually a pointer to the first chars in the string so it complains about an assignment from int to pointer without a cast

21371252
hash	salt
if you pass different parameters such as a random iv or a randomly salt password hash then you will get different results

21371270
put	get
if put sends broadcast then in 4 both get and dump are awaken

21371292
min	max
starting at this pixel form a min max rectangle and keep expanding it until none of the sides contain an alpha pixel

21371293
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
the bundled java.util.date java.util.calendar and java.text.simpledateformat are notoriously troublesome confusing and tricky

21371306
sorting	filtering
you can also use the datatable select command with parameters for filtering and sorting

21371349
folder	directory
i have two folder in my wamp directory client1 and client2 obviously each folder will relate the the client1 client2 in the host file above

21371367
folder	directory
firstly your directory structure should never go above the www folder for security purposes

21371385
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
amazon-web-services opsworks and amazon-web-services beanstalk are i ve been told simply different ways of managing your infrastructure depending on how you think about it

21371396
integer	unsigned
u16 is an unsigned 16-bit integer in big endian

21371436
getter	setter
from the point of view of building good software some functions will need multiple tests and some functions getter and setter come to mind do not really need any and sometimes multiple functions are best covered by a single unit test getter and setter again come to mind

21371443
int	double
the error i m getting is operands of have incompatible types double and int

21371458
min	max
this example works fine but i would just add something like min and max values

21371468
put	get
they re just or at least should just be a programmatic representation of a database table a way for entity framework to take data from your table rows and put it into some structure that lets you get at it easily

21371478
imagemagick	mogrify
when imagemagick is installed try these commands identify display convert mogrify on your images

21371489
.htaccess	httpd.conf
there are probably a bunch of other things you ll want to change in httpd.conf such as enabling .htaccess files to function fully like they can on a typical linux server

21371493
min	max
you can add variables with min and max values

21371511
put	get	post	get	post	put
first the boundary is the starting point of your application and exposes your services in the rest phisolophy you should do operations like crud remember get post put delete and ejb is just that kind of boundary session facade that you want for transactional operations or other powerful services such as asynchronous message driven beans etc...

21371555
hide	show
with selects it does update the value but when it hide the input when clicking outside the tr the value of the select show the fk id field rather than the text in between opening and closing of the selected option tag the name field

21371592
inherited	subclassing
where bar is a subclassing of foo using single table inherited

21371637
google-chrome	safari
until apple fixes these long standing bugs in mobile safari it seems that trying to scale iframe content using webkit-transform isn t a viable option unless you are only targeting google-chrome

21371641
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
on firefox google-chrome node.js macos node.js ubuntu and safari the fastest implementation i tested was

21371665
width	height
similarly to this answer i gave you could absolutely position the .overlay element relative to the parent element and give it a height and width of 100 this should work for all img sizes given that the parent element will be inline-block it s the same size as its containing elements

21371713
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
on the other hand in ie9 or higher version of ie google-chrome firefox safari etc. it returns true which means ã is a one-byte character

21371726
versioning	upgrade
you should upgrade to the latest versioning of xcode

21371790
octal	decimal
in octal 10 8 decimal

21371791
binutils	glibc
follow pass 1 and pass 2 of linux from scratch for binutils gcc glibc and libstdc++

21371791
centos	linux
glibc will need the centos linux kernel headers -installs as-

21371797
for-loop	loops
everything both for-loop and ui runs immediately and nslog loops is done

21371831
button	checkbox
in your project select project assistant tab build installation panel select single msi package checkbox then click build installations button

21371846
spaces	delimiter
i would ideally like the first two words separated by a spaces and each two word-set tab delimiter

21371849
udp	tcp
so i m setting up a voip software and my connection thread to another peer has a udp socket to send audio and a tcp socket for signaling text

21371850
median	max
the function f is typically some summarizing function like the mean the median the max or the min.

21371894
width	height
android.graphics.bitmap.createbitmap bitmap 0 0 width height matrix true

21371931
put	get
and i am trying to get a value from database and put it in a textbox

21372007
width	height
go to ib and set constraints so the uitableview is equal to the view controllers width and height

21372031
inherited	properties
that s why you can optionally define the textelement.fontsize attached properties which are child controls will inherited due to dependency properties value inherited in the visual tree

21372046
vbscript	jscript
jscript language is similar to vbscript but have an advantage in this case the jscript code can be placed inside the batch file itself via a very simple trick

21372046
vbscript	jscript
in this case the original vbscript code is so simple that the jscript translation is immediate

21372046
vbscript	jscript
however i am not entirely sure that spvoice execute the same in jscript than in vbscript

21372048
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
looking at the source code it seems pretty clear that the utf8proc library is re-entrant and thread-safe assuming you have thread-safe malloc realloc free

21372062
google-chrome	firefox
this code works perfectly in google-chrome but does not work at all in firefox the form is sent to my server even when errors exist

21372066
median	max	min	median	min	max
if you are only interested in applying simple functions like mean median max min to the k -vectors functions for which the k -dimensional structure of these vectors is irrelevant then this is the way to go

21372066
median	max	min	median	min	max
this code assumes that fun operates on the first dimension of its argument as is the case for mean median min and max and many other matlab standard functions

21372076
google-chrome	firefox
it probably works in google-chrome because it perhaps catches this type of error for you and firefox isn t so lenient a good thing in my mind

21372078
min	max
that provides the result the number of days of booking for different rooms now my question is how to use the exerted data i e number of days with min max or count function

21372111
ecj	javac
this works well if i use some editor without syntax checking + javac with -javaagent but for eclipse it s impossible as if i add -javaagent to build configuration it s no used during incremental build with internal ecj

21372124
mousemove	mouseup
so when i detect the user clicking on the divider div -- i set the document s mousemove and mouseup handlers to my 2 functions movedivider and enddividermove code below

21372158
put	get
unfortunately i can t look at it now and tell you how to get the same functionality but i quickly went through the new code and put together a workaround in case it may help you

21372163
setinterval	clearinterval
if you intend to use the clearinterval method to cancel the setinterval call be sure to assign the setinterval call to a variable which the clearinterval function will later reference

21372163
setinterval	clearinterval
if you do not call the clearinterval function to cancel the setinterval call the object containing the set timeout closure function will not be garbage collected

21372163
setinterval	clearinterval
i ran a version of setinterval and did not find a memory leak obviously not using clearinterval

21372190
int	chars
it appears to compile and generate the .exe but when i go to the command prompt to enter the two inputs int argc chars argv it runs but generates no output

21372230
winhttp	libcurl
with that said http is not a trivial protocol to implement by hand so you really should use a premade http library such as libcurl or use microsoft s own wininet or winhttp apis

21372261
children	parent
i am keeping a directed acyclic graph structure in a dictionary where each key is a parent and each value is another dictionary which maps the children of the parent with corresponding edge weights

21372261
children	parent
for example in the graph below parent 1 has 2 children

21372277
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
in this case i ve tested the webdesign in firefox opera ie compatibilty starting from ie8 google-chrome and safari and everything is displayed correctly

21372277

21372325
serializable	deserialization
however you can get around this by dealing with serializable deserialization on your own

21372365
sorting	filtering
same as above except instead of filtering on the client you re now responsible for sorting on the client

21372382
equals	compareto
the compareto should first compare 1 if equals compare b if equals compare c

21372461
oncreate	setcontentview
then declare them after setcontentview ... in your oncreate like

21372465
super	extends
i m kind of a beginner at coding and i ve been looking all over the internet and nothing really comes out and gives me an example on how to use the extends method and how to properly use the super method

21372539
memcpy	memset
from my understanding both memcpy and memset should be included with intrinsic functions enabled

21372562
getter	setter
the attribute is to prevent ef from trying to store this value the getter and setter of this property just parse the guid of the base string id

21372564
portrait	landscape
even tough the user interface is locked to portrait the device orientation will return landscape which influences the calculation and results in this error

21372599
children	parent
this is because the parent wouldn t normally overlap the other elements in the list if it doesn t have a z-index so its children won t either

21372628
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
in debian or ubuntu linux

21372628
redhat	fedora
in fedora centos or redhat

21372628
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
you do this with the following command in debian or linux ubuntu

21372628
redhat	fedora
or the following in fedora centos or redhat

21372674
concurrenthashmap	readwritelock
for the inner map you could consider either readwritelock or concurrenthashmap

21372678
apache	nginx
if you re running a sensitive application financial data etc terminating ssl connections with nginx or apache is going to be a big deal for you because they will be using openssl which has been vetted and reviewed by numerous security experts

21372686
folder	directory
i have the 3 files of code all saved to the htdocs folder in xampp directory

21372724
multiplying	add
the collatz sequence goes if the number is even divide it by two if odd multiplying by 3 and add one

21372737
min	max
if you wait for python 3.4 you can do this quite cleanly as min and max will grow a default parameter see issue #18111

21372764
int	boolean
first the method in your case is returning a boolean but you are doing a switch on an int

21372764
int	boolean
so when the code checks to see if the input parameter mark is equal to isbetween 0 20 it is trying to compare an int and a boolean

21372794
centos	linux
on linux version 2.6.18-371.3.1.el5 centos the following worked for me

21372839
google-chrome	firefox
a pro-tip for the future when trying to debug this type of client-side js open the google-chrome dev tools or firebug if you re a firefox kind of person and start testing your jquery selectors in the console

21372966
post	put
would suggest akatum to post as an answer please don t accept this since akatum already posted the solution i just wanted to mention the side point but it s too long to put in a comment

21372969
versioning	upgrade
i have recently upgrade joomla from 2.5 to 3.0 and also upgrade my jomsocial to the latest versioning

21372984
post	get
if i add iteritems like other so post mention then i get this error list has no attribute iteritems

21373001
debian	centos
i think that the sendgrid instructions you linked to assume debian and file locations may be different in centos

21373012
min	max
i tried to put the constraints in ccd algorithm that is if my rotation angle goes above or below the constraint i limit it to max or min

21373016
post	get
i suppose exportdidfinish method have just a business logic then post that logic calculation in background thread using dispatch_get_global_queue then get it back on main thread using dispatch_get_main_queue

21373104
post	get
type has to be either get or post

21373112
mouseleave	mouseenter
i have made a button that fades in and out when mouseenter and mouseleave

21373141
equals	tostring
in list after i type colums 5 then dot just appear equals gethahcode gettype tostring

21373156
children	parent
the problem is that #header is in a stacking context defined by it s parent #wrap_all so none of the #wrap_all children will ever be above or below that stacking context

21373156
put	get
thirdly position fixed is put into a root level stacking context by some browsers but not by some other browsers so if your #overlay-2 isn t a top level object you may get some variability by browser

21373163
firefox	safari
it behaves properly with firefox and safari on my mac and with firefox and ie on a windows 8 pc

21373193
superclass	subclassing
i try override constructor from superclass to subclassing with array parameter in it

21373206
google-chrome	firefox
i tried using both firefox and google-chrome and both of them are doing the same thing

21373211
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox 26.0 google-chrome version 32.0.1700.76 m

21373221
put	get
the put request is sent but the file does not get uploaded as required

21373252
sorting	grouping
another case say down the line you want to introduce sorting or grouping to the query suddenly your line turns into something like this

21373275
public	protected
if you want to access a property in a sub-class then it has to be either public or protected

21373307
prepare	execute
why a simple query take long time to execute more than 1 second you can see the log file the query passed in prepare statement

21373316
puts	gets
i think you need two maps one for gets and other for puts

21373320
typedef	struct
struct argument is the underlying type and you want to typedef it as argument

21373335
serializable	deserialization
i guess that is why default serializable deserialization does not handle problem properly

21373337
children	parent
children will be z-ordered within the parent and not be interleaved

21373454
width	height
tcpdf does not support width and height css property to make pdf file best solution is that plase place a particular image instead of setting width height

21373535
int	double
you could get away with storing the differences as long int probably multiplying appropriately but it will be faster to keep them as double

21373546
width	height
the above example will draw a rectangle at x 50 y 50 coordinates with width and height of 100 each

21373559
express	node.js
i m new to angularjs and node.js express 3 and jade

21373581
children	parent
i ve tried to make a variable in the parent usercontrol such as uielementcollection and represented in the xaml file as stackpanel but that wasn t exactly what i wanted specially it allowed to have other children from a different type and i couldn t set any properties for the parent usercontrol such as the width

21373613
int	chars
for a lot of c compilers a chars is a signed 8-bit int

21373613
int	chars
this means you should store the value returned by getchar in an int then compare with eof then cast it to unsigned chars or uint8_t with a type cast to compare it 0xac

21373706
ssl	spdy
we don t need ssl and i haven t dabbled with spdy needs ssl of course so let s go with not needing ssl for now.

21373712
mouse	keyboard
we got a working prototype that streams and injects keyboard mouse events to a remote pc using the pcpmain.cc example provided under talk examples

21373744
button	checkbox
a button is not much different from say a checkbox or textfield

21373777
viewdidload	viewwillappear
reason being the first call will be when your viewcontroller is loaded and viewdidload and appear would be called as usual secondly when you have presented a modalviewcontroller imagepickercontroller and when it is dismissed again viewwillappear will be called because the viewcontroller s view is about to appear

21373782
put	get
when you call to_owned however you are getting a fresh instance of and you can put it into a mutable variable to get mutable vector

21373799
put	get	textview	imageview
if you put the pics in imageview and the textview to the right you will get the same effect with more control

21373857
google-chrome	firefox
for muting audio that is being sent on the peerconnection to a remote browser the audio tracks enabled should work in both firefox and google-chrome

21373965
subtract	add
math library seems to support basic vector operations such as add subtract and multiplication of two vectors

21374002
folder	directory
i want to apply a script to fix filenames in a directory and in sub folder

21374045

that way you don t have to duplicate the code in the superclass to both subclassing

21415730
keydown	keyup
this new control works well for formatting text however events like keydown keyup don t work

21415757
fold	catamorphism
there exists a generalization of the concept of a fold called a catamorphism

21415757
fold	catamorphism
in the same way that a fold lets you consume a list without explicit recursion a catamorphism lets you consume a tree or other datatype without explicit recursion and in a bottom-up manner starting from the leaves

21415774
build.gradle	gradlew
in projet i m importing to idea using gradlew import import from gradlew external model in idea my build.gradle contains besides other things following

21415791
treemap	linkedhashmap
if you need to store map in some order you must use treemap instead of linkedhashmap

21415799
imperative	declarative
your attempt is applying imperative programming methodologies where d3 is designed to support a more declarative approach

21415816
keydown	keyup
see if they re subscribing to the keydown and keyup events

21415885
getter	setter
i ve removed some of the things like the world getter and setter and cut the code down a bit

21415896

21416100
implements	extends
or possibly you re extends the municipality controller from a different ancestor that doesn t implements the add method

21416157
lisp	scheme	haskell	scheme
if you want to implement a basic lisp in a higher level language you might get some mileage out of the later chapters of the little schemer where you re shown how to write a meta-circular evaluator in scheme the entirety of wyas48 where you re shown how to implement an r5rs scheme in haskell and these two norvig articles wherein he implements a basic lisp-like in python

21416190
public	protected
it might be that you are getting only public things documented but just still seeing the private protected toggle buttons in the view

21416200
src	attr
just use attr to set src of iframe

21416253
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
i am using amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk to deploy a django application

21416258
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
another best practice is you can catch the checked exception and throw a unchecked-exception runtimeexception so that the caller of the method doesnt need to handle that

21416263
put	get	post	get	post	put
subsequent requests will be get post and put requests containing json and also the response will be in json

21416371
spaces	delimiter
character as a delimiter and not a spaces by.

21416403
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
google-chrome recent builds only and firefox are behaving very strict in this regard no matter how much content you have it will be no bigger than your viewport while opera presto behaves more like a table 100 is treated as a minimum not a maximum

21416403
opera	google-chrome
it is worth noting that responsive images fare poorly inside flex items using max-width 100 in some browsers most notably google-chrome builds from roughly a year ago and opera presto

21416446
ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest
you need the ftpwebrequest and ftpwebresponse classes

21416446
webclient	ftpwebrequest
the reason to use these classes instead of using webclient classes is that if you use ftpwebrequest response classes to upload and download files then we have more control of what is done inside

21416489
implements	extends
there is no effect on synchronization whether you extends thread or implements runnable

21416489
implements	extends
when you synchronize a method you get a lock on the object and not the thread - so it really does not matter.there are many so topics that discuss the distinction between these 2 approaches extends thread vs implements runnable

21416499
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on ie10 11 firefox e google-chrome

21416557

21416780
put	get
in one thread a it will just get the value and put an updated value so it is not a problem

21416816
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
there is hardly ever a need to say that a method throws exception which is the mother of all checked exceptions vs some more precise condition and in particular if the method only throws unchecked-exception subclasses of error or runtimeexception then there s no need to use the throws clause at all

21416823
width	height
hide frame2 and make sure to line up both framesso that they are of the same size and located right on top of each other top left width and height properties must be the same

21417024
keydown	keyup
it appears that firefox reserves the escape key and will not let you override or change its functionality using keydown keyup or keypress

21417032
wan	lan
most routers come often with 4 lan ports and one wan probably conencted to your modem

21417038
decoder	encoder
here the advantage is that when configuring the encoder elements accordingly no matter which input file format you get as long as your server can decoder it you ll end up with a mpeg4 udp stream but the server might waste resources and lose video quality by decoding a file just to encode it back into the same format

21417070
mouseup	mousedown

21417368
google-chrome	firefox
i replaced and tag with and its working fine now with all 3 browsers firefox google-chrome and ie

21417369
width	height
the getbounds method should return a rectangle if it was set using setbounds which stores the x y w h of the shape within its own coordinate space - it s real width height with no transformations applied

21417369
width	height
the gettransformedbounds method should return a rectangle again if set by using setbounds which stores the x y w y within its parent s coordinate space - the shape s width height with transformations applied

21417375
division	multiplication
you can flatten the vector into a single one and use multiplication and division to switch between two dimensional indicies and one dimentional indicies

21417376
google-chrome	firefox
use a tool like firebug for firefox or the inbuilt devloper tools in google-chrome

21417386
realloc	malloc
i m writing a short program where i need to first malloc an array of structure and if asked by user to malloc others the allocation give them consequentially addresses i ve prooved this but when i realloc one of them the reallocation invades the space of the others making them unusable.

21417437

you don t have to upgrade everything -- you could just obtain a license for a versioning 10 client

21417842
google-chrome	firefox
tested in google-chrome and firefox with the same issues

21417889
children	parent
the pluginmanagement in a parent pom is often used to set up the plugins for all children .

21418145
ppl	tbb
you need to source these structures from a reliable source like intel tbb or microsoft ppl

21418160
hide	show
the minimize is achieved by simply handling the click event and setting the window-state to minimized but this doesn t show the minimize animation you see on windows 7 and just instantly hide the window which feels very odd when used with other windows that do animate as you tend to feel the application is closing

21418216
ant	maven
thus i will have to resort to ant when building plugins for liferay prior to v6.1 and ant maven afterwards v6.1+ can be programmed using ant or maven build systems or gradle proviede there is such script upon this technology

21418240
webclient	webrequest
i m not sure if the credentialcache works with the httpclient but if it doesn t you could switch to webrequest or also webclient or maybe this information just brought you on the path to another solution

this works in safari mobile google-chrome mobile ie desktop and google-chrome desktop but not in firefox desktop 26.0

21418773
children	parent
if there is a common root module the â œparentâ that all the other modules the â œchildrenâ depend on none of the children should be depended upon by the parent

21418773
children	parent
however you can also have a parent have its children be sub-modules

21418817
int	double
the error occurs because your overriding function is returning a double instead of an int

21418830
centos	linux
but i continually receive red hat enterprise linux test page using centos and it allows for sub-directories because i allow

21419032
for-loop	loops
all i need is a for-loop for a label to pop up and flash entry1 as many times as entry2 yes i realize how to get the entry inputs but i have no idea how to get the label to continuously flash i have tried pack_forget and .destroy methods for the label in a loops but unfortunately it does not display as it almost instantly clears it from the screen again

21419041
draggable	droppable
once a draggable is dropped onto the droppable remove the ability for both the draggable and droppable to be futher dragged and dropped in the drop event

21419047
children	parent
now it may not always be this simple sometimes you may want to create multiple children on a parent control...in that case you d set up an itemscontrol set its panel to a grid say and modify the data templates to set the margin etc on each element to position them

21419050
int	double	int	chars
what i am trying to say in those lines of code is put this element whether it be a string int double or chars into this slot of the array

profiling	debugging
the answer there references a handy nuget package which once added and referenced in your app enables a simple check to see if it was compiled with the debugging profiling

21419112
int	chars
one way to do it would be to allocate an array with 256 int i assume that the chars are utf-8 to fill it with zeros and then to go through the string and increment the int on the array positions corresponding to the int value of the chars

21419112
int	chars
an other approach would be to use a chars to int hashtable and to store a number for each encountered chars

21419140
int	boolean
in contrast each side of the bitwise operator is an int as is the result which is then implicitly cast to boolean before being evaluated by the conditional

21419145
width	height
i would make the li be position relative and have width and height of the image

21419206
stdout	stderr
more specifically i would like to read from the stdout and stderr streams of a subprocess without creating one thread per stream and it seems this is the only way to do it in pure java

21419213
stdout	stderr
you may also want to provide file s for stderr and stdout and possibly a control path using stdin

21419238
getter	setter
the problem is that you must start with a barebones dto declare your members to only match the columns in the database then create exact setter and getter for those members

21419242
int	chars
initialize an array of int that represent the int value of a chars for example the int value of f is 102 which is its ascii value

21419361
g++	gcc
i did something to the configuration that made it start giving the above error actually two errors for gcc and g++ both

21419457
int	chars
hashmap will require 3 extra objects for each entry an entry a chars and an int

21419488

attr_accessor is shorthand for defining getter and setter so the closest i can think of to making a column_names method for this class without constructing any additional scaffolding is this

21445945
getter	setter
you call instance_methods to get the getter and setter then you reject the setter

21446001

the one way to do this goes as follows we create class inherited from qitemdelegate normally simple qitemdelegate is responsible for drawing qcombobox items

21446953
qitemdelegate	qstyle
basically we re just using normal paint function function but pretend that all the items don t have qstyle state_selected which is being checked in several functions inside qitemdelegate paint most importantly in drawbackground which is sadly not virtual

classname	inherited
and if you find yourself in a position where you need to override one to compose an inherited class then you either have the option of composing a new classname which now might not be 100 semantic generic .big-green-subtitle but is still 100 self-contained for those moments where you want your special-cases to feel loved too.

uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i ve created a uitabbarcontroller with multiple uiviewcontroller to act as its tabs

21447080
uinavigationbar	uitabbarcontroller
i would also like to display a constant uinavigationbar within this uitabbarcontroller that will persist across tabs

21447080
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
since none of the child view controllers for the uitabbarcontroller are uinavigationcontroller i m hoping this is possible and won t cause a conflict

21447080
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in the image below i have a uitabbarcontroller that is presented modally with four uiviewcontroller s as children

21447080
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
since each child view controller is a single view it seems unnecessary to embed each one in its own uinavigationcontroller for the sake of getting the uinavigationbar to appear

21447082
google-chrome	safari
the html5 details summary tags seem to work fine in terms of structure despite only working in google-chrome and safari

21447088
hide	show
so rather than animating your top value to show hide the footer i would instead put your footer inside of a wrapper and animate the height value for that wrapper

21447090
client-side	server-side
i already have an entirely client-side solution and additional server-side processing in context is extremely awkward so i strongly prefer client-only answers

21447096
int	chars
here is a code sample that creates a string of base31 chars from a 64-bit int

21447110
google-chrome	safari
why are google-chrome and safari behaving strange

21447110
margin	height
i tried like everything resetting border margin and padding to 0 even line height

21447112
int	chars
you can always use a map chars int to track the same information it ll just be slower

21447115
range	minimum
as you can see it returns the minimum int from a list of ints generated using the function in the range 1 x n however i would like this list comprehension to return the minimum tuple as follows

21447116
width	height
if you loaded a json payload of information about each image and used document.body.getboundingclientrect .width then you could use the body s width or your container s and the metadata about the image to reserve that much height

21447155
ssl	https
also i know here req should be https or ssl instead of http

21447163
put	get

uiview	calayer
make your dot by creating a uiview configured to draw the way you want - look into calayer and setting dotview.layer.cornerradius to make it be round alternately you can make a uiview subclass that overrides drawrect to make the right coregraphics calls to draw what you want

21447443
content-disposition	content-type
you may need content-disposition header for file name and content-type to let browser offer download instead of trying to open directly

21447452
division	addition
however all the foodentries for each document need to be able potentially but not necessarily to be subdivided by day as this is a natural division for which logic and calculations must be able to be performed in addition to doing them for the whole document

21447455
google-chrome	firefox
here is a reproducible code sample tested in google-chrome 32 firefox 26 - however some users are reporting that it does not work for them

finally fi we would like to find some parent based on their children we can use in this scenario subqueries 15.8

21447581
width	height
you can just use the box function to draw a border around the edge of your window you don t need to know the height and width to do it

21447618
google-chrome	firefox
anyway the website is up because i checked in google-chrome and firefox and it s up and working

21447704
equals	gethashcode
to have it working correctly you need all sorts of equals and gethashcode to match above behavior

21447710
for-loop	loops
ultimately if the structure of a loops is more expensive than the operations within loops and the tiny performance overhead from loops is actually significant then you might have a case for-loop unrolling

21447715
post	get
other way is to get http post information from the source page

21447715
textarea	textbox
in the source page include a form element that contains html elements such as input or textarea or asp.net server controls such as textbox or dropdownlist controls that post values when the form is submitted

21447735
stateless	stateful
effectively the first session is emulating the stateless session but retaining all the features of a stateful session until the objects are detached

21447749
pickle	dill
use dill and pathos.multiprocessing instead of pickle and multiprocessing

21447770
int	chars
i don t think i could convert the whole chars array to an int because it has not only int in the line and i don t really know what to do i am stuck

21447779
folder	directory
then go through a specific directory within the account folder that have a time stamp naming convention i.e 123456789 jan_29_2013_453pm

21447779
next	except
next all folder structures are the same for all account folders except the time stamped folder under the root i.e 123456789 jan_29_2013_453pm data

21447779
folder	directory
other account directory that have more than one media folder need to run a test against the log for success or fail and depending on the string to move a single file from all other media media2 media3 media4 etc. folder over to media1 unless failure is read in the log

21447779
folder	directory
the hard part i see is being able to get through the time stamped folder in order to get to the data directory

21447810
ienumerable	ilist
i don t believe the implicit cast to ienumerable or ilist does this

21447810
ienumerable	iqueryable
from the reading that i ve done it seems to be best to simply present to the controller a list of objects that it needs versus an ienumerable or iqueryable

21447810
ienumerable	ilist
therefore i think it would be better to instead of returning an ienumerable to return an ilist instead

21447810
ilist	iqueryable	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	iqueryable
i apologize in advance if this is not clear or there is already an answer but i have been searching and reading the other posts ienumerable vs iqueryable vs ilist but i still do not understand this particular issue

comparator	comparable
as you don t pass comparator someclass should implement comparable interface i.e

21448895
width	height
if you have a binary tree of depth d it can have at most 2 d leaves so your binary tree with n leaves must have height at least log n - so the original network from which it was derived includes paths of length at least log n so if it looks remotely like a network with rectangular layout like benes it must have width at least log n

21448906
submit	submission
however in some cases you need to use closest to get form for example if you write a universal function for validating every password input in every form in this case you don t like to get forms by ids and search for its childes passwordfields to prevent auto submission so i guess the guy who wrote the code is doing this a function which validates passwords before submit

int	chars
because of this the type of the expression char1 + char2 assuming char1 and char2 are both of type chars is not chars as one might expect but is instead int

21453214
int	chars
because int is at least twice the size of chars on an octet-addressable machine this is a narrowing conversion and so fails

lagcalid has getter setter

21460301
mouseover	mouseout
you need this weird construct with the domversions of mouseover and mouseout because they constantly both fire while you re moving your cursor across the map

21460301
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseleave
only the mouseout event however fires when your mouseleave the map so checking for if no new mouseover event has fired since we last fired mouseout 100 milliseconds later is what you need to do to make sure we ve actually left the map when mouseout is fired

versioning	upgrade
it should upgrade all dependencies to the latest versioning available or the latest versioning allowed in pubspec.yaml see the pub package manager docs

21460845
versioning	upgrade
but if it jumps only over one new versioning per upgrade try to fill in the bug

21460909
pop-up	dialog
add it to your sheet and it will automatically pop-up assign macro dialog

21460916

the downside to this is there seems to be a multitude of libraries microsoft kinect open kinect openni openframeworks etc.. and i m struggling to get my head around which one would be best for my use

21460969
udp	tcp
the decision of udp vs tcp depends on your messages whether or not they need to be reliably delivered etc

21460980
width	height
i d use the analogue way you re setting your height and width via getlayoutparams

21460986
udp	tcp
about tcp udp tcp is typically slower but more reliable so by default go for tcp but there might be reasons for choosing udp like streaming multicast broadcast .

21460995
for-loop	loops
if you want to keep your writerobj.framerate fixed at 4 then you can replace your your while loops with a simpler for-loop

21460995
ceil	floor
ceil or floor could be used instead of round to guarantee that the the video is either always at least duration seconds long or always less than or equal to duration seconds respectively

21461022
kde	gnome
gnome or kde desktop

21461034
google-chrome	firefox
this worked for me in firefox and google-chrome

21461037
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on google-chrome firefox 26 and ie11 however in firefox 4 the header is triggered even when loading using ajax

21461097
google-chrome	firefox
this appends for ie 8 firefox and google-chrome

21461124
width	height
if you want to change its width and height attributes you have to do this like so

21461124
width	height
then when you inspect the element you will see its width and height attributes changed

21461124
width	height
it will not change its width and height permanently

21461143
put	get
it helped - it got me a put - not get

21461157
equals	gethashcode
or if you have equals and gethashcode overridden on latestnewscategory type then you can simply

21461197
width	height
retrieving create an object defining each sprite s x y width height and save the objects in an array

21461216
min	max
changing max for min for the other.

21461251
onmousedown	onmouseup
i think you ll want add the onmouseup event handler inside the onmousedown handler

21461251
mousemove	mouseup
the mousemove event fires something like 50 times per second in some browsers so you repeatedly add and remove the mouseup down events

21461252
ceil	floor
then you can use math function like round floor ceil it depends of what you want and find the string corresponding to your pattern

21461274
minimum	max	min	max
the min parameter is the inclusive minimum as one would expect but the max parameter is the exclusive maximum as one would not expect

21461274
min	max
in other words if you pass min 1 and max 5 then your random numbers would be any of 1 2 3 or 4 but it would never include 5

21461274
min	max
2 when min max + 1

21461274
min	max
when min 10 and max 5 then the next function throws an error

21461274
min	max
or consider when min 5 and max 4

21461274
min	max
so it really is not an exclusive max when the max the min

21461274
min	max
but when max min for the random.next function then it throws an argumentoutofrangeexception

21461274
min	max
you may want to simply swap the numbers when min max so no error is thrown but it totally depends on what is desired

21461274
minimum	max
if you want an error on invalid values then it is probably better to also throw the error when microsoft s exclusive maximum max + 1 in our code equals minimum where ms fails to error in this case

21461298
mousemove	mouseup
also you re making excessive calculations by computing dist in the mousemove event it shouldn t be calculated until mouseup

21461320
gtk	xlib

it is promoted to int chars and short are promoted to int when used as var-args

21461357
chown	sudo
one solution is after you re created your directory under the apache root directory to use sudo chown to change the ownership of that directory to your account

21461357
chown	sudo
or you can use sudo chown to change just the group ownership of the directory to some group you re a member of -- probably a group created for this purpose

21461383
int	chars
when you use while it is pointing to an int or long it takes only one chars a byte from the place cc is pointing to

21461383
int	chars
in variable argument lists which printf uses chars values are automatically promoted to int

21461406
int	chars
and in most cases chars is neither compatible to int nor long

21461412
lseek	posix
if you store the file descriptor backing the file - using fileno - on a posix bsd system you may be able to salvage something using async-safe functions write lseek flush fsync etc

21461746
mocha	sinon
i am trying to test an ember component with mocha and sinon

21461757
folder	directory
the solution is pretty simple i had to place the handlers in an app_code folder inside the virtual directory

21461802
int	double
i m considering round is a method that take a double number and int precition

21461803
width	height	width	margin	children	parent	margin	height

21461823
hid	keyboard
put your scanner in hid mode and it will behave like a bluetooth keyboard

21461831

21462013
button	checkbox
button is visible for all the rows but checkbox only shown for some row which fullfill my criteria

21462014
min	max
you would want to enhance it with various validations length of the segments array min max of each segment etc. -- this is why a library as suggested in the other answer may be a better way not to mention possibly being equipped to handle ipv6 which i simply ignore

21462037
phpmyadmin	adminer
if so restore it with phpmyadmin or adminer in your hosts cpanel

21462078

xlwt	xlutils
i wrote a small script in python using python-excel modules xlwt xlrd and xlutils

21462248

21462315
g++	gcc
the situation with gcc g++ is not so rosy

21462339
udp	tcp
for tcp port it was really simple but now i struggle with udp ports

21462352
vb6	vba
iirc you don t use the return keyword to return a function value in vb6 vba you assign the return value to the function s name

21462411
getter	setter
you can create a class that doesn t extends activity and have getter setter or whatever methods you need

21462424
width	height
it has a width height y top space or bottom space

21462425
getter	setter
this will prevent such errors in the future if someone adds a getter without a setter

21462473
maven	pom.xml
i still have a problem with eclipse because eclipse still indicates that my pom.xml has errors in it because the repository is unreachable but the maven build compile is working though eclipse so its a partial solution

21462670
getter	setter
the bean debugbean is simple just contains two variables label and value both string and its setter and getter

21462721

21462722
for-loop	loops
python offers an else statement for the for-loop that is executed if loops ends without being broken

21462733
hide	show
i want the functionality to hide and show the window of these exe programs using hwnd or suggest any other solution.

21462801

b protected member variables are generally frowned upon nearly as much as public ones

21463038
getter	setter
you should use protected getter setter and make the variables private

21463050

to get at your desired output i literally put the symbols in this order letters first so a 0 and 0 26

21463360
put	get
well it s best practice to put the jquery code into a separate js file but it seems like you d rather just get it to work so here s the quick and dirty way

21463389
put	get
i can get it to work but i don t want to put a switch statement in every overloaded operator function

21463425
public	protected
i actually consider it a helpful and good practice if the typedef is not exposed public or protected

21463432

from the api documentation you can get post note information as follows

21463486
google-chrome	firefox
everything works great for google-chrome firefox and ie8 ie9 and ie10

21463486
google-chrome	firefox
it works great in google-chrome and firefox but for some reason ie8 9 and 10 loses some of the css not all of it

21463530
integer	unsigned
that s an unsigned 32 bit integer and so strictly speaking your enum should use uint as its base type

21463555
min	max
assuming the requirement is to get the first min enroll date after the last max lapse date by client and program id then this should work

21463559
next	except
looks same as screenshot of trigger adding in the answer above except that its the first column shows methods in you forms script the next column reads from-form and in the third column you choose on submit

21463565
tabcontrol	tabitem
styles are of type tabcontrol so it can be applied on tabcontrol and not on tabitem

21463585
valgrind	memcheck
but when run on smaller instances valgrind memcheck reports our code as flawless so that reason seems unlikely as well on throwing instances valgrind itself runs out of memory so we cannot check that case directly

21463614
superclass	subclassing
i am new to java and i having problem with my code.i am trying to call a constructor of superclass from subclassing s constructor.although i can do it by super but i am trying to do with other method by making a object of superclass in subclassing s constructor that will call class a constructor

profiling	instrumentation
however after profiling with instrumentation i found that performance was slightly worse with hardware decoding enabled which i still can t explain.

21463716
post	get
you re making a post request but you want to fetch the data so you should be using a get

21463739
lodash	underscore.js
you should use underscore.js or lodash

21463755
post	get
you need to add both get and post methods to your view

21463763

21464040
unicorn	webrick
web server nginx with unicorn webrick for development environment

21464068
getter	setter
your bean class should contain a string field order with getter and setter of course

21464101
hash	md5
you better create a random hash like md5 time .rand 1000 9999 and

21464101
submit	submission
this way only users that submit the form from your domain will succeed submission

21464107
move	drag
i have a user control that i want to move in runtime when i hold and drag it

21464140
post	get
you should use post method instead of get to avoid the password in the url

21464145
for-loop	loops
id like to know if there is a way to loops thru all of them with a for-loop like giving i to the end of the integer names like so

21464155
freebsd	debian	ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	debian
i ve reported it for what its worth to freebsd and to debian which should also apply to ubuntu

21464155
ubuntu	debian
i tested this by downloading the debian util-linux source package 1 and then compiled it on an ubuntu system using the following commands starting in the directory in which i downloaded the tarball

21464163
xlib	xcb
good old xlib and xcb

21464163
xlib	xcb
so you really need the simplest possible xlib or xcb code to create a window for your application and use glx to render onto that window s surface

21464202
plone	buildout
run buildout and start plone

21464228
hide	show
so question is how to hide show row depending on input data and selected option assuming that input data refer to column value

21464254
strlen	strncpy
there is issue with strncpy when string length what strlen returns and excluding 0 terminator where b points to is equal or longer than size of name - it will not put 0 terminator into target string

21464372
google-chrome	firefox
firefox has similar tools as does ie but i m most familiar with google-chrome

21464376

if i comment out in the extension the compiler says it can t find _title in the first line of the setter and wherever it occurs in the getter

21464424
express	node.js
i am using node.js with express for a special webserver

21464444
width	height
moreover i would like to use width and height obtained in graph1.json.php to be set in update-anim.html

21464447
width	height
instead cuz your total element s height and width sums up to 108px counting border on both the sides

21464447
box-sizing	border-box
if you want to stick with the 50px measurement than you can alter the box model rendering by using box-sizing border-box

21464489
division	subtraction
this is not an issue with operations that commute but for non-commutative operations like division or subtraction this fact is crucial to the analysis of a statement

21464509
width	height
for a circle shape using css you should specify the same width as height like you did but you should always use 50 on your border radius

21464509
width	height
this is because when specifying a width and height it will not be including the padding and border widths

21464509
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome 4 and firefox 3.6 are the last versions to need these prefixes and those really lack any browser usage share at all

21464510
for-loop	loops
the way the for-loop works is in the brackets the first variable is where loops starts x 0 the second variable is the condition x 10 and the third is what to do for each loops x++

21464548
hide	show
i am binding an onclick event in the document.ready function to an image and i want it to first hide the modalpopupextender that it should show and then execute a new function that show a dialog

21464548
google-chrome	firefox
the functionality works fine in ie but doesn t in firefox or google-chrome

21464610
getter	setter
i can of course do that in setter and getter

21464610
getter	setter
however if i want to attach the same behavior to multiple attributes i d have to explicitly define the same setter and getter for every one of them

21464623
setinterval	settimeout
as a general rule most javascript methods are synchronous as there is only one thread with a few exceptions like xmlhttprequest setinterval settimeout workers etc

21464635
getter	setter
if you declare a property and then override both the getter and setter it won t auto-synthesize the property

21464643
prepare	execute
the result a test which is prepare for this environment and ready to be execute

21464645
getter	setter
when you override the setter and getter not just the getter xcode assumes you want complete control and doesn t create the backing store the _title

21464650
min	max
then i would add min id to see if its any faster than max id

21464662
hide	show
when i open the table all rows that must be hidden are being show and if i click on any main row it will hide that rows

21464674
google-chrome	firefox

21464674
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly fine in google-chrome with html5 but in firefox the flash fallback works once then breaks

21464674
google-chrome	firefox
i tested in google-chrome and it works but firefox does not

21464706
implements	extends

21464709
acs	adfs
now that i explained my configuration i intend to have windows identity foundation wif to allow authentications from both acs 2.0 and adfs

21464744
getter	setter	accessor	properties
if you implement a getter and a setter for a read-write properties or a getter for a read-only properties then clang xcode will not synthesise the backing instance variable - see apple s encapuslating data note in the section you can implement custom accessor methods

21464744
getter	setter
you are implementing both the setter and the getter so you must provide your own instance variable if needed

21464777
post	get
the problem is that when validation fails and post to the controller the drop down values are lost and i get an error

21464812
background-image	background-color
if you use styles that ie8 recognizes like background-color or using an actual image for the background-image then it will be styled in ie8 as well

21464814
post	get
i m trying to post events into a cherrypy small app which responds to get post but when trying it with angularjs it simply not posting a thing

21464823
for-loop	arrays
i populate the 2d arrays with the standard double for-loop methodology

21464851

i ll post the entire code but i want to point out this is the code that makes the disabling work and the code that i can comment out and get the update and cancel functions to work again

21464927
screens	tablet
configured to take care about tablet screens optimization as well

21464954
hash	salt
current consideration on the ios app and wordpress create a hash of user id + password + salt or something of that ilk

21464970
gesturedetector	motionevent
check out a snippet from the ontouchevent motionevent in gesturedetector

21464980
hide	show
the solution is create nsmutablearray and in didselectcellatindexpath method add or remove the indexpath for that cell to the array and in cellforrowatindexpath check this array and show hide checkmark base on that table

21465004
client-side	server-side

d3.js	leaflet
for the sake of simplicity my goal at the moment is to use d3.js to create a svg within each leaflet popup div and draw a square

21465089
d3.js	leaflet
i have found some examples where people have used d3.js to create graphs inside leaflet popups but none of them were also using geojson and the oneachfeature function

21465089
d3.js	leaflet
if anyone has any experience using d3.js leaflet and geojson together and could explain to me how to get my square to show in the popups or if anyone knows of a source that could help me

21465089

stdout	stderr
that is to say stdout and stderr should appear the same as if they had not run through my command

21465297
stdout	stderr
to do this i m trying to redirect stdout and stderr separately to two different tees each for a different file and then recombine them so that they still appear on stdout and stderr respectively

21465297
stdout	stderr
my attempts are successfully splitting the output into the right files but the streams are not correctly retained for actual stdout stderr output

21465297
stdout	stderr
i see this in a more complicated setting so i created simplified commands where i echoed data to stdout or stderr as my command as shown below

21465297
stdout	stderr
i am echoing to stderr so i expect to see nothing when i redirect the final stderr to dev null and my original echo when i only redirect stdout

21465297
stdout	stderr
in the case of the first command i suspect that this is because i am combining stdout and stderr before i pipe it to the second tee but if this were the case i would expect to see both stdout and stderr in the tee2.txt file which i don t - i only see stderr

21467066
inherited	properties
although your approach of using the self.myview properties may be preferred anyway it allows you to change up the view hierarchy in the future without changing your interface and doesn t muck with inherited methods

21467066

for example the md5 hash of hello is

21467857
hash	md5
the md5 hash of a file s contents does not know or care whether it is encrypted or not it just reads bytes from the disk

21467857
hash	md5
since the bytes are different between plaintext and encrypted the md5 hash will be different

21467971
google-chrome	firefox
update actually it seems that the delay happens in internet explorer too as well as firefox and google-chrome

it s working with both firefox and safari but not with mobile safari

21468147
sorting	grouping
in my case the sorting of a grouping column was screwed because of the grouping data pop up

21468160
keydown	keyup
if the keydown and keyup events come close enough together they ll be handled one after the other and the global up variable won t ever get seen as true by the rest of your program

21468182
int	double
when you cast the result to int before assigning it to the -7 in double is converted to -7 in int

21468182

then this int is converted to an unsigned chars

21468189

#hola .addclass max min

21468208
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the space removed is causing an error in google-chrome firefox and safari

21468271
for-loop	loops
to be clearer - you wont need a for-loop at all as long as you are extending a baseadapter somewhere in the heirarchy loops will be automatic

21468283
avr	microcontroller
i ran across unexpected behaviour while programming in c for an 8-bit avr microcontroller

21468308

can anyone help me make this code draw each image 64 pixels the width and height of the images apart

21468468
factors	mean
i then performed functions to the split data mean by another factors and hence i cannot perform unsplit any more because my original data frame is of different length now

21468475
hide	show
initially show you loading image then hide it with a line of js

21468497
width	height
as for how to figure out the width and height of a svg sized by css you use window.getcomputedstyle to get the actual pixel length that s being used

21468497
width	height
on the svg -- there s a firefox bug that gives unprocessed width and height values on inline svg

21468615
folder	directory
it runs grunt and generates a dist folder within the solution directory and msbuild then copy those files to

21468615
bower	npm
note technically to run grunt successfully i need to run npm install and bower install so kudos if the answer also covers grunt packages and bower packages

21468645
min	max
i tried grouping by staffid and date fields and getting the min of begintime and max of endtime but that does not account for the non-overlapping time frames

21468654
firefox	safari
this was reproduced consistently with both firefox and safari at their latest versions

21468661
comparator	comparable
the treeset class will use the fact that it s comparable or alternatively a comparator to order items and determine if there s a duplicate

21468662
google-chrome	firefox
this is the unreal gaming engine running on it to have an idea of the type of performance takes a bit to load but runs very smoothly use firefox or google-chrome

21468662
google-chrome	firefox
if the browser like latest versions of google-chrome firefox detects asm.js you will have a near native performance

21468662
post	get
you can t get faster than that in a browser these days and it keeps getting faster see mozilla team blog post here

21468670
equals	compareto
if you want consistent behaviour with a hashset you would have to implement hashcode and equals as per the javadoc and in such a way as to be consistent with your compareto method

21468705
background-position	background-size
you would use background-size background-position in order to position the background

21468744
ubuntu	debian
it uses update-alternatives which is a debian tool and hence will be available in ubuntu to point to the oracle jre installation

21468748
hash	md5
if you create the exact same plaintext from the ciphertext which is the name for the encrypted plaintext and hash that then the md5 sum will be the same

21468748
hash	md5
note that the md5 hash function is broken

21468748
hash	md5
so it is very easy to create two programs that do different things but hash to the same md5 hash

21468786
cos	sin
i am new to the c++ language and am trying to create a program that will output all the values for sin cos and tangent

21468792

post	get
i have read that i have to change my method get to post

21468846
public	protected
public -- protected

21468863
hide	show
you could either handle the validation on the controller by checking if all your models have values or you could just show hide the elements instead of adding removing them

21468880
range	min
randint and randint3 both give a value in the range min to max+min

21468880
range	max	range	min	min	max
randint2 gives a value in the range min to max

21468880
range	max	range	min	min	max
randfloat gives a value in the range min to max as a float

21468880
range	min
randfloat2 is wrong and will always give a value in the range min to some really small number just above min

21468905
google-chrome	firefox
p.p.s browser requirements google-chrome firefox ie8+

21468908
ng-show	ng-hide
i am aware that use of ng-if dictates that ng-if destroys the scope on the element unlike the use of ng-show or ng-hide

21468930
inherited	properties	accessor	properties
the behavior you describe occurs because ib inherited ia both of them defining an item properties accessor

21468930
accessor	properties
therefore the b_from_a.ib.item properties accessor implementation has two slots available

21468930
accessor	properties
now if both ifoo and ibar were to have a member with the exact same signature as in your example an item properties accessor and you implemented the member only via foobar.ibar.item then a type inference ambiguity would necessarily arise because it would be undefined behavior whether foobar.ibar.item should implement ibar.item or ifoo.item

21468942
dictionary	map
there isn t typically a change key operation for dictionary hash map type data structures as they would essentially just remove and add the item again

21468948
children	parent
in tk children are clipped by their parent

21468967
hide	show
you call your javascript as regular and depending on whether the rendition is on the screen or the printer the css will handle the show hide of the header with logo

21468969
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works fine in firefox and safari but not in google-chrome the image just doesn t show up

21469132
folder	directory
create a layout-land directory under res folder and put the landscape version of your layout xml file in that directory

21469141
prepare	execute
the whole idea is that you prepare the statement outside the loop then inside the loop you only pass values to execute and once loop is completed you close the loop

21469145
folder	directory
i want to prevent php to access folder files above the website directory

21469152
draggable	droppable
they have actions called draggable and droppable which you apply to divs

21469156

using strdup in the getstr method instead of malloc also has the same effect while ditching both and just trying to return str without either causes random symbols to be printed out diamons and question marks

21469168
move	drag
if you uncheck that and try resizing a window you ll see that only the window frame move until you complete the drag operation and then the window repaints just once at the new size

int	chars
convert each chars to an int then do the addition

21469217
put	get
if you get a double digit then only put append the second digit and carry over the first digit to the next calculation

21469219
getter	setter
after all properties are just syntax sugar for getter setter methods.

21469219
accessor	properties
using accessor internally might be preferred if accessing a properties from within a class has the same semantics as accessing it from outside

21469219
accessor	properties
in addition accessor bring a consistent way to deal with regular and auto-implemented properties

21469219
accessor	properties
also outside of constructors almost for sure accessor should be used for virtual properties

21469231
int	chars
this line of code combines two chars into a int in a way that first chars is moved 8 bits

21469232
width	height
you can do this with css providing width and height of html body are set to 100 first

google-chrome	firefox
now when i using internet explorer 11 google-chrome 32 or firefox 26 i see the following behavior

21469350
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
while this works perfectly in google-chrome safari and firefox - it does not work in ie10 or ie11

21469381
portrait	landscape
correct way to have different designs for portrait and landscape in viewcontroller specific designs no resizing elements no autolayout with storyboards

21469410
min	max
in this case you might use a drop down list or html number input with min and max values

21469436
children	parent
i realized that i could get the same effect by removing the parent children spouse fields from the person model and setting the related_name to relationships on the relationship model

21469503
width	height
scaling works by multiplying the current value width height by the scale value

21469519
put	get
anyway when i put to search for i always get only results starts with that letter

21469570
interpolation	splines
in comparison to a previous implementation that was purely in python evaluating the c-code is so much faster than the splines interpolation that the evaluation of splines is the bottleneck in the ode function

21469582
int	chars
when you bit shift a unsigned chars chars byte by 8 you end up with 0 so you need to cast both and to an int so when you do the bit shift you end up with 768 00000011 00000000 now you | that with and you end up with

21469584
cpu	processors
for some reason any processors information counters in the script the ones with cpu in the name do not work

21469587
http	spdy
both will fall back to http 1.1 but are there browsers that support only spdy but not http 2.0 or vis versa

21469593

21469631
stdout	stderr
this example program uses the process async pipes and pipes-bytestring packages to execute an external command and write stdout and stderr to separate files while the command runs

21469631
stdout	stderr
and this is a variation that writes stdout and stderr interleaved to the same file

21469707

int	chars
i have a gridview with these columns comment 255 chars user name varchar 50 rating int 1 date yyyy-mm-dd

21469852
public	protected
the explicit defaulting of the copy constructor is not more readable in my opinion but you may want to explicitly default it if you do not want it to be public but protected or even private

21469859
gruntjs	package.json
important you ll need to include gruntjs and bower if you use it in your package.json file

21469862

i m a newbie to flask and sqlalchemy been working with django for the last 3 years

21469893
folder	dir
finally you ll probably need to reinstall node-canvas via npm so navigate to your node_modules folder and delete the canvas dir

21469903
polymorphism	name-hiding
if you pay attention in your class designing to potential name-hiding problems and just use polymorphism to customize the behavior of functions you actually want to be different and that can be cast-controlled then a clean hierarchy as could eventually solve your problems

21469909
post	get
i have a user that has already been authenticated and authorized in my application but for the life of me i can t figure out how to get the company pages he can post to so that he can share updates to his pages from within my application

21469981
profiling	benchmarking
i would expect sql to be faster overall - although the only way to know for certain is to create a performance benchmarking profiling under actual usage conditions - because even with a full table scan less data must be transmitted and the php method doesn t sound like it would use an ingenious solution

21469986
children	parent
i cant seem to get the child to read the parentscope according to angular documentation children accesible methods should be defined inside the controller of the parent directive

21469994
webclient	webrequest
i ve tried various webclient webrequest webresponse attempts just can t quite get it to work

21469995

one useful approach for the python community is to use ipython as interactive shell it works really nice with pandas matplotlib numpy and scipy

21470064
portrait	landscape
one tab is for controller with portrait and another is for controller in landscape mode

21470064
portrait	landscape
assure that container view is resizable to fulfil the parent view in both cases landscape and portrait

21470140
pandas	patsy
not entirely sure if this is what you mean butâ using pandas statsmodels and patsy we can compare an ordinary least-squares fit and a weighted least-squares fit which uses the inverse of the noise you provided as a weight matrix statsmodels will complain about sample sizes 20 by the way

21470193
versioning	upgrade
his fix was the upgrade to lion but i am already on the latest versioning of mavericks so this is not a viable solution for me

21470199
udp	tcp
in this particular case i would rather use udpclient.client.receivetimeout and tcpclient.receivetimeout to time out a udp or tcp receive operation gracefully

21470200
hash	salt
the token would be hash and salt salt + user_id + time delivered

21470236
svg	vml
for instance processing them as svg to canvas or svg to vml as cufon does will force users to do some work if they want to steal it but there are plenty of svg- tff converters out there

21470287
getter	setter
your private member is not being initialized correctly because your setter and getter are wrong

21470294
int	double
your nummines calculation will always return 0 because when you cast a double that is less than 1 to an int it will be set to 0 which means that the statement in your while loop will only be run a single time hence only a single mine being placed

21470315
codeblocks	mingw-w64
edit1 i m using codeblocks ide with mingw-w64 x64-4.8.1-posix-seh-rev5 as the compiler

21470435
fadein	fadeout
and there is a next button to fadeout the current div and fadein the next one

21470437
children	parent
this is because their parent is a linearlayout which arranges it s children one below the other vertically y-axis non-overlaping as in a roll of toiler paper where each view is a paper square

21470437
children	parent
if you wanted the child framelayout and linearlayout to be on top of the other z-axis their parent would have to be a framelayout which arranges it s children one on top of the other overlaping in the z-axis as in a stack of paper sheets

21470454
unix	bsd
there is something i am wanting to know if there is a way to do on unix and unixlike systems such as bsd gnu linux etcetera

i only have this problem on ie i use ie8 but google-chrome and firefox both render the page as i expect correctly

21470499
initializer	class-method
this allows both viewcontroller classes to access a shared data store also if you use class-method you don t even need to initializer the utility class

21470503
filtering	grouping
be careful to read the documentation for dimension.group carefully as it contains a gotcha where the filtering on the dimension being grouping won t be applied

21470503
filtering	grouping
to work around this you may need to actually define 2 dimensions that are identical and use one for filtering and the other for grouping

21470516
post	get
i ve seen a few post on here with similar issues but i can t seem to get this solved

21470547

21470547
stdout	fflush
the issue is that the first print doesn t trigger a fflush of stdout a much better explanation from a couple years ago can be found here so you have to a do it manually as below or b use ipython -u for unbuffered output which i haven t tried

21470559

21470632
int	chars
i m not sure if undelimited is the right term but i want to break it up by the boundaries of int and non-integers rather than splitting it by whitespace or another delimiting chars

21470634
cout	cin
specifically i can t perform cout or cin and the lines #include iostream and using namespace std are errors according to the program

21470644
getter	setter
create setter and getter and pass the values would be a better way to do it

21470649
pop-up	dialog
i am trying to create an interactive installer in sugarcrm where the pre_execute.php script called from the manifest.php file uses javascript to pop-up a confirm dialog and from there i feed the php script via form with the answer in order to maker decisions on what the script should do

21470649
pop-up	dialog
i have the sample pre_execute.php script working when it is not being called from the manifest file with the result of the pop-up dialog being properly reflected in the action the script takes after the user response

21470649
pop-up	dialog
i have the javascript pop-up confirm box being presented when the script is being called from the manifest file during installation but the result of the pop-up dialog are not being reflected in the action the script takes after the user response

21470649
pop-up	dialog
and if i include a pop-up dialog in a script called from the manifest file the module installation finishes and the page with display log appears for a brief second but is then replaced by a screen that shows only the following error message

you could extend this if you wanted to just add remove disabled on the button based on the checkbox status

21470803
stdout	stderr
these are redirect commands used in a bourne shell not javascript that i know of to send the stdout or stderr to a designated not-normal place

21470805
post	get
if you want to send complex data structures to your controller you need to do a post with the json as the request body for instance - although you can use get for array data but not the way you are doing it here - each row needs to have a separate request param pf24values one and pf24values two etc - there are a few ways to do this

21470837

what i attempt to do is create a for-loop which cycles for the length of the arrays

21471116
for-loop	arrays
my objective is to begin the for-loop play the first video in the arrays wait for end of video then continue with for-loop with next element in the arrays

21471116
for-loop	arrays
what currently happens is the for-loop cycles through the entire arrays and only plays the last video

21471141
geany	sublimetext
like mikko i also decided that due to the limitations of the shell add-ons for sublimetext to stick with a real terminal window - i ve got too used to the f2-f4 workflow of geany

21471153
button	checkbox
i understand you mentioned a timer in your question but you can simplify the code by adding the disabled attr on button and enable it only when the checkbox is checked

21471153
button	checkbox
the current code only activates the button when the checkbox is checked

21471155
hide	show
the following code show related posts by tags i want to hide it if there are no tags

do both use a focuslistener and actionlistener which simply calls a method that validates the state of each field to determine if you have enough information to perform the required calculations

21471359
getter	setter
i stumbled across the below example of using getter and setter in a different question

21471359
getter	setter
since python has implicit getter and setter i wonder what the reason is to define them explicitly as below

21471364

21471411
floating-point	integer
what happens in case of overflow in a conversion from a floating-point value to an integer value is not defined by the c standard compilers can choose to do whatever they want

21471411
floating-point	integer
conjecture #3 in pelles c when a floating-point value is converted to an integer type it is wrapped modulo the size of the type like what happens when converting to a smaller integer type

21471411
floating-point	integer
note that your program may report some numbers as prime if their largest prime factor is very close to their square root if the number is the square of a prime because the conversion of number to a floating-point value may round it down so trsq may end up being less than the square root even less than the largest integer that is smaller than the square root

gedit	nano
gedit .bash_profile could also be edited for individual path it comes by default with every gnome installation in case you don t have nano

21471451
getter	setter
getter and setter are pointless if they are doing nothing more than adding overhead

21471451
getter	setter
the nice thing about the way python ties getter and setter to properties is that you can easily change an attribute into a property without having to go and refactor all the code that uses the class

21471496
portrait	landscape
if you want to present the same data differently based on whether a device is in a portrait or landscape orientation the way to do so is using two separate view controllers

21471849
multiplying	subtract
you seem to have gotten the value 218.75 from dividing half the screen 500px by 16 and then multiplying by 9 which gives 281.25 and then subtract from 500

21471849
range	max
then do something similar for your y values - take the max range you want divide it by 999 and use that as your increment to determine the correct pixel height based on your function value

21471882
rss	feed
if you d like rss feed according to section can be a publicly facing feature

21471906
children	parent
another benefit to not miss is that you can put common columns between the two tables into the parent table instead of repeated in the children

21471948
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works great in firefox google-chrome and ie but not on w7 safari 5.1.7

21471961
coalesce	isnull
you will find that if your data sets become large having to put a coalesce or isnull in there will hurt performance in a significant way

21471963

21474495
uilabel	uibutton
ps if it were a uilabel then go with uilongpressgesturerecognizer but for a uibutton it won t be ideal because you ll have to drop the implementation of the method connected to the button s uicontroleventtouchupinside and instead make the method connected to the uilongpressgesturerecognizer as the main button method it feels kinda dirty

21474504
width	height
the approach that ll give you the most consistent result across mail clients is to use empty table cells as padding i know the horror but remember to fill those tables with a blank image of the desired dimensions because you guessed it some versions of outlook don t respect height width declarations of empty cells

button	checkbox
note i want to hide the checkbox where rowid of button matches with the rowid of a checkbox

21474748
addition	multiplication
i have one program having matrix multiplication code and another program having both matrix multiplication same as first program and addition program

21474772
children	parent
as a rule of thumb one should never retain nodes in objects that are not nodes themselves and never retain any parent or sibling nodes only children or grandchildren nodes

21474803
filtering	grouping
you already filtering it an grouping

21474808
superclass	subclassing

if oncreate is not getting called then try to update the text on onresume or onnewintent method

21474876
addition	multiplication
lastly code that deals with byte conversions usually doesn t use the arithmetic operations of multiplication and addition but is uses so-called bit-wise operators

21474898
post	get
and get it back in the post method of with modela tempdata modela

21474988
portrait	landscape
so mental note even though your app will show only landscape layouts you must provide portrait xmls in the layout folder

21474996
post	put
any time a user make a reply for any post i want to put that post at the top of the wall

21474996

if single form with different operations like state change on button click then you can show hide group view

21475286
multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
in the way of arithmetic i currently have unsigned add subtract multiplying and divide

21475286
subtraction	multiplication	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
and what about for the other three operations subtraction multiplication division

21475319
subtract	add
add and subtract are the same for signed and unsigned 2s complement assuming you re going to handle overflow underflow in the normal way for most cpus just wrap around

21475319
multiplying	subtraction	multiplying	addition	subtraction	addition
so you only need one addition routine and one subtraction routine regardless of signedness but you need separate signed and unsigned multiplying and divide

21475323

my rest post is successful as i get a valid response from server

21475615
inherited	properties
you are correct about sharing properties as the child controller will inherited its properties for the parent controller

21475615
inherited	properties
however i would try to make it blindingly obvious in the code that specificcontroller does indeed inherited from globalcontroller in order to avoid collisions of data properties

21475621
children	parent
your children relationship should be on menu component and the inverse of the parent relationship

21475630

by convention getter and setter are expected to return almost immediately

21475651

21475774
subtraction	modulo	division	subtraction	division	modulo
i am a bit suspicious of the performance because modulo tends to use division which is slower than your subtraction operations

21475780
ubuntu	linux
such qmake project .pro code successfully work under ubuntu linux but under windows 8 it don t

21475786
int	chars
int data types short int long etc. are significantly faster than chars data types chars varchar etc.

21475786
int	chars
so avoid using chars data types for int data

floating-point	integer
this works both in integer and floating-point coordinates but mind overflows

21475931
sequence	permutation
it seems that you can represent a permutation combination by a sequence of 0 s and 1 s where each number tells from which string to take next character like this

21476003
min	max
why does type number not work for me also i get a problem with min and max attributes

21476053
post	put
i am returning the updated object on post s put s etc

21476070
free	malloc
the fact that malloc and free aren t supported just means that you re free to provide your own implementation and they won t collide with existing definitions

21476070
free	malloc
so what s probably the best solution is to provide your own simple malloc free and write your own string class on top of that

21476080
width	height
if you don t know the width or height of the div you can use this css3 code

21476081

basically as the question describes i need to get post data in joomla 2.5 3.xx and i want it through the jinput the new talk of the town

21476124
freetype	libpng

21476129
width	height
all positions and width height should be defined as float or double from 0 to 1

21476167
processors	hyperthreading
basically the only number above that makes any sense to me is the 8 in using up to 8 threads because i have a quad-core processors with hyperthreading therefore i can run 8 threads

21476192
width	height
if you want the buttons to be of equal size why don t you just use weight 1 with 0dp width or height for each button instead of weightsum with container layout

21476195
calendar	gcal
check the calendar and it has colored the backgrounds of 26th 27th 28th march - so the final effect is that it has shifted my whole original gcal event forward by one day and in relation to the json it has the correct end date but the wrong start date

21476203
for-loop	arrays
i often come across cases where i want to use an enchanced for-loop for some collection or arrays that i get from some object

21476221
post	put
so for sending the id you will need to put it in a hidden field and it will automatically be sent on post

21476314
box-sizing	margin	box-sizing	border-box	margin	border-box
if you set your element s box-sizing property to border-box you can then give it 25px padding at the bottom then allow the 25px bar to sit on top by also giving it a negative 25px margin

21476336
width	height
the containers themselves are flexible in width height

21476380

we all agree that nsnull null is useful as a placeholder where an object is required as elaborated above

21484617
fortran	ada
ada and fortran or fortran depending on the vintage

21484621
min	max
step 2 now we want to replace the value column with min and max columns

21484670
junit	testng
only test methods annotated with test in junit or testng support mock parameters so the only choice here is to declare a mock field at the test class level

21484699
carrierwave	minimagick
there is also a gem minimagick which will give you similar functionality within carrierwave as rmagick and i ve found it to use less of a memory footprint

21484754
post	get
i m trying to parse a reddit json file to get titles of the post however when i use this code

21484756
google-chrome	firefox
wish it worked in firefox or google-chrome but only ie

then in the cron file which schedules jobs using the syntax that you can read more about on wikipedia enter that line

21484896
width	height
transform translate - width 2 - height 2 combined with scale which does the same but from a different starting position

21484922
implements	extends	inject	interceptor
at runtime castle will make this interceptor either extends your concrete class or implements a common interface - this means you ll be able to inject the interceptor into any piece of code that targets the intercepted class

21484932
mdpi	hdpi
on mdpi hdpi devices the vm in which your app run will only have a smaller amount of heap memory available and you might run into out of memory exceptions much more frequently if you only load high quality images

21484932
mdpi	hdpi
the quality of the image might not be as good on mdpi hdpi devices because of the resizing

21484964
width	height
when i m at full width in foundation i use the large-12 class and the small-12 class for smaller viewports however i have that nav div inside of another parent div so when i get to small viewport the navigation drops below the height of the parent div

21484994
stateless	stateful
i think it has to do with the fact that the sessionscoped annotation is meant to be used only in a web context otherwise like in your your second case it doesn t make sense and you should assume that it will be ignored and your stateful ejb will behave like an old regular stateful ejb and in general you shouldn t inject stateful resources into stateless ones because usually the results are unpredictable and dependent on the container implementation

21484994
stateless	stateful
however you shouldn t even rely on the fact that there s only one servlet instance since in fact many containers use servlet pooling to increase performance on the other hand when you look up or inject a stateful ejb into a stateless component it s your responsibility to take care of the scope of that particular instance so that it can work as it s supposed to in this case since you don t have control over the instantiation of your servlet instances neither you have it over your ejb instances

21485067
division	multiplication
i haven t tried a multiplication division example but i m guessing it would work too

21485107
put	get
you could get more detailed if you wanted and define the format earlier and only put out relevant info such as if days 0 exclude that from the date format

21485122
jpql	hql
jpql or hql

21485124
post	get
but you could also simply return at the beginning if you don t want any get post parameters displayed

21485136
versioning	upgrade
json_unescaped_unicode was added in php 5.4 so it looks like you need upgrade your versioning of php to take advantage of it

21485137
getter	setter
and have appropriate getter and setter for the fields you want access to

21485138
versioning	upgrade
here is how you then launch the google play intent and take them to your new versioning in the store after prompting the user that they must upgrade

21485163
uicollectionview	uitableview
i need to have a uicollectionview a uitableview then another uicollectionview with a different format

put	get	post	get	post	put
curl -x post roles -d name nameforrole title titleforrole permission get put post delete users me

21485233
width	height
then i need to set the width height of the scrollview programically

21485255
integer	unsigned
the hexadecimal values its just a notation the first letter represents the first 4 bits of your int and the other the other four bits because you are declaring a const uint8 variable wich means an unsigned integer of 8 bits this is an integer but without sign the bit of the sign is removed so it can store 2 8 posibles values

21485267
macbook	isight
my development machine is a macbook pro using the internal isight camera

21485273
fgetcsv	splfileobject
here is a modified example from the splfileobject fgetcsv documentation that might simplify your code enough to isolate what might be giving you issues

21485278
portrait	landscape
this works fine and is centred in the viewport when opened but when i tilt the phone to landscape i call a resize function but it doesn t seem to work properly as the newly resized image is off centre in the viewport this is then repeated when the phone is returned to portrait mode

21485326
express	node.js
i have created a web app with node.js express and angular.js in the past

21485328
post	get
most users could also use merge i ll post an example of that when i get time

21485339
move	drag
so far the brush is created and the user can move and drag it but the bars in the main chart are re-drawn oddly and the x axis is not updated at all

21485342
integer	unsigned
...an unsigned integer type with the property that any

21485342
int	chars
a 32-bit int is not a compatible type with chars

21485342
integer	unsigned
therefore if the array started on a non-4-byte-aligned location accessing it with the aliasing unsigned integer pointer could cause a hardware exception for example

21485360
pull	push
in our case we had to pull data from the back end in some cases which meant a user might tap something and then there d be a slight delay before the nav push occurred

21485363
portrait	landscape
the transfers we received for a recent design were to small as i m guessing they were printed portrait instead of landscape

21485364
post	get
want to use both get and post methods

21485507
uilabel	uibutton
in some views i need to add some uibutton but also some uiimage for the logo that is not centered or some uilabel

21485507
uilabel	uibutton
but i don t really like this method because if i ever have to add a uibutton or just change the text of the uilabel i need to change manually the origin of each uilabel and each uiimage

21485566
versioning	upgrade
it s not a supported approach and may break in the future if you upgrade to a newer versioning of tfs but if you only want to read the data you can go directly to the sql database for your tfs server

21485632
hide	show
set it to sw_hide initially and set the dwflags member to startf_useshowwindow then you can use showwindow to show hide the console window when needed

21485653
ubuntu	centos
my system is a tomcat 7 server running on ubuntu talking to a mongodb cluster running in centos

21485702
post	get
how can i get row post request data from client using fastcgi++ library and show it on web page

21485721
pull	push
some stuff is annoying but i guess they try to push or pull people toward different practices

21485728
hide	show
once you have the hwnd s you can use showwindow to show hide them as needed

21485729
lisp	scheme
there may be semantic differences between mathematica and lisp scheme clojure but mathematica s syntax is a demonstration that you can move the left parenthesis over by one atom and still interpret it sensibly build code with macros etc

21485731
hex	binary
the reason hexadecimal is used is because there is a direct mapping of single hexadecimal digit to exactly four binary digits so hex is a compact way of representing bit patterns

21485731
hex	binary
the hex digit to binary pattern conversion is as follows

21485780
16-bit	64bit
what is confusing me is that unsigned long int is at least 32-bit what does that mean it s either 32-bit 64bit or 16-bit right

21485790
nsurl	nsstring
writetofile takes a nsstring as argument not a nsurl

21485798
put	get	post	get	post	put
the api uses simple get post put delete patch http methods to change files in the google drive

21485802
button	checkbox
i m using the most recent version of antetype and created a web bootstrap project and wireframe blank project but cannot see the default antetype widgets radio button checkbox dropdown

21485803
width	height
it happens normally when child divs width or height is greater than the parent div

21485823
plot	heatmap
i tried to fit a heatmap as a subplot of a plot

21485823
plot	heatmap
if save the result of heatmap as a object and use plot or view to put it into a figure it always open a new figure window rather than plot on the existing one even with the hold on

21485844
valgrind	memcheck
i am running valgrind --tool memcheck --leak-check full -v and the call stack being reported is missing symbols

21485899
width	height
in the central 100 div there is an image carousel so as the width of the div increases so does the height

21485911
versioning	upgrade
but during my tests i inserted an sql error on purpose and it does go to oncreate and drops tables and creates tables but it wont increment the versioning next time the application is restarted it will try to upgrade again

21485921
hide	show
- the thumbnails that appear through jquery hide show and hide the main images clicking on the specific icon

21485923
width	height
the idea is that image files have different properties height width than document files etc

21485994
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and internet explorer this form is allowed to be submitted but in firefox it works correctly and tells me to select an option

21486028
atan2	sqrt
you should make a column of absolute windspeed sqrt u_ms 2 + v_ms 2 and take atan2 u_ms wind_abs v_ms wind_abs

21486035
cout	cin
now i did all of this with cout cin and it works fine no problems

21486171
min	max
you can easily write a code that sets the max height or min height

21486182
width	height
right now when i plot values on the graph i automatically send them to the center of the graph based on the height and width of the svg container

21486225
getter	setter
the property has a getter public java.lang.string com.apigee.organizations.keymanagement.app.getdeveloperid but no setter

21486263
post	get
when i post the form with a single images attached its fine and saves to the db and it works a treat but when i save it with multiple image uploads i get this error

21486268
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox rs v.24 and google-chrome all is ok when i add a user into the database this new user is displayed automatically into my list grid

21486290
png	ico
edit the file ico file was converted from a png using dynamic drive s favicon generator

21486347
min	max
i know it s returning the correct min and max score but it s only returning one date and i m not even sure which date it s returning.

21486378
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
in the current versions of firefox google-chrome safari and opera the same â œmoving â error occurs

21486451
implements	extends
to extends the previous answer even more like ankit was saying for complex objects you need to implements serializable

21486462
atan2	sine
the proper way to do it is by find the sine of the angle using the cross product and the cosine of the angle using the dot product and combine the two with the atan2 function

21486479
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
whenever you have an aggregate-functions sum count max min you need to include all non-aggregate columns in the group by so it knows which columns to perform those functions on

21486481
mergetool	diffmerge
is it possible to do view git diffs using a gui tool that will nicely display the local and remote side-by-side similar how it is possible to set the mergetool to be diffmerge and when you do

21486487
ggplot2	lattice
i d like to make a plot like the one produced below in either lattice or ggplot2 where each panel has a different x variable

21486496
min	max
therefore you are just choosing min max of latitude and longitude for one node

21486498
width	height
likewise if the scale is 2 that means that the visible area covers 1 2 as many units as the original width and height

21486498
width	height
i.e. the position of the center of the visible area is the position of the top-left corner of the visible area plus half the visible width and height

21486516
int	double
the following is one way to resolve this as well as the fact that 2 of your sum variables are string and not numeric assuming int but what you may desire here instead is double

21486523
width	height
this is so it can be fluid with its width since every star is a box the total height is 20 the width

21486557
int	boolean
i figured out after looking at the link that sergeylitvinov provided about .equals that the column i was checking submitted was actually a boolean instead of an int once i made the types the same my statements worked

21486620
implements	extends
potential solution if you need to extends specially designed parital class s and it provides extension poinst like callmethod is marked as partial - it is expected for implemnting portion of the class to implements it

21486625
put	get
the problem with this is those are put into the .xcproject file which get s checked in and causes merge conflicts

21486635
min	max
your query is not legal sql exactly because there are different data values for min and max scores

21486635
min	max
the query is not simple because you want to return min and max in different rows

21486635
min	max
and if you have more than one lesson_score equal to min or max you will get extra rows showing it

21486662
put	get
so we can put it all together and get something like this

21486706
google-chrome	firefox
if you are using firebug in firefox or google-chrome developer tools then you can use firephp to write logs in the browser console

21486707
maven	m2e
the projects are all imported maven projects with m2e and we use subversion with subversive plugin for source control

21486707
disk	ram
my workstation is quite capable with 4-core intel i7 cpu 16 gb ram and a solid-state disk

21486721
google-chrome	firefox
support for the html5 battery status api is limited firefox and google-chrome

21486721
google-chrome	firefox
that also has limited support firefox and google-chrome

21486756
puts	gets
1 you are not exploiting the vulnerable code because it have puts function you are exploiting it because it is using gets function that is vulnerable to stack overflow here

21486814
scrypt	salt	hash	salt
the correct way to store passwords is to prepend a per-user salt to the password and then store a cryptographicly secure hash bcrypt or scrypt of the result

21486819
hdfs	oozie
turns out that oozie doesn t support this sort of thing because the shell script is being run as a different user to the one that oozie is doing it s stuff internally in hdfs as

21486819
hdfs	oozie
in other words running the shell script loses the context in which oozie does operations within hdfs

21486819
hdfs	oozie
so having oozie invoke a shell script and expecting it to be able to do things in hdfs is the wrong approach

21486819
hdfs	oozie
oozie is kinda limited in what it can do explicitly in hdfs but it appears that is the way to invoke hdfs actions within oozie

21486853
sorting	grouping
if you don t bother about sorting grouping etc

21486861
hex	binary
if you have access to a hex editor try compiling your program and opening the binary in the editor

21486897
hide	show
you can hide them using javascript or jquery and on click of button you can show them

21486899
daemon	cron
i m trying to start the cron daemon but it will not start

21486926
free	malloc
i am having a strange problem with malloc and free in mingw gcc

21486926
free	malloc
i should clarify that i have written my own memory library with malloc and free and the issue is that i do not want mingw to call those functions

21486926
free	malloc
i have currently implemented a simple fix of renaming my malloc and free but ideally i would be able to name them malloc and free and not have to worry about any external code calling them

21487023
maven	m2e
we re trying to not use m2e and start maven executable as an external tool with some configurations

21487033
google-chrome	firefox
i ve added code to reset the src of the video every time the modal is closed but it will only work in firefox not in ie or google-chrome

21487042
move	drag
thanks to pinal i have been able to stabilize the pointer-events if the cursor happens to interfere with the video when dragging the pointer events of the video would normally stop the drag event eg the mouse move faster than the dragged element then a stall in dragging will happen

21487063
range	max
i need to generate a list of numbers about 120. the numbers range from 1 to x max 10 both included

21487092
width	height
also i recommend switching to using display.getsize point outsize as the width and height methods are deprecated

21487123
woocommerce	shortcode
i donâ t know if this is the best approach but for what i can see the class woocommerce is returned directly on the recent_products shortcode function as html so i canâ t imagine how to filter or hook this by anotherway

21487134
folder	directory
clone or copy project folder into wp-content plugins directory

21487173
put	get
but currently with the below if i put a standardcar into the list then loop through that list and cast it to a standardcar i will get a cast exception

21487279
fast-forward	merge
however you can t as it isn t a fast-forward merge

21487279
fast-forward	merge
doing it that way should ensure that a fast-forward merge is done which keeps git happy when you push to heroku but it might be possible to get the same result by just merging branchname to master without that step

21487303
post	get
preferably you might want to have multiple common methods which are capable of verifying the response details and restarting the process automatically so 1 for get 1 for post ...

21487323
put	get
you put the object they get it

21487345
invoke-command	cmdlets
if you re only using a limited number of cmdlets once you have the session established you can use invoke-command targeted to that session to run the exchange cmdlets and save the overhead of doing the import which will load proxy functions for all the available cmdlets into your local session

21487348
hide	show
call hide on all of them and then show on the chosen one

21487351
children	parent
in catalog product list.phtml there are 3 lines of code that if the parent product has no reviews even though the children products have reviews it will not satisfy this if condition in order to display the summary html

21487395
pop-up	dialog
i m not sure how to explain this but occasionally i will experience an issue where i pop-up a dialog say a file browser and after it is closed part of the dialog remains visible on top of my app

21487521
printf	strlen
to printf when printf is built in and strlen is known not to

21487521
free	malloc
despite being able to override the implementation of malloc and free i believe the only way to remove the calls that the compiler add to these functions to initialize the program environment is only possible to remove with the argument -nostartfiles

21487533
hide	show
this way you can run this code each time the change occurs and depending on the value show or hide the content

21487584
pop-up	dialog
you can also use joptionpane to pop-up a dialog asking for inputs

21487608
jobs	cron
i am trying to take back up in my cpanel using cron jobs

21487634
width	height
you can adjust the width height as needed and the overflow-y scroll

21487650
slideup	slidedown
slidedown works for hidden item and slideup just opposite of it

21487667
getter	setter
also as you would with any other class definition just use getter and setter of the inner class within the outer class

21487677
folder	directory
the parameter to the constructor below is the xml working folder not the working directory of the process

21487684
for-loop	loops
also you should put the return 0 at the end of the function or the for-loop would just loops one time because if the condition acode.equals ... is not true it will return 0 in the first loops

21487690
int	chars
i m mostly unsure of whether using a local short or chars or whatever will save space since it has to up-cast to meet the foo int prototype

21487776
post	get
the site had about 200 post articles that i d like to get back

21487776
put	get
if i was able to get them i would put them back into a wordpress site

21487841
put	get
so the message leaves the sender and is received by the server but does not get put in the output queue

21487844
minimum	max
i set the gray alphas to have a parabolic shape with minimum where the gray value is .5 and max of 99 at gray values of 0 or 1

21487864
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
do not use a for-loop to loops through an arrays

21487878
theos	logos
logos is a component of the theos development suite that allows method hooking code to be written easily and clearly using a set of special preprocessor directives

21487879
theos	logos
logos is a component of the theos development suite that allows method hooking code to be written easily and clearly using a set of special preprocessor directives

21487904
min	max
on my machine this took about 15 seconds to run and the results were always the same for both min and max

21487913
ienumerable	ienumerator
thanks to sam i am s comment i am able to tweak the code on this page and put together the following without using ienumerable or ienumerator

21487916
netcdf	proj
for the last couple days i ve been trying to simulate a real-time plot of some radar data from a netcdf file to work with a gui i m building for a school proj

21487921
uipangesturerecognizer	uiswipegesturerecognizer
uipangesturerecognizer gives you precise movement data whereas uiswipegesturerecognizer is more basic and just detects whether or not a swipe happened and in which direction

21488003
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade the rails versioning to rails 4

21488011
getter	setter
you should look into getter and setter methods

21488013
width	height
there s no need to set the height or width of the image view

21488055
width	height
i specifically need it for google maps with this method map.movecamera cameraupdatefactory.newlatlngbounds bounds width height map_padding

21488074
versioning	upgrade
this happened to me when i upgrade the cli cordova via npm to 3.3.1 but forgot up update my project to the corresponding versioning

21488077
next	except
the instruction pointer is incremented by a fixed amount except when executing control flow instructions--jumps and branches independent of the instruction type so the location of the next sequential instruction can be available early with minimal extra work compared to having to at least partially decode the instruction

21488077
short	base
although it is possible to used non-power-of-two instruction lengths tensilica s xtensa now has fixed 24-bit instructions as its base isa--with 16-bit short instruction support being an extension previously they were part of the base isa

21488087
plot	heatmap
by using imagesc to plot the matrix i can easily set the heatmap as a subplot

21488105
clang	llvm
debuggers do that yes but no debugger operates in llvm ir land - as far as i know even llvm s own lldb works differently by parsing the dwarf in the object file into clang types

21488106
subclass	accessor
each subclass could provide accessor for its member variables

21488109
folder	directory
everything works fine for the pages in the main directory but it does not work for the pages in sub folder for example

21488209
width	height
unless you explicitly set your view s width height to static value like x-dp or match_parent you cannot know the size of your view until onmeasure loop is completed

21488237
inherited	properties
business logic with calculated properties inherited and whatever else might help you

21488250
post	get
as mentioned in the comments map get to one method and post to another

21488269
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it played well for google-chrome safari firefox localhost

21488277
ubuntu	linux
i am currently building a program in c in netbeans at ubuntu linux os and i want to parse it to valgrind for memory leaks

21488290
width	height
in the first case i get the image with its actual size but in the second case the sizes are doubled both width and height

21488326
getter	setter
if it is uppercase make it lowercase and create your getter and setter again and try it again

21488403
inherited	properties
it should check if the navigated-to page inherited irequiressettings and set that properties accordingly

21488428
portrait	landscape
landscape view and the others portrait views must not rotate if the user rotates the device

21488428
portrait	landscape
iâ m trying with stage.setaspectratio stageaspectratio.portrait for portrait views and stage.setaspectratio stageaspectratio.landscape for landscape view

21488428
portrait	landscape
sometimes going from a portrait to landscape works but when i return to the caller portrait view its rotate to landscape too

21488470
sorting	filtering
i m creating an angularjs component that will provides a checkbox list directive with filtering sorting toggling options scrolling etc.

21488528
children	parent
typically for large associations i have separated these because sometimes the parent have not been fully created first before their associated children during an import

21488528
children	parent
the association to parent would then only include the 38 children

21488534
ng-show	ng-hide
i am trying to use ng-hide and ng-show for this

21488534
ng-show	ng-hide
should i be using ng-show and ng-hide maybe i should use something else instead

21488535
google-chrome	firefox
it doesn t matter which method i would like to use ie and firefox shows only g+ and twitter buttons but fb button is missing google-chrome shows all three buttons

21502477
post	get
you have defined a route for get only so you are only proxying get requests but login and signup uses a post request

21502477
apache	nginx
usually a proxy rule in apache or nginx will proxy all allowed methods for a given url but since you defining the handler by method this doesn t happen

21502477
post	get
i m not sure if other methods are needed as well options get post and delete were the only ones i observed you will see which method is failing if you take a look at the requests the page does with firebug

21502477
put	get	post	get	post	put
to fix this add the same handler you have added with get for post put and delete as well

21502485

21502543
filesystems	fat
unless you did something tricky like installing 3rd party filesystems drivers then the only filesystems that both windows and os x can read write to natively is fat based

21502543
filesystems	hfs+
this could mean using hfs+ os x filesystems which would require you to install hfs+ drivers on your windows system so that it can read write to the filesystems

21502543
filesystems	ntfs
or it could mean going in the other direction and using ntfs windows filesystems which would require you to install ntfs drivers on your mac

21502543
filesystems	ntfs
note that most recent versions of os x can read ntfs filesystems they just can t write to them

21502566
width	height
when i changed the image width to percentage i noticed it also affected the height

21502591
width	height
so if width or height is changed the other will change with it

21502598
x86	64bit
important note seemly this affect the results i compiled this with mingw targeting 32-bit and running on a 64bit bit x86 i ran only once a test targeting 64bit thus i am not confident of its results but the performance gap is seemly 2 instead of 11

21503039
public	protected
usually anything public protected or internal classes fields properties etc. is recommended to be pascalcase

21503144

i found a solution on here to get the width and height by creating a new image element and using the onload event to get those values

21503144
width	height
i want to set the element s width and height to those values so that i can refer back to them

21503168

21503584
implements	extends
i did try removing the implements callback and extends the handler class in an anonymus class implements the handlemessage message msg method

21503603
textarea	textbox
my work-around is unsurprisingly to first move the content of the textarea into hidden textbox and then serialize the form data

21503605
realloc	malloc
if i replace realloc with malloc this works perfectly but that would create a memory leak

21503614
min	max
i m trying to determine the runtime complexity of an algorithm that i have written to take an array and determine the length of the longest continuous subsequence of the array where the difference in the max and min of the subsequence is less than or equal to some given value

in project properties i ve linked additional library directory to the folder with libcurl.dll in and in linker- input i ve the .lib s listed there in that previous answer

21503743
explode	implode
this can be done without regular expressions as well using implode and explode

21503778
realloc	malloc
you need to do a malloc before doing the realloc

21503778
realloc	malloc
you should init the lines memory area to null first and then realloc will perform a malloc the first time since realloc will operate like malloc if the pointer is null

21503778
calloc	malloc
so add a line after the malloc to initialize the area to null or use calloc instead of malloc

21503796
inherited	subclassing
i m not sure if this is possible given that the eigenclass is an anonymous subclassing of class so foo appears nowhere in its inherited hierarchy

21503796
initializer	eigenclass
clearly the eigenclass s to_s method knows something about the owner even if this information is hardcoded when the eigenclass is initializer

21503812
folder	directory
generally apache will look in the public folder which should be located in the root of your project directory

21503828

i ve been able to get this working by creating a new activity for the new screens but i believe i want to use a fragment for the new screens because in a tablet layout i want the new screens to appear beside the main screens rather than replacing it

21503954
cos	sin
it should be much more accurate than yours as it calculates distances with much better approximation wgs83 instead of using sin cos and rest of this stuff

21503967
switching	screens
the idea is to have each tab be a category of a grid of items that can be combined in this merged tab then one can swipe from right to left to select one tab with one category swipe again to switching to the next category then swipe a 3rd time in the same direction to return to the screens with both merged and basically have a loop like that when swiping in that one direction

21503969
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
and from what i ve tested it works fine on my windows pc in recent ie firefox google-chrome opera builds.

21504013
gridview	sqldatasource
i also have a gridview which fetches data from sqldatasource

21504025
getter	setter
as chris hammond pointed out just because you use a property setter getter does not mean that it will automatically create property values for you

21504052
vbscript	vb6
this is vbscript but should be pastable into vb6

21504062
min	max
at last in your inner loop on every iteration you are adding element to newarray and calling min and max on it

21504062
min	max
complexity of both min and max is o n but length of array decreasing

21504062
min	max
min max for j in 0-4

21504062
min	max
min max for j in 0-3

21504062

min max for j in 0-1

21504062
min	max
min max for j in 0

21504096
for-loop	loops
do i need to use a while loops or a for-loop

21504132
range	max
iâ m looking for a way to employ a lookup algorithm on a dataframe that for a given element examines corresponding variables within a range and returns the max such variable

21504177
put	get
i know the xaml control is correct because when i put in the default values i get the microsoft advertising banner

21504187
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
give it a width of 100 and set box-sizing to border-box still needs to be prefixed -moz-box-sizing for firefox then it should fit into the available width

21504189
folder	directory
what i ve discovered however is that i need directory access to a particular folder

21504189
folder	directory
or do i have to approach it from the other angle and enable directory listings globally and then selectively disable them folder by folder

21504210
hide	show
the key tree is used to get an id for the folders as well as a class for the files using jquery show files which are related to the active folder and hide which are not a.s.o

21504217
operands	scalar
in the other hand scalar operands used as factor in the linear contrast adjustment transform per intensity sample again most basic formula

21504247
post	get
of course as noted in your question you want also to get the post parameters sent by the applet and generate the text of the response based on those parameters rather than just using a constant string .

21504273
nsdictionary	restkit
i m trying to end up with a single object of group holding an nsdictionary children with key-value pairs of actions action1 key and child object of label type and value using restkit

i added the the respective graphics in the folders-drawables ldpi mdpi hdpi xhdpi xxhdpi

21504331
screens	mdpi
when i open the app on the emulator on a normal screens mdpi .everythings is right

21504331
mdpi	hdpi
but when i choose other emulator like one hdpi large .the android system is not choosing the right graphics. for example i open a hdpi emulator and the system is choosing the normal graphics mdpi

21504334
integer	unsigned
then -1 10 is -1 and not 9 and -1 assigned to uint8_t yields 255 since unsigned integer overflow is defined in terms of modulo arithmetic

21504354
range	max
since -1 is outside the range of representable values 0 to 255 and the type is unsigned the conversion takes place by reducing the value modulo 256 one plus the max value into the range thus yielding 255

21504388
inherited	subclassing
however since a classâ s singleton class inherited from its superclassâ s singleton class youâ ll get multiple results if the class youâ re trying to find has subclassing

21504392
post	put
just put this code replace your post execute with this

21504408
int	chars
i suspect it s reading the value of key chars as a list with a single item rather than an int but i m not entirely sure

21504436
int	chars
i suspect it s reading the value of key chars as a list with a single item rather than an int

21504543

21504657
google-chrome	firefox
developer tools such as those in firefox and google-chrome will use them to allow debugging as if the code was not compressed

21504685
width	height
i would use a predefined width x height on the grid version of images that have a larger irregular version

21504685
portrait	landscape
the downside to that is you re assuming all images are square or landscape not portrait or vice versa

21504685
background-image	background-size
alternatively use a background-image with background-size cover

21504693
portrait	landscape
i have an app that you can rotate the view landscape or portrait when you do this a button moves location

21504731
vundle	pathogen

21504940
int	double
the answers the user gives is in numbers can be int or double

21504961
put	get
for your real code you just need to get name price and speed of the pc and put everything in the arrays using the same index

21504962
button	checkbox
updating a value of a checkbox radio button .checkboxradio refresh should be used to re-apply styles on that element

21504974
bonjour	avahi
mdns bonjour avahi zeroconf

21504994
post	get
what i would suggest is instead of giving direct picture link create another page and code that page to collect a pic url id from by get post and display the corresponding pic and then embed this page into the fancybox

21505023
for-loop	arrays
to my knowledge and research so far - javascript s native for-loop is quicker than arrays map for iterating through the arrays

21505067
folder	directory
once you have the file saved in your htdocs folder you will need to open the xampp control panel it s located in the xampp directory and called xampp-control.exe

21505077
octal	binary
because putting a 0 before a number turns it into an octal representation not binary

21505077
octal	decimal
so for example 011 is octal for decimal 9 which is what s printed

21505116
post	get
i also want to get all post with odd id s and display them somewhere else

21505147

21505230
base	fractions
my experience is that even a very large code base can be parsed into a single heirarchical build tree in a tiny fractions of the time it takes to actually execute the build even with monsterous build servers...

21505232
post	get
the system has a custom error handler that essentially just grabs the error and prints out everything about the session and error so i have the line number of the offending file along with any get and post params

21505246
width	height
you need to scale your coordinates based on the height and width of your jpanel or canvas object on which you are painting the polygon

21505246
subtraction	addition
also the origin is in the upper right corner of the jpanel or canvass so you either need to use addition subtraction to shift the scaled coordinates or you need to use the affine transform to get the polygon where you want it to go

21505257
textview	imageview
use relativelayout as parent layout and add imageview and textview to it

21505346

21505397
put	get
however when i try to put it into the context format of a function i get an error stating

21505426
istream	getline
but i guess you are actually using getline of an istream object - if this is the case you may just use the operator instead

21505432
profiling	benchmarking
thus armed with the means above to create an objective benchmarking i would be more inclined to persist with the profiling approach probably something like

21505432
memcpy	memset
this turns out to be quite a good illustration of the benefit of sampling memcpy and memset are hand-coded in assembly --- we find that the most time-consuming functions have already been optimised

21511108
public	protected
what you are observing has nothing to do with whether fields and methods are public or protected

21511108

post	get
if you re dealing with methods defined by w3 specs like get and post then you re guaranteed that a spec-compliant client will send you them in uppercase

21511879
post	get
and the w3-defined methods like options get post etc

21511884
post	get	ssl	https
in https there is an additional layer between http post get and tcp the ssl encryption

21511884
post	get
this encryption does not care if the data are get or post they even don t care if it is http at all

21511884
post	get
and because a get requests with the same parameters looks different to a post request with the same parameters in http it will also look different in https

folder	directory
simply by putting the repository directory in the .htdocs folder and then accessing the app through localhost repositoryfolder appfolder in my webbrowser worked perfectly for me

21511956

i create another folder trying to download android source code and get the following error but for my first android source code directory there s no such error

21511960
post	get
so here s my problem to access the api i first need to make a post for authentication i inform my access token then i can make some get request to retrieve the data

viewmodel	caliburn.micro
you can create a bool property on your viewmodel called cansayhello which caliburn.micro will use to enable disable the control

21511982
for-loop	loops
the mistake you were making is using a for-loop inside run instead use loops run method it-self

21511983
width	height
these images have different aspect ratios but the largest dimension is exactly 40pts whether it be the height or the width

21511983
width	height
i then added two constraints - one to constrain the width to 30 and another to constrain the height to 30

21511991
setinterval	settimeout
use settimeout instead of setinterval - that will fire the function to run only once

21512004

by the way if you re using margin on the elements you re reading the height on and you want to include them in the calculations use outerwidth true instead of width

21512047
cos	sin
another common thing contained in the expressions expanded dot cross products which could get simplified to cos a sin a expressions which might get merged together in the next steps

post	get
changed post into get

21512063
post	get
you were using get and post together this is highly unlikely

21512144

guessing that the three buttons on the left have a fixed width and height you could set the image as background-image to a ul which wraps the buttons and have a 100 width

21512147
xna	spritebatch
you should probably draw your crosshair as a 2d sprite inside the directx control as 2 textured tringles using uv mapping or through tlan api like xna s spritebatch

21512553
for-loop	loops
you are missing the closing end of the for-loop which causes the insert line to be inside loops

21512562
hash	salt
i d say you should prefix the plaintext password with the salt and then hash the whole thing

21512562
hash	salt
if you just prefix the hash with a salt the salt will be easily recognizable once an attacker sees 2 or more salt hash next to the other

21512585
width	height
this maintains the aspect ratio of the image but sets its size so it covers the div either fitting to the width or height whichever is proportionally less

svg	vml
while i can handle all other aspects of it i am facing problem in correctly converting the path of the shape from vml path to svg path

21513819
svg	vml
the svg path treats first set of coordinates in q qx as a control point and hence the actual path doesn t passes through the point whereas the vml intended those coordinates as the point over which the path should pass through

21513819
svg	vml
currently i am using this and this for researching svg and vml respectively

21514007
put	get
secondary i try to get uan array data and put it into fragment

21514022
stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush	stderr	fflush
i guess this has to do with the way stdout and stderr buffers are fflush

21514022
stdout	fflush
at the beginning of your perl script so that stdout is fflush after each print statement

21514036
asterisk	ivr
if you want to setup an asterisk ivr you can also use some drag and drop web based tool in order to make simple auto-attendant like in your example or complex ivr managing scripting or data base driven ivr

for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
if i do a for-loop to print out all the values it stops midway and crashes in the case of arrays of size 25 it consistently stops after index 7. however if i printf the index if seg faults on with loops it works perfectly

21515023
rss	feed
i have php script that reads rss feed from a website and then modifies it a little

21515060
put	get
another idea is to put an invisible imagview on that layout and strech it with fill_parent so it will cover the whole layout and to measure that image to get the layout dimensions

21515068
put	get
that s why you get only zeros - you put them yourself to the result... to

addition	multiplication	division	multiplication	division	addition
i want to be able to calculate a running average on an arbitrary type upon which i have defined addition scalar multiplication and scalar division

21515241

21515446
fancybox	colorbox
tip take a look at colorbox or fancybox

21515449

the new scopes are child scopes so although the scope is new the properties on the scope are inherited from the parent

21515544
accessor	properties
second i suggest you place the annotations on the properties rather than on the accessor methods

21516765
leaflet	openlayers
my initial trials with leaflet quickly came to the conclusion that leaflet actually leaves all of the reloading and load-error handling to the browser while openlayers at least has an event that is fired when the tile server does return with an error code

post	get
with this i can get the post data so this works fine

once you have that binary the trick is to get from downloading it to being able to put execution privileges on it

21518893
int	double	int	boolean
first you can create final static variables of the results as per your example 1 or 0 hence only one copy is stored for the whole class then your local variable is only a boolean using only 1 bit but still maintaining the result value of double also maybe you can use int if it is only 0 or 1

width	height
instead of filling the entire paintable area you could create a bufferedimage whose width is 1 pixel and height equal to the area you want to fill assuming you are fill vertically

21519409
graphics2d	bufferedimage
you would then apply the lineargradientpaint to this bufferedimage s graphics2d and fill it don t forget to dispose of the graphics context when your done

21520612
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
this works fine for the width by using display inline-block but the height always has some extra padding margin border

21520656
min	max
v starts off as infinity so at the first call to min v max-value s v gets set to the utility of a child node as computed by max because it is max s turn after min and we know it is correct by induction because it is of depth d-1

21520656
min	max
the argument for max-value is much the same as for min-value so the induction tells you that for trees of any depth both min-value and max-value return to you the value of the node passed to them when it is max or min s turn to move and make the choices associated with that node

21520656
min	max
so the double recursion arises because it allows max and min to take alternate turns as you walk up the tree from the leaves and v is a temporary which is used to work out the min or max value of all the child nodes of a tree

i realize git does a incremental push and pull so it would not be 300gb worth of data being pushed and pulled each time

the problem i ran into is that scrollorama relies on the scroll event being fired fairly often as this is what the animations are hooked into - however when using a touch screen the browsers only seem to fire the scroll event when you start the drag and when you stop - this is consistent across opera mini google-chrome safari firefox mobile

using closures to create getter setter allows you to control how the variables are modified

21529078
getter	setter
getter and setter allow you to hide the variable in the function s scope so if something wants to change it it must go through you

21529394
getter	setter
or if you don t need setter getter virtuals or any other of mongoose magic to be applied to your documents you may use lean queries as johnnyhk suggested

21529476
int	chars
if your variable stores a constant value such as static final int num_gears 6 the convention changes slightly capitalizing every letter and separating subsequent words with the underscore chars

the problem i m having is passing the relevant div id to the function so the function knows which div element to show hide for each function call

21529677
put	get
i thought to put a random variable on id to each form and the button add get this id but i dont know how to do it

21529685

google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
at this time it s only supported in later version of google-chrome opera firefox but there are shims to patch this up if you want to use this functionality in production today

21530013
hide	show
the second part of my question is that i can t figure out the logic on my togglecurrent function so that i can hide show the currently displayed view

21530013
hide	show
example - if the thumbnail view is visible i want to hide show or if the full view is visible i want to hide show that

21530029
width	height
this rotates with no problem - i now need to change the width height of the control to match the new dimensions created with the rotate

21530029
width	height
i can t do that here as setting the width height of the control in this event causes a rendering loop

21530034
portrait	landscape
in landscape mode this looks great but if i switch to portrait everything is rendered much larger

21530061
box-sizing	border-box
box-sizing border-box

21530068
pow	sqrt
dijkstra once observed in a grad student recruiting talk that the object of the exercise is don t make a mess of it. observing that pow x 2 x x and pow x 1.5 x sqrt x you can get rid of a lot of transcendental numbercrunching calls by defining two inline functions and rewriting the critical line as

21530112
stateless	stateful
as you can see from comments i have tried several combinations of stateful stateless session

21530121
getter	setter
if that is the case you might want to consider creating an interface which specifies all the getter methods and is implemented by both someclass and someotherclass with both classes also implementing the setter methods they require

21530147
folder	dir
get the sources to some folder in my home dir apt-get source nginx

21530172
division	modulo
if you perform a modulo to a number that is not a power of two the cpu has to perform a division that can be a quite expensive operation of course it depends on the size of the numbers you are using

21530180
min	max
well without seeing the source data it s hard to know for sure but you re using different date columns in the max min and datediff

21530193
hide	show
hi you can show that list in header or footer but you can hide your parameters using this lines in the code behind

21530196
move	drag
so i want to have a ship on the field and i drag it and drop it on an empty field to move it

21530212
cpu	processors
however cpu cycles aren t a great way to measure performance with modern processors which run more than one instruction at once pipelining have multiple layers of cache etc

21530224
move	drag
everything works fine- i can move drag image kinetic.image etc

21530269
portrait	landscape
the app also does not full screen to landscape but rather shrinks to fit in portrait mode

21530314
int	chars
you can try to set the int value for the chars

21530352
width	height
the progress bar div will not be affected by the container1 div s width because the progress bar floats if you check the container in your browser you will find that it has no height and it is set up to work together with the .progress class

21530358
int	chars
up to 255 i can understand how the int are stored in chars and unsigned chars

21530359
google-chrome	firefox
sticky menu works in google-chrome but not in firefox 26 ie 11

21530392

but because it would be different for each site i quickly started leaning towards each parser actually returning the same thing -- a properly formatted by local database schema standards recordset ready for storage

21530466
integer	unsigned
trying to assign 256 which is an int literal to it results in an unsigned integer overflow that is defined by the standard to result in wraparound

21530466
integer	unsigned
the result of where u is an unsigned integral type and n is an unsigned integer outside its range is

21530466
integer	unsigned
this norm is there since most platform already implement this at the assembly language level unsigned integer overflow typically results in this behavior plus some kind of overflow flag set to 1

21530466
int	chars
notice that all this do not hold for signed int as often plain chars is signed int overflow is undefined behavior

21530475
box-sizing	border-box
you should add box-sizing border-box

21530484
min	max
also how can i set the heap min and max sizes for tomcat

backgrounding	multitasking
see executing a finite-length task in the backgrounding discussion in the app states and multitasking section of the ios app programming guide

21530831
getter	setter
if it does work with the uncompiled xtk we can add getter setter to access this variable from the compiled xtk

21530860

even upgrade your app per versioning as we ve seen in ios 5.1

21531032
int	chars
it works for me if it is chars with marshal.ptrtostringansi but i want it for int because i don t have anything like marshal.ptrint ..

21531054
getter	setter
it has to be a java bean that implements the serializable interface has a constructor without arguments and has public getter setter for access to properties

21531079
int	chars
every chars has an ascii value an int

21531105
client-side	server-side
then i check if the client-side timestamp timezone match the server-side timestamp timezone

21531130
mouseover	mouseout
the mouseover and mouseout change the pointer into a hand while over the split button

21531200
width	height
hi i am trying to make the images resize to 75 of the actual height and width

21531220
put	get
what you can do is put all of the values from the data table into a collection that can be effectively searched and then get all of the items in the list that are also in that collection

21531267
int	chars
also in the oracle docs about conversion we can see that chars to int is one of the widening primitive conversion along with

21531267
int	double
byte to short int long float or double

21531267
int	double
short to int long float or double

21531267
int	double	int	chars
chars to int long float or double

21531267

note also you can only use numerical values on properties that support them like width or height

21531620
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
how do i access a qpixmap item once i have added it to a qgraphicsview via a qgraphicsscene

qgraphicsitem	qgraphicspixmapitem
i believe the qpixmap is at this point a qgraphicsitem or more precisely a qgraphicspixmapitem .

21531658
int	double
this is because mantissa of double has 52 bit and every higher int is representable only with precision loss

21531697
post	get
you re correctly using https but make sure you can get to the site using curl or wget with a post operation not just a get operation

21531700

i am trying to use reflection.emit to create a dynamic type which inherited from a given type and adds a new properties whose getter setter call methods of the base type

21531725
google-chrome	safari
but in google-chrome and safari its comes at text

21531768
post	get
in other words if you set it as a parameter in the url s query string and the data is big next to 1k i d recommend strongly to prefer a post instead of a get

21531772
post	get
i replaced the post with a get and the action with a working url so you can see something happening

21531774
folder	directory
however this gives me the message no examples matching . spec _spec.rb could be found note that within folder a and b i have sub directory for the different areas of the application under test

21531779

21532006
width	height
make sure position is set as absolute and then set the width height

21532094
margin	height
i apply this height to the relevant note probably as a margin offset

21532167
google-chrome	firefox
tested on ie7 ie8 ie9 google-chrome operate firefox

21532172
post	get
the cleanest and least intrusive way to do this as i see it would be to attach a handler to the sync event and check the xhr object if it s a response to a get do one thing and another if it was a post

21532253
int	boolean
you can store what are called bits to this so let s say you had 32 boolean values which in java all values take up 32 bits except long or for arrays they take up 8 for byte 16 for short and 32 for int

21532253
int	boolean
now as i was saying you could effectively store 32 boolean into a single int by doing the following

21532253
unsigned	short
i mostly posted this to assist anyone who may come across this searching for unsigned short or even possibly multi-dimensional arrays

21532286
jobs	cron
i need to create and manipulate some svgs just with some server-side code like with cron jobs but i m wondering if it s possible to use snap.svg in this scenario where it s not included in a web page

21532321
countif	sumifs
i would suggest a pivottable but given a layout as below with countif and sumifs may also be possible

21532346
ssl	https
you may also have an https part of the site that would then have a reference to a non-https version of the site which would create ssl errors alerts

is width 986 height 1 is the right image size to use when creating

21532552
width	height
yes it is width 986 height 1

21532552

only if you want to create a bitmap respecting width and height in postscript file

21532553
width	height
h and w are height and width respectively

21532575
uitableview	reloaddata
another way that is arguably more extensible this could be done is wrapping uitableview s reloaddata method and after the reload calling a recursive scrollview-checking method like what dominic_sander listed above although i have not checked this solution since i am done messing with this problem

21532577
filtering	grouping
so basically i want to filtering all the error lines and the last caused by line in that grouping grouping are delimited by the log4j dates

21532631
getter	setter
however when i skip validation part xml file is properly loaded into java objects all data is loaded and accessibile with both getter and setter

21532663
free	malloc
if you use malloc you will need to remember to free the object later

21532663
free	malloc
because if you were to have the code in a library and malloc in the debug runtime and free in the release runtime bad things happen

21532699
width	height
height and width constraint for imageview set to less then or equal

21532699

you ve swapped width and height which would logically swap the dimensions of the image

21532846
client-side	server-side
you have a partial view that is rendered server-side and you want to render something different based on something that s going to happen client-side a click

21532856

i ve been writing a lot of code in matlab 2012a recently and i m wondering if there s some way to show whitespace characters tabs spaces etc. like in notepad++ or sublimetext

21532886
put	get
your application needs to store the objects from the request an array then fire a new request to the next_url put those objects into the same store array then follow the link again until you reach the end or until you get enough to satisfy your needs

21532902
qthread	qapplication

mdpi	hdpi
160 dpi corresponds to mdpi not hdpi 240 dpi

21533223
screens	tablet
in order to accommodate other types of tablet and screens sizesâ in particular 7 tabletsâ android 3.2 introduces a new way to specify resources for more discrete screens sizes

21533223
width	height
to make it possible for you to provide different layouts for these two kinds of screens android now allows you to specify your layout resources based on the width and or height that s actually available for your application s layout specified in dp units

21533232
hash	salt
1 000 iterations is still unfortunately the best tradeoff behind offering increased security over a straight-up salt and hash and keeping the web server responsive

21533242
division	multiplication
in general bit manipulation is faster than arithmetic especially multiplication and division

21533251
integer	unsigned
but you surely missing the logic for checking overflow by assuming x 1 x 2 and it works only on unsigned integer

21533308
division	multiplication
anyway practically every compiler will replace multiplication or division by the power of two to bit manipulation automatically if it is possible

21533361
folder	directory
i include the aloha folder into the vendor directory of the ember-app-kit

21533366

int	double
although you have defined perc as double but the right hand side of the assignment is all int and hence the calculation is being done in int type

21533397
multiplying	multiplication
if you are multiplying by a number show the operation as multiplication

21533397
division	multiplication
the exception comes when if a performance barrier is hit and it is determined through profiling that your code needs to be adjusted to an uglier version using bitshifts instead of multiplication and division

21533397
division	multiplication
unless you have run into such a performance issue not likely there is no reason to use bitshifts when you mean to use multiplication or division

21533433
division	multiplication
some compilers may not recognize the same and actually perform multiplication for and division for x 2

21533435
typedef	struct
typedef struct int counter

21533444
oncreate	setcontentview
in oncreate after setcontentview bind it to the textview

afaik you can t use two subversion origins at the same time cloned mercurial repository will operate only with source-svn repository later for pull and push i.e you will not be able hg pull local + hg push remote

21533666
pull	push
but if local svn-mirror used only once for creating clone in mercurial and later remote svn is used only push and pull you can try replace default path in repository s .hgrc and change local url to remote for full mirror with shared uuid it may work

width	height
i changed the last two lines of the resizefix method to directly update the element s width and height and this solved my issue

21534003
move	drag
of course this will also make it transparent to the drag event so you will have to add the drag event to the container instead of the nodes then figure out which circle is being dragged in the dragstart event change its pointer-events style and store the circle selection in a variable accessible by your drag function which will move it the same as your current code and dragend function which will re-set its pointer-events style

21534008
width	height
another strange thin is that when i look at the table s height and width in debug mode it says 0 even thoug there are elements in it that all have the corrct size

21534014

21534223
subtract	add
we add their returned counts to the total count of the found largest possible slide and use the count of the backwards scan as the length of the overlap and subtract its triangular number

21534231
getter	setter
through getter and setter

21534251
typedef	struct
compiler will treats it as typedef struct

post	get
now i could be hacky and do some fun post substring processing stuff to get rid of that . portion

21534516
post	get
altering get post data as suggested here seems wacky as it is going to alter the whole application state rather than of the target controller as far as i understand but perhaps it is considered okay in the php world i don t know i am coming from the strict c++ c# java scala world let me know if so

21534531
shadowing	named
this is called method shadowing the methods share the same named but they are actually different and probably unrelated - that s why you get different behavior and it s used when a base class has introduced a new method where your derived class already had that method

unfortunately delete and put are not able to be sent through normal html forms via method only post and get

21536168
int	chars
imagine this scenario i request the user to enter an int getting it by using scanf but the user enters a chars because of that the program reaches it s end.

21536206
hide	show
the problem is that when i click on .personalized class it does not have both #loading_personalized and #divpersonalized so it takes the ajax call ..and as soon as i click again on .personalized in time the id #loading_personalized is showing up it hide but the previous ajax call is not cancelled yet so it executes and show #divpersonalized but i want that at the time the #loading_personalized is showing up and i click on .personalized the previous ajax call should also cancel.

21536284
fgets	getline
or usually better not least because the error reporting can report the whole line is to use fgets or getline to read the whole line then use sscanf or other techniques to parse that line and go from there

21536294
fgets	strtol
use fgets then sscanf or strtol

21536344
cmdlet	start-job
the cmdlet command-let you want to use to create a background job is start-job

21536344
put	get

width	height
the program will get the width of a 2d array from command line then find the appropriate height input the characters row by row and encipher them by outputting column by column

21536367
hide	show
or probably the easiest way use jquery s show hide events

21536367
hide	show
show hide on the other hand simply removes them from the display which seems to be your actual intent

21536373
google-chrome	firefox
just watch this in firefox and in google-chrome

21536414

so you have to literally move draggable items into droppable area

21536442
spaces	delimiter
w is a shortcut for building arrays of spaces delimiter strings

21536553

i would put them in an arraylist store each new text field and combbox as you create them then you can go back and get input from all of them after you re done

21536553
implements	extends
if you wanted to extends jcombobox and jtextfield with your own classes you could have those classes both implements an interface that defined something like getvalue or gettext

21536566
google-chrome	firefox
also looks like this code is not working in firefox though in google-chrome and ie11 it works fine

21536574
post	get
the next section of code line 3- is supposed to perform a function on each object retrieved to get its name key and then post it in an alert box

21536581
google-chrome	firefox
i was able to kind of fix this in google-chrome but firefox was pretty stubborn about treating these differently

21536589
g++	gcc	vtune	perf
i m most interested in these compilers gcc g++ icc and these profiling tools intel vtune linux perf and oprofile

21536597

i am using a nice script to hide and show several divs

21536662
post	get
in wordpress i am trying to get all post within multiple categories

21536678

if absolute paths would be used directly the clone of the clone would push pull from the original and not the first clone

21536682
superclass	subclassing
using an instance of the subclassing i want to call the method of the superclass

21536685
post	get
i want to post not get with jquery javascript

21536697
int	double
i want to make the vector generic so that it can store int or double and i don t need to declare two different vectors with their own specific data types

21536713
directx	gdi
i think there is a reason why we don t use gdi when drawing in games that use directx or opengl

21536776
inherited	properties
as that s rather heavy handed and all my classes inherited from my own standard baseclass i m going to add a properties called typename to the baseclass that returns this.gettype .name

21536793
yacc	bison
a yacc bison parser is an lalr 1 parser

21536798
linefeed	delimiter
you would need to define another record delimiter rather than a linefeed or cr linefeed

21536928
filesystems	btrfs
e.g. you could mount a btrfs filesystems on btrfs on the host then have a btrfs data subvolume and then do something like docker run -v btrfs data var data â to bind-mount that subvolume in the container

21536937
mouseover	mouseout
this work s properly in all browsers except safari which for some reason completely resizes the svg on mouseover and mouseout

21536943
width	height
so you can t directly assign width or height properties or scale the picker

21536967
folder	directory
i was under the impression that if i created a layout-land directory in the res folder that android would automatically select the correct layout for the orientation but it appears that this doesn t detect changes once the activity is currently running.

21536984
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome the number is displayed like 123 456 789

21537005
floating-point	fractions
it has only 53 bits to use for the fractions portion of the floating-point value and 1e-21 is almost 70 bits below 1

21537016
portrait	landscape
this tells android that you re going to handle rotation changes yourself so it won t use the layout from the landscape directory if started in portrait - because the activity doesn t get restarted

21537030
integer	unsigned
the changes convert to unsigned integer constants because shifting is best done with unsigned integers

21537045
children	parent
my gut feeling said the most natural way to implement this would be a hierarchical group management where a group can be part of other groups children and parent

21537089
vim	emacs
if you want an editor that will run directly on the command line you can try emacs or vim

21537089
notepad++	gedit
if you just want a simple editor with syntax highlighting gedit or notepad++ will work well

21537217
ng-show	ng-class
his solution was for animation with ng-show which is very similar but a little different from animations with ng-class

21537255
map	quadtree
at this point googlemaps + spatialite or googlemaps + quadtree + utils to identify if a latlng belongs to a circle polyline polygon can solve the problem but i have one more requirement i need to cache a zone of the map to work with it on the street without internet

21537306
ssl	https
i have a web application that runs through https but we are loading external images on servers that don t support ssl

21537377
width	height
root node position is initialized at width 2 100 instead of width 2 height 2 - this is natural position of the root for hanging layout

21537377
children	parent
new in this example is just one more custom force one that centers all parent to the middle of horizontal positions of their children

21537419
converter	multibinding
you just can t simply do multibinding nor you could do some converter that would fetch parent datacontext so you have to construct it yourself

21537424
width	height
otherwise you will have to fix the position and width height of your components but you may loose responsive design

21537476
maven	pom.xml
thinking this was a classloader issue i ve excluded duplicate libs in my maven pom.xml so there is only one instance of scala-lib akka-actor and akka-kernel...but that didn t solve the issue

21537530
apache	nginx
see the documentation for apache nginx

21537568
inherited	subclassing
firstly - class variables are evil and should be avoided because they are also inherited by all subclassing and usually causes more harm than good

21537583
for-loop	arrays
if you have more elements in the arrays you will need to iterate them with a for-loop

21537584

in this case it will require some imagination to get the thing done you will need the mutual exclusion implemented on some object that is common to all the vms involved and that may escalate when you put additional machines into the cluster

21537858
free	malloc
then when you attempt to call free on the address of a local variable your environment correctly reports that you are passing to free an address that was not created by a call to malloc

21537861
free	malloc
if you have a property that managed outside of arc say a malloc ed object you need to free it in the dealloc method preferably by setting it to nil and handling the freeing in the setter

when you extend an interface or an abstract-class you are creating a contract of sorts with that superclass

21538526
implements	extends
abstract classes can also extends interfaces so they can implements some of their methods

21538531

this also occurs in other applications that try to record audio with both audiorecord and mediarecorder audiorec hq for example

21538728
auto-generate	edmx
since this is an auto-generate file editing the edmx directly essentially means that those same changes would need to be re-done upon any modification through the designer

21538744

21539440
wookmark	masonry
i m using a masonry plug in called wookmark which is really great but i need it resizing the image holding divs to execute after everything has finished loading so i do

21539470
jpql	hql
that is why your first sql variant with the manual join will not translate 1 1 into hql jpql but look different

21539493
next	except
i find no errors except when trying to use mysql_real_escape_string which will be my next step challenge â but i want to ensure i have the form working with the database properly first so that i can understand where my errors are coming from without being overwhelmed

21539503
rss	feed
a year ago medium.com announced that it would provide rss feed

21539503
rss	feed
i am using wordpress and when i enter a url for an rss feed i receive this message on the page that s loading the script

21539531
typedef	struct
my understanding is that i can t typedef it in the .cpp file because the pimpl struct is private

21539543
integer	unsigned
on the other hand comes out correct because 240 has the same representation both as a signed and unsigned integer

21539570
ssl	https
if you use ssl https you have to make sure that the certificates match the domain

21539576
put	get
worse even i get mixed results on different platforms an arm mali t604 seems to follow the .5 convention whereas an adreno 330 seems to put the pixel centers at full integers both tested on android 4.4.2

21539601

writetofile	nsdata
i use the writetofile atomically method on nsdata which writes the data to a temp file and then renames the temp file to the location i specified

21539648

easy fix would be to multiply the outcome by 100 cast them to an int then divide them by 100 again to a double

21539688
int	chars
my complier error is cannot convert â std string aka std basic_string â to â const chars â for argument â 1â to â int strcmp const chars const chars â

i am updating some code from a vb6 application to vb.net

21539748
width	height
i need link id width height and position

21539753
width	height
when you use weight in a horizontal linearlayout your width should be 0dp and in a vertical linearlayout your height should be 0dp

21539768
16-bit	64bit
it looks like this function just does a 32 x 32 - 64bit signed multiply and then shifts the 64bit result right by 16-bit and truncates it to 32 bits

21539782
getter	setter
had this method been a getter or setter then the use of self keyword would have been necessary to imply that we want to operate on an instance s attribute and not a local variable in the function

21539788
inline	constexpr
... a program that defines main as deleted or that declares main to be inline static or constexpr is ill-formed. ...

21539809
int	double
try casting the value property to the apropriate type string int double and then perform the comparison

21539824
width	height
adding height width and display block will solve it

21539824
width	height
i will let you position the final pixels height width

21539847
switching	screens
i was using setvisible to switching between my two frames which was good because it reused the previous virtual desktop and retained the full screens mode but i had to switching to dispose in order to hide the second jframe because of a toolkit thread paint problem

21539847
switching	screens
now looks like i ll have to live with the repaint.buffer issue to allow full screens switching to work correctly

21539857
set	bag
i personally would store a bag set in java of the column s values

21539875
int	double
the only difference is that javascript uses double for all numbers that is it doesn t have an int type or a single-precision float

21539878
laravel	yii
my choices are yii and laravel

21539883
client-side	server-side
for that you d have to write code for sending the data in the client-side using javascript html and also to process the received data using server-side languages eg php on the server-side

21539904
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome beats firefox hands-down in the performance department

21539916
width	margin
define a width and margin on your div of

21539959
int	chars
numbers are sequential in their ascii values so in order to turn your chars into an int you could simply do

21539979
width	height
i have a of fixed height that acts as a menu of buttons of uniform width

21539982
put	get
i m using get and put and the producer threads spend most of their time blocked in io reading from serial ports - basically doing nothing

21539982
puts	gets
however i seem to have what i would call a high latency between the time a producer thread puts to the queue and the time the consumer thread gets from the queue like 25 ms i m running a 1 processor beagle bone black 1ghz on angstrom linux

21539982
put	get
i would think that if all the processes are blocked then the elapsed time between put and get should be really small a few microseconds or so not tens of milliseconds except when the consumer thread is actually busy which is not the case here

21540032
gruntjs	package.json
this is my package.json for the gruntjs task

21540053
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this is implemented and working in firefox 25.0 google-chrome 45.0 edge 12 and safari 7.1 but not in internet explorer or a bunch of other old or uncommon platforms

when browsers like ie 11 firefox 26 google-chrome 32 etc

21540101
hide	show
here s an example of using javascript to show an element #foo after 1 second and then hide it after another two seconds

21540105
hide	show
like multiply it show only black and dark colors and hide white

21540152
for-loop	loops
this condition in your code make the x for-loop with value 1 so it will be infinitive loops each time x will be with value 2 this condition make x 1 so the condition in loops will not occur and you will get message with wait or close program message

21540153
next	except
you go into none of those if s except for the last one which sets x to -1 so on the next loop iteration it ll become 0 again

21540172
put	get
so the problem is when i go to i get challenged which is to be expected but i does not matter what i put in it looks like the authentication token is not accepted and the browser challenges me again

21540186
cgal	vcg
in case anybody interested this is can by done through vcg library or cgal

21540202
post	get
you shouldn t use post method to get data

21540220
post	put
am aware that not all settimout tasks put on the queue are actually fired thanks a post by bobnice on this

21540226
google-chrome	firefox
it s working on ie and firefox but not on google-chrome

21540250
portrait	landscape
this set of data must be viewable in two different ways no this is not about landscape portrait thus two different views

21540251
hash	md5
if a user the server generates api token sha hash of fields or md5 and some other meta data determining roles to pass back in 1 post reply

21540273
slideup	slidedown
i played around a little bit and this is being caused by the margin-top 39px on your #content div if you remove that and use top 39px instead of margin-top 39px on the #content element instead it doesn t jerk either - but it also causes the button to jump a bit on slideup and slidedown so you will need to tweak the css of the button wrapper area like so

21540336
folder	directory
after that i transffered the created folder into another directory and just edit the index.php and set the correct path for yii framework

21540379
http	spdy
i would like to compare the performance of spdy vs http 2 preferably a recent draft

21540426
for-loop	loops
then after your parallel for-loop the one where you re iterating through both lists one of your indices is always going to break your loops because it s at the end of its list

21540426
for-loop	loops
for in-order merging i usually declare i j outside loops you ll need then after your first for-loop like above and then do something like in your notation

21540426
for-loop	loops
after your first for-loop you get to the end of exactly one of the lists someone s going to break loops so exactly one of the above loops is going to get executed and that will contain the remaining items in order

21540436
hide	show
basically you need to create another view right on top of your uiviewcontroller s view in storyboard and make it hidden connect its outlets to the controller and when a button that flips your presentation styles gets hit you need to either show or hide your second representation view like this

21540447
for-loop	arrays
the only other way i can think of for displaying arrays is by iterating over the arrays with a for-loop

21540454
nsurlcache	nscache
note that nscache and nsurlcache are two very different classes

21540454
nscache	uiimage
uiimageview+afnetworking uses nscache to store uiimage objects

21540454
uicollectionview	uitableview
nsurlcache stores nsdata objects and retrieving objects from this cache is typically not performant enough for image-heavy applications that show images in a uitableview or uicollectionview

21540454
afnetworking	sdwebimage
sdwebimage offers disk and memory caching and gives you much more control over the details than afnetworking s uiimageview+afnetworking

21540503
min	max
then the min max assignment seems to have wrong indentation..

21540532
box-sizing	border-box
it s most likely because bootstrap 3 uses box-sizing border-box

21541036
csv	tsv

21541066
button	checkbox
checking a checkbox enables a disabled button

21541077
crfsuite	crf++
i ve realized that 3 implementations of crf stanfordner crf++ and crfsuite has python bindings but only by crfsuite i can train a model in python while with crf++ and stanfordner i can only try the existing models in python

21541078
maven	pom.xml

21541246
distance	polygons
the one drawback is that distance between vertices might be slightly less intuitive than polygons area but the two are proportional

21541247
innodb	myisam
further when it is needed to update many rows in a mysql table in a single statement sometimes it would be better with myisam which does table level locking as opposed to innodb which does row level locking

21541247
innodb	myisam
you could try switching between myisam and innodb to find the better suitable engine for this table in your application

21541273
puma	webrick
some issues in the dashing repo suggest using a different webserver such as webrick or puma

21541278
mouseleave	mouseenter
if you are handling ui display items in the code behind you can simply handle the event and change the border thickness with the mouseenter and mouseleave events

21541284

safari and firefox appear to work properly however google-chrome seems to keep the session cache as valid meaning that the user is logged in when they browse to my site

indent your code one more level so that it belong to the post function and you should get rid of the problem

ubuntu	linux
obviously you ll need to run both the windows and the linux version of svnserve to make this happen using the same repo - and might give you issues with line endings ie the ubuntu version of svnserve will not be able to read files created by the windows version but i think you might be able to jiggle settings and run the linux version under windows which might be able to handle the linux-line endings correctly

21550809

however the best answer is to run a little linux vm that contains your repo and a svn server and mount it on both windows and ubuntu

21552908
width	height
i have an input field with a background and a fixed width height

21552985
width	height
when included in a listview row it should fill 100 of the row height and set its width to be the same as its height

21552985
width	height
my guess is that sometimes the height of the relativelayout must be returning 0 thus causing the squareview to set its own height and width to 0

free	malloc
if you want multiple threads to work on the same memory you should probably put the malloc and free into the code that starts and joins the threads

21553363
free	malloc
if the global pointer is some kind of global ressource and the threads don t have to work on it in parallel you should put a mutex around the entire function from malloc to free

21553363
free	malloc
if you only protect malloc and free seperately one thread could free the memory that another thread is working on

implements	extends
the first one is extends the dependencyactivatorbase class needed for using the felix dependencymanager and implements the init method where the component is created and configured

21554243
width	height
your inner class ring_main doesn t override onmeasure so it is going to have zero height and width

21554243
width	height
your onmeasure implementation is wrong because you ignore the possible mode attached to the incoming width and height

21554243
width	height
it will also be up to you to override onsizechanged to calculate what actual height and width you will use to draw your arc as well as any offsets required to possibly center the arc within the view

portrait to landscape i lose no data

21554809
portrait	landscape
landscape to portrait i lose data

21554809

the only sense i can make from this is that the oncreate method is recalled when going from landscape to portrait however not from portrait to landscape

21554861
profiling	debugging
first and foremost never profiling in debugging

21555220
onresume	onpause
your problem sounds weird however i think you must override the methods onpause and onresume because when you rotate the screen these methods will be invoked so you must store your state when the screen is rotated onpause and restore the state when the screen is redrawn onresume

21556015
opera	google-chrome
there is margin 10px in the top of the page in opera and google-chrome

21556034
min	max
ok in order to divide the attributes you need to feed the reducer with the max and min values instead of relying on the reducer to do the work for you

21556034
min	max
you can implement the cleanup method so that it gets the max and min values of each of the attributes for each of the map nodes

21556034
min	max
then the reducer gets the max and min values for each of the attributes since it will be a very short collection so there won t be any problems

21556034
min	max
you need to remember that you cannot save the values in the context variable in the map method you need to do this in the cleanup method after iterating through the hashmap and finding out the max and min value for each column

21556034
min	max
bear in mind that you will receive one column for each mapper so if you have 20 mappers you will receive 20 max values and 20 min values for each attribute

21556034
min	max
therefore you need to calculate the max and min again just like you did in the cleanup method of the mappers and once this is done then you can finally calculate the buckets

21556034
min	max
you may be wondering if i still need to find the max and min values in the reducer then i could omit the cleanup method and do everything in the reducer after all the code would be more or less the same

21556046
post	get
i am trying to do a simple form with get and post and am having no end of grief

equals	gethashcode
if you don t have equals and gethashcode implemented in employeeobject class then employees will be compared by reference

21556440
equals	gethashcode
if you can t or don t want to change implementation of employeeobject class and override its equals and gethashcode methods then you can create custom comparer for employees

21556440
equals	gethashcode
or you can project your employees to anonymous objects which have default implementation of equals and gethashcode

21556487
equals	gethashcode
but if you need to match on all properties you need to override equals and gethashcode

udp	tcp
you will need to decode the headers of tcp udp and even ip to get that info

21556980
udp	tcp
your application will essentially need to be able to interpret and construct ipv4 and ipv6 headers and options and as the ip payload the udp headers and tcp headers and options

21556997
width	height
this code will size the uiimageview according to its superview s width and height

21556998
width	height
you can do this by not explicitly declaring width and height in the svg which is overwritten by css anyway using the viewbox attribute and then allowing anythingzoom to clone the content of your original chart

21556998
width	height
since you are drawing in svg using d3 where you need to know the width and height for the pack layout and using a jquery plugin which zooms by setting classes and absolute positioning you have to share the coordinates the 225px magic number in css and in js

21557015

ideally i would like to just put all the font files within the build folder under a directory structure like . usr share fonts and then reference that within the file section of the spec and let rpm do its magic

range	max	range	min	min	max
so if you append a start smallest and end largest value to your various samples which is the min and max for all samples of interest this forces the histogram range to be equal for all your data sets

range	max	range	min	min	max
to create equal bins you can simply first define a min and max value which is slightly smaller than both range

21562035
subtraction	addition
the addition subtraction of 0.05 is based on knowledge of the range of values - you don t want your extra bin to be too far or too close to the actual range

21562035
min	max
that being said for this example by using the joint min max values this code will work irrespective of the a and b values generated

21562043

getter	setter
i d like to create a class in js that uses native getter and setter

21564885
getter	setter
i know i can create getter setter for objects like so

21564885
getter	setter
is there any better way to add getter and setter to js class than

21564897
getter	setter
the compiler also generates hidden methods with special names for auto property getter and setter event add remove handlers and some other cases you won t encounter these since these auto-generated methods can t call your getcurrentmethod

21564897
getter	setter
but note also that manual property getter and setter have special names like get_propertyname and you may see those if you have a property whose code calls getcurrentmethod

21565773
post	get
get and post - are pretty obvious they already have the type defined

21565776
hide	show
your navigation doesn t show on page load because you re relying on javascript to hide and show it but your javascript only fires when the navigation button is clicked not on page load

21565776
hide	show
have javascript hide the navigation on page load - set left -25 on either toplevelnavigation1 or toplevelnavigation2 depending on which one you want to show on page load

21565776
hide	show
hide your navigation by default with css - add left -25 by default on your html by means of a class make sure you remember to remove the class with javascript when you want to show it or just add an inline style

21565776
hide	show
the second method is definitely the more preferred method as you re not relying on javascript to load the initial state of your site and you don t have to wait until the dom is ready to hide your navigation potentially having the navigation show and then disappear for no reason

they then click submit and two numbers are randomly generated for addition or subtraction

21566179
subtraction	addition
i have an addition function and a subtraction function to determine the total below

21566179
subtraction	addition
my problem is this when they choose the mixed radio button to randomize between addition and subtraction i can get it to randomly choose addition or subtraction but can t get it to keep randomizing between the two

21566179
subtraction	addition
..if the number is below 5 then the total is the value of the subtraction function and if its above 4 then the total is the value of the addition function

21566179
subtraction	addition
i need to be able to regenerate the random number when the user answers the question correctly or if they click the next button which skips the current question so that the questions are a mixture of addition and subtraction

in this case you can try to use htfp instead of hdfs or upgrade your cluster to the latest versioning of cdh4 and check the release notes to see if there is any relevant known issue and work-around

21586472
min	max
3.4 if actual premium is higher then p avg make min avg because implied volatility must lie between avg and max

every type of input in html needs to be inside a form and form tags that define the method which the form is sent post or get and what is the destination what php file defined by action parameter

21586514
folder	directory
keep in mind that headers accessed with #include ... require their folder to be set as an include external directory so qualifying up to that path won t work

21586543
apache	nginx
for production you should use the options built in web servers such as apache or nginx

21586563
getter	setter
hence a getter and a setter for this field are not required in the corresponding action class

21586563
getter	setter
since there are no getter and setter for this field in the action class it produces a message quite unnecessarily on the server terminal something like the following

21586572
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome there are element inspectors that highlight the region and or element that your mouse is currently hovering over such as the div it is currently hovered over or a button if it is hovered over that

that implies that you are doing an upgrade of some kind and at that point i get lost because upgrade just work - if the file is already there it gets updated or not based on versioning rules

21586640
range	max	range	min	min	max
you can go with random class and give min and max according to the range random value you required

21586682
setinterval	settimeout
use setinterval instead of settimeout

21586686
switching	screens
edit the galaxy s4 emulator s definitions to 5 so you have the right screens size it will auto-change the size to large so you will need to decide if you need to switching it to normal then go from there

21586733
int	double
my data can be either int double or a string so i can always try to cast them into int and if it fails cast it into double and if that fails for all element return system.string

drupal_http_request does allow post but it defaults to get

21586840
google-chrome	firefox
but when the function opens it in a div i get a replacement characters sprinkled about in the form of a small box in ie and a black diamond with a question mark in google-chrome and firefox

21586891
post	get
the next step would be to check that the request should run this implies you can uniquely identify each request i.e by checking some value in get post - this allows you to make sure that if request #200 was processed let s say in the last minute you will ignore it and allow for request #201 to run

21586899
versioning	upgrade
finally you need to upgrade to a current versioning

21586905
width	height
i have a basic html table and the width and height are both restricted so that it scrolls both vertically and horizontally

21586957
overwrite	preserve
-p to preserve status -update to overwrite data if a file is already present but has a different size

21586975

safari does see it as an illegal character the second hash but other modern browsers ie google-chrome are fine with them

21586991
min	max
i need to calculate and retrieve the average max min etc

21586991

when i use google-chrome or firefox i can login independantly to each websites even at the same time

21587013
lwp	libwww-perl
it looks like you combined a recent version of libwww-perl lwp useragent with an lwp protocol https from an older installation of libwww-perl

21587013
versioning	upgrade
i would also suggest to upgrade to a newer versioning of io socket ssl because the one you use is also fairly old nearly 4 years and lots of features and fixes were added in the meantime

21587021

put	get
while if i put the same result in the xy in the first place i ll get the fine result

21587078
width	height
if you are using the image control whether in xaml or code behind to display the images then you can set height and width on the control itself

21587078
width	height
in your case you know that you always want the first image to be larger than others so set the height width property of the image control accordingly

21587103

21587178
hide	show
you can hide the alert-box by default with css and use javascript to show it when there s no cookie

21587179
for-loop	arrays
to get all dots we get the number of arrays already created from the variable saved in nsuserdefaults and run a for-loop

21587179
for-loop	arrays
we then add each arrays that we created to an nsmutablearray now all we have to do is extract it later on with objectatindex in another for-loop and do all our code there

21587244
getter	setter
i know in java we would most likely want to make these fields private and use getter and setter to access them

21587287
public	protected
yes - php5+ supports public protected private methods in classes

21587287
getter	setter
you don t need to design getter setter but if the class grows adds functionality it ll be safer than letting people call the properties directly

21587346
width	height
just add height and width constraints to the search bar and pin it to top left and right

21587356
hide	show
and to hide and show the canvas and got the same behavior

my class already extends an activity so not sure how to implements the onsizechanged

21587368
width	height
how to get the imageview width and height

21587370
width	height
you can calculate the actor s width and height at runtime for example you you want to fill the entire screen and you know how many buttons you want horizontally and vertically then

21587395
serializable	deserialization
it seems to me that this is not likely to be robust for serializable deserialization of the state across different compilations and probably not even across runs of the same binary in the presence of aslr. in the abstract there are going to be versioning challenges to be sure but it doesn t seem like protothreads even gets that far

21587399

hide	show
that s how i managed to deal with this problem by making the browser think the user blured the input so it hide the keyboard before it has time to show

21587844
instances	transient
this forces hibernate to go to the database to determine if an instances is transient or detached unless there is a version or timestamp property or you define interceptor.isunsaved .

21587852
pop-up	dialog
the following button is labeled show hint and pop-up a dialog box when activated

i read a bit around some other post and i ve figured out that i need to get the point of collision and then somehow turn that into a vector to update the ball s position

21587982
put	get
put them in another static or singleton class so they won t get deleted once you change your state

21588018
bower	npm
given that the javascript community calls their version of those tools npm and bower package managers i think that the development community has essentially synonymized those terms

21588055
textview	imageview
i basically need one textview one imageview under it then one listview and one more multi-line textview

21588060
width	height
and part of the collision mechanics require getting the width and height of the canvas to redirect the ball

21588111
post	get
the risk described in the post you linked to was that session-specific states didn t get cleaned up as a given db connection was inherited by a subsequent php request

21588149
folder	directory
a composer plugin to install differenty types of composer packages in custom directory outside the default composer default installation path which is in the vendor folder

21588149
folder	directory
by adding the installer-paths part you are telling composer to install the monolog package inside the monolog folder in your root directory

21588152
uilabel	uitextview
also cool is the fact that you can set textcontainerinset and linefragmentpadding so if you want to increase this or have a uitextview that renders with no insets so it matches a uilabel for example you can

int	double
how do i access each int of a double and how would i turn my array of int back into double

21588183
int	double
one operand is an int the other operand is a double and we have mixed types

21588183
int	double
java does us a favor and casts the int to a double to preserve accuracy

21588190
width	height
the image width and height are read-only properties so they will cause the code to break in some browser

21588190
width	height
if you absolutely want to set the width and height before loading the image you can do

21588193
children	parent
table rows have to always be a part of the table if you want these rows to be children of some parent row - they have to belong to their own table

21588193
hide	show
this code handles click on the expand icon and hide or show child rows accordingly

21588201
spaces	linefeed
s character that represents any spaces character carriage return linefeed tabs spaces ...

21588208
children	parent
of course like scalabilitysolved said if you know the parent you can just multi-get on the array of children and not even need a view at all unless you have to search for the parent via various json properties and not the key itself

21588212
onclientclick	scriptmanager
how to add if condition to scriptmanager s onclientclick of ok in aspx.cs

create css rules that show hide the content for the appropriate starting state

21588274
int	chars
so i cannot somehow put an int array on a 0 a chars array on a 1 -- java arrays are single-type

21588274
int	chars
i m aware that i can declare 2 parallel arrays-- one int and one chars and that solves it

21588279
express	node.js
i have a node.js express server which breaks down chunks of json into smaller sections and routes the request via url s for mobile devices and various other apps i am creating

21588281

first create a function to show and hide divs

21588288
google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure what causes this behaviour to be different in firefox and google-chrome

21588288
google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome but breaks in firefox too long as expected from the height + the padding

21588296
int	double
java assumed that the 1 3 is dividing two int so you d get an int back casted into a double

width	height
and i want it to have a 100 width or height based on the browsers window size

21588372

21588379
ubuntu	mint
so i look up the sdl development package in ubuntu mint

21588423
folder	directory
i want to create a directory selector in java but when doing this using the jfilechooser and set it to directories-only you get an unclear layout of the folder just a normal filechooser layout

21588423
folder	directory
for folder however i think its more useful to show a filetree showing all directory with the main disk as root like a normal windows filechooser see this post this guy wants to do the same thing but not in java

21588427
associativity	operator-precedence
i ve read from here and there from stackoverflow and from other websites that expression evaluation is dependent from operator-precedence and associativity of the operators

21588443
getter	setter
yes in general properties should be made protected or private and getter and setter offered

21588443
getter	setter
however if the code is intended for release as a f oss library then there s an argument for forcing child classes use the getter and setter methods in which case the properties should be private

21588482
octree	quadtree
you may also find quadtree or octree in a 3d system to be particularly useful if you run into performance difficulties

you can see i used _delegate to use the show and hide functions i used nslog to make sure that im calling the functions correctly

21588721
width	height
the same way you set the height you may set the width to the maximal width of the current layout

21588749
ssl	https
opencart by default works with ssl only in checkout pages and when user is logged in as such the only way for you to have https in all url is to force via .htaccess the simplest solution if this is the case is to remove the redirection that forces https in .htaccess enable ssl in opencart backend and change the config file site url from http to https although these are steps you should have taken before and a simple removal of the right lines in .htaccess should suffice

21588750
int	chars
those chars aren t your random chars instead of random int

firefox and google-chrome do fetch the data every second

21588763

rank	max
essentially the query would be select max week from datatable where rank 0

21588869
for-loop	arrays
without the for-loop you access the arrays elements with a fixed constant a constant which the optimizer can easily proove will lead to an uninitialized value which is also never used again

21588869
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
with the for-loop you have a second usage of the values through the use of a dynamic index and the optimizer has to ensure that the undefined value you read from the arrays elements in the first cout is the same as the one that is later read within loops

21588875

21588908
getter	setter
as setter and getter are known for accessing and mutating properties of a class it would seem they are also treated as class properties as opposed to a typical method but this is not entirely the case

21588908
getter	setter
in fact only the setter appears as a property of the public interface the getter on the other hand is a method that can read like a property

21588929
google-chrome	firefox
so i can t access my login page frome google-chrome but it works fine with firefox

21588959
width	height
also i want to be able to use width 100 and height 100 inside my content without it overflowing and creating a mess

21588961
jar	manifest.mf
big chance that those are actually of legacy jsf 1.x version you d first extract the jar file with a zip tool and then read the meta-inf manifest.mf file for the exact version detail which used the ancient jsp as default view technology which in turn at least explains why all your views were by default interpreted as jsp

21588996
pop-up	dialog
with just a handful of lines you get a pop-up dialog that can save any component to a variety of scalable and regular image formats

21589043
children	parent
this is easily achievable when you don t actually contain the intended children in the parent element but instead fake hierarchy visually while keeping the dom layout flat

21589043
children	parent
notice that the parent element isn t actually around the so-called children elements

21589052

personally i wish every object behaved like calayer and caanimation where you can attach as much data to it as you like in the form of key-value pairs as if the object were secondarily a kind of nsdictionary

21589991
plot	heatmap
i want to plot a confusion matrix but i don t want to just use a heatmap because i think they give poor numerical resolution

21590047
fadein	fadeout
i am using fadein fadeout to change the list and autocomplete feature

21590078
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i have the web page tested on google-chrome firefox opera and ie on desktop and on various mobile phones as well

21590088
websphere	ibm
this bothered our ibm websphere developers who expected something else

21590101
post	get
your type post should be get

21590105
width	height
basically what i need is to have a full window layout full width full height no scrolling - ever

21590105
width	height
100 of width and height should be covered using two different horizontal boxes you can see them as rows

21590120
children	parent
a parent pom passes values to its children while an aggregator pom manages a group of subprojects or modules

21590120
maven	pom.xml
when you run mvn clean install site now maven must build the parent pom.xml here parentaggregator so it has the information required for the child modules depending on it

21590120
maven	pom.xml
if you have a multi-module build where the aggregator pom.xml the one with packaging of pom.xml and the modules section is also the parent referenced by its child modules and the aggregator version does not match the version specified in the parent section of the child modules maven will not let you build the project

21590183
hide	show
the problem essentially is that if you call .modal hide and then .modal show in rapid succession it gets confused -- i believe this is because the css transitions it uses aren t complete yet and show get s called while it is still transitioning

21590205
inherited	properties
that is will it creep up during comparison or inherited after i override the constructor s prototype and constructor properties

21590228
box-sizing	border-box
if you re defining the site header using percentages and if you don t need to support ie 8 then you can use percentages safely with box-sizing border-box to achieve the same

21590245
junit	testng
you could have left your build alone and changed your job to archive junit results instead of testng results

21590255
put	get	post	get	post	put
these resources can be independently managed using post get delete put crud operations

21590261
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it in google-chrome and firefox and it seemed to fix the issue

21590349
accessor	properties
note that __proto__ is an accessor proterty internally a getter not a real properties so it cannot be changed

21590384
versioning	upgrade
if you re not using recent versioning you thus have a reason to upgrade

21590395
qcombobox	qstyleditemdelegate
i m trying to subclass qstyleditemdelegate to remove the focus rectangle in a qcombobox

21590421
hide	show
basically i need this create 2 qwidgets from 1 window go to first window and from there hide main window and show second window created by main window although main window is not main it is qwidget too

21590421
hide	show
the final goal is to be able show and hide both gamewindow.cpp and world.cpp from battle.cpp just regular class

21590423
draggable	droppable
i know i can set the class for a droppable object when a valid draggable is hovering using hoverclass

21590428
background-position	background-size
with background-position center you can put the image to the center and with background-size cover you set the picture to fit all the screen

21590464
teamcity	jenkins
on the production server you will just pull the latest changes when you want to make an update or use a continuous integration server - jenkins teamcity bamboo etc

21590464
pull	push
on your local you will push pull changes to the same subversion server

21590495
fullscreen	minimized
i d also like to change the icon from maximize to the minimized icon once the screen is on fullscreen but i don t know how to do that yet

21590587
cpython	ironpython
there seems to be a difference in the elementtree and xmllib implementation shipped with ironpython 2.7.4 when compared to cpython 2.7.4 2.7.6 and you could should probably file a bug for that

21590642
gmail	outlook.com
gmail aol and outlook.com all do not support media queries

21590687
width	text-align
the display inline-block and text-align center technique does work here but you need to make sure that on the smaller screen your ul #nav is not floated and doesn t have a width set

21590691
min	max
i would like to provide a function that finds the value of x that corresponds to either the min or max sampled value of y

21590702
min	max
if the min salary is not specified it should be set to 0 similarly if max salary is not specified it should be set to

21590744
melt	reshape
in which case i suggest checking out plyr and reshape packages and specficially the functions melt and ddply within each

21590768
post	get
i start building a query to update the table name then fire a post request to get this thing going

21590785
metaphone	soundex
for what it s worth postgresql has a contrib module fuzzystrmatch that implements soundex metaphone double metaphone and levenshtein distance functions

21590785
postgresql	mysql
if it were up to me i d build this in postgresql rather than mysql

21590827
hide	show
use some jquery focus focusout to show hide the icon

21590846
cocoapods	carthage
thanks for all your support this is now on cocoapods carthage spm at

21590846
portrait	landscape
this gives us automatic placement for all scenarios ios6 7 8 9 iphone ipad image no-image accessory no-accessory portrait landscape 1x 2x 3x

21590851
min	max
if the min and max values are both r then all values are r or null

21590911
factors	matrix
i attach a solution it should work on any matrix of factors

21590933
button	checkbox
i am selecting checkbox and then click a next button to go to the next tab which has an almost identical grid of persons bound to selectedpersons

21590997
mouseup	mousedown
by logic a mousedown event has to be followed by paired with a mouseup event

21590997
mouseup	mousedown
the only reasonable progression is mousedown followed by a corresponding paired mouseup

21590997
onmousedown	onmouseup
create a new vcl forms application or fmx application - replace tshape with tmemo or any other control with an onmousedown and onmouseup event in the following steps

21590997
mouseup	mousedown
experiment with pressing the mouse button over the shape to set the label s caption to mousedown and then moving the mouse to various locations and releasing the button watching the label change to mouseup each time the button is released regardless of the location of the mouse pointer

21591017
qsort	bsearch
i suggest to use double into the array treated by qsort and bsearch

21591018
pull	push
i imagine that one answer to the first question would be that the owner of b could pull the contents of the a repo and then push the resulting state to the b repo but i was wondering if there s a way to update the b repo directly from the github web interface.

21591067
min	max
for example it would be easier to have two functions one that calculates the min and other that calculates the max and then call either of them depending on the value of ismin

21591100
mouseleave	mouseenter
in jquery hover is a combination of mouseenter and mouseleave events so you can bind a handler for a hover start

21591133
pull	push
this causes problems if you have push ed the project to other contributors who will have to pull a fresh copy and re-apply any pending changes

21591185
google-chrome	firefox
i just tried this out in the latest google-chrome firefox and ie and it is allowed

21591195
button	checkbox
for a mobile version of a website iâ m using jquery to create a div element close button inside another div checkbox elements

21591195
button	checkbox
this works fine but when i add a click function to the div inside close button i canâ t hide the parent div checkbox elements

21591195
button	checkbox
when i attach the close button to any other element outside the checkbox elements div it works fine

21591199
post	get
to port all of the features of some modules to web services would be a significant undertaking but there are some low-hanging fruit to get activity lists forum discussions post choice polls etc

21591202
equals	gethashcode
the problem is that .distinct determines what s distinct based on the gethashcode and equals implementation of the underlying objects

21591205
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
all of the viewcontroller logs are obviously from my uiviewcontroller and ones are from my uinavigationcontroller delegate

21591209
put	get
if you are here seeking a solution to get all branches and then migrate everything to another git server i put together the below process

21591215
int	chars
-edit just changed the first line as i recalled that if you convert from a factor to a number what you get is the int of the factor level and not the number you think you are getting to factors first need to be converted to chars then numbers which was can do just by wrapping as.character inside as.numeric

21591253
post	get
how the values are sent depends on the method get post

21591261
put	get	post	get	post	put
knowing the rest api you should know with get you get some data with post you create and store data with put you update data and with delete you delete data

21591270
width	height
i have a container spanning 100 width and 100 height and i need to absolutely position a block of text which have a variable number of lines so that the bottom of the bottom line of the text block is at a fixed vertical position in the container

21591307
serializable	deserialization
eventually all you need to do is handle serializable and deserialization but that should be a rather thin layer on top of a lightweight client which does not attempt to do any of that for you

21591364
postgresql	mysql
looking at the desired app and given that it s for learning purposes i d suggest to pick sinatra + erb haml + mysql postgresql since it s lighter extremely easy and quick to learn

21591407
queue	circular-buffer
one can easily write a list-like or circular-buffer lock-free producer consumer queue but no standard c++ container can qualify

21591416
system.io.compression	sharpcompress
i learned that i can add references to sharpcompress system.io.compression but not .filesystem only

21591416
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
sharpziplib dotnetzip don t seem to support wp8

21591437
scala	typesafe
when i compile from the gradle scala plugin or via the typesafe scalaide with scala 2.10.2 or 2.10.3 i get the following type of un-useful error messages

21591458
google-chrome	firefox
not to mention firefox and google-chrome work slightly differently

21591458
udp	tcp	sctp	tcp	sctp	udp
one good thing about the sctp channel is that you can use a reliable data connection tcp instead of unreliable udp and the data gets sent in order

21591484
int	chars
i m not sure why this is exactly happening but it has to be because it expects an int and i m passing chars

21591501
google-chrome	safari	ubuntu	linux
linux x86_64 applewebkit 537.36 khtml like gecko ubuntu chromium 32.0.1700.102 google-chrome 32.0.1700.102 safari 537.36

21591522
int	chars	spaces	delimiter
it is stated the first argument will be a path to a filename containing a series of spaces delimiter chars followed by an int representing a index into the list 1 based one per line

21591536
width	height
i need to resize images bigger than 600x600 could be any width height starting from the given one but when i pass the size to gm it creates an image that doesn t have the same size i requested

21591561
uniform	phong
the goal here is just to copy the phong shader so i can modify the uniform vert and frag on it

21591571
mouseleave	mouseenter
true since moving the image triggers the mouseleave event leave callback sends it to its original location thus triggering mouseenter and so on for ever and ever unless you move the mouse away

21591588
int	chars
we tried fprint but that transformed the int into a chars and changed the bits

21591592
firefox	safari
copy the url and run the app in firefox or safari

21591592
firefox	safari
in the dart editor you can just righ-click the file you want to run any build folder piratebadge.html in this case select copy the path then paste the path into your browser s address bar for me it works only in firefox and does not work in safari and hit enter

21591599
inherited	subclassing
constructors are not inherited so subclassing of anabstractclass won t necessarily have a two-argument constructor

21591636
jaxb2-maven-plugin	xjc
in the maven project i am using jaxb2-maven-plugin to generate xsd schemagen classes xjc

21591637
hex	binary
i ve been using images to store data since editing binary data through paint.net is much friendlier than most hex editors

21591637
integer	unsigned
since java does not have unsigned ints the top bit of the integer or long is the negative sign bit even though bit 32 the lower integer pixel will be an ordinary bit in the long integer

21591646
post	get
also can post this on wp stack overflow but so tends to get better answers for server regex htaccess questions

21591684
put	get
i ve put the project to github actually made some helper class to cut down boilerplate but you ll get the point

21591709
implements	extends
you ll have to implements a class which extends org.apache.ivy.core.pack.archivepacking and declare it in your ivysettings.xml like this

21591717
versioning	upgrade
we re running the wso2 api manager 1.4 and would like to upgrade to the latest versioning 1.6

21591724
hide	show
when readmore is clicked it hide the excerpt and show the full content then re names the buttons to hide then when hide is clicked again it has to show the excerpt again and hide the full content

21591749
button	checkbox
ignoring the fact that checkbox should have distinct names where radio button share a name attribute you could do this

21591767
udp	tcp
imo the best bandwidth estimation tools is udp based not influenced by latency unlike tcp brute force not influenced by other traffic with custom made control flow tuned for high speed networks

21591851
int	double
edit i am required to use a collection of type number to add a sequences mixed int and double and ensure that when cast back the int are returned as int and double are returned as double

21591851
int	double
the question i am attempting to complete is as follows testnumberparsimony test that when mixed int and double concrete types are added to a statcollection they maintain their concrete types as int or double

21591851
int	double	min	max
the mode min or max should return concrete type as int or double according what types the numbers were when they were added to the statcollection

21591896
setcontentview	findviewbyid
specifically you should also read up on how findviewbyid works and what setcontentview does

21591909
projectile	angle
then i convert the angle to a vector and multiply it by 15 the speed of the projectile

21591921
post	get
do the call with method get - this works but i need do it by post

21591921
post	get
it seems like if it does a first call right but get redirected and then loses the post data in the way

21591939
box-sizing	border-box
you may modify the box class such that box-sizing is set to border-box

21591985
rubygems	rvm
i ve tried to manually run rake out of the terminal in multiple different rubygems files including rvm

21592008
int	double
when you load the double and int values into the array they lose identity as double or ints--they are autoboxed and stored as instances of the abstract number class

21592011
for-loop	arrays
the problem i am having is that the for-loop to read in the arrays values doesn t work properly

21592023
int	double
all values are double or float beacuse it s related to physics and can t use int values

21592024
oncreate	onstart
you are launching an activity during oncreate - you will not see your main activity it never reaches onstart or onresume

21592029
margin	height
now that i know the height of a block i can take the current y coordinate of the destination object subtract it from the total height of a page minus bottom margin to get my available space

21592067
ienumerable	iqueryable
note that it doesn t return iqueryable or ienumerable but just the entity

21592091
post	get
sending the correct post get data and make it work

21592115
rspec	capybara
so i want to test a user deleting their account using capybara and rspec

21592159
int	double
if you can convert your double somehow to an unsigned int 0-255 or signed -128 - 127 then you just need to cast each double to byte and assigned it to a new array otherwise you have to use bytebuffer

21592203
submit	submission
but the change event is not triggering form submit so i tried trigger submit but the page is refreshing instead of submission in ajax

21592234
integer	unsigned
having done some research the problem seems to be related to signed unsigned 32 64 bit integer operations

21592257
int	chars
the console.read function reads the next single chars of input and returns it as as int value

21592261
postgresql	mysql
in mysql and postgresql

21592295
post	get
in android application call web api to send or receive data get post

21592471

the problem is i want to draw a hierarchical bar chart every time one clicks a bar the sub layout of that bar is shown just like this one however the value of parent node is the sum value of its children node

21592482
filewriter	bufferedwriter
you have to flush and close bufferedwriter not filewriter

21592485
comparator	comparable
i ve read i need a comparator or to implement comparable but i don t know how to do that and i think there might be a simpler solution although perhaps not as efficient

21592492
switching	screens
and from there when the if statement is true then switching to a panel that displays the pipes and start moving the pipe across the screens

21592496
apache	nginx
apache is probably the easiest most widely installed although you can use node nginx etc

21592511
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
using the and javascript code provided by the google groups configuration system things work when i view the page in safari version 6.1 8537.71 and google-chrome 32.0.1700.107 but not firefox 26.0 running on mac os x 10.8.5

21592511
google-chrome	safari
now the curious thing is that using the debug consoles in google-chrome and safari they both report an error too mdash

21592511
google-chrome	safari
this seems to imply that the reason it works in safari and google-chrome is that google is sending an invalid header which seems unlikely and safari and google-chrome therefore ignore it or that both browsers are unable to interpret x-frame-options which as far as i can tell is not supposed to be the case

21592511
google-chrome	safari
i ve now determined that google-chrome and safari do not implement support for allow-from in x-frame-options

21592511
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
in view of the above my original question is basically answered the reason safari and google-chrome display the embedded page is that they currently ignore the security header value whereas firefox doesn t and correctly blocks the embedding because the value of allow-from is not the domain of the page enclosing the iframe mydomain.org as it needs to be

21592525
maven	pom.xml
if it s a maven project make sure the pom.xml has the following w in the project build plugins element

21592621
treemap	treeset
you are trying to use treeset instances as keys in your treemap

21592621
comparator	comparable
you get a classcastexception when treemap tries to cast the key to a comparable reference in order to use its comparator method

21592640
uilabel	uitapgesturerecognizer
to answer your question about a single uicomponent you could use a uilabel in conjunction with a uitapgesturerecognizer to create the intended effect

21592658
glmnet	predict
another problem in your example is that you need to load glmnet on the workers so that the correct predict function is called

21592667
for-loop	loops	for-loop	while-loop	loops	while-loop
i searched a lot and discovered nice approaches of others that do solve my problem but out of curiosity i would love to know if there is solution to my problem that keeps the while-loop despite a for-loop would be more appropriate in the first place as i know the range but the day will come when i will need a while loops

21592778
mouse	keyboard
this will give the user input events mouse and keyboard the best priority on the wpf dispatcher event loop

21592783
min	max
this actually makes sense since the max and min apply to the whole data rather than sequentially

21592783
min	max
i also tried 2 separate qualify statements to get the min part to apply to the subset of the data created by the max part but that errors

21592784
int	chars
your functions take chars change them to int

x86	64bit
i want the script to read lscpu command to check if the system is an x86 or 64bit system

21592858
gridview	onclientclick
i d prefer not to make all the gridview items have the same onclientclick method because i am adding a drag-and-drop functionality that will use long click and because when i do this even if i make the gridview clickable true it still makes all my gridview items non-clickable so i m wondering how i can do this

21592858
gridview	onclientclick
is there a way that i can put an imagebutton in the actual gridview and set up the onclientclick method the same as this

post	get
i cannot post the entire method but this should get the point across

21592897
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
when the internetaddress arrays get instantiated it get set to null null so the for-loop properly ignores the second item in arraylist but when loops finished the call to addrecepients the arraylist still has the 2nd null from instantiation

width	height
if dialogbox is hidden with display none css any calculation of its or its children s height or width will return 0 as display none means height 0 width 0

21593149
width	height
you also should give minimum width and height on dialog box so until image is loaded it should gain some width and height

21593166
google-chrome	firefox
use firebug extension if you are using firefox if you are using google-chrome no need to install firebug then press f12 and check whether the browser can get the stylesheet file or get an 404 error

21594184
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	webkit	gecko
the particular memory leaks you are referring to are only a problem in older browsers - modern webkit gecko google-chrome safari opera and firefox do not have these problems nor do ie 10 or 11

the conversion to double only happens after 2 3 is computed in int arithmetic

21594901
libpcap	wireshark
take a look at the libpcap library which is used by wireshark and tcpdump if you don t mind writing your own code to parse the files

21594911
int	chars
if your concern is just numeric chars escapes the number is a chars number and can be used fairly directly by just converting it to an int and thence to a chars

21594918
int	chars
your code results an int 329 the result of chars plus chars is int

21594976

set the height and width of the div s parent elements html and body to 100 and zero out the margin

21595026
width	height	width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box	height	border-box
next because you want a border on the div you need to make sure that the border width is included when you specify the width height of the element to do this use box-sizing border-box on the div

21595026
margin	height
because you want a 3px top margin on the div relative positioning of the div will result in a height that is 3px too tall

21595041

earlier we had only get request to download the file but to support new feature we had to customize download by sending post request first and api then sent file directly in response to post request

21595051
int	double
this code takes two int divides them converts the result to a double and stores it in minutes

21595134

this is one of the caveats of rsa which is why things like aes are better suited for longer streams like files

21595143
folder	directory
i am learning vb.net i would like to know how to get all the folder and sub-folder s inside a directory and how to add them all to a listbox

21595147
dictionary	map
the short version the python spec doesn t specify a dictionary implementation but cpython uses a hash map and handles collisions with open addressing

21595149
hash-collision	key
hash table implementations must allow for hash-collision even if two key have same hash value the implementation of the table must have a strategy to insert and retrieve the key and value pairs unambiguously

21595149
cpython	pypy
if the slot is occupied cpython and even pypy compares the hash and the key by compare i mean comparison not the is comparison of the entry in the slot against the key of the current entry to be inserted dictobject.c 337 344-345

21595176
width	height
but that doesn t work because i have to give a absolute width and height

button	checkbox
so i do a foreach loop after i click a button update button to loop the rows and check if the checkbox of that particular row is checked then i want to update all rows together after clicking a button

21595370
getter	setter
you can get methods in order of declaration using debug symbols and since property getter are methods you can with some work obtain a list of properties with explicit getter or setter in order of declaration but the getter of auto-properties have no source code and thus no debug symbols to indicate their location

21595426
onclick	onsubmit
use onclick instead of onsubmit

21595645
apache	nginx
there are simple apache and nginx configurations to do that

21595650
int	chars
the ascii range of the chars representing int is 48 to 57 for 0 to 9

21595650
int	chars
you should subtract the base value 48 from the chars to get its int value

21595677
terminate	timeout
not because it s necessary request_terminate_timeout will terminate php children properly as long as it s lower than the fastcgi timeout but because your scripts can detect the timeout properly if setting max_execution_time fails while they will asusme it worked if they can override it there is no way to read request_terminate_timeout from inside php scripts

21595707
hide	show
here i come with two question one is on onload all listbox to be hide depend of radio button listbox had to show hide listbox but its not working here and other one is i have to check if listbox option value contain null value or empty space if means i have to remove it

when i click on the edit button i need to open the dialog pop-up using jquery dialog

21596452
hide	show
and i also used javascript to turn the hide text into show and show back into hide when clicked on

21596452
hide	show
clicking on the hide and show text has no effect at all

21596452
hide	show
and it correctly turns the hide text into show when i click it but of course does not turn the show text back into hide

21596496
google-chrome	firefox
i ve created a tcpdf using php when i printed out the output using my google-chrome browser and it works great but when i printed it out using firefox some of the words came out at the top of the page

21596521
submit	submission
another thing to note here is that your login.jsp has no submit button and you are not all submission the form so the control never comes inside your action class

21596535
mdpi	hdpi
you can then you use this photoshop script i wrote or cut slice me to export assets from that document to the other resolutions xhdpi hdpi mdpi and ldpi

21596557

so it is best to use git ls-remote --tags to get the right sha1 without importing all the tags i mean 898 of them of the kernel.ubuntu.com git-repos ubuntu linux repo

21596583
daemons	systemd
essentially this is equal to su on most linux systemd except the daemon-thing as there is no daemons ahndling su calls on regular linux systemd

21596658
int	chars
however they are all convertible to std function in the same way that all primitive types can convert to int so passing them into functions involves using the same tricks that let you pass chars and floats into a function like f int a

21596675
queue	fifo
all callbacks when they fire are entered into a fifo queue and run sequentially

21596681
ubuntu	centos

21596989
width	height
set dynamically height and width to different resolution android device

21597001
tingodb	nedb
or it can use an embedded database like sqlite nedb or tingodb but am not entirely convinced since they don t have native enum-like types and might or might not be made for this kind of counting

21597011
elasticsearch	kibana
for authentication you can integrate kibana elasticsearch with any framework example play spring mvc etc which ever your are using.create a login page authentication using the framework point the kibana to web server app server embedded in the framework and pass the kibana request to elasticsearch and response from elasticsearch to kibana through this framework.basically this framework will be a mediator between kibana and elasticsearch.also need to block the elasticsearch server port so that no body could directly access the es

21597011
elasticsearch	kibana
kibana -- intermediate framework -- elasticsearch

21597099
width	height
in my activity i have programatically created list view with both width and height as match_parent

21597178
setinterval	settimeout
adding setinterval argstoarray 500 would just call your first function without any arguments you should use an anonymous function or pass arguments into the setinterval settimeout function see mdn

21597187
pull	push
you want to push objects to the next viewcontroller not pull them from the previous viewcontroller

21597192

youtube	vimeo
youtube makes it easy by hosting predicatably located images and vimeo requires that you go through their api

21597502

chars to ensure short int will have an address multiple of 2 2

21597819
getter	setter
now i want to refactor and use getter and setter

21597819
getter	setter
right click - source - generate getter and setter just creates the functions but does not apply them in the rest of the code

21597824
inherited	properties
the style defined for the same element will be always overwritten if there are duplicated properties and inherited from the previous definition for the same element

21597844
getter	setter
it has an item encapsulate fields which generates getter and setter just as source - generate getter and setter does but in addition it replaces all usages of the fields and makes the fields private

21597844
getter	setter
that is if you create a new class with some getter and setter you can use the help of the source menu by coding the fields only and auto-generate the getter and setter afterwards

21597844
getter	setter
however if you want existing code to use getter and setter instead of direct field access this is a classic case of code refactor ing.

21597866
google-chrome	firefox
how can i see the full preview in both firefox and google-chrome

21597872
hide	show
instead of the hide or show properties use toggle.

21597874

ssl	https
yet i am facing an ssl certificate trouble when switching to https

21598023

how can i access direcly all this data say the factors or the nicely displayed z 0 + i x v + y + i w v i mean without using paste all the time

21598098
hide	show
well the above two functions are good enough to show dependant form section hide and reset other form sections

21598098
hide	show
as from the code above its looking at the data-dependson value to identify which form section to show and which ones to hide

21598314
width	height
here you can arrange your settings like width height or you can describe your date format

21598352

d3.js	leaflet
i think this is one of the best solutions i have found for combining leaflet and d3.js by zjonsson

21599738
d3.js	leaflet
d3.js + leaflet integration

21599738
d3.js	leaflet
in this example the leaflet map is initiated as svg here map._initpathroot with the svg then selected using d3.js after which all the d3.js fun can be had

21599738
d3.js	leaflet
after this d3.js transition options will determine how the d3.js layer reacts to the leaflet map pan zoom event

21599738
d3.js	leaflet
in this way you have the full scope of the d3.js + leaflet libraries without the hassle of calculating map bounds etc as this is handled nicely by leaflet

21599738
d3.js	leaflet
whilst this is not as customisable as d3.js you could always edit the leaflet src code to alter the transition duration

getter	setter
using getter setter methods created in the constructor can work but those getter and setter are public so it won t allow you to hide the value only wrap its get and set with logic

21599817
getter	setter
if you keep the getter and setter as you have them there is no point in making them private

21599817
getter	setter
only the init function has access to the local variable so the setter and getter functions created in that scope also can access that local variable

21599817
getter	setter
but that local variable wont be accessible elsewhere so you must use the getter setter
