ftgl	freetype
id recommend ftgl as already recommended above however i have implemented a freetype opengl renderer myself and thought you might find the code handy if you want reinvent this wheel yourself

480078
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome have a built in web inspector right click and select inspect element

480118
gridview	repeater
i am using a repeater because i have implemented pagination as a gridview was not appropriate due to how i am displaying the content

480139
datalist	repeater
however i think a more appropriate option for you is to use a datalist rather than a repeater as the data list can automatically render 4 columns and it will handle all of the html rendering for you

480177
put	get
the other option is put them on my sqlite database but i worry that that get bigger

480182
spaces	delimiter
i think the key bit here is the single spaces as a line delimiter in the last line 61 sqlchar 0 0 0 status

480216
throttling	throttle
for the attackers at best it will be the same effort to break 100 accounts as it would 1 account but since you re not throttling on a site wide basis you can ramp up the throttle quite quickly

480224
hash	salt
currently we re simply writing a salt hash of the document string to the start of the file before the xml document itself

480234
inherited	properties
the background properties is not inherited from the parent you have to set it yourself

480235
disk	ram
the easiest way to work around it is to copy things to the ram disk eg

480237
hash	md5
you can definitely hash the file though but something like an md5 hash ought to do the trick

480241
hash	salt
you should sign the message by encrypting the salt hash with an asymmetric encryption algorithm and send it along the document

480271
int	chars
if the output is in chars output with length stored in unsigned int length and the matched string needs to go in chars match.

480324
union	distinct
internal exception java.sql.sqlexception columns of type blob may not be used in create index order by group by union intersect except or distinct statements because comparisons are not supported for that type.

480337
ubuntu	linux
it follows what i ve done using ubuntu linux 8.10

480361
factors	mean
i agree on the money as a mean of interchange but nevertheless i consider that as an important factors

480362
int	double
under the covers it uses the same msil for all reference-type specializations so a list string uses the same implementation as a list object with different type-casts at the api boundaries but each value-type uses its own unique implementation list int generates completely different code from list double

480362
int	chars	int	boolean	int	double
the clr allows user code to define new value types structs whereas the jvm provides a fixed collection of value types byte short int long float double chars boolean and only allows users to define new reference-types classes

480405
verilog	vhdl
the motivation i want to implement this in hardware in an fpga in vhdl verilog

480406
post	get
if you use apache httpclient to manage your programmatic http connectivity you get an extremely useful api which makes creating connections and optional automatic re-connecting on fail setting headers post vs gets handy methods for retrieving the returned content and much much more

480496
implements	extends
multiple dispatch further extends this concept to more parameters but is significantly harder to implements in languages like c# not that it can t be done it s just hard

480524
int	boolean
or putting an int as an if condition where a boolean is expected

480542
put	get
and then put it into a generate loop ie it will get unrolled into hardware which will produce parallel hardware for the expressions

480551
hide	show
so in this case it would render a linkbutton hidden by default via styles and a normal button with some javascript registered to hide the button and show the linkbutton

480556
ati	nvidia
as an alternative you can look at some of the different languages for performing general purpose gpu programming gpgpu such as cuda from nvidia or stream sdk from ati

480562
int	double
the previous instruction loads the int value 2000 as a double float using the fild instruction

480577

for a bit of review java.lang.number is the abstract super-type of atomicinteger atomiclong bigdecimal biginteger byte double float int long and short

480647
accessor	properties
this is just an example you know implement good accessor properties and so on.

480654
int	double
all the common numbers int long double etc do implement comparable

480675
accessor	properties
the thing is you can never be completely sure a field won t be used differently or the accessor won t ever change and given the trade off in work there s no reason not to implement a properties

480785
children	parent
relying on a numerical trick where the number of parent-child links the number of children that parent is linked to all children

480833
voip	sip
after setting up your asterisk box to connect to your voip service provider use a software sip phone x-lite is a popular one

480867

so to show it i just have to hide the controller

480883
metaphone	soundex
i ve taken soundex levenshtein php similarity and double metaphone and packaged them up in c# in one set of extension methods on string

480914
implements	extends
all you would achieve is an exception if it did not implements the interface extends or was the class or do nothing if it did

480946
google-chrome	firefox
for ie google-chrome it works mostly fine but from firefox it is quite high chance not to have dopostback in page source

480965

480975
jsf	seam
i am using jsf facelets seam and am trying to display radiobuttons

480987

481126
hash	salt
generate the hash and the salt in your own code

481126
hash	salt
i would recommend fetching the hash and the salt from the database and comparing it to the ones you calculated from the username and password supplied by the party that wishes to be authenticated

481182
button	checkbox
none of these approaches worked - we wound up using the checkbox jquery plug-in that replaces the checkbox and radio button with shiftable images

481227
int	double
looking at your code i think you re actually trying to see if it can be represented exactly as an int in which case why can t you just cast to int then back to double and compare to the original

481227
int	double
any int stored in a double that s within the range representable by an int should be exact iirc because a 64 bit double has 53 bits of mantissa and i m assuming a 32 bit int

481289
post	get
also tried to use post instead of the default get and telling sajax to use post didn t work at all

481355

width	height
php code to go about extracting the width and height of the really large image

481477
int	chars
or make your own print_string to print a null-terminated string using the undocumented int 29h print chars in al

481496
try-catch	exception-handling
if you don t expect the finally block to throw an exception-handling and you don t know how to handle the exception-handling anyway you would just dump stack trace let the exception-handling bubble up the call stack remove the try-catch from the finally block

481496
try-catch	exception-handling
if you want to reduce typing you could implement a global outer try-catch block which will catch all exception-handling thrown in finally blocks

481570
treemap	treeset
however you can write your own comparator and use it to create a treemap number object treeset number or collections.sort list number comparator or arrays.sort number comparator

481573
hash	md5
you can upload an md5 hash of the file and then upload the file and if the file uploaded doesn t match the md5 then it s not finished or if it takes to long perhaps it didn t upload properly

481573
hash	md5
md5 is often used to check the integrity of a file by creating a hash that represents the file

481573
hash	md5
if the file varies at all it will almost always as in basically never for our purposes generate a different md5 hash

481573
hash	md5
the only reason a file would not match it s previously uploaded md5 hash is if it wasn t finished or the md5 file was corrupted on upload

481588
postgresql	mysql
i m using both postgresql and mysql so subqueries are probably bad given that mysql doesn t optimize subqueries pre version 6 anyway

i2c	spi
i am starting to try to interface with some external components skyetek m1 mini or m1 rfid scanner than supports the following protocols ttl spi or i2c

482268
hash	md5
you can specify md5 or sha1 as your hash algorithm or indeed other hash algorithms if supported by future framework versions

482268
hash	salt
what you should do is salt the hash

482268
hash	salt
you store the salt unobfuscated in a column in the db alongside the hash salt + password combination

482268
hash	salt
when the user returns you prepend or suffix the salt to their input in the same way and then do the hash comparison as before

482268
hash	salt
you can safely store the salt in the db because working out a string from its hash is just as hard when you know some of the string as it is when you know none of it provided the password itself is longer than the salt and long enough and strong enough to take a long time to crack by brute force at least 6 chars with at least one case change and a number or non-alphanumeric i d say

482309
folder	directory
i don t need the actual contents of folder being stored in the git directory

i don t know how to make vim macros work but since you asked for tweaks for making emacs as vim-like as possible here s a few additions to vimpulse i use everyday

482859
vim	emacs
and the default vim key bindings are so comfortable that using viper simply means that viper does some emacs customization for you

482859
vim	emacs
as for using vim instead of emacs i love vim but i love the interactiveness of the lisp system that is emacs

i don t know why this would fail for a chars and not an int and it is possible you ve got other problems causing this

483751
octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
hex and octal are just shorter ways to write binary

483757
octal	binary

484736
width	height
if you find yourself in the situation where this is what you want except in the case of a deprecated method referred to in another answer chances are you have an inheritance model where inheritance isn t really modeling is-a scott myers s example square inheriting from rectangle but you can t change a square s width independent of its height like you can for a rectangle and you may need to reconsider your class relationships

484745
teradata	greenplum
for that you want to go to specialists like teradata best in class extremely expensive greenplum asterdata netezza and others

484840
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
note better than just runtimeexception would be to use a more specific unchecked-exception if one is available

484840
illegalstateexception	runtimeexception
other good runtimeexception s to use if they describe the problem you are rethrowing are illegalstateexception typenotpresentexception and unsupportedoperationexception

484849
hex	binary
hex is just less verbose and can express anything a binary number can

484859
config	ini
my clients aren t really the type to understand xml and have asked me make config files more like the old ini style

484898
verilog	vhdl
the only languages i ve ever used that properly support binary numbers are hardware description languages verilog vhdl and the like

484934
background-image	background-color
you could add a background-image to your td and wrap the inner text with an inline element such as a span and style that with a background-color

484961
post	get
i have a webforms page .aspx that accepts parameters via get post and returns xml

484972

484999
getter	setter
does anyone know of an eclipse plug-in or method to get eclipse to generate getter setter on one line like this

485008
post	get
if you post more info on your setup you might get better answers

485035

723 - this set of chars refers to a literal int value

485150
int	chars
my_int_var - this set of chars refers to a variable int value

485188
getter	setter
globals over having getter and setter functions for everything does keep application size down though

485211
getter	setter
this expression will transform the generated getter and setter to be one line

485234
postfix	dovecot
two howtos first second describing how dovecot and postfix can authenticate users using pam and postgresql as backend

485297
ironruby	ironpython
given that there are many .net clones of various languages - f# ironpython ironruby jscript.net for example - visual studio is quite a good way in which you can combine various languages

485343
getter	setter
to access your fields you should declare properties in ifacilitytreeitem interface with getter and setter

485388
vim	emacs
but compared to vim and emacs i m sure the text editor inside visual studio is really lousy

485406
getter	setter
java code formatting in eclipse does not differentiate between getter setter and any other methods in a class

485414
put	get
you need to put it in the routedata to get it to show up

485416
mouse	keyboard
the good thing about those two i have never used emacs before but i still use vi for the most mundane task is the fact they don t interrupt your train of thought you don t have to take your hands out of the keyboard to grab the mouse and hunt in the file menu for the correct option

485472
for-loop	loops
this is shown clearly by the for-loop which is actually an infinite loops

485475
eurekalog	madexcept
my suggestion would be to try either madexcept link text or eurekalog link text

485487
eurekalog	madexcept
i would recommand some kind of exception-hook like eurekalog or madexcept that gives you a nice callstack when exceptions occurs

485525
floor	math.h	ceil	math.h	ceil	floor
i can find ceil and floor in the math.h - but not round

485529
int	double
or to put it another way you can always assign and int value to a double and then compare the double back to the same int and be guaranteed it will be equal

485529
multiplying	subtract
you can also start out by assigning a whole number and have simple comparisons continue to work by sticking to adding subtract or multiplying by whole numbers assuming the result is less than 24 bits for a float abd 53 bits for a double

485529
int	double
so you can treat floats and double as int under certain controlled conditions

485538
vim	emacs
as others have noted the editors in ides are sort of limited compared to either vim or emacs

485538
vim	emacs
at the same time both vim and emacs are available when there s no chance of having a full-blown ide working over ssh sessions for instance

485558
jdom	dom4j
you ought to be using jdom of dom4j to handle nodes if for no other reasons to handle whitespace correctly

485614
strlen	strcpy
you do not strcpy a string you have just strlen d

485614
memcpy	strcpy
edit memcpy is very likely to be faster in any architecture strcpy can only possibly perform better for very short strings and should be avoided for security reasons even if they are not relevant in this case

485640
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
it would be much better to create an nswindowcontroller or nsviewcontroller for each secondary non mainmenu.nib nib and bind the nsarraycontrollers in those nibs to file owner.myarray

485640
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
you can then instantiate the nswindowcontroller or nsviewcontroller passing it an array or array kvc-compliant object before loading the secondary nib

485658
cvs	svn
very good if you are used to sourcesafe or tfs and it can work in the svn cvs checkout-merge-commit way if you want to not the default but easy to change or just use the check out - lock - check in way like vss

485698
post	get

485845
accessor	properties
the right way to do this is to implement accessor methods for the properties then call your own accessor

485845
accessor	properties
when you implement accessor then when an object binds to the properties cocoa will wrap the accessor in kvo magic that will send the appropriate notifications for the mutation

485858
merb	ruby-on-rails
i d advise you to look at bort as a complete ruby-on-rails skeletton app with restful auth builtin one of its fork here or at authlogic a less intrusive auth solution for ruby-on-rails and merb and some others

485872
width	height
the other problem then is that padding and border are added to the height and width in most modern browsers except ie6 ie6 is actually quite logical but does not conform to the spec

485876
vim	emacs
the clarification that great programmers adapt their environment to themselves may have some merit but lots of tools can do that vim and slickedit so there s nothing particular about emacs in that regard

485876
vim	emacs
emacs and vim and slickedit et al is such a tool

485896
int	double
for context imagine a whole library of math theorems you want to use with int double int-rational double-rational bigint or bigint-rational types depending on what you are doing and the speed precision accuracy and range requirements

put	get
putting everything in an airing cupboard if we put everything in one big pile and just let general warmth do it it will take a long time for the middle shirts to get dry

487278
addition	multiplication
but a comparison of two algorithms to do arithmetic operations one multiplication one addition will tell you something meaningful

487278
multiplying	multiplication
so to multiplying our two 6 digit numbers we must do 36 multiplication

487278
multiplying	multiplication
while multiplying 6 digit numbers if one of them is 4 digit and the other one is 6 digit then we only have 24 multiplication

quicksort	mergesort
mergesort versus quicksort

487454
quicksort	mergesort
because of the worst case time complexity of quicksort is î n 2 all elements fall on the same side of every pivot and mergesort s worst case is o n log n mergesort is the default choice for library implementers

487454
quicksort	mergesort
given that it is possible to vastly reduce the likelihood of the worst case of quicksort s time complexity via random selection of the pivot for example i think one could argue that mergesort is worse in all but the pathological case of quicksort

487491
google-chrome	firefox
the difference between google-chrome and firefox might be different tostring implementations

the catch is that i need the change in the credit amount between the max and min date so

488744
inherited	subclassing
remember inherited is an is a relationship between the base class and the subclassing thus every time you have an instance of a subclassing by definition you will also have an instance of the base class as part of the instance not as two separate instances

488749
superclass	subclassing
the superclass constructors are called because otherwise the object would be left in an uninitialized state possibly unbeknownst to the developer of the subclassing

488850
spweb	spsite
dont forget to do a dispose of the spsite and spweb objects and you will have to set allowunsafeupdates to true

488911
16-bit	64bit
but the only way you can convert a 64bit value into a 16-bit one is to remove 48 bits of data

488921
apache	nginx
nginx could then drive it directly instead of going through apache

488934
floating-point	fixed-point	floating-point	integer
although currency is classified as a floating-point type it is really a fixed-point scaled 64-bit integer

488941
scipy	scikits
it seems that mov_average_expw function from scikits.timeseries.lib.moving_funcs submodule from scikits add-on toolkits that complement scipy better suits the wording of your question

488942
int	double
in c# when you want to divide the result of a method such as below what is the best way to force it to return a double value rather than the default int

488946
superclass	subclassing
it seems that you might want to inspect the argument list of the superclass __init__ method and compare it against what you have in the subclassing

488946
superclass	subclassing
it might not be safe to assume that just because class a has n arguments to __init__ subclassing will contain at least n arguments and pass the first n through to the superclass

488946
superclass	subclassing
if the subclassing is more specific then it might fill in all by 2 of the arguments to its superclass __init__ method

488978
easymock	powermockito	mockito	easymock
powermockito extends both easymock and mockito with the ability to mock static methods final and even private methods

488978
mockito	easymock
the easymock support is complete but the mockito plugin needs some more work

489120
folder	directory
if the directory for the documents is okay to add to i would add an index directory in each folder as documents are parsed and store a file such as originalfilenamesansextemsion _index.txt inside

if that is not possible create an index folder on each drive and mirror the directory structure as needed

489154
xls	ods
hi i m looking to parse spreadsheets xls ods in groovy

489154
xls	ods
the ability to process xls files is not of major importance but would save me having to save multiple xls files to ods as this is for parsing data from clients

489172
cvs	rcs	manual	rcs
cvs was based off individual files in rcs format and was much more amenable to manual repairs than the subversion repository

489209
hash	md5
keep url in a text field keep the md5 hash of the url in another column and create a unique index on the hash column

489278
super	extends
the reason is that super only operates on new-style classes which in the 2.x series means extends from object

489327
xls	ods
both xls and ods will produce the same csv - you ll have to handle just one input type

489373
pecl	pear
there s both a pecl and pear bbcode parsing library

i would like to port the functionality from oracle to postgresql or mysql

489527
onchange	onsubmit
it appears in both ie 6 and firefox 3 that when you type some text into the input field and click submit that the onchange event fires for the input field but the onsubmit event does not fire for the form until you click the submit button a second time at which time the onchange does not fire of course

489527
onchange	onsubmit
in other words the onchange seems to prevent the onsubmit from firing

489554
onchange	onblur
you could use the onblur event in your inputs instead of onchange

filtering	grouping
stackoverflow questions filtering by a specific grouping of tags

489905
children	parent
maybe somewhere else in your code you are setting a parent control of those panels to visible which rips through all children and sets them to visible as well

489936
queue	fifo
the file you are writing to and the old file you are reading from taken together constitute a queue or fifo fifo but that s not a very deep concept

489936
puts	gets
on subsequent passes in update mode debutton gets the id from the fifo modifies it if necessary and puts it back in the fifo

489950
kerberos	ntlm
then kerberos will be attempted between the server and the client if something above is not met then ntlm will be attempted

489950
kerberos	ntlm
i currently handle this by keeping track of the request in the session and if a ntlm message is received it disables kerberos and www-authenticate for the rest of that sessions life

489974
google-chrome	firefox
it is only a problem in google-chrome and firefox

you can push changes pull changes and clone repositories

490122
interbase	firebird
i like ibexpert for firebird or interbase

490175
getter	setter
essentially it would be a bunch of getter and setter and any one of the major libraries could sit inbetween

490180
accessor	properties
to encapsulate the frame the form which is after all just a class can have public properties that have accessor and mutators to proxy the information to and from the embedded frame

490208
inherited	properties
instead of applying changes immediately it allows properties mutators to invalidate the component s content text via the inherited invalidateproperties method

490219
websphere	ibm
i m doing some portlet development for ibm websphere portal 6.1

490278

it is used to update transient instances in a different session from the one that was used to retrieve the instances see here for details

490311
internationalization	translation

i have an objectdatasource that will return a potentially large collection up to 200 000 records that are bound and paged in a gridview

490357
wav	riff
a wav file can basically be just a riff file container that contains the raw pcm audio

490391
inherited	subclassing
i have a mysitecontrollerbase class inherited from controller - which is subclassing by productcontroller

490444
implements	extends
if you like though you can create a pretty bare-bones uicomponent from scratch simply by extends uicomponent which ll give you all the baseline stuff or i suppose if you re really going for minimalism and you re up for a challenge you can just implements iuicomponent and define each interface method manually

490472
many-to-many	many-to-one
similarly for any of the foreign key constraints which are many-to-one or many-to-many

490540
folder	directory
if you haven t committed your changes yet you can do a revert on the parent folder where you deleted the file or directory

490554
cvs	svn
furthermore the sourcecontrol blocks for cvs and svn in cc.net are more granular and featurerich than their counterpart in the java version but this has not been a problem in my work

490560
cos	sin
let the fixed distance be d then x d cos a and y d sin a where a is the angle

490566
cassini	iis
you could probably use cassini if you don t want to use iis

490569
ultrawingrid	ultragrid
edit 5 16 12 just ran into this issue repeatedly with an ultragrid ultrawingrid

490607
for-loop	arrays
now if you add more strings to mystrings arrays for-loop will be automatically adjusted

490614
cos	sin
if center-point xcp ycp isn t the origin you also need to add it s coordinates to x y x xcp + d cos a and y ycp + d sin a

490632
cos	sin
if your asking for a more physical explanation of sin cos and tan consider how they relate to right-angle triangles

490635
jquery	scriptaculous
also we found the documentation on the struts 2 client side validation to be less than useful so you may want to consider the validation in your javascript framework of choice dojo yui scriptaculous jquery etc

one thing extra when i create the cache file i put in a little php code in the beginning of the file to serve it as a gzipped file which is actually where you ll get most of your savings anyways

490802
width	height
you might have to set the width and height of the a-tag also since nothing fills using this trick

490806
pop-up	dialog
however a standard basic auth dialog box still pop-up prompting the user for their username and password

490816
g++	gcc
that way gcc g++ will also look here in addition to the default headers directories

490835
clang	llvm
i followed the steps in finding memory leaks with the llvm clang static analyzer but i was unable to run static analyzer on my project

490864
ubuntu	linux
i am developing some python programs that i m running on a remote ubuntu linux server hosted on slicehost

490900
int	chars
my guess is that your compiler is putting int ret on the stack before chars buffer 1

490900
int	chars
so to get to the return address we have to go through chars buffer 1 1 byte int ret 8 bytes and the saved base pointer 8 bytes for a total of 17 bytes

490900
x86	64bit
here s a description of the stack frame on x86 64bit

i prefer a scite kind of editor with similar highlighting and fonts aesthetics and f5 working but with display of folder and files dynamically like komodo edit and a better code completion and vi emulation

491196
comparator	comparable
comparator or comparable for sorting your data structure to get the top 10 list out

491199
ada	pascal
ada pascal and many other languages support ranges a way to subtype integers

491199
eiffel	spec#
i think about the design by contract approach eiffel and the spec# c# contracts that give a more general solution

491209
hide	show
you can hide and show controls and subreports but stuff like interactive grouping etc isn t there

491217
distance	polygons
the polygons solution suggested is wrong -- the area of interest is the union of that polygons with the circle of radius d around each point on l -- and actually less efficient than simply finding the distance from each point to every line segment.

491222
int	chars
if you just want to open a file whose name is 1 then you can use integer_to_list 1 to do that since a string is just a list of int for the ascii values of the chars

491240
int	chars
index the sort order column and ideally add a trigger to the chars column so that inserts or updates to the chars value trigger an update to the int value

491259
pascal	delphi	int	chars	int	boolean
pascal and also delphi uses a subrange type but it is limited to ordinal types int chars and even boolean

491263

if you do this then there s nothing stopping your callers casting the ienumerable back to icollection and then modifying it

491527
google-chrome	firefox
edit on further examination firefox does not seem to be doing this but google-chrome definitely does

491527
google-chrome	firefox
i guess its just a bug with a new browser - for every event an i o read also occurs in google-chrome but not in firefox

491527
google-chrome	firefox
when i load the following page in a browser i ve tested in google-chrome and firefox 3 under vista and move the mouse around the memory always increases and does not ever seems to recede

491548
int	double
i am c# developer and i am almost certain that in this language an int is always 32 bits regardless of the platform 32 vs 64 bit a long is always 64 bits a float is 32 and a double 64 and so on

there are lots of post on the repository pattern the way that works best with mvc is to get the item then update it with the form then save it

491577
int	chars
chars is the only unsigned int type

491603
post	get
having come from a get post world before this i don t have a good basis for understanding why people would go through the trouble of encrypting query strings when using post for sensitive data along with ssl would achieve a similar level of security

491606
public	protected
if b wants to do something to a then use a s public or protected interface

491649
width	height
currently i m probably incorrectly listening to the event.resize event and drawing the contents when the width and height are non-zero

491649
width	height
it turns out i was setting the width and height somewhere in the redraw method i have no recollection of why i did this

491676
pull	push
like a lot of work but i think the result is relatively decent -- a super-high-level view of a project that allows for a high degree of day to day flexibility but still affords one a way to reasonably make plans around interdisciplinary activities once this is done we need to buy those four servers make sure our legal stuff is taken care of and pull the trigger on that marketing push one week later etc

491742
direct3d	gdi
mixing gdi rendering and direct3d rendering into the same window is a bad idea

redland	jena
i know that there are some libraries frameworks like jena redland protã gã but they don t state on which platforms they are known to work

491818
hide	show
one option you could check would be to add all components to the same panel with just one grouplayout then and hide show them based on user s selection

491818
hide	show
if grouplayout behaves well then it would just be a matter of calling pack each time after user changes his selection to show hide extended fields

491822
public	protected
they take it directly off the pda they also need the password as the public key should be protected by the user password

491823
boost	stl
i also avoid using pods and instead use stl boost as much as possible to avoid mem leaks and other nasty things

491842
post	get
right now you should get some errors because post variable is not defined and then because you re accessing a php property on a non existent object setdata

491929
inherited	properties
right now since this code was inherited the view states are changed in an actionscript function which sets the visible and includeinlayout properties on each pie chart based on the selectedindex of the togglebuttonbar but this just doesn t seem like the best way to do this - not very dynamic

491931
g++	gcc
the gcc g++ flag -print-file-name library can help track down exactly which library is being used

492418
put	get
we decided to choose php instead of asp.net in part because we didn t want to get stucked in a unflexible paradigm webforms everything-automatic-but-not-so-flexible but i believe a php framework could put us in the same situation

492420
postgresql	mysql
if you use the top solution or limit if you use mysql postgresql sqlite then you can t get the minimum for multiple groups based on name you can only get the minimum for one name

493232
google-chrome	safari
this works fine on ff3 google-chrome and safari 3

onchange	onsubmit
it turns out that it is only presence of an alert - or a confirm - during the input s onchange event that causes the form s onsubmit event to not fire

493241
bazaar	git
in summary bazaar was great when i was cutting my teeth on dvcs but i m now very happy with git and github

where arch is arm or armeb vendor is unknown or softfloat os is linux and libc is gnu or uclibc

493533

folder	directory
you need to make sure that the folder that your header files are in is added to the additional include directory setting in the project properties or is one of the global include directory in the main vs options

493672
subtract	add
but you can think to instead of adding a datetime field add an int and place the number of seconds since 01-01-1970 you will never have date problems and every time you need to get the date just subtract the current date those seconds

493811
subtract	add

493931
try-catch	exception-handling
to see the exception-handling message put a try-catch around the service call and set a breakpoint in the catch block

493951
for-loop	loops
don t think about the situation follow a list of inviolate rules no matter what the situation no matter what you think is the better way if the rules say use a for-loop in case x then you have to use a loops even if you know if there will only be 1 loops from 1 to 1

void pointers are often used in memory operations memcpy memset etc... since one doesn t want to assume the type of the data at the given address

494249
pop-up	dialog
i am starting using yui s container control in my application to display messagebox pop-up and other dialog

494249
pop-up	dialog
now i know i could use this example for how to show a please wait dialog and on completion just show another pop-up with the returned data

494254
versioning	upgrade
there s a free versioning of an obfuscator shipped with visual studio which can be upgrade to industrial strength

494289
put	get
if you want it to be completely automatic you d have to put all the correct values into an array and get the computer to compare them

494386
disk	ram
an oldie but a goodie create a ram disk and compile your files from there

494562
width	height
this is the label whose height and width are going wrong

494595
min	max
create an index with the min max and no of elements of sets

494595
min	max

494602
octree	quadtree
break up all the primitives into a quadtree octree 2d 3d

494602
intersect	contains
leaf nodes in this tree contains references to all geometry that intersect that leaf node s axis-aligned bounding-box

494602
octree	quadtree
a general visitor pattern is used to walk the quadtree octree

494614
ant	maven
hudson supports maven ant etc and supports all the major scms

494650
cruisecontrol	teamcity
try teamcity or cruisecontrol

494760
typedef	struct
the line typedef float vertex const vert means that vert is a pointer to a float member of the vertex struct

494762
folder	directory
for unix based os i-node look-up algorithms are highly efficient and number of files and folder in a directory does not matter

494772
filesystems	ntfs
usually modern filesystems like ntfs or ext3 don t have a problem with accessing files directly ie

494812
hash	md5
we structured them with md5 hash usernames 3 levels deep ie

494818
free	malloc
closest thing we ve done with malloc free for debugging is to

494873
width	height
yes basically the width and height properties of the html have been deprecated for some time you are recommended to use styles instead

494921
free	malloc
allocation from the loh is done via a free list much like malloc is handled in the c runtime whereas allocations from the generational heap is essentially done by just moving a pointer in generation 0

494922
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the following checkboxes are properly vertically centered in ie safari firefox and google-chrome even if the text size is very small or large

495077
post	get
if you re still struggling to get it right post a link to your page

495090
gif	png
as an extra tip opacity and png s or gif s with transparent backgrounds don t tend to play nicely in ie6 and i would strongly recommend you use a javascript library such as prototype or jquery if you are working with javascript

495100
magento	joomla
a solution which looks promising to me is jfusion which is an open-source bridge to combine several different systems in terms of structure and user authentication - this is built around joomla but supports moodle and several forum software products along with magento ecommerce

495133
factors	matrix
you can store a matrix of conversion factors where

495136
getter	setter
it should be noted that it s not good practice to use public instance variables you should always create getter setter to have proper encapsulation

495155
outputstream	inputstream
i have used inputstream and outputstream to do he same

495159
gif	png
they will already be png gif or jpeg images

495160
solaris	bsd
apart from the highly recommended stevens books providing a detailed description of one implementation check out the source in linux or solaris or one of the bsd s

495161
hash	md5
i have sets of hash first 64 bits of md5 so they re distributed very randomly and i want to be able to see if a new hash is in a set and to add it to a set

495166
post	get
i ve never tried it but you can use the referer header to know where the post or get comes from and try to match the url with a route

495171
pop-up	dialog
where freakout did something like clear out the text field or pop-up a warning dialog

495194
width	height
the table needs to fill the entire page so i have set the height and width of the table to 100 in the css stylesheet and the height of the html and body to 100 too

495216
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
tried the following code in ie7 mozilla 2 google-chrome 1 opera 9.5 safari 3.2 and it works

495265
post	get
in order to handle the case where javascript is turned off when you detect in the controller that the post was not done with ajax request.isajaxrequest is false you could look at the request.urlreferer property to get the url of the referring page

495285
asterisk	ivr
i ve worked with ivr in the past but mainly with large systems and have never used asterisk

495290
asterisk	ivr
freepbx makes it really easy to set up an ivr - got a decent web-based front end and supports some cool asterisk tools out of the box

495318
google-chrome	firefox
and i find that although this works in firefox google-chrome and anything

495321
pop-up	dialog
in vs2005 opening a file causes a dialog to pop-up contacting server to get a list of items to update .

495380
width	height
we use sql server and have a window table with columns for id name machinename for environment.machinename userid windowstate x y height width

495380
width	height
so for every window you would have one row with windowstate x y height and width for each user and machine

495418
maven	m2e
i m using the m2e plugin to handle maven modules in eclipse

495431
disk	ram
your best bet might be to up the disc cache more ram and get harddisks with a very high random access speed maybe solid state disk

495528
vbscript	jscript
when writing code in jscript as i am wont to do as i have never been a fan of asp.net and jscript is infinitely more elegant than vbscript you can call upon the arguments collection

495540
put	get
i will put variables into another variable and then it will get re-initialized to default values

495613
versioning	upgrade
versioning is it reasonable to force all customers to upgrade at the same time

495626
ienumerable	ilist
you can use a collection of t instead note that this is different from collectionbase or simply expose ilist of t or ienumerable of t

495647
dictionary	map
i now want to store an associative array of drive letters to map key is the drive letter value is the network path and have tried using dictionary hybriddictionary and hashtable for this but i always get the following error when calling configfile.load or configfile.save

495802
ienumerable	iqueryable
public static iqueryable duplicates this ienumerable source where tsource icomparable

495817
qmail	exim
other good choices are exim and qmail

495829
sequence	permutation
empty placeholders could be used with default ordering and numbered for some localization cases where different languages do permutation of words or parts of sequence

495862
zoo	xts
xts and zoo handle irregular time series data on top of that

495868
rss	feed
with my rss feed

495868
rss	feed
i tried other rss feed

495881
int	double
that data type can still basically act the same whether it s a double or an int

495886
getter	setter
having complex logic in getter setter is not a good practice

495886
accessor	properties
i recommend to move complex logic to separate methods like getsumofxyz and use memoization in properties accessor

495903
cpu	processors
one ec2 compute unit provides the equivalent cpu capacity of a 1.0-1.2 ghz 2007 opteron or 2007 xeon processors

495913
getter	setter
if this was on a domain entity then i wouldn t be in favor having complex logic in a getter and especially not a setter

495914
getter	setter
i think that there is some level of logic that is expected in getter and setter otherwise you just have a kind of convoluted way to declare your members public

495925
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
the enterprise library client system.data.oracleclient is a viable alternative to the odp.net provider from oracle

495925
xmltype	clob
also the oracle xmltype column is not supported and must be casted to a clob to be returned into the oracleclient

495927
int	chars
why is that you will ask the reason is simple int32 is type int numerical and string is oh well type string chars

495929
width	height
width and height of all textures must be the same

495937
hash	md5
when an md5 hash algorithm is specified the probability of hashbytes returning the same result for two different inputs is much lower than that of checksum

495965
int	chars
x0000f the int split into two sets of two bytes each representing a unicode chars

495965
octal	binary
however if you convert to binary octal or hexadecimal negative numbers are displayed in twos complement so convert.tostring -7 16 becomes ffffffba

495977
fontfamily	font-size
firstly if you re catching yourself setting color font-size fontfamily style rules over and over you re wasting your time

495985
ubuntu	linux
our web app is written in django we are running on linux ubuntu under apache + fast cgi with postgresql database

496022
cvs	svn
oh yeah and to repeat what dozens of people will undoubtably add to this question if it is at all possible to use svn instead of cvs in your system do it

496047
libc	binutils
con you are stuck with whichever version of gcc binutils libc they picked

496047
gnu	uclibc	libc	binutils
set which versions of gcc binutils libc gnu or uclibc threading and linux kernel to build and crosstool-ng does the rest downloads the tar balls configures the tools and builds them

496124
toolbar	docking
i haven t found a good simple solution to stopping the toolbar from being dragged yet while docking next to each other you can remove the cbrs_gripper style however that doesn t stop the toolbar from being dragged

496124
toolbar	docking
however dockpaneleftof does not seem to work in this case so you lose docking toolbar next to each other

496124
toolbar	docking
so it seems like one or the other right now if you want to stop docking or dock toolbar next to each other

496251
int	chars
i believe from an architectural perspective a datetime would be a more efficient data type as it would be stored as a two 4-byte int whereas your nvarchar 10 will be stored as up to 22 bytes two times the number of chars entered + 2 bytes.

496258
ssl	https
ssl through https is sort of a cooperative venture with the destination server

496276
sorting	filtering
the date filtering in the nvarchar field is not easy possible as the data in the index is sorted lexicographically which doesn t match the sorting you would expect for the date

496279
nant	cruisecontrol
cruisecontrol and nant are probably your best bet for builds with flexible output

496312
next	except
if there is no actual next argument or if type is not compatible with the type of the actual next argument as promoted according to the default argument promotions the behavior is undefined except for the following cases

496312
integer	unsigned
one type is a signed integer type the other type is the corresponding unsigned integer

496313
post	get
hope this helps and if either of these give you some more clues post them here and we ll get this solved

496346
free	malloc
and i know it s early in your development but you ll want to make sure you free the memory that you malloc

496358
expression-blend	silverlight
if you are just starting with silverlight then i highly recomend also installing expression-blend 2 with sp1

496364
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this code doesn t work as intended in ie6 7 it might work in ie8 i tested it and works correctly in firefox 3 safari 3.1.2 opera 9.50 and camino 1.6.6

496374
int	chars
unicode defines a single huge chars set assigning one unique int value to every graphical symbol that is a major simplification and isn t actually true but it s close enough for the purposes of this question

496376
pkcs#12	pfx
pfx files are actually pkcs#12 files part of a specification by the rsa group

496426
clang	llvm
finding memory leaks with the llvm clang static analyzer

496470
gridview	objectdatasource
i m used to using the asp.net gridview control with an objectdatasource pointed at objects in our business layer - and in that case the ods handles all of the paging sorting using the methods that our orm generates on the objects

496486
stringbuilder	stringwriter
use the stringwriter class if you want a stream that wraps a stringbuilder

496498
sorting	filtering
if you want to bind without dipping into code-behind whenever your query logic changes you re probably better off using a collectionviewsource since it has sorting and filtering capabilities assuming that s what you re after from using linq

496583
width	height
i tried setting the width and height to auto but no go

496606
implements	extends
if are supposed to implements models by extends abstract models listeners by extends adapters but that s it

496664
getter	setter
a very simple tutorial that shows object creation use simple getter and setter would be fine and deletion would be fantastic

496692
stringbuilder	stringwriter
the stringwriter implements textwriter against an underlying stringbuilder

496692
stringbuilder	stringwriter
then in your test instead of instantiating a streamwriter you instantiate a stringwriter and you could then check what was written by looking at the underlying stringbuilder

496717
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for example firefox safari chromium or google-chrome and my other next-gen browsers do not lose focus when using a scrollbar

496723
folder	directory
all svn export does is move the chosen directory s to a new location without the .svn folder so it acts as if it s not a working copy and from there you can add it to your working copy

496724
for-loop	arrays
if you re really using arrays the best way is probably just to use the conventional for-loop with indices

496781
jobs	cron
in my past experience any cron jobs generally only have to deal with data as opposed to say generate static files etc

496825
gmail	hotmail
i want to use this template as an email newsletter template but i ve heard people say hotmail yahoo and gmail offer limited support for css

496864
versioning	upgrade
pick the versioning of a family of processors with the smallest amount of flash on the grounds that you can always upgrade later unless costs make this unavoidable

496875
coldfusion	verity
i then want to make it available using coldfusion s available verity search to search the contents

497020
subtract	add
i have looked at and understand a javascript to manipulate and display a single date add or subtract but am unable to get that date in a cell as well as figure out how to display the other multiple dates mentioned above in a html table

497034
ceil	floor
see also ceil floor and trunc

497040
ceil	floor
you can try ceil and floor to round up and down

497040
ceil	floor
ceil and floor only work on double s though

497063
put	get
the main reason i see to make at least the get synchronized is that if it is very expensive to miss in the cache and you don t want multiple threads each going out to get a value to put back in the cache

497144
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
edit it looks like ie did not have everything wrong after all this is part of html5 draft and seems to be supported by the latest version of google-chrome safari and firefox at least

497148
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if your application code comes from a case-insensitive collation database it may not run on a case-sensitive collation database if a object is misreferenced you would get a message when you attempted to run the statement or create the stored procedure or in a stored-proc architecture you would catch all these pretty quickly unless you had a significant amount of dynamic sql

497160
gridview	rowdatabound
in the gridview there is an event called rowdatabound

497211
prng	random
you also need a real source of entropy not just a prng no matter how random it looks

497221
ubuntu	debian
the problems with deployment especially between debian and ubuntu are so miniscule you can go on without worrying about it

497333
ocaml	sml
ml family sml ocaml f#

497337
min	max	min	median	median	max
as for what value to select when the points overlap you can do min max median average etc

497346
csla	.net
csla insulates developers from the gotcha s of the .net and the ever changing architectural topology at microsoft

497349
hash	md5
stuff you cannot avoid except by being as up-to-date as possible new attack against a hash function or an encryption function see recent md5 talk new attack technique see recent attacks against protocols that send encrypted voice over the network

497353
folder	directory
what i m trying to do is create a powershell script which gets a list of folder in a directory which is filtered by a regular expression screening out folder names with nnnnnnx31 or nnnnnnddd where n alpha chars for the first 6 characters and the last 3 is either numbers of the static string x31

497380
int	chars
what s happening here is that chars + chars int

497389
rss	feed
i have a database with many rss categories that in turn have many rss feed

497389
rss	feed
so each rss feed is pulled out of the database depending on the id of the parent rss category

497389
rss	feed
i initially imagined two nested repeaters the outside one databound to a list of rss categories from the database which displays the category header and contains a hidden control with the category id then an inner repeater with the rss feed for that category

497406
int	chars
both methods invoke abstractstringbuilder.expandcapacity int which will allocate a new chars eventually and system.arraycopy the old content first

497406
int	chars
afterwards abstractstringbuilder.append chars just has to put the given chars in the array whereas abstractstringbuilder.append string has to check a few constraints and calls string.getchars int int chars int which does another system.arraycopy of the appended string

497571
google-chrome	firefox
i ve got this working in firefox and google-chrome

497589
inherited	subclassing
when a subclassing inherited from iterator it does this

497626
unix	bsd
bsd ftp doesn t give you a return code for error conditions necessitating all that parsing but there are a whole series of other unix programs that can be used to transfer files by ftp if you or your administrator will install them

497643
min	max
just calculate the min max values and use that to translate each number into a different shade from white to black

497695
actionscript	mxml
one s just by referencing the class name directly -- so for example if you d created a new component class mycomponent in actionscript or indirectly by making an mxml component extending another uicomponent called mycomponent in both cases the component would pick up the styles declared in your external stylesheet provided that stylesheet s been imported into your application via style source

497698
rss	feed
it is a great utility to let you create consume and manipulate all types of feed be they rss or atom of any version

497713
post	get
the .aspx file extension is properly mapped to the correct .net dll and has the verbs get head post and debug activated for the mapping

497730
versioning	upgrade
i thought in upgrade the windows versioning to one with asp.net iis but i thought in another possibility

497734
vmware	esx
yes i use vmware workstation 6.5 and esx 3.0 for my servers

497794
quicksort	mergesort
i was working on implementing a quicksort yesterday and then i ran it expecting a faster runtime than the mergesort which i had also implemented

497794
quicksort	mergesort
i ran the two and while the quicksort was faster for smaller data sets 100 elements and i did verify that it works the mergesort became the quicker algorithm fairly quickly

497794
quicksort	mergesort
i had been taught that quicksort is almost always quicker than mergesort and i understand that there is some debate on this topic but i at least expected it to be closer than this

497824
inherited	properties
you may also create a custom control that inherited from label that overrides the id properties to be what you want it to be

497830
ant	maven
the tomcat documentation gives recommendations for pre-compiling jsps at build time using ant and a maven plugin is also available .

497849
quicksort	mergesort
i could imagine that by directly accessing the memory using c for example one can improve the performance of quicksort more than it is possible with mergesort

497849
mergesort	in-place
another reason is that mergesort needs more memory because it s hard to implement it as an in-place sort

497880
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu as my linux development environment on top of vista 64

497906
lisp	scheme
if you re not interested in all the java aspects of clojure perhaps you d be better off learning another dialect of lisp such as common lisp or scheme

497918
put	get
put them together and you get

497936
boost	stl
for example using classes and class methods and function overloading which are usually easy for even c diehards to cope with but not the stl stream operators and boost which are harder to learn and can have bad memory characteristics

497967
quicksort	mergesort
i actually just wrote a linked-list comparative sort demo program in c and arrived at a similar conclusion that mergesort will beat quicksort for most uses altho i have been told that quicksort is generally not used for linked lists anyway

497967
factors	mean
i would note that the choice of pivot values is a monster factors -- my initial version used a random node as the pivot and when i refined it a bit to take a mean of two random nodes the exectution time for 1000000 records went from over 4 minutes to less than 10 seconds putting it right on par with mergesort

497967
quicksort	mergesort
mergesort and quicksort have the same big o best case n log n and despite what people may try to claim big o is really about iteration count and not comparison count

497967
quicksort	mergesort
the biggest difference that can be produced between the two of them will always be to quicksort s detriment and it involves lists that are already largely sorted or contain a large number of ties when quicksort does better than mergesort the difference will not be nearly so great

497979
uiview	catransition
i try with catransition uiview animation but nothing

497987
rss	feed
given a blog url obtain its rss feed url

498001
graphics2d	bufferedimage
callouts text images etc can be added to the screen shot via the graphics2d object you receive when you call the creategraphics method of the screen shot s bufferedimage

498046
hide	show
if you hide all your errors you won t be show those which signify that the logic of the program is wrong - namely errors you want to see

498052
x86	mips
beyond that if you want to run them on an arm processor or mips or powerpc then you have to run a full machine instruction set emulator that interprets the binary machine code from x86 into whatever machine you re running it on

498056
voip	sip
to clarify i am talking about the voip protocol sip

498056
asterisk	freeswitch	asterisk	pbx	freeswitch	pbx
i m not looking for asterisk freeswitch or any other pbx software

498069
inherited	properties
according to this book if an element is not matched by a selector in any of these stylesheets only then will the properties value be inherited from parent elements

498069
inherited	properties
if a browser s stylesheet does define a style for all types of element and this style has a higher precendence than inherited then inherited properties values should never be observed

498069
inherited	properties
i m aware that not all css properties inherited but for the sake of this discussion assume i m referring to a properties that is color

498076
fpdf	fpdi
you can use fpdi to read pdf and translate them in fpdf

498140
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
virtualbox is nice and fast for occasional ubuntu and an xp holding ie6 ff2 google-chrome opera safari for testing and installs of apps i don t trust

498150
vmware	esx
our engineers run a windows vm on vmware esx

498171
inherited	properties
second one can in some places in css use an explicit value of inherited to instruct the renderer to adopt that style properties from its parent

498190
ubuntu	linux
i particularly like vmware on my laptop and i really like to use it for ubuntu linux

498215
cvs	svn
for example there s a --cvs-exclude flag to exclude all the metadata files from backup not only for cvs but also for svn

498250
inherited	properties
obviously not all properties are inherited

498260
postgresql	mysql
if you make your site public and are getting more than a handful of users mysql or postgresql is the next step

498261
post	get
have an iframe on your web server that makes a request to a page on your exchange http server with your wanted cookie vars set as get or post variables

498271
ubuntu	linux
you can buy a virtual machine with 256mb for 20 month but you build the machine from scratch after loading a base linux distribution like ubuntu

498271
ubuntu	debian
i would suggest debian or ubuntu

498271
gentoo	linux
if you want to learn a bit more about some linux fundamentals like building a kernel and tweaking .conf files could be useful at some point try a distribution like gentoo

498278
post	get
i am very familiar with using post or get to send data but all of a sudden realized i have no idea how to retrieve it in a way that it can be used by a jquery callback function

498342
listview	checkboxlist
this way you can simply take a repeater or listview control and databind it to the list of categories then put a checkboxlist inside that

498349
min	max
when performance became an issue for me 10 000 items i put the acronyms in a hashset and then searched each substring of the text from min acronym length to max acronym length

498416
mouse	keyboard
remove the mouse and keyboard and use remote desktop to control the computer or try replacing your graphics card with another

498460
int	chars
when i call installservice from my int main int argc chars argv it is registered successfully i can see it in msconfig and services.msc

498486
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
you might also want to consider putting a more balanced reverse proxy in front of your mongrels something haproxy instead of nginx apache or lighttpd

498486
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
the other reverse proxies nginx apache lighttpd only do round-robin which means that they can load up your mongrel queue inadvertently

498570
disk	ram
a 4-byte int as pk might make a huge difference in space needed - on disk and in ram

498586
move	drag
note that this is not an overlay that is the gray frame should not move when you drag the map

498588
maya	blender
usually you sculpt your 3d character in a 3d modeler blender maya 3d studio max etc you export this character to a file .obj .md2 etc and you have written the code to your 3d game in order to handle the import of the character in your engine

498676
jboss	glassfish
question pretty much says it all - i m interested to find out about how to set up jboss seam on a glassfish v3 prelude application server rather than jboss

498696
profiling	benchmarking
then benchmarking profiling and tuning can be applied to the measured bottlenecks instead of guessing

498703
int	boolean
the difference is string.contains returns a boolean while string.indexof returns an int with -1 representing that the substring was not found

498720
implements	extends
or it may be that a holds an instance of some other class that extends implements is a and isn t a b and you ll get a classcastexception

498737
versioning	upgrade
we upgrade to a later versioning and it was much better

498756
loops	while-loop
in the while-loop the method next is invoked and i should be incremented every time by 1 next should return i++ and the value of i in the while loops should be incremented by one

498840
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or

498840
integer	unsigned
signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned

google-chrome	firefox
if a competitor came along it would need to really bring something new to the table in order to convince everyone to a adopt it b live with locking out all the users of older browsers like ie7 firefox 3.0 google-chrome 1.0 etc

498884
extjs	mootools
what we re currently getting is a range of library sets jquery prototype extjs mootools etc

498968
inherited	subclassing
i ve come across the feature in visual studio to auto-generate a subclassing of a custom control using add new inherited user control

498986
children	parent
my service layer then adds an additional query restriction by parent before returning the list of children for that parent

498991
inherited	subclassing
you just create your own class that inherited the control that you would like to subclassing

499137
textarea	textbox
what would be the css selector to force this text to be wrapped in an html textarea or in a xul textbox

499141
firefox	safari
microsoft could probably have pulled it off some years ago when ie has an extremely large market share before the rise of firefox and safari but they chose instead for strategic reasons to let the browser stagnate

499155
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
the for-loop loops over its arguments your args variable is an arrays but bash only sees the first element when you do args

499158
google-chrome	firefox
as of 2016 tested and working on google-chrome firefox ie11 even ie8 see that last here

499172
fortran	ada
there are a multitude of programming languages that aren t used terribly often anymore but we re used extensively in their heyday - cobol fortran and ada come to mind

499172
lisp	prolog
other languages such as prolog or lisp are not used terribly often in business but contain key concepts that all programmers should learn and are valuable in their own right

499177
firefox	safari
note safari seems to wrap the long string in a anyway unlike firefox

499218
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
it could be that the gif jpg decoders rewind the stream but bmp png don t hence the error.

499280
versioning	upgrade
it s probably cheaper for you to upgrade your vista home basic to a versioning that runs iis although my suggestion would be to run win 7 beta since it s free and then upgrade to the final versioning of win7 when it s ready

499405
put	get
when i put an alert just above it works fine but when i remove the alert and let it run at full speed i get the error

499413
button	checkbox
jquery.val checks or selects all the radio button checkbox and select options that match the set of values

499429
decimal	ieee
if you can tolerate the typical errors that come from the ieee method of storing floating point numbers then use a float otherwise use a decimal if you need an exact representation and that goes for any numbers that are not integers that you will use in calculations using the percentage as well

499458
superclass	subclassing
this lets me write cleaner code one layer up since i can catch the superclass and only deal with the individual subclassing when it really matters

499491
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception	illegalargumentexception	unchecked-exception	illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
illegalargumentexception is a subclass of runtimeexception which makes it an unchecked-exception

499590
gif	png
unfortunately it did this for non-gif images too so when our iphone application was expecting a png image and got a gif it would crash

499591
ssl	https
i would like to know because i want all url data to be hidden when using tls ssl https

499593
serializable	deserialization
fast serializable deserialization

499594
post	get
the client and server first establish a secure encrypted tcp connection via the ssl tls protocol and then the client will send the http request get post delete... over that encrypted tcp connection

499602
put	get	post	put	post	get
but if you are using get instead of post then the user will still be able to cut and paste the url out of the location bar and you will probably not want to put confidential information in there that can be seen by anyone looking at the screen

499603
post	get
under net - xhr tab you can see the exact url call with all get post parameters that was triggered

499615
stdout	stderr
stdout stderr

499615
stdout	stderr
stdout stderr - so air or java or

499615
stdout	stderr
alas merapi has to use a localhost port and socket for doing the interprocess communication - which is a clumsy way to go relative to using stdin stdout stderr interprocess pipes instead

499662
cvs	svn
gforge incorporates cvs svn document storage issue trackers and integrates everything nicely

499662
cvs	svn
versioning although we tried svn we switched back to cvs because it fits our needs better and works fine

499664
serializable	deserialization
also another lesson we have learned was that the slowest operation in distributed caching is serializable and deserialization at least in asp.net

499755
lisp	scheme
learn lisp or scheme

499796
boost	stl
boost thread - an stl style

499872
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works great with ie7 8 firefox google-chrome safari etc.

499879
stdout	fflush
it sends lots of newlines to stdout for those of you thinking i should fflush

499893
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql and a few other gems like hpricot thin and mongrel don t work but the application does work

499895
stdout	fflush
you might have to add some calls to fflush stdout after all

500059
width	height
in the validation block of the model that has_attachment when i try to access image_size width or height it always comes out as null

500096
accessor	properties
i have a class with many properties and they all share the same accessor code

500166
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
the more complcated way to do this is to use touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended to keep track of the user s fingers and adjust your view s transform property appropriately

500215
kate	gedit
i d suggest using a good text editor like kate or i guess gedit since you re gnomey

500233
anjuta	gnome
there s also anjuta devstudio written for the gnome desktop environment and it works pretty well with c c++ projects

500233
vim	emacs
if you just want stuff like go to definition etc. vim and emacs have that too with help from ctags

500258
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
in all cases you ll need to implement touchesbegan touchesmoved and the like to determine what the user is trying to do zoom pan etc.

500331
int	chars
for the first one the right-hand side is an unsigned chars and all unsigned chars values fit into a signed int so it is converted to signed int

500338
rss	feed
if so i d investigate providing an rss feed or some other way of notifying them so they don t eat up your bandwidth

500365
getter	setter
i think that if you created a dynamic method getuser return request.user that the groovy javabeans getter setter access would allow you to simply reference user the way you want

500434
post	put
i thought they would be in the request.post array as put is somewhat similar to post in my understanding but that array is always empty

500532
for-loop	arrays
and since you can never be sure that nothing will be added to the prototype chain just use a for-loop to enumerate the arrays

500565
for-loop	arrays
an alternative way of iterating through an arrays is using a for-loop

500622
komodo	notepad++
if i had to choose between notepad++ and komodo i would choose pyscripter

500638
jboss	glassfish
it is tightly integrated including with prototype much like jboss seam in the java world being integrated tightly with jboss hibernate and yes i know recent releases and articles have tackled the issue of using it with say glassfish and another jpa provider

500638
post	get
what also rings alarm bells for me is the comments you get in post like on derek siverâ s return to phpâ is

500680
jboss	glassfish
glassfish jboss etc. you want to be

500805
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
apply margin width and height to your iframe or embed or object to position it within the div that has the ipod background image

500878
inherited	properties
for..in will loop over all own and inherited properties of the array object which aren t dontenum

500878
inherited	properties
inherited properties can be excluded by checking hasownproperty but that won t help you with properties set in the array object itself

500920
int	chars
int dosomething chars hihi means a function called dosomething which returns an int and takes as a parameter a pointer to pointer a chars

501078
ienumerable	iqueryable
all it requires is that your dal expose your entities as ienumerable or iqueryable and you can use linq against it

501086
dbml	edmx
update resharper wasn t the issue but rather the plugin huagati dbml edmx tools. it seems some plugins might be conflicting and i encourage people to disable all plugins as a preliminary step in debugging the crashes

501121
rss	feed
typically be in an rss feed vs polling

501121
rss	feed
that depends on what sort of caching the site uses for its rss feed

501137
versioning	upgrade
for each change i usually create one script named dbverxxxx.sql that contains all necessary upgrade xxxx is versioning number

501137
versioning	upgrade
create script that will upgrade your user s database to new versioning

501137
versioning	upgrade
script should check current versioning of database and then execute database upgrade scripts that will convert schema to required level

501191
nfa	dfa
then convert the nfa into a dfa

501191
nfa	dfa
there are know procedures for converting a regular expression to a dfa and converting an nfa to a dfa

501227
firefox	safari
here it is in the safari firefox browsers

501251
backslash	double-quotes
python as many other languages uses the backslash as an escape character the double-quotes at the end of your xp1 .

501265
gnu	groff
gnu troff groff seems to be more popular than latex in the software community

501362
metaclass	subclassing
django s model object and thus also your models which are subclassing has a modelbase metaclass

501443
jdom	dom4j
i d suggest using an xml library like jdom or dom4j for manipulating xml instead of using regular expressions

501457
backtracking	greedy
this might be a bid greedy though and the backtracking to much for the matcher to handle

501461
fast-forward	merge
and you can undo the merge even if it is a fast-forward merge

501474
integer	unsigned
some other insight is that a pointer is always an unsigned integer type

501477
textile	bbcode
html textile wiki syntax markdown bbcode or even your own markup system can be easily implemented

501602
move	drag
the reason i was seeing the mouse enter leave event was because when moving the cursor the lines would drag 1 frame behind and thus allow the mouse to enter leave but not move

501647
kde	gnome
the standard windows-like os x gnome kde etc set of window management metaphors really break down when you have more than one window you want to see at the same time

501689
subscript	superscript
honestly i don t see the point in doing superscript subscript in css only

501689
subscript	superscript
beware css for superscript subcript on why you arguably shouldn t style superscript subscript with css at all

501689
subscript	superscript
typically superscript subscript is not actually a styling issue but is indicative of meaning

501689
subscript	superscript
side note it s worth mentioning this list of entities for common mathematical superscript and subscript expressions even though this question doesn t relate to that

501697
postgresql	mysql
depending on your actual data usage mysql or postgresql should be able to handle a couple of billion records on the right hardware

501697
merb	ruby-on-rails
the big advantage of using a rdbms with ruby-on-rails or merb is you gain access to all of the excellent tool support for accessing these types of databases

501718
disk	ram
i want to create a ram disk and move my solution onto this virtual disk

501718
disk	ram
ps i think when i have some documents in my program real world which are used frequently for example some document templates it could be good idea to move these documents onto a ram disk as well to speed up i o

501741
kde	gnome
if you only need some dialogs to improve your scripts you can use kde kdialog or gnome zenity

501751
disk	ram
personally i d just buy a ssd disk you could lose your whole soln at any time if your ram loses power

501751
disk	ram
right now i have 4gb of ram and a 150gb 10k rpm velociraptor hard drive for my boot disk running win xp pro 64bit and everything vs 2008 sql management studio and my testing vm s is very fast

501752
postgresql	mysql
a single mysql machine can deal with a few million rows postgresql can probably scale to a larger number of rows but might work a little slower

501752
vertica	greenplum
if your organization has deep pockets check out what vertica asterdata and greenplum have to offer

501756
disk	ram
honestly if you have vista windows server 2008 x64 and you jam your workstation with 4 to 8 gb of ram for most tasks everything will be in cache or stored by superfetch which will be a lot easier to manage and just about as high performance as a ram disk

501756
disk	ram
the ram disk won t do a thing for you if you re starving your other system ram to make it work

501756
disk	ram
while it technically worked copying the necessary data to the ram disk on every boot took too long and was a pain

501770
floating-point	integer
an example of this second usage is in the expression int float_var + 0.5f which rounds a floating-point variable by adding 0.5 which produces a floating-point value and then explicitly converting that value to an integer

501770
superclass	subclassing
casting can be done when there s a superclass subclassing or interface implementor relationship meaning 1 above or when the two types are primitive numeric types meaning 2

501803
bazaar	git
in addition to scott s comment of just doing it paraphrased if you start with a distributed system such as git or bazaar instead of subversion you can start with having it running locally without even impacting others and then spread it amongst the other developers over-time

501816
int	chars
however when i run this arr outputs the address of the first element of the array of int as expected but arr2 doesn t output the address of the first element of the array of chars

501832
komodo	notepad++
i use both komodo edit and notepad++

501841
rss	feed
a variety of rss feed for tracking changes would nice too

501867
button	checkbox
for flags and options you can simply use checkbox combo boxes radio button and file selectors filenames

501870
writetofile	nsdata
once you have the nsdata you could write it to your documents directory using writetofile atomically and then i believe you can pass it in as a local url although i ve not tried this

501888
disk	ram
if you use up memory with your ram disk you just going to deprive the os ram for virtual memory and that is going to be causing more frequent page faults and thus potential more writing to the hard disk

501888
disk	ram
if you do decide to use ram disk at least have a batch file on your desktop that copies everything to disk and run it frequently

501967
udp	tcp
i would also pick up a copy of the tcp ip illustrated as well since understanding things like how ip routing works how tcp and udp both work as well as how they differ are the most important practical things to know about networks

501999
modifiers	sealed
access modifiers like internal and sealed don t have anything to do with obfuscation or code security they just tell other classes how to interact or not interact with them

502005
folder	directory
this should be recorded separately for each user the position should not be recorded in the file because if the file is shared with a different user or edited in a different context the other user may move the window to an undesirable position so for windows i put this in the users s local settings folder do not put it in the registry for unix i put this in a home .app directory

502013
hex	binary
don t forget that this is a text file so convert binary to hex n 0a

502024
stdout	stderr
indeed i have researched the air 1.5 documentation and looks like they have omitted any access to stdin stdout stderr file pipes - despite they are available on all the platforms that air supports

502024
stdout	stderr
the merapi bridge library implemented via the interprocess pipes of stdin stdout stderr would grant to air a shade of microsoft powershell ability which can marshal .net objects over std interprocess pipes

502038
put	get
to get it to accept the mouse moved events i simply put in it s awakefromnib

502094
post	get
i am trying to get the title of the last 8 topics which has the newest post

502194
pop-up	dialog
using visual studio 2008 when i add to a c++ project a file that is not .c .cpp .h .rc or anything the ide doesn t recognize a dialog pop-up which asks me if i want to create a custom build step rule for this kind of files

502194
pop-up	dialog
this is the dialog i mentioned which pop-up when you add a file with an unknown extension

502196
firefox	safari
this works great on firefox safari but not on ie6 which doesn t understand the display inline-block

502208
width	height
when you increase the width and or height of a control the designer is interpreting your actions as a request to make the control that specified width and or height

502305
postgresql	mysql
craigslist uses sphinx and it can connect to both mysql and postgresql

502329
submit	submission
alternatively you could add a submit button to the page allowing you to check the form values before submission to the database

502343
ubuntu	debian
a debootstrapped copy of debian or ubuntu makes a great starting point to create the former

502384
inherited	properties
the only difference between object literals and constructed objects are the properties inherited from the prototype

502389
inherited	properties
a few google results dealing with custom controls suggest changing the properties from dependencyobject to frameworkelement but i d have to inherited datagridtextcolumn and define my own properties to do so - there must be a better way

502399
vim	emacs
i guess you don t use emacs as you d use for example vim

502428
versioning	upgrade
as an example i have a rails app running in our company right now that was coded about 2.5 years ago that only needed to have some work done to it once this year to upgrade it to a new versioning to be compatible with apache mod_rails it was originally written against rails 1.2 i believe

502488
vim	emacs
although he s a vim guy he wrote it you might get some ideas about how best to go about becoming more proficient with your text editor that ll apply to emacs

502496
width	height
and often it needs to be done twice - first to calculate the width height of the text for positioning and then actually drawing the text at the right coordinates

502580
folder	directory
if i add the root image folder as directory i receive this error

502593
cpu	processors
the gpu is just like the cpu except it s less general purpose and more a data paralleled processors

502614
superclass	subclassing
subclassing must override a superclass method

502625
post	get
unfortunately there are no details but maybe you can get more information by commenting that blog post or by contacting the stackoverflow team

502627
chipmunk	pymunk
as a first reference you may want to look into pymunk a python wrapper of chipmunk 2d physics library

502658
vim	jedit
personally i would recommend jedit rather than vim

502721
config	ini
error tracing and logging via editing php s ini config file is a good way as well specially if you can manage it to log information

502748
entity-relationship	diagram
so use uml finite state machines entity-relationship diagram plain english whatever you want but be sure to include a logical path that your readers can follow to understand what s going on

502758
folder	directory
the data directory where we create delete files and folder is located at c projectx data

502769
outputstream	inputstream
you have to get an inputstream as well you can t read from the outputstream

502770
superclass	subclassing
now that we have established the fact that your subclassing method doesn t override the superclass method according to the jls let s look at the runtime implications when type erasure has occured

502770
superclass	subclassing
so the type system here will decide that the subclassing method does override the superclass one they are identical after type erasure and we can never have a conflict

502776
ant	maven
we do not do ant builds directly or use maven

502776
put	get
we now want to be able to put all these projects and their various versions in a continous integration tool - i like hudson but this is just a matter of taste - which essentially means that we need to get an automatic way to check out the projects to a fresh workspace and compile the source folders as described in the project-files in each project

502794
min	max
min and max return the smallest and largest if there was an aggregate function like nth which d return the nth largest smallest value then i could do this in similar manner to the above

502847
int	boolean
then you can use the ispointer boolean to decide if you should treat the union as an int or pointer

502849
integer	unsigned
the following type designates an unsigned integer type with the property that any valid pointer to void can be converted to this type then converted back to pointer to void and the result will compare equal to the original pointer

502849
integer	unsigned
which is the unsigned integer type of the result of the sizeof operator

502876
min	max
you already have an index on goods min and max values so this sql for known goods and its value

502892
interbase	firebird
firebird and interbase are using b-trees with multi-record versioning systems for storage

502903
vim	textmate
i get by with vi vim textmate editors and what they provide or what i ve so far found in each of these editors

502958
nodevalue	innerhtml
in internet explorer all the properties i ve tried text innerhtml data nodevalue return item1 instead of item1

502969
versioning	upgrade
those scripts contain the sql statements which are necessary to upgrade the db to a certain versioning

502969
versioning	upgrade
next to that i ve a small application which upgrade the db to the latest versioning by executing those script files in the correct order from current versionnr of the db to the last script-file

502970
calloc	malloc
to the excellent responses posted i want to add one more point of difference between using calloc nelem elsize versus quality implementations of calloc will ensure that if your nelem and elsize were big enough to cause an integer overflow when multiplied together it will fail rather than cause an undersized allocation as a naive malloc invocation would

502970
calloc	malloc
just this feature alone would be enough for me to prefer calloc to malloc

503061
folder	directory
basically there s a sites folder which has a directory for every site you re hosting

503139
dictionary	map
another answer is to use a map or dictionary in the user class

503172
vsto	add-in
i have created a vsto application using office 2005 visual studio 2005 professional.i found there a setup folder.while i am running the .exe file in client machine it giving me error. an add-in could not be found or could not be loaded.

503208
ienumerable	iqueryable
but i have to implement the iqueryable interface on my repository with a iqueryprovider which transform the expression in a call to a ienumerable object

503219
vsto	add-in
create a new vsto add-in without any additional code and run it

503233
width	height
ok that s not what i want but i don t want to define the exact size either since i know height and width should be flexible so i try

503250
arp	icmp
arp is layer 2 protocol so it s packets are not forwarded by routers but it s much more reliable then icmp echo ping

503267
scrollable	panels
the controls can be many so the panels has to be scrollable

503285
hide	show
i would only make the show and hide methods when needed that is if

503295
post	get
using a query in a view and custom forms i was able to get a list to the form but then i was not able to post

503427
opencv	emgucv
if anyone who use emgucv opencv wrapper in .net 3.5 framework please tell me why this exception appears its inner exception is unable to load cxcore.dll

503540
put	get
the data context is created fine but when i instantiate an object of this type the only item i get showing on the intellisense for it is the class based on the table i dragged onto the designer and even on this i get no intellisense if i put a dot after it

503550
min	max
these are the max and min functions so it s useful to define them as such

503577
for-loop	loops
when doing vector operations at some level within the internal code there is likely a for-loop which loops over the indices you are swapping

503607
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
there s also common lisp which is a case-sensitive language that many people mistakenly believe is case-insensitive

503612
jquery	scriptaculous
i recommend the javascript route -- using a framework like jquery or scriptaculous

503629
width	height
you can set verticalalignment to center top or bottom to get automatic height of about one line maybe backed up by a minheight setting to avoid problems really tiny fonts and then set the width so the textbox width does not change as the user types into it

503658
stdout	stderr
you need to redirect stderr to stdout so you can capture it

503658
stdout	stderr
this example routes stdout to devnull thus ignoreing it and routes stderr to you

503671
stdout	stderr
2 1 means re-route stderr messages to the same place as stdout and thus will be loaded into the output array

503691
addclass	removeclass
i know my test function is working since the addclass removeclass functions are working

503709
post	get
cross domain request only work with the get verb and not post

503709
post	get
if the request is using a get then i have to convert it to a post

503737
implements	extends
some network filesystems do not implements file locks on regions that extends past a certain position often 230 or 231

503751
folder	directory
close the solution delete the directory testresults under your solution folder and then open the solution and run all tests test - run - all...

503770
post	get
as i said in a different post the sole obstacle is that users will take a few days to get accustomed to the idea

503778
folder	directory
you should also delete the .svn directory that s kicking around in the folder that you re removing or you ll end up confusing svn tortoise

503778
folder	directory
you can also do an export for step 1 which will remove any .svn directory for you if you re doing this for a whole directory tree rather than a single directory this is a lot more convenient than cleaning the folder out by hand

503788
width	height
width 0 height 0 visibility hidden

503820
ant	cruisecontrol
i have a hand-written ant build file we call it cc-build.xml because of our cruisecontrol roots. this file is responsible for refreshing the working space for the project from the cm repository and labeling the contents for future reference

503943
bazaar	git
as an alternative to git which has already been mentioned i would highly recommend bazaar

503986
freemarker	velocity
velocity freemarker and others are templating engines that allows the separation of ui logic and business logic thus facilitating changes in the presentation while minimizing the changes on the business side

504022
bazaar	git
the major choices for a distributed vcs are git mercurial also referred to as hg and bazaar or bazaar

504058
sdl	xlib
sdl is not a hardware interface in its own right but rather a portability layer that works well on top of many other display layers including directx opengl directfb and xlib so you get very good portability and its a very thin layer on top of those technologies so you pay very little performance overhead on top of those

504077
post	get
i ll edit the post once i find out how to get a list of all defined variables

504112
integer	fractions	floating-point	fractions	floating-point	integer
ecma script does actually have a concept of an integer type but it is implicitly coerced to or from a double-precision floating-point value as necessary if the number represented is too large or if it has a fractions component

504133
post	get
post and get parameters are only available per request

504219
subtract	add
i would like to add or subtract to this number

504262
xlib	xcb
pure xlib xcb if you want to take into account non-opengl plaforms

hash	salt
thus you can regenerate the salt once the user applies and you can generate the expected hash and get the job done in a single query

504327
inherited	subclassing
b will be subclassing by other developers and inherited from a

504362
notepad++	textpad
i used notepad++ now but i have to keep textpad around just for that number-filling function

504386
xsl-fo	xslt
i am total noob with xslt and xsl-fo and i am looking for some advice on the possibilities and limitations with dotnet 2.0 and 3.5 when using xslt for formatting xml data for reporting purposes

504386
xsl-fo	xslt
i also read some posts about adding an xslt schema to visual studios schemas for intellisense does anyone know of a current xsl-fo schema for this purpose

504434
hash	md5
often a hash digest is stored as the ascii representation of hex digits for example md5 of the word hash is

504434
hash	md5
but md5 really produces a 128-bit binary hash value

504434
hex	binary
this should require only 16 bytes to be stored as binary values instead of hex digits

504434
hex	binary
that is a given amount of cache memory can store twice as many rows worth of binary data if the string is half the size of the char needed to store the same value in hex

504533
treeviewitem	menuitem
now i want to pass the treeview control in the commandparameters of the contextmenu s delete menuitem s deletecommand so that i can handle the selection of the treeviewitem on the deletion of the currently selected item

504537
webkit	gecko
but you ll need a bit more for handling all browsers mobile gecko webkit opera etc.

504537
google-chrome	safari
if required you can also create additional files to specifically target google-chrome or safari if required

504575
jboss	weblogic	jboss	oc4j	weblogic	oc4j
i ve worked with jboss and weblogic before but this is the first job i ve been at where we ve used oc4j

504606
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i run firefox on vista xp and a macbook pro regularly and aside from taking a while longer than safari or google-chrome to start up it s fine and seems to use less ram than either

504643
int	chars
try the atoi function or the appropriate version if you re using wide chars to convert strings to int

504668
jruby	rubinius
also rubinius jruby are doing things the right way and are moving along at a great pace

504686
merb	ruby-on-rails	datamapper	activerecord
we went from ruby-on-rails activerecord to ruby-on-rails datamapper and finally to merb dm each iteration getting more speed simply because of the underlying frameworks

504686
merb	ruby-on-rails
generally when it comes to ruby ruby-on-rails merb you have to scale out throwing hardware at the problem

504716
cpython	ironpython
ironpython python for .net is faster than regular python cpython on the same machine

504759
filtering	grouping
now the entire function reading from right to left is a pipeline that filtering only alpha or separator characters splits it into words breaks it into grouping filtering those grouping with more than 1 element and then reduces the remaining grouping to the first element of each

504763
openrowset	openquery
try openquery and or openrowset and pass through the mdx

504900
perforce	svn
about a year ago i moved my home scc depot from perforce to svn in a few steps using a python script

504900
perforce	svn
this gave me a complete svn mirror of my perforce depot with all history comments and branch info retained

504907
exponent	modulo
export the public key as rsaparameters and write the modulo and exponent values to disk

504907
exponent	modulo
on the c++ side you ll need to read the modulo and exponent values from disk convert them into bignum values

504935
implements	extends
the most important thing in java is that you can implements multiple interfaces but you can only extends one class

504945
xna	slimdx
if you don t like xna you can use slimdx

504945
xna	slimdx
unlike xna slimdx supports directx 10

504950
versioning	upgrade
i d suggest having a baseline script and upgrade scripts so that you can always run a sequence of scripts to get a database from it s current versioning to the new state that is needed

504962
post	get
the alternative to the get method is the post method

504981
post	get
get and post methods have nothing to do with the server technology you are using it works the same in php asp.net or ruby

504981
post	get
get and post are part of http protocol

504992
post	get
i use get when i m retrieving information from a url and post when i m sending information to a url

504993
post	get
in plain english that means that get is used for viewing something without changing it while post is used for changing something

504993
post	get
for example a search page should use get while a form that changes your password should use post

504993
post	get
so a post request is a superset of a get request

504996
post	get
just be careful of people hitting refresh with the get method because the data will be sent again every time without warning the user post sometimes warns the user about resending data

505000
free	malloc
systems might choose to give free memory to other processes for re-use immediately while other systems especially if you use the rather private lib functions such as malloc might just use memory that is only available to this one process of yours so nothing will happen to free memory because no other parts of the system will know about it

505004
xna	slimdx
you might also want to look into slimdx a very fast lightweight open source alternative to xna

505077
perl	tcl
vim has a native scripting language and can also be built with embedded python tcl or perl interepreters that can operate on selections buffers etc through the plugin mechanism

505077
vim	emacs
i used to use xemacs a major code-fork of emacs that goes back a number of years back in the 1990s but went to vim later on

505077
vim	emacs
if you find the user interface of vim or emacs a bit too much there are a variety of other text editors available many of which offer scripting

505131
hide	show
i think you would want to group your associated controls together in panels align them to the top bottom of your form and then programmatically show hide the appropriate panel when the user clicks more detail less detail

505131
hide	show
edit i don t know of a helper control for this specific functionality aside from panels used to group controls and show hide them all at once

505135
hide	show
if the panels are docked for example top - then just hide show the panel and everything should fall into place automatically

505163
superclass	subclassing
all subclassing always can specify their own constructor as long as they call a constructor of the superclass - so there is no way of forcing the a class to have a specific constructor at least that is the way it works in java

505284
vmware	esx
we have experimented successfully with vmware esx to get better usage out of our data center

505292
xsl-fo	xslt
you still need to write the xslt file and as far as i know there is no intellisense for xsl-fo under visual studio

505321
richtextbox	textblock
if you want one paragraph per element you should probably do as suggested and use a read-only richtextbox or do what this person did and derive from textblock so that the inlines property can be bound

505353
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i have multiple dropdownlistfor in a page and would like to disable all if user selects a checkbox which reads disable all

505374
gridview	datalist
i am using the link button in the datalist to filter the territories and display them in a gridview

505387
parent-child	one-to-many
the scenario is the following i have a one-to-many parent-child relationship

505401
atoi	strtok
since the list of integers is variable i d be tempted to use strtok to split the string up into individual strings separate by space and then atoi to convert each number and sum or find minimum on the fly

505448
innodb	myisam
it may depend upon whether you are using myisam or innodb tables but i would run the optimize after truncating the table

505467
folder	directory
to keep things clean i don t want to have a .git directory in the myfiles folder so i thought i could create . backup git_repos myfiles

505507
try-catch	exception-handling
to do this you have to make sure that every line of code is either enclosed in a try-catch block or only called by code that its exception-handling can bubble up into

505534
fastcgi	scgi
cgi fastcgi and scgi are language agnostic

505534
post	get
the reason this is so great is that we can avoid the messy step of converting from a http get post to cgi to python and back again on the way out

505578
mouse	keyboard
you could use this to globally listen for messages that bring a window to the foreground and or messages for user interaction mouse keyboard

505594
put	get
you want to put global get at the beginning of every function except get itself

505611
serializable	deserialization
the serializable deserialization works fine however if i were to change the assembly which does the work it fails to deserialize because of the header in the binary file indicating that it requires assembly x instead of assembly y to handle the data

505706
mantis	bugzilla
mantis definitely wins on usability grounds over bugzilla

505706
mantis	bugzilla
compared to bugzilla or another system we tried implementing some weird european thing mantis is gorgeous

505762
merb	ruby-on-rails
the ruby-on-rails framework is what i ve used mostly but i played around with merb a little bit before the announcement that it was merging with ruby-on-rails

505786
cpu	affinity
context switch use a multi-processor core chip on a lightly loaded system and set the process s affinity to a specific cpu preferably not cpu 0

505795
cpu	affinity
it may help to set the cpu affinity in order to bind the process to a single cpu

505797
getter	setter
if you have a set of fields are simply read and written via the getter and setter you could probably get away with a single lock for these fields

505839
width	height
my fixed document xps has its page orientation set to landscape the page media size has a width that is longer that its height and it displays correctly in the viewer as landscape

505896
profiling	debugging
if you need a tool to debugging this look at .net memory profiling or windbg with the sos extension both will allow you to sniff through your your managed heaps

505901
vb.net	vb6
if you want to learn more about tdd and unit testing you should apply it to functions or procedures in vb6 -- although i d recommend vb.net or c# and doing object-oriented development

505942
set	bag
what you want is a bag - which is like a set but also counts the number of occurances

505943
inherited	properties
i cant assign a to the unsubscribe properties which is an arrayofstring - even though it inherited from list

505951
factors	matrix
usually the management uses more sophisticated matrix and all to make their decision but more or less these are the factors they usually put in

505956
equals	gethashcode
fortunately you can tell it to use different criteria by specifying an iequalitycomparerâ ¹xelementâ º basically an object that has an equals method that returns true iff two xelements are equals according to your definition and false otherwise and a gethashcode method that takes an xelement and returns a hash code based on your equality criteria

506033
coalesce	isnull
i just had a look at the linked article and can confirm short circuiting can fail for both coalesce and isnull

506159
profiler	gprof
it s a kernel level profiler requiring a kernel module unlike gprof however also unlike gprof it can profile multithreaded applications

506163
ssl	https
https http over ssl can help prevent hackers spoofing requests allowing you to securely exchange messages between the client and server

506241
division	multiplication
division is per se slower than multiplication however i don t know the details

506241
sin	sqrt
the basic reason is that similar to functions such as sin or sqrt it s just mathematically more complex

506241
division	multiplication
iirc a multiplication takes about 10 cycles on an average cpu while a division takes about 50 or more

506252
division	multiplication
both operations are done down at the floating point unit fpu level and even in the world of integral alus the division circuit is a far busier place than a multiplication circuit

506378
typedef	struct
you can define the typedef and forward declare the struct first in one statment and then define the struct in a subsequent definition

506378
typedef	struct
edit as others have mentioned without the forward declaratation the struct name is still valid inside the struct definition you can used struct a but the typedef is not available until after the typedef definition is complete so using just a wouldn t be valid

506380
stdout	stderr
you may need to read stdout stderr of a java program

506381
post	get
the controller get and post methods are as follows

506463
vb.net	vb6
the reason why microsoft designed vb.net to size arrays based on upper bound rather than array length is to make it easier to port code from vb6 to vb.net

506463
vb.net	vb6
by designing vb.net to interpret an array s sizing argument as an upper bound rather than the number of elements in the array old vb6 code that looped from 1 to n could be ported directly to vb.net

506463
vb.net	vb6
the array in vb.net will have one extra element compared to what the array had in vb6 the element at index 0 but otherwise behaves as it did in vb6

506528
implements	extends
secondly you need to create a class extends canvas and implements the paint method

506530
daemons	systemd	put	get
what s the best caching systemd daemons that supports get put delete and list memcached i think doesn t support list

506560
ogre	irrlicht
it includes gui elements is much smaller than most full-blown engines like irrlicht or ogre optionally makes use of 3d hardware acceleration and has been tested by popcap on millions on computers

506591
folder	directory
as you ve added the c xpressmp lib folder to the library search path in vc++ directory check that only the library file name is specified under additional dependencies and this does not include the path i.e xprm_rt.lib not .. .. xpressmp lib xprm_rt.lib

506599
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
freebsd is a nice in-between linux solaris though

versioning	upgrade
this file is used to upgrade the database from 1 versioning to 2

506642
gdi	direct2d
have you had a look at direct2d which is kinda the replacement for gdi

506705
classname	inherited
all i need is method in the action class only in it because there will be a lot of inherited classes and i donâ t want to implement this method in all of them which will return classname from a static call

506707
int	chars
i need to convert a chars array into int and float using c

506714
atof	strtod	strtol	atof	strtol	atoi	strtol	strtod	atoi	atof	atoi	strtod

internationalization	translation
internationalization i18n language specific adaptation of your application translation

506786
internationalization	localization
internationalization prepares your application for localization

506793
http.sys	httplistener
httplistener should be fine but it s just wrapper around http.sys and this library is available only on windows xp and higher

506828
multiplying	add
you need to write rules to transform this into add multiplying lit 2 variable x lit 3

506894
packets	multicast
you just send your udp packets to a multicast address that is 224 4 and the routers decide whether to route it to a subscriber

506894
packets	multicast
if you want to limit destinations where your multicast packets go you do it on routers

506894
packets	multicast
you should understand though that the word routes above means that the router emits the packets into appripriate interface with a multicast destination address in ethernet header and multicast destination address in ip header

506929
division	multiplication
for example the compiler can replace integer division between 3 with a multiplication and a binary shift

506929
division	multiplication
also it can replace float division between 2.0 with a multipliation by 0.5 but it cannot replace division between 3.0 with a multiplication by 1 3.0 as 1 3.0 cannot be represented exactly using binary numbers therefore rounding errors may change the result of the division

506987
accessor	properties
in objective-c you can use the properties and synthesize directives to let the compiler generate the code for accessor

507015
pop-up	dialog
in the dialog that pop-up select general then appearance then colors and fonts

507074
short	base
but in short the base object isnt yet an instance of the derived type therefor cant call any overloaded functions on the derived object

507136
range	max	range	min	min	max
a class of numeric responses defined as a set of intervals where each interval range from a min to a max value

507156
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
the windows filesystems fat ntfs do not care about the case of file names case-insensitive

507157
put	get
first put an id on the element so you can easily get a reference

507240
spaces	delimiter
just to elaborate on what others have said multiple css classes are combined in a single string delimiter by spaces

507367
cassini	iis
i m sure installing iis or cassini on the client would work but i was hoping for a simpler solution

507465
put	get
make the static versions of xml s you get over xmlhttprequest and put then into a folder on disk

507530
rss	feed
i surf over the rails blogs in my rss feed reading the headlines and just enough to figure out what the article is about

507530
post	get
i also open the post i want read in depth in another tab for later i used to use readitlater but it got out of hand and as i read them i write notes in a post on my own blog more for my own benefit than for others - to get into memory and to ensure i can find it later

507671
next	except
i need to be aware of how each method will affect the way i program the site using rails since if i do consolidate there will be essentially 4 levels of categories in a single table but that definitely seems more manageable than separate tables for each level since apart from subclass which directly links to product blocks they don t do anything except show the next level of category under them

507735
width	height
so all w10 w11 w20 etc share the same image nav_logo4.png all have fixed height and width

507754
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i have the following javascript that works perfectly under ie google-chrome safari and opera but dies in firefox by forcing the page to reload client side it redraws all elements

507774
client-side	server-side
due to deployment restrictions we can t deploy wcf on the client-side yet but would like to use it on the server-side

507778
put	get
you don t care what a bag is made of or what it does when you put your stuff in it as long as the bag performs the job of being a bag and you can get your stuff back out

507854
configobj	configparser
consider using the a href rel nofollow noreferrer configparser a standard library module or the a href rel nofollow noreferrer configobj a third-party module which supports complex datatypes such as nested dicts lists etc to parse a configuration file instead

507857
put	get
i ve found bigger impacts can usually be made by adjusting the way pages are put together particularly in reducing how much images get cut up into little pieces to reduce the number of requests

507859
mouse	keyboard
you can use the quartz events system to install application-specific or system-wide event taps which let you monitor and inject keyboard and mouse events at a pretty low level

507937
put	get
so it s generally best to just go get a resource as if you know for sure it exists and put your development time in to making sure your exception handler does a nice job with the failures

507986
ati	nvidia
if your gpus are all the same brand you might be able to get gpgpu support from the vendor either through nvidia s cuda or ati s stream

gif	png	mp3	wmv	mp3	flv	wmv	flv
object oriented handling of multimedia files mp3 jpg gif png flv wmv without writing my own wrappers for everything

508008
post	get
if you can get them on an ftp and post a link i can take a quick look and post my findings thoughts here

508072
inherited	subclassing
it s not really clear why you re creating a subclassing within the class itself though - i suspect your inherited hierarchy might not be ideal

508120
preventdefault	onsubmit
the problem with onsubmit still continues when i even use preventdefault option

508135
put	get
basically some other people who have control over the repository and therefore get to decide what goes in there put a directory in there that really didn t need to be in there

508146
post	get
if i get my git daemon up and running on my home server i ll edit this post to add the url for the project

508146
int	chars
int main int argc const chars argv

508172
folder	directory
if you rename the .svn directory in the bad folder and then run an update svn will skip over the directory and say it was deleted even though it s still there

508188
jsf	seam
seam is a superset of jsf and introduces a new conversation scope for

508230
versioning	upgrade
before 1.5.x releases your repository was automatically upgrade to the latest versioning when you access them with a later versioning

508234
jobs	cron
my site is with an isp who has a plesk control panel and i see a crontab section which lets me set up cron jobs

508273
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome uses dep data execution protection but firefox does not

508290
hide	show
additionally you will need to hide the form until a user action requests it to be show

508319
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox opera internet explorer safari google-chrome etc

508319
int	double
you can log arrays strings int double etc

508385
queue	fifo
they re the same for practical purposes with the difference that a queue is fifo

508393
put	get
also don t put sensitive information in the query string only option with get because it shows up in the address bar bookmarks and server logs

508446
put	get
had to pull out some sensitive lines so i wouldn t get canned and put them back in the wrong order

508485
post	get
if you get nothing else from this post then let it be this do not assume that the ids will always increase

508537
mouseup	mousedown
please allow me to call these events mouseup and mousedown

508537
mouseup	mousedown
most often you ll want to perform some processing on mousedown and do some further processing on mouseup

508537
mouseup	mousedown
the trick is that simply tracking mouseup messages is not enough mousedown may not have happened in your window

508537
move	drag	mouseup	mousedown
going further up the reasoning you should not rely on receiving a mouseup after you processed mousedown user may have move the mouse and released the button somewhere else think drag n drop in which case you don t receive the mouseup event.

508537
mouseup	mousedown
unless you capture the mouse on mousedown to make sure you get mouse event up to mouseup even if the mouse left your window

508537
mouseup	mousedown
all in all you end up tracking mousedown capture the mouse and when you receive mouseup just check if you own the capture

508537
mouseup	mousedown
if not the mouse was either double-clicked no 2nd mousedown or mousedown happened somewhere else hence you most likely don t care about this mouseup

508572
post	get
to get a prettier period you can calculate how long it really is divide by two and adjust the start of the period back by that amount and the end forward this will center the post inside the hour

508577
uiview	subviews
you need to add your icons which are uiview of some sort as subviews of your springboard view

508630
integer	unsigned
in c++ i enjoyed having access to a 64 bit unsigned integer via unsigned long long int or via uint64_t

508661
getter	setter
the record class has setter getter i feel like i need a helper function somewhere to help it serialize the whole class

508690
post	get
as mentioned in another post if you can get an examdate in there that would be more reliable than the examid column

508694
cos	sin
y1 sin x +.02 cos 200 x +0.001 sin 2000 x +0.0001 cos 20000 x

508701
int	double
now if what you want is the object and not the primitive then using valueof string may be more attractive than making a new object out of parseint string because the former is consistently present across int long double etc

508726
ant	cruisecontrol
if you don t do asp.net theres still the original cruisecontrol with ant that you can use in the same capacity

508758
getter	setter
intellij can generate all the getter setter for me

508763
inherited	properties
after much searching on msdn and other sources i have basically found that some dependancy properties do indeed support properties value inherited similar to wpf

508763
inherited	properties
i need to know exactly which dependancy properties do indeed support properties value inherited

508776
getter	setter
the bloat in java code is caused by other things than getter and setter

508809
inherited	properties
everything that inherited from system.windows.forms.control has a designmode properties that returns a boolean indicating if you are in design mode or not

508889
joptionpane	jdialog
it will be almost instantaneous you should use jdialog or joptionpane for this

508931
post	get
i agree with the previous two post about going straight into while dr.read and get the ordinals in the first iteration

508972
accurev	cvs	perforce	accurev	perforce	cvs
in many version control systems including cvs perforce accurev mercurial and team foundation server the command is annotate

508982
ready	each
when each stage of the computation on the clusters is done it will some how notify the cs that a specific file is ready

508990
typedef	struct
if you really must typedef a struct and most programmers that i work with would notâ¹ do this

508994
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
all works fine in all major browsers opera safari ie6 ie7 ff3 but not in google-chrome

508994
updatepanel	scriptmanager
after a few attempts i discover that it isn t a problem of the updatepanel but it seems that the autopostback of dropdowns doesn t work properly even in pages without scriptmanager and updatepanel..

509000
put	http-post
you can put in documents by posting http-post them to the search-server

509003
getter	setter
although you can override the methods in setter and getter few ever do

509003
getter	setter
i still average one setter getter every class or two but not enough to make me feel that a new programming structure is justified

509046
objectdatasource	detailsview
i have a detailsview control which uses this via an objectdatasource

509053
serializable	deserialization
for example when java s serializable constructs an object during deserialization it calls the constructor of the first non-serializable class in the hierarchy

509057
implements	extends
another reason is that it makes refactoring so much easier especially in cases where you want to implements or extends a generic framework through inheritance or delegation

509057
serializable	deserialization
what the attributes are basically doing is dynamically creating an interface definition specifically used for data serializable and deserialization

509098
post	get
i would recommend using the tryupdatemodel method in your action you ll have to get the customer from the database again and update it with the form s post variables

509103
hide	show
you can then show and hide them get messages from them about selection changes etc

509104
lisp	scheme
when you re starting out you may actually be better helped by looking at some lisp or scheme tutorial because symbolic math is conceptually very straightforward to do in lisp and to build a symbolic engine in python you ll more or less have to implement a mini-lisp as a foundation

509112
children	parent
in my case its actually a children and parent relationships

getter	setter
when defining a property with non-trivial setter and getter or how to disambiguate foo if the the declaring type also contained a property called foo

509168
xsl-fo	xslt
ok i downloaded the syntext xsd and put it in the same directory that has my xslt which generates xsl-fo in it and its working using the visual studio editor

509170
for-loop	loops
using a java 5 for-loop you can rewrite your loops as follows

509189
put	get
unless i get another really good idea today i want to turn this into a stored procedure and also put together a version as a table-valued function using a temp table to put all the results in one resultset for select queries only

509219
implements	extends
i want to add support for http authentication password protected directories on the server but i don t know how to implements this - i assume i need to extends the class somehow but on how to i m a little lost

509222
inherited	properties
so perhaps there is something going on under the covers that allows what you re calling properties inherited since the the framework might transfer the values between these similar dp ids

509238
put	get
to get the definition you can run this hit ctrl-t first to put the results pane into text mode

509259
width	height
your animation does update but the width and height of the app don t update

509386
submit	submission
i have a client that is a newspaper and when they submit the pdf form of the paper to their site they are submission the same copy they send to the printer which can range from 30-50mb

509428
cvs	svn
i d check git svn cvs logs for the few most recent changes you made and look for anything that might be slowing down queries

509433
required	placeholder
that s why many of the examples you see out there including mine attach name john+doe -- it s just a placeholder for some data that urlrequest seems to required when setting any custom http headers

509481
inherited	properties
class b inherited the properties from class a instead of the reverse

509522
width	height
sometimes when i have to scale the video down on the client size height or width less then videoheight or videowidth keeping the aspect ratio flash player makes text look blurry

509553
google-chrome	safari
this happens because microsoftajax.js does browser detection and it s incorrectly detecting google-chrome as safari

509553
google-chrome	safari
be sure to put the google-chrome check before safari

509590
mockups	balsamiq
from an interview with peldi guilizzoni the creator of balsamiq --an adobe air application for creating mockups

509590
mockups	balsamiq
first version balsamiq mockups

509596
firefox	safari
only works in firefox 3.1 and above though i think safari is heading in the same direction

509642
disk	ram
my first thought was ram or disk corruption but that all checked out fine

509703
sproutcore	javascriptmvc
it s probably overkill for what you need but sproutcore is an mvc framework and it doesn t look any more heavyweight than javascriptmvc or trimpath s junction

509718
box-sizing	border-box
update also box-sizing border-box

509721
integer	fractions
modulo is performed in the integer context not fractions remainders are integers

509764
multiplying	division	multiplying	modulo	division	modulo
note that i multiplying the result of the modulo by 1.0 to ensure that a floating point division operation is done rather than integer division which will result in 0

509799
post	get
no scheme you choose will be perfect our one month rule but as long as all post are following the same rule set you still get a good comparative value

509836
division	modulo
you ve confused division and modulo

509836
division	modulo
modulo is the remainder left over after integer division

509845
free	malloc
it can be much easier to deal with than malloc free but it doesn t allow the laziness that java and scripting languages engender

509878
git-am	git-apply
another could have been to export them via git format-patch and then importing them with git-am git-apply but that would likely be slower plus it won t record the origin of the commits.

509922
stateless	stateful	jsf	seam
i am expecting to use jms with mdbs session beans stateful and stateless jpa and i am really excited about using jsf with seam

509953
ant	maven
ant maven

510149
button	checkbox
however maybe you should just check all checkbox after a submit button click then it may be simpler

510193
put	get
why do i get the following error when i try to put the same figure into the a0poster document

510222
np-hard	np-complete
as pointed out by many other posters it is possible to base cryptography on np-hard or np-complete problems

510222
np-hard	np-complete
therefore practical crypto is based on mathematical problems that are not yet proven to be np-hard or np-complete so it is conceivable that some of these problems are in p

510225
kerberos	ntlm
above when talking about accessing the network this refers solely to spnego negotiate ntlm and kerberos and not to any other authentication mechanism

510261
direct3d	gdi
on top of this are the plethora of api s that often have many different ways of doing the same thing std library boost .net wxwidgets cocoa carbon native script libraries for python lua etc opengl direct3d gdi aqua augh

510265
cgpoint	cgrect
i ve found nsstringfrom helpful when logging structs like cgrect cgpoint etc

510272
mouseup	mousedown
i want to enable controls in my next button mousedown and then disable them at my next button mouseup

510317
breadth-first-search	depth-first-search
you can use any depth-first-search or breadth-first-search algorithm and continue searching till you have visited every vertex in the graph

510322
atomic	interlocked
there is a number of functions that allow for atomic operations interlocked increment interlocked decrement and interlocked exchange

510342
datamapper	activerecord
propel uses the activerecord pattern not the datamapper pattern so your domain objects end up with a lot more persistence responsibility and afaik it does not include a unit of work facility

510360
base-class	subclassing
i don t think you can force any subclassing to override any of the base-class s virtual methods unless those methods are abstract

510445
rss	feed
validating in the context of xml files and hence rss atom feed which use xml to encode the values means to use a document schema which describes the expected structure of the xml file which elements can have what child elements what attributes can be present etc

510445
rss	feed
now seeing how you are parsing arbitrary rss probably it is the best to skip validating and make the best effort of parsing the rss feed

510448
mxmlc	compc
in general i check in the most minimal set of whatever i d need -- given a clean flexbuilder installation or none at all -- for example if i were compiling instead with mxmlc or compc and an empty project -- to build the project successfully

510455
post	get
if you are connected to the internet directly and not through a proxy and requests for a page get post in internet explorer 7 the default time-out is 1 minute

510462
cpu	processors
now in a multi-core system it could be that after measuring time1 the thread is scheduled to a different processors whose counter is less than that of the previous cpu

510483
width	height
you could create 2 new properties myfoo.avatarsizewidth and make this property change the width same goes for height

510497
put	get
if i set the function to static when i try and put this.errormsg.text error i get this error an object reference is required for the non-static field method or property

510550
opera	firefox
firefox and opera and i m sure the newest ie display new windows as a new tab unless otherwise specified by user preference

510573
libevent	epoll
listen to the people advising you to use libevent or os specific utilities such as epoll kqueue

510590
perl	tcl
for instance i use the man command for perl tcl tk and various flavours of unix and linux the online language reference manual for ada apple developer resources for objective-c and cocoa

510598
width	height
note that setting the width and height separately will be less efficient than setting them in one go

510621
post	get
here is a blog post to get you started on drag drop functionality in wpf

510630
uilabel	uitextview	uiview	subviews
one way to do it which i used recently is to create a uiview subclass which simply draws a rounded rectangle and then make the uilabel or in my case uitextview a subviews inside of it

510632
dictionary	map
from what i understand hashtable is an old implementation extending the obsolete dictionary class which has been adapted later to fit the map interface

510657
nsstring	nsdata
on mac os x and probably also on iphone os the defaults database can only contain property list objects nsstring nsnumber nsarray nsdictionary and nsdata

510664
children	parent
each knowledge node can have any number of knowledge nodes as children 1 sorted parent child relation

510665
put	get
collections.synchronizedmap map synchronizes all operations get put size etc

510714
division	multiplication
actually the opposite is often suggested as a performance optimization using shifts to implement multiplication division by a power of 2

510714
division	multiplication
but any half-decent compiler will do that for you so you should absolutely not do it manually keeping your code clear is the most important thing so use multiplication and division if you re doing math and use bit shifts if you re manipulating bits

510715
multiplying	division	multiplying	multiplication	division	multiplication
if you did use the multiplication or division option you would clearly need to comment why you are suddenly multiplying values by seemingly random numbers

510721
subtract	add
you can use normal relative positioning and use + or - to add to or subtract from properties

510765
hide	show
once the application has completed loading i want the splashform to hide or me sent to the back and the main from to be show

510781
division	multiplication
as others have said a modern compiler will probably produce the same output whether you use shifts or multiplication division

510816
superclass	subclassing
you have to invoke the superclass constructor otherwise java won t know what constructor you are calling to build the superclass on the subclassing

510830
pascal	delphi
delphi rad studio and lazarus ide for pascal delphi language

510854
gif	png
developer notes this tests the case where gif input is automagically converted to png

510860
client-side	server-side
you would typically make use of ajax and hence javascript to invoke some sort server-side validation that would be inappropriate for client-side validation

510903
firefox	safari
the following css works great in firefox and safari but doesn t in ie6

510907
hide	show
your javascript will need to be waiting for the reply in order to handle it in your example show or hide an error message

510953
int	double
you haven t said what you re trying to parse int double etc or what options you want allow hex thousands separators etc which makes it harder to give a good list of things to check

511002
accessor	properties
i found that it was much easier to define a simple intermediate representation of these properties as an inner class define transformers for both concrete object classes again very simple as it s just using relevant accessor methods to get the properties out and then use collect to convert my incoming objects into the intermediate representation

511003
superclass	subclassing
from class sub you can call super.anothermethod bla but you cannot access the method of the superclass in your main method - that would be against the whole idea of using subclassing

511012
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
the header and footer do not stay fixed in opera or safari google-chrome but the whole table is scrollable so it is usable

511012
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
if you want to experiment with opera safari google-chrome support look at giving the tbody display block and go from there

511094
actionscript	mxml
im calling an actionscript class from my main mxml file

511108
inherited	properties
no ie has never supported inherited for any properties - sorry

511153
inherited	subclassing
if your subclassing overrides test then it overrides test - this is the whole point of object inherited

511153
superclass	subclassing
that s the beauty of polymorphic typing in fact the caller doesn t have to know about any of this at all and the subclassing determine how their behaviour differs from the superclass

511153
superclass	subclassing
if you sometimes want it to act as its superclass method and sometimes want it to act as its subclassing method then you need to provide the context required to do this

511153
superclass	subclassing
one which is never overridden and so always returns the superclass behaviour you can even mark the definition with final to ensure it s not overridden and your normal one which is overridden as appropriate by the subclassing

511181
pascal	delphi
delphi prism is an add on for visual studio which allows you to code to linux and mac from vs albeit in the object pascal language though

511209
accessor	properties
jcc attempts to make these python types pythonic by detecting iterators and properties accessor

511281
put	get
we ve got an api right now where all operations either retrieve from a list resource ie get user or on a single instance put user 1 delete user 22 etc

511325
inherited	properties
you could call inherited first and check if the properties are still set

511325
inherited	properties
and by the way free doesn t care if the instance to be freed is nil so this will work if but only if inherited destroy sets the properties to nil

511326
multiplying	add
your compiler will look at any integer multiplying divide by a constant amount and reduce the expression to a series of shift add operations almost all of the time

511326
post	put
if there s enough call for it i ll edit the post and put it in tomorrow

511380
chunked	transfer-encoding
cgi you could return a response body with transfer-encoding chunked to spit out a few bytes every so often and keep the connection alive

511385
hide	show
you can prompt the user with the columns and have a show hide or something similar

511390
innodb	myisam
just remember that you need to use the innodb storage engine the default myisam storage engine doesn t support foreign keys

511478
firefox	safari
when we moved it to a load balanced environment the images stop working only in mac safari but still works in all other browsers including windows safari and firefox on the mac that had the original problem

511614
ant	maven
one approach would be to analyze the standard xml files that are output from the junit running in both maven and ant

511617
put	get
instead of providing a function that must be called to convert the utc times to local times put this logic inside each datetime property s get function

511623
super	extends
allowing code to not call the super constructor first breaks encapsulation - the idea that you can write code and be able to prove that no matter what someone else does - extends it invoke it instansiate it - it will always be in a valid state

511648
post	get
i then do the replace on spaces in the search string as described in my original post to get contains to work on multiple words and to stem words individually

511658
ready	each
inside each you could create a new data context and attach the entity to that context when you are ready to perform the action

511747
profiling	debugging
the loss of performance between engine and normal extensions is that profiling isn t nearly as accurate editor - server debugging isn t reliable and doesn t appear to work on anything but explicit xdebug_break statements

511762
nunit	mstest
fwiw we run the crappy visual studio testing via mstest on our hudson box and i ve got an xslt that hudson uses to convert the results to the nunit format so hudson can decipher them

511781
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
i don t mean fat or ntfs or a particular type of filesystems i mean the filesystems structure as a whole

511789
versioning	upgrade
i am having trouble generating an msi file that will upgrade from one versioning of the service to another

511796
gridview	repeater
rather than a table you ll have better luck with a true server control like gridview or datagrid or repeater

511862
ant	maven
or if you going to to serious stuff opt for a build script like ant or maven

511891
pop-up	dialog
it automatically pop-up a dialog with a progress bar if the operation is taking a long time

511928
int	double
the largest double value is also larger than the largest int so it would have to be a long

511940
filtering	grouping
how about grouping by category id then using the having statement to filtering out specific categories like

511948
int	double
returning the int as a double is the right thing to do here because it offers a much wider usefull number-range than a int could

511956
folder	directory
you can right click on the folder in vs and remove it from the project or you can make sure any of the files contained in the folder have their build action set to none and copy to output directory set to do not copy

511966
innodb	myisam
if that s true then you might not need all the transactional safety provided by the innodb storage engine and you might be able to get away with switching to myisam which is considerably more efficient on aggregate queries

511967
hash	salt
store the hash with salt only

512022
integer	unsigned
i like the fact that the compiler warns me if i do things like assigning a signed integer to an unsigned variable

512076
folder	directory
in modern linux systems this folder is managed largely by udev which helps with the automatic configuration and population of this directory

512076
kde	gnome
gnome or kde are usually installed in this folder and you will find many of the programs you fire up in daily usage like firefox or evolution or gedit located here

512076
folder	directory
the reason for this is that the programs can be installed to a root-like set of folder like the installer is expecting without actually muddling up the directory with a plethora of files

512100
google-chrome	firefox
i don t know whether there is an equivalent in firefox google-chrome though

512106
multiplication	modulo
it later states that it can be viewed as a matrix multiplication but as the elements of the matrix must be bytes and output as bytes then each element of the matrix must be modulo 256 and therefore not reversible and non linear

512113
integer	unsigned
doing that with an unsigned integer or overflowing such one has perfectly defined semantics because there is no such bit in the way

512123
onfocus	onblur
you can attach the onblur and onfocus events to the window

512129
actionscript	mxml
the right way to do this would really be to figure out some way to pass a reference to your custom component to the actionscript class that requires access to it -- for example in your mxml

512135
hide	show
i was able to show wait message but i am not able to hide the same when the execution is complete

512135
onbeforeunload	onload
i attempted to hide the wait message using javascript but any javascript function written in onload onunload onbeforeunload etc of iframe is not being executed

512145
versioning	upgrade
recently i upgrade a couple of cruisecontrol.net server from versioning 1.3 to versioning 1.4.2.14

512149
put	get	post	put	post	get
regarding http you should simply do a get for reading data no side-effects and a post for submitting actions side effects with perhaps put delete etc

512186
min	max
so you can give a min and max

512222
int	chars
i must ve typed a couple of hundred unused int args chars argv lines back in the day

512254
mockito	jmock
if it helps i m switching to mockito from a jmock test that did this

512405
post	get
i ll post the code when i get home from work

512449
put	get
it really depends on how big a shop you are and whether you will get back the resources you put into writing one

512517
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a gridview bound to an objectdatasource

512542
textarea	textbox
excerted from josh stodola s setting keyboard caret position in a textbox or textarea with javascript

512542
textarea	textbox
a generic function that will allow you to insert the caret at any position of a textbox or textarea that you wish

512542
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
tested on ie6 and up firefox 2 opera 8 netscape 9 seamonkey and safari

512569
xsl-fo	xslt
all in all t4 to me is more of a inside vs code-generation tool to quickly create c# or other files while xslt is more of a data-processing data-transformation tool to turn data from xml into another format typically html or pdf using xsl-fo

512628
int	chars
int foo1 handle handle const chars sentence

512631
sorting	grouping
the advantage is that you can generate a report in about 10 lines of code including different query parameters sorting grouping etc

512643
fflush	gets
then it s just a matter of which buffer gets fflush first

512646
stdout	stderr
to system.out stdout while the stack trace is printed to system.err stderr

512677
prng	random
you need to use a pseudo random number generator prng with a fixed start seed

512777
hide	show
drillthrough and show hide features

512779
rss	feed
i have a rails application that allows users to import information from various sources using rss feed and such

512831
children	parent
i know of the tablefunc connectby function but that is for getting a parent children

512849
children	parent
as you add more children you simply look up it s parent s top parent id and insert the appropriate row in the additional table

512911
width	height
to add an iframe with it all you do is iframe url iframe you can set width and height and everything

512915
multiplying	add
so the question how to create a template to add up the size of all the elements multiplying the values of each element and then adding all the results and then do a static_assert and stop the build if they exceed the magic number size of the eeprom

512965
int	chars
this reads an unsigned int but stops after reading two chars two hex chars equals eight bits or one byte

513023
gentoo	linux
i have apache 2.2.11 using mod_python 3.3.1 python 2.5 running under gentoo linux

513034
google-chrome	firefox
i can open these documents in firefox or google-chrome and by open i mean from windows explorer not through a web server

513052
uiview	subviews
august i took your advice and added the uibuttons as subviews of the uiview rather than look further into the uitable

513082
profiling	debugging
xdebug can both do profiling and interactive debugging

513095
hash	md5
to meet the requirement you could simply use a hash such as sha-1 or md5 on your indexes

513095
hash	salt
i d also very strongly recommend insist on using a salt otherwise the hash values could easily be broken

513107
width	margin
give the wrapper div a left padding of 50 and the inner div a negative left margin equal to half of its width

513132
microstrategy	cognos
cognos sap business objects oracle bi suite microstrategy and reporting services are all basically comparable in performance on rendering to excel and pdf from their respective report builders

513169
versioning	upgrade
there are several things that need to be done to get upgrade to work with msi s if you want to automatically remove the previous versioning

513169
versioning	upgrade
for you upgrade scenerio the product code must be changed for each versioning

513173
cvs	svn
my hosting service does not currently run allow svn git cvs on their server

513190
mouseup	mousedown
try capturing on the mousedown and releasing the capture on the mouseup

513227
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
from what we can tell there is nothing wrong with this page and it renders fine everywhere else ie7 ie8 firefox opera safari etc

513296
mouse	keyboard
-it is possible to accomplish any given task with just the keyboard without the mouse

513511
put	get
if i put an echo in the function i get everything back as i should

513542
komodo	scite
it looks like komodo edit scite and eclipse monkey are the winners

513542
komodo	scite
scite s api though does not seem as extensive as komodo edit s api

513566
int	chars
an advantage i see of storing the value in hex vs int is that if we needed to grow the size which i don t see happening with this application at 16 chars we could simply increase the truncated length and leave the old values without fear of collision

513588
shutil	copytree
for highlevel file operations like that use the shutil module and in your case the copytree function

513590
jobs	cron
if you go with ruby stick with ruby for your utility scripts cron jobs and that little gui app the boss wanted to automatically sms the intern when he takes more than five minutes to bring him his coffee

513618
inherited	properties
both properties are inherited from the listbase class

513763
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
major upgrade which will uninstall the old versioning so you need to be aware of this

513789
pop-up	dialog
in the dialog that pop-up make sure java build path is selected in the left pane click the source tab then click the add folder.

513858
post	get
will allow you to post your whole application but it may be a bit more difficult to get feedback from it there unless it is appealing to lots of people

513954
bazaar	git
i agree with most of what s been said here but i d add the obvious point that it s less important to do frequent check-ins to the central repo if you re using a distributed vcs like bazaar or git

ati	nvidia
my advice would be to get the best machine you can afford with a top-end ati or nvidia card ideally an ati mobility radeon hd 4850x2 or 48xx or nvidia 98xx xxx card

514074
innodb	myisam
afaik the innodb engine still doesn t handle full text indexing so you need to use myisam

514104
pop-up	dialog
load the file into the swf modify it and save it back it requires user interaction a mouse click and again it pop-up a save file native dialog

514110
put	get
once we do a request.send null the object basically attempts to â œgetâ the url via http and once we get the data back from the server it is put in the responsetext argument

514147
cos	sin
also consider standard mathematical functions sin cos and tan would only work for half their input values you couldn t find the log of values 1 you couldn t solve quadratic equations x -b + - root b.b - 4.a.c 2.a and so on

514161
for-loop	loops
ordinarily you might use a for-loop and loops around 100 times

514184
floating-point	integer
they take up more space and floating-point math is slower than integer math

514263
mouseup	mousedown
mousedown mouseup approach to click pushbuttons

514268
mantis	bugzilla
i ve tryed mylyn but i cant find that feature if anyone have test mantis or bugzilla please tell me if one of those have that option

514302
innodb	myisam
don t use myisam tables use innodb for everything except fulltext search

514377
hide	show
i d like to show or hide a few fields in a form in rails depending on the state of a select field in the form

514377
hide	show
what s the accepted practice for conditional show hide forms in rails

514403
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
you could potentially stop your animation in viewwilldisappear or viewdiddisappear and then restart it in viewwillappear or viewdidappear

514413
post	put
edit changed method from put to post given a put must enclose a complete replacement or addition of the resource whereas clearly here we are only updating a part of the resource

514441
redhat	fedora
i recommend for that matter redhat fedora because of rpm and it s what i have experience on

514444
post	get
in my forum that i am building i want to get information about users that make the post in a thread

514476
consistency	acid
3 acid sort of a corollary to #1 if atomicity consistency integrity and durability are not challenges with a flat file then go with a flat file

514517
ord	chr
however if you don t want to import anything and are only working in unicode use the built-ins ord and its inverse chr

514518
extjs	qooxdoo
and interface to this api using a framework such as qooxdoo or extjs

514531
mouse	keyboard
plus the user with inputs of mouse and keyboard has a variety of ways to break what you produce

i am trying to optimize a small highly used function which uses the high bits in an unsigned short int to indicate the values of an array to sum together

514637
addition	multiplication
although this second approach eliminates the if-statement from this section of the code the second solution needs to run a multiplication of 0 or 1 on every iteration in addition to the rest of the equation

514638
factories	presenter
i ve implemented my own copy of the model view presenter pattern in vein of web client software factories so i can leverage my own di framework instead of being tied to wcsf s objectbuilder which i had numerous problems with

the workaround as described in more detail in the blog post is to get the sources with git i specified release-1.0 branch for repo command which i hope corresponds with sdk 1.0-r2 collect all the java source files and put them in the correct directory structure under sources directory which goes right next to your android.jar from the sdk and refresh the jar in eclipse at which point you can browse the sdk class sources

514802

i ve been hearing about vrml and x3d for at least 10 years and .

514960

514986
voip	sip
i ve seen not used directly just reviewed a fairly large and stable voip system using a sip stack from radware

515081

inherited	subclassing
if i implement an interface on a base class will it be inherited by its sub classes i know the functions procedures will be but i am more interested in whether i will be able to cast the subclassing to the interface and then back to its original class

515325
wxpython	qt-designer
as far as i can tell qt-designer is more powerful than any wxpython counterpart like boa constructor and pyglade

515327
cfstring	nsstring
the basic string objects are cfstring and nsstring

515333
inherited	subclassing
yes the interface is inherited by the subclassing

515333
inherited	subclassing
there is some essential difference between subclassing that inherited the interface

515345

directory machineipaddress s spbr00df does not exist or the sql server service account and the bi_web administrator service account do not have permission to read or write to the backup folder

515546
lisp	scheme
i have a nagging feeling that i already know most of this stuff and would probably have an easier time understanding it if it was presented in terms of lisp scheme rather than math

515548
doc	rtf
doc -- pdf html txt rtf

515562
for-loop	arrays
i use the for-loop when i have a collection with ordinal sequence as arrays or with a special rule for the step declared generally as a simple increment counter++

515582
int	double
i doubt scripting is setup to turn that into a real value and it would have to be something like a double not an int

515589
for-loop	loops
with the for-loop the scope is limited to loops itself in the case of the while loops however the scope extends to the end of the enclosing block no big surprise since the declaration is outside loops

515603
versioning	upgrade
then you have a core schema that you ve dumped from your database and when the versioning number is too low you upgrade your database using the migrations from the migration schema directory

515604
google-chrome	firefox
it breaks in both firefox and google-chrome

515668
versioning	upgrade
you need to upgrade to jquery core versioning 1.3.1

515670
inherited	subclassing
the interface is inherited by the subclassing and you can cast the objects to the interface but it is not safe or recommended to cast the interface to class

515712
serializable	deserialization
java serializable does a lot of things under the hood that will probably make the actual deserialization step faster than reading from a file and instantiating your objects manually

515773
getter	setter
don t test the compiler getter and setter

515808
integer	unsigned
the warning is there to catch comparisons between a signed integer with a negative value and an unsigned integer -- if the magnitudes of both numbers are small the former will incorrectly be deemed larger than the latter

websphere 7 xml feature pack by ibm

516056
hash	md5
seed a randomizer with the md5 hash value and start retrieving random numbers

516144
dictionary	map
you could use map dictionary instead of list

516148
public	protected
i can t see much of a case for private or internal modifiers in interfaces but supporting both public and protected modifiers seems perfectly reasonable

516163
implements	modifiers
an interface is all about what a certain object can do so when using a class which implements that interface the developer will expect all the members to be implements so the protected access modifiers won t mean anything for interfaces

516271
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
however here is the js that works in any browser ie 6+ safari opera firefox etc

516298
width	margin
personally i ve stumbled on too many such sites where the margin is also too small and if i widen the browser the margin doesn t increase even at full 1920 width and is still too small - a designer imposed an uncomfortable margin on me and i can t fix it by less than changing the site s css with the browser s dev tools

516319
equals	gethashcode
also note that the gethashcode and equals implementations must agree

516364
implements	extends
i have had the idea to the extends class write an enum implements an interface

516383
typedef	struct
and you don t need a typedef for an enum or a struct

516398
ssl	https
tls ssl the s in https guarantees that there are no eavesdroppers between you and the server you are contacting no proxies

516439
typedef	struct
the other big advantage with the typedef d version is that you can refer to the struct the same way in both c and c++ whereas in the second version they are refered to differently in c than in c++

516455
system.configuration	system.web
you must also reference system.web and system.configuration and any dlls containing configuration handlers that are set up in your web.config

int	chars
note that int short chars .

516603

if you re doing proper great-circle calculation based on taking the sine and cosine of the reference point and the other data points then a very substantial optimisation could be made by actually storing those sin cos values in the database in addition to the lat long values

516664
nsstring	nsdata	nsurl	nsdata	nsurl	nsstring
it s easy to convert an nsurl to an nsstring and that to an nsdata

516722
client-side	server-side
client-side validation is useful in general case but you can t be sure how these values arrive to the server so server-side validation is a must

516784
postgresql	mysql
if you are serious about porting the application over to postgresql or mysql i would recommend you to not use global variables at all since they are bad practice when coding according to me at least

516941

517245
hex	binary
you could edit the hex view of the data the binary view of each field or even point and click at the fields and all the other views would update

518094
udp	tcp
it s a fully functioning tcp udp client server amazing for debugging sockets

518111
inherited	properties
on occasion they can leverage some member functions and properties inherited from their base prototypes but this is only for convenience it does not mean that they are objects themselves

518113
getter	setter
you need both a getter and a setter or the property will not be serialized

518123
getter	setter
i had to look it up and couldn t quickly find an authoritative source but it looks like the xmlserializer does use getter and setter while the binaryformatter does not use getter or setter

518123
getter	setter
my first point showed that you don t really want to use getter setter

518123
getter	setter
the binary formatter can just take the exact in-memory representation of the object so it skips the getter setter

518172
width	height
creating a bitmap using the width height constructor will construct a ddb device dependent bitmap

518216
serializable	deserialization	getter	setter

i can use this jquery code to dynamically change the rss link in the dom in firefox google-chrome

518294
bash	zsh
it s much less comprehensive than cygwin but is mature and stable and has a good cross-section of the basic unix commands sed etc. it will play nicely with windows command files you can do piping and redirection and there is a port of zsh with it so it will also run shell scripts although zsh is not totally compatible with bash

518368
postgresql	mysql
the limit offset clause from mysql and postgresql is a good solution that no-one else appears to do

518393
throttling	throttle
you can do some kind of throttling to limit it to x clicks per y seconds etc but then the adversary can also throttle his click rate

518399
post	get
you need to make sure that all of the actions available via a get operation are safe which is best practice anyway since you re applying your xsrf protection to post only

one can use key preview per form to listen for the prefix suffix characters - and when intercepting something that resembles a barcode the barcode text can be sent to the correct edit box or used to pop-up a dialog box

520510
mouse	keyboard
this allows us to replicate an auto-away behavior much like msn live messanger when there has been no keyboard or mouse events after a certain amount of time

520600
post	put
i wonder if maybe it s trying to do an http put as opposed to a post

521033
rss	feed
i would need to programmatically determine whether an rss feed exposes the full content of its articles or just extracts of them

521034
getter	setter	subclass	abstract-class
for instance if the contract of the dosomething method above required sometype to have populated x y and z fields when they were accessed via getter and setter your subclass would blow up regardless if you used the concrete class that returned null as your base class or an abstract-class

521034
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
if it is just a shortcut and you cannot qualify your proposed subclassing as-a superclass then inherited should be avoided

521034

521392
ant	maven

i had the idea to run profiling collect the dml statements then replay them on the test server while debugging the app .

521478

521758
put	get
i create and populate my struct put it in the tag pull it out get the data of the selection and so forth

521782
ant	maven
however since it involves system-level and cross-platform functionality most development languages platforms are not properly suited which includes java and therefore ant and maven

521782
scons	setuptools
scons buildbot setuptools easyinstall and base python are my current target platform for the build process

521782

522176
int	chars
the array class is useful if the things in your list are always going to be a specific primitive fixed-length type chars int float

522178

the way to do this with the least leftover space is to put the centers of the circles on a hexagonal grid like the pattern you d get if you were making a pyramid of coins

522203
firefox	safari
html5 s contenteditable is modelled after the existing property from ie which is also supported by at least firefox and safari so you don t have to wait for html5 to be â supportedâ

522244
move	drag
when the user is trying to click it interprets is as a drag even if the mouse has only move 1 pixel

522311

522389
rss	feed
i don t know if you can link directly to the rss feed xml so that it s always up to date

522444
button	checkbox
if you do not want to use a list i think a button or a hyperlink that toggles from select all to select none would work better than yet another checkbox which is hard to make out among all the other checkbox

522502
post	put
google and others put a high value on words in the url that match words on the page so if the title of your blog post is in the url it will help your search engine juice

522509

the server runs a linux debian

522525
mouse	keyboard
since you have to have a place to put the mouse to move it and let s face it little point in the middle of the keyboard just isn t it

goto	break
a much simpler way of inspecting the code in msvc is to simply set a break point and inspect the disassembly right click on the line and select goto disassembly from the pop-up menu

522545
onfocus	onblur
since that doesn t work with all browsers they go with javascript in the onfocus and onblur events to remove a class that sets the border color

522546
width	height
i ve used -scrolltorowatindexpath atscrollposition animated in other parts of my application successfully but the difference there is my uitableview covered the entire height width of the content view so the scrolling worked

522572
actionscript	mxml
one thing i do recommend however is keep actionscript out of your mxml files as much as possible

522572
actionscript	mxml
mxml is a layout language and in my experience it pays in the end to use it where it makes sense and drop into actionscript whenever heavier lifting is required

522622
cpu	processors
incidentally i think the current trend of cpus with multiple identical cpu cores will eventually subside as well and the real processors of the future will have a single master core a collection of general purpose cores and a collection of special purpose coprocessors like a graphics card but on-die with the cpu and caches

522626
terminate	timeout
if a query in the database hits the maximum query timeout in sql server the database query terminate and the web service returns an error to the client

i have a wcf service that uses a system.servicemodel.syndication.syndicationfeed to create an rss feed

522801

i don t have any problems with your code on either mac safari or mac firefox using jquery 1.2.6 and jquery ui 1.5.3

522927
post	get
you need to go to the source of the blog figure out how the comment form is posted post or get then you can use mock ajax documentation here

522964
gif	png	tiff	png
other than that it s up to the uses of the images quality compression etc. in terms of whether you choose png gif jpeg tiff etc

522966
gif	png
if you were it usually doesn t matter between png gif and jpg other than jpg being a lossy format the other two are lsosless which is ok for photos and the like but not say for icons or text

522974
division	addition
i need basic mathematical operations such as addition and division for arrays

522974
division	addition
what about the addition and division between a and b

522988
hibernate	gilead
gwt is a pain to work with hibernate - you can try using gilead but i havent had much success with it its too cumbersome for me

522993
perl	tcl
after occasional exposure to tcl and perl i was really wishy-washy on the value of these kinds of tools

ubuntu	debian
sudo apt-get install libdirectfb-extra # for debian and ubuntu anyhow

523106
freebsd	linux
also needs to run under freebsd linux

523109
union	distinct
in that case you might want to reconsider the idea of querying the list of distinct categories first then union the per-category queries

523139
hash	salt
you should store the passwords as salt hash not as plaintext

523139
hash	salt
it might be a good idea to select the password don t do select anyway and compare it to the salt hash of the password the user typed in

523154
postgresql	mysql
on mysql and postgresql the two databases i ve used the syntax would be

523171
pop-up	dialog
the pop-up windows are very easy to implement and the modal dialog boxes are even easier

523195
pop-up	dialog
i have a strange encoding situation whereby the html page itself displays as it should with all the accã nted chã racters properly displayed but all the pop-up dojo dialog fail to use the correct encoding

523353
post	get
once you get going read through scott guthrie s mvc post and check out phil haacked s blog and steven walther s blog

523360
hide	show
i need to crawl a web board which uses ajax for dynamic update hide show of comments without reloading the corresponding post

523391
cpu	affinity
you could set the cpu affinity of your program

523393
affinity	processors	cpu	processors	cpu	affinity
or since the other dll will be loaded in your process you might be able to set your process or threads processors affinity to just one cpu

523427
affinity	processors	cpu	processors	cpu	affinity
you can then set the processors affinity for that job object to include only one of the available cpu cores

523427
affinity	processors
the child process is not able to change the affinity mask to anything that is not a subset of the processors affinity for the job object

523472
affinity	processors
setting processors affinity is the wrong approach

523475
inherited	properties
it seems as if object inherited is not working in the javascript microsoft jscript runtime error object doesn t support this properties or method

523477
mockups	balsamiq
a tool like balsamiq is great for fast ui mockups

523483
apache	lighttpd
apache lighttpd etc are all great for being flexible but you run a single purpose website and you really need to be able to both do more than the current servers are capable of doing both in handling traffic and in appropriately combating bots

523530
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
graphicsmagick and imagemagick are two different libraries

523542
cos	sin
on my labtop sin and cos takes about 144 ns

523544
serializable	deserialization
i have found the mvc json framework has some shortfalls in regards to serializable deserialization ignore member attributes

523544
post	get
.getjson also works but lacks http request type post get

523570
cos	sin
you could pre-store your sin and cos in an array if you only need some approximate values

523570
int	double
you then use this array using degrees int instead of radians double

523595
i2c	spi
ethernet serial ports uart spi i2c and gpio s support are all in one

523601
atan2	sqrt
i could have done something similar for the other trig functions but i have not found it necessary as profiling showed that only sqrt and atan atan2 were major bottlenecks

523635
post	get
now the question remains if i repeat the joincolumn attributes updatable false and insertable false on the parent see code in first post the additional update statements seem not to get produced.

523675
hide	show
this will show all the divs on page1 and hide them all on page2

523679
hash	salt
a server might also provide digest authentication which avoids transmission of the actual credentials - the client instead generates a hash of their credentials with a server generated salt

523696
pop-up	dialog
i d use the jquery ui dialog plugin to pop-up the dialog

523701
cos	sin
on the x86 the java.lang.math sin and cos functions do not directly call the hardware functions because intel didn t always do such a good job implimenting them

523708
emacs	textmate
i do almost all my coding in textmate which has been dubbed the emacs of macs

523711
post	get
remove the get contactusform method and only have the post version

523725
post	get
when session_start is called php is looking for a parameter from the client that was sent via post get or in a cookie depending on the configuration

523741
hash	md5
feed that into configured session hash function either md5 or sha1

523762
google-chrome	firefox
download a copy of google-chrome firefox with firebug or ie9+

523810
solaris	procfs
for solaris you could try the procfs module from cpan

523818
awt	swing
the answer will vary slightly depending on whether the application or applet is using awt or swing

523818
awt	swing
for swing the method to override is the paintcomponent method of the jcomponent and draw the image as with what was done in awt

523818
awt	swing
painting in awt and swing

523837
switching	screens
however when i put a default in one of the switching statements that default applies to every other switching statement and so when i use the variable of another switching statement in the url the default case of that other switching statement will appear on screens along with the case of this switching statement

523854
inherited	properties
if you mean a class that inherited from system.componentmodel.component like for example the system.windows.forms.bindingsource and strongly-typed datasets this will allow to drag an instance on the visual studio design surface on a form in design-time and set some properties using the properties grid

523856
post	get
correct me if i m wrong but i believe you can only send post and get requests with a browser in html

523878
bash	subshell
if this is run the bash subshell running in the background is terminated ok but tail still hangs around

523939
versioning	upgrade
i run into this fairly often when coding in python because my desire to upgrade to a new versioning of the interpreter can easily introduce problems in libraries that worked fine before

523945
filepath	unc
as they are detected the stored procedure calls a .net console app using xp_cmdshell passing the product id unc path report name adobe reader filepath on the sql server and a few other parameters

523945
filepath	unc
the filepath and unc path are passed as parameters and voila - automatic printing of ssrs files

523982
preorder	inorder	preorder	postorder	postorder	inorder
if you can construct a tree in this way forming the various notations prefix postfix infix are fairly simple -- you just follow the preorder postorder and inorder traversals of the tree for which there are well known algorithms

523986
instances	transient
i put transient data into instances variables instead of passing them as arguments among the private methods that support count

523989
tcplistener	tcpclient
if you want to have a stream like access to a tcp socket you should use the tcpclient tcplistener classes which wrap a socket and provide a network stream for it

524021
aptana	radrails
however i see that the main developer on that project has joined aptana radrails

524024
rss	feed
i need a php library script that can retreive data from feed no matter if they are rss or atom because i want users to insert random feed which will then be stored in a database

524034
rss	feed
consuming rss and atom feed

524035
aptana	radrails
i have used aptana radrails in the past and thouroghly enjoyed it

524036
aptana	radrails
i ve used aptana radrails and that s definitely one to steer clear of

524039
width	height
i m having trouble consistently setting the width and height of an img tag

524039
width	height
sometimes the width and height are set properly and sometimes they aren t

524039
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox seem to be working fine

524039
width	height
also when ie7 doesn t display the image with the proper height width if the browser is refreshed it then displays properly

524069
try-catch	exception-handling
put the try-catch where you are sure you won t just swallow the exception-handling

524074
hash	salt
to fix this you setup a method that takes in the browsers valid session and generate a md5sum + salt + hash of your own private device and send it back to the browser

524074
post	get
the browser then is required to return that hashed key back during every post get

524074
hash	salt
if you even have access to ajax there is a way to send a salt and hash key across the wire and use javascript with it to build the onkeypress characters valid token that gets sent across the wire

524099
width	height
if i use a custom panel to layout my listboxitems the listbox won t respect their combined height it does respect their combined width though - even when my arrangeoverride returns a size that surrounds all the items

524104
pexpect	subprocess
if you re familiar with how a href rel nofollow noreferrer expect a allows passthrough to interactive subprocess with specific key sequences from the user or strings received from the child process triggering matches and sending control back to your program the same thing can be done from python with a href rel nofollow noreferrer pexpect a

524114
put	get
if demand for your random crap is high enough that people are willing to go to these lengths to get it legitimate users aren t going to be put off by a captcha

524193
textile	bbcode
the three common markups i know of for this purpose are markdown used i believe by so textile and bbcode

524210
affinity	processors
this is done by setting the processors affinity of the thread

524212
width	height
this is because you need to remove the width and height attributes of the tag

524212
width	height
simply changing the css image width and height values will not work

524250
qmail	exim
i have no experience with them but i m told that qmail and exim are equally good

524309
lisp	prolog
try c# lisp prolog and c for example add some toy functionality to a local copy of the linux kernel to see how it ticks

524342
disk	ram
so that next time when the program runs it can just load the ht off disk into ram

524386
unix	bsd
plus bsd is a bit more mature operating system being directly descendent from at t system v unix

524404
anjuta	geany	anjuta	gnome
anjuta geany and a bunch of other micro-ides for gnome fail at indentation and misc features

524408
ubuntu	linux
sure you can install most of the same stuff on bsd as linux but you won t find a distro similar to say ubuntu which focuses strictly on the desktop

524413
post	get
i recall reviewing someone else s php code once and he had a function or class method that rolled all get and post variables into a single plain old object that could then be passed around

524413
post	get
if the same name-value pair appeared in both get and post post would win

524444
codeigniter	cakephp
i ve used codeigniter cakephp and even smarty template engine

524459
vmware	esx
i ll set up a vm in vmware workstation configure it to my liking and then use vmware importer to import my virtual machine into an esx environment

524696
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this works in firefox opera and internet explorer but not in google-chrome

524721
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this was tested in ie 7-9 firefox opera and google-chrome

524754
int	boolean
c didn t have an intrinsic bool type so all boolean were typed as int instead with canonical values of 0 or 1

524754
int	boolean
the not-not syntax converts any non-zero int to 1 the canonical boolean true value

524786
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
an nslog in viewdidload is being called when the application starts which makes sense. nslogs in viewdidappear and viewwillappear aren t doing anything

524791
iprincipal	iidentity
with a totally custom implementation you can still use iprincipal iidentity and formsauth

524815
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
if you were using a uinavigationcontroller as the container then viewwillappear viewdidappear would be called whenever you push pop a new viewcontroller

524827
integer	fractions
i m using the following piece of objective-c code to format a nsnumber and it works fine most of the time but it doesn t quite do what i want when the nsnumber object holds an integer no fractions part

524834
cvsnt	tortoisecvs
i haven t used tortoisecvs in a while but i guess there might even be a gui option for that in there your server would still have to be cvsnt for it to actually work

524834
cvsnt	tortoisecvs
note that tortoisecvs is just a graphical frontend for the cvsnt client

524845
post	get
thus every request every http get and post and the rest will end with this string

524877
put	get
get your main application to put all the files installation details into a low-permission temporary location

524897

post	get
just to get a handle on creating custom controls in .net cf if you haven t already i d highly recommend following this blog post on making controls transparent as the concept is largely the same

524944
disk	ram
the reason it can be slow allocating memory from the os is that it deals with lots of processes and memory on disk and in ram so to get memory it s got to decide if there is enough

524944
disk	ram
possibly it might have to page another processes memory out from ram to disk so it can give you enough

524950
free	malloc
what they will give you is memory allocation libraries which provide malloc free etc

525018
httprequest	httpresponse
guice integration was relatively smooth and good using warp-servlet which enabled me to inject into servlets and injects httprequest httpresponse session in other objects without passing them around

525018
jsf	seam
seam not a framework on its own but a meta-framwwork which normally comines spring jsf

525029
backtracking	greedy
it doesn t show how to do greedy nongreedy matches backtracking matching within a line instead of the whole line and other more esoteric features of state machines that are easily handled by the re syntax

525034
post	get
a lot of mvc frameworks assume that you will be using the post - redirect - get pattern for handling user input in your web forms

525041
children	parent
to accomplish what you re describing at least what i think you re describing one way could be to have both the transparent wrapper and the image children of a parent div with relative positioning

525049
width	height
the top and bottom divs are the full width of the image and are set to have a height that is the difference between the top bottom of the selection box and the top bottom of the image respectively

525049
width	height
the side divs have height and width modified so that they fill in the side areas of the image

525068
int	chars
the numbers after literal and range refer to the int values of the ascii chars they re supposed to match

525097
put	get
when i run the mapping i get a identifier type mismatch assuming it is trying to put the formcode into the id of the question

525122
put	get
in your css file you can apply styles to decorator-panel.using this we can change colour.for image you create one image directory under public directory the directory which is having your css file and put your image there.then in css you can get image

525125
xmltype	clob
if you are storing xml in oracle use an xmltype column which can easily be converted to a clob and works wonderfully with the jdbc 10g driver as that is what we are currently using in our production environment

525167
min	max
that site did lead me to the postgres gotchas list which had more details on count speed and another sequential scan issue max and min are sequential scans

525187
memcpy	memset
memchr like memset and memcpy generally reduce to fairly small amount of machine code

525189
client-side	server-side
the rest span client-side server-side and a few other domains

inherited	subclassing
a potential problem is if you use multiple inherited your subclassing then inherited two instances of the eve classes .

525319
inherited	properties
our base businessobject class that all business objects inherited from defines a properties

525398
post	get
so is there any way i can somehow link the login specific information with every http requests get post going to web server

525418
ethernet	wireless
without knowing exactly what your requirements are here s what i did to see packts go by from the iphone connect a mac on ethernet share its network over airport and connect the iphone to that wireless network

525458
salt	md5
one idea to randomize it would be to take the least significant bits of the md5 sha of their ip plus some salt based on the deal

525486
png	ico
it creates an ico file from 1 or more png s and handles multiple sizes etc

525502
firefox	safari
html 5 has support for databases and a couple of browsers have already implemented this part of the spec safari firefox with the gears plugin

525503
appfuse	spring
the best lesson i can recommend is having a good look at the spring mvc build of appfuse

525661
jsf	seam
seam combines jsf and hibernate

525672
opensuse	linux
i d like to know if it is possible for non-root user on linux i m using opensuse to run apache without using sudo command

525713
nsstring	nsxmlparser	nsstring	nsdata
you can then remove the processing instruction convert the nsstring to an nsdata and pass it into the nsxmlparser

525714
freebsd	linux
to put it all into practice read the linux or freebsd kernel source to see how the networking stack there is put together

525714
udp	tcp
tcp ip udp bgp and friends are much more interesting in my view

525737
width	height
it looks like the height of the main view is being cut by a little more than half and the width is being increased by about 50

525739
des	aes
unless you have backwards compatibility reasons you should use aes and not des in new production code

525745
3des	aes
please use aes or at least 3des if aes is not available

525816
google-chrome	firefox
the following code shows what i expect in firefox and google-chrome

525909
cpu	hyperthreading
if your application is single-threaded and your test system is multicore hyperthreading multi-cpu then you should expect to see around 50 idle cpu time for two cores 75 for four etc

525925
subtract	add
if you add up everything going on in task manager subtract this number from 100 then you will have the value of system idle process. notice it consumes almost no memory at all and cannot be affecting performance

525932
kde	gnome
for linux it will depend on the window manager gnome kde - as you ve already mentioned

525934
dictionary	map
i am doing a report on the various c++ dictionary implementations map dictionary vectors etc

525954
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
assuming a nix based platform you can use apache nginx or lighttpd

525954
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
there s a bunch of other ones but they are typically used as app servers tomcat zope mongrel etc and have apache nginx lighttpd squid proxy in front of them

525977
accessor	properties
in this properties s set accessor i convert the string back into a fontfamily

525977
accessor	properties
the only reasonable alternative to validation that i can think of would be having the properties s set accessor ignore invalid values and filter out the invalid deserialized objects later

525980
width	margin
this is where width 33 may not work because you will need to factor in the amount of margin that element has

525992
width	height
the problem is i can give a width to an iframe but the height should be dynamic so that there is no scrollbar in the iframe and it looks like a single page.

526005
button	checkbox
for checkbox and radio button at least in delphi 6 which is all i have access to there is no transparent property

526013
client-side	server-side
it s unclear whether you want a client-side or a server-side solution

526013
web.py	cherrypy
i really like how cherrypy and web.py handle them but the api is pretty simple in any library

526025
rss	feed
it displays an rss feed from google

526037
ubuntu	linux
other issue - function doesn t work on linux at least on ubuntu 8.10

526057
unsigned	short
malloc allocates bytes and an unsigned short is most likely to be two bytes

526065
width	height
i haven t had a chance to mock up this particular issue since then but i recently discovered that setting height or width to double.nan resets it to its default free-spirited behavior

526070
int	double
today i noticed that when i cast a double that is greater than the maximum possible int to an int i get -2147483648

526070
int	double
similarly when i cast a double that is less than the minimum possible int i also get -2147483648

526070
min	max
is putting if statements for min and max int before the cast the best solution

526092
int	double	min	max
limits.h has constants for max and min possible values for int data types you can check your double variable before casting like

526114
opera	safari
i ve tried this in ie6 ie7 opera and safari and it works fine

526115
subtract	addition
the implementation will allow for normal addition subtract etc on a c++ number type including casts

526139

it will detect any kind of truthiness such as string int and what not and turn it into a boolean

526242
unsigned	short
total sizeof unsigned short

526274
geocoding	geocode
the usc webgis geocode offers several geocoding api s that can do this

526281
folder	directory
i wrote a nintendo ds application that requires a folder to be copied to the root directory of your memory card and i often get e-mails from people who copied it to the wrong place and don t understand what the root directory is

526281
folder	directory
i don t think they realize that the root directory can be thought of as a directory or folder

526285
lisp	scheme
because common lisp unlike scheme and other lisp requires funcall your proposal is not ambiguous

526290
folder	directory
for them the root directory is the first folder they see when the double click the memory card icon

526303
margin	height
you ll need overflow hidden on the parent object but the result will be that each column will request to render this additional height suggested by the margin but not actually request layout of that size because the negative margin counters the calculation

526337
lisp	scheme
ever since reading what paul graham has to say about lisp i ve been intending to go back and pick scheme up again and see if it ll improve my programming in general

526340
entity-relationship	diagram
it even produces entity-relationship diagram and you can feed it with xml file containing the comments for tables and columns

526356
opera	firefox
opera i can t find any documentation but it appears to follow the same method as ie firefox see above links

526356
opera	safari
safari same thing as opera it works but i can t find any documentation on it

526373
hide	show
then when the resizeiframe function kicks in put two extra lines in there that will hide the loading image and show the iframe for that faux ajax look

526373
rss	feed
of course this only works from the same domain so you may want to have a proxy php script to embed this stuff and once you go there you might as well just embed your blog s rss feed directly into your site with php

526420
innodb	myisam
i m using innodb at the moment but am interested in answers for both innodb and myisam

526424
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome but in internet explorer 7 everything runs really slow and nothing happen

526455
spweb	splist	sharepoint	splist
another wonderful addition would be adding interfaces to spweb splist and other sharepoint classes to aid testing

526471
hide	show
i m not exactly sure why your adding the extra calls to show hide

526471
hide	show
please explain further as to why you need to do the show hide

526479
cos	sin
in the sin cos test i was performing for integers zero to one million

526487
daemons	systemd
i m developing an asynchronous queue worker systemd in this case using php beanstalkdd though the actual language and daemons isn t important

526494
strlen	strcpy
only use string apis that are unicode aware not strlen strcpy .

526504
hide	show
it should only be used to show hide the submenu

526504
hide	show
even so it should not show hide by add the css property display block|none

526505
findwindow	showwindow
use something like findwindow findwindowex to find the hidden window and get its window handle and then call showwindow handle sw_normal to unhide it

526521
post	get
if you use the technique in the post referenced by nobugz you will need to make sure the delegate doesn t get garbage-collected by using gc.keepalive _proc when setting the hook otherwise after an indeterminate period the hook will stop working when the delagate gets gced

526528
median	minimum
so the median gives a local minimum

526528
median	minimum
so the median gives a global minimum

526537
int	double
the computation works for x86 80-bit extended precision values aka long double as well but the bit-twiddling must be done byte-wise as there s no int type large enough to hold the values on 32-bit hardware

526550
jar	war
you probably just need the necessary jar files and either include them with your war or add them to your application server many have different ways of doing this

526600
gdk	gtk#
according to the documentation for gdk _threads _init g _thread _init has to be called first and the gtk# documentation says the same

526604
stopwatch	chronometer
one somewhat confusing thing about chronometer is that you can t really use it as a stopwatch that gets started stopped and restarted again

526604
stopwatch	chronometer
if you need something like a stopwatch you ll have to subclass chronometer or maybe create your own version using the source

526682
ostream	ostringstream
using my common sense i would say that for ostringstream this should give 0 for default constructed ostream -1 and for ostream with freshly opened file 0

526684
jsf	seam
the point of seam is that it is a closed -ish technology stack combining jsf and hibernate

526723
public	protected
scene is protected meaning it can be accessed from any class that derives from the class it resides in which in this case is screen however you haven t declared sceneitem which is the type of scene to be public

526751
post	get
4 yrs later edit because this post seems to get a fair amount of traffic

526758
margin	height
if you already know the height of the elements then you can just use floats and add enough margin to position them as needed

526767
awt	swing
it s using for the ui as far as i can tell swing and awt

526797
yacc	bison
preferably these tools would use lex yacc or flex bison for the grammar and not be too complicated

526798
nsstring	nsobject
as a rule of thimb any class starting ns will be present on the desktop - nsstring nsarray and nsobject etc

526810
uninstall	upgrade
if you application is small and you don t feel the pain of uninstall and install then major upgrade are the easiest thing to do

526883
.htaccess	httpd.conf
for example you can put the following directives in an apache httpd.conf or .htaccess

526885
lisp	scheme
that is pretty related to scheme since scheme itself is a dialect of lisp

526977
subtract	add
all you need to do is make the string lowercase turn it into a char array like you have done loop through each letter take the value of each char and subtract the value of a and add one

526986
equals	gethashcode
the cell implements inotifypropertychanged and overrides gethashcode and equals

526998
int	chars
int is a function that converts a chars or whatever to an int

527006
interbase	firebird
interbase firebird has a generator object which is pretty much like a sequence in oracle

527036
nant	cruisecontrol
add something in the cruisecontrol build like setting verbose on nant and confirm you have the same paths set up

527174
hide	show
if they are show toggle makes them hidden using the hide method

527307
int	chars
which is an unsigned int type used for 16-bit chars and is the same type as uint_least16_t described in 7.20.1.2

527307
int	chars
which is an unsigned int type used for 32-bit chars and is the same type as uint_least32_t also described in 7.20.1.2

527368
post	get
i presume that comments page should call three action methods index addcomment get addcomment post

527425
folder	directory
this works fine in a firefox browser when i place my trust file at etc flashplayertrust folder with entries for the directory and the swf file i want to trust. according to the flash security guide the global trust file should be at the same level as the directory which contains the mms.cfg file

527457
jquery	simplemodal
i am using simplemodal in jquery and i use ajax for displaying radio buttons

527461
inherited	properties
when creating your own custom event class you must override the inherited event.clone method in order for it to duplicate the properties of your custom class

527466
accessor	properties
usually you can do the same job better and more cleanly by implementing and using accessor or better yet properties

527468
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
the first resize works fine mousedown mousemove then mouseup but on subsequent mousedown+mousemove s the browser attempts to drag the whole resizebar div instead of properly resizing its parent container

527468
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
on mouseup the div then starts resizing cooldiv on mousemove without any mousedown required until a further click of the mouse

527502
inherited	properties
you can access them in the code-behind files as well because the viewpage inherited from system.web.mvc.viewpage that has the viewdata properties

527590
cairngorm	flex
may be you can use cairngorm framework in flex as its an mvc implementation in flex

527616
clang	llvm
you can look at clang that uses llvm for parsing

527695
opera	firefox
in firefox opera webkit ie6 it is ok but in ie7 the textarea have a 100px left margin

527699
hide	show
the visitor can click on a product image and it will basically hide all the divs and then show the one related to the image they have clicked on

527710
post	get
google for using cursors to loop through tables and you ll find enough to get you going like this post

527789
versioning	upgrade
any hack you could use to make it directly can be removed when you upgrade your interpreter versioning since no one expects backwards compatibility to preserve such things

527791
post	get
that is not necessarily true if you have used a post to get to the current place

527794
superclass	subclassing
generally it s not such a good idea when a superclass has any knowledge of the subclassing

527821
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i ve set up textpattern s hak_tinymce plugin on a website i run and it works great in firefox google-chrome safari and opera

527822
google-chrome	safari
in safari google-chrome it has extra spacing on the left top of ol s blockquotes and other elements

527826
margin	height
another poster decided the relative positioning combined with negative margin height was the way to go

527833
pull	push
then i can execute git pull and git push

527833
pull	push
but i m interested in only do git pull because i want to push into another repo

527833
pull	push
but i would like to configure git to use default and distinct repositories for pull and push i.e

527833
pull	push
basically i want to setup the default push repo to be different from the default fetch pull repo

527893
codeigniter	cakephp
alternatively you might build your own solution on top of cakephp codeigniter zend or similar framework which include plenty of ready stuff so that you don t need to completely re-invent the wheel

527916
public	protected
typically you d also use explicit implementation rather than public properties - perhaps with some protected virtual methods for the implementation details although keeping track of where the reader writer is across different classes would be a nightmare

527989
hide	show
if it happens to work then most likely the show desktop operation will hide the window

528093
mbunit	cruisecontrol.net
i ve recently installed mbunit version 2.4.2.355 on our build server which runs via cruisecontrol.net and nant on a windows server 2003 machine with .net framework 3.5 sp1 installed

528116
put	get
i need to process mysql data one row at a time and i have selected all rows put them in a tuple but i get the error above

528131
width	height
the problem here the only way to get the height is to wait for the browser to layout the page unless you specify the width of every element

528164
width	height
the width and height of the update panel can be changed to whatever suits your needs but bear in mind that you need to change those values in css as well as in this function

528327
maven	pom.xml
i have a maven pom.xml build file in the root directory of my project

528375
folder	directory
within windows explorer navigate to the parent of your project directory right click on the project folder and select tortoise svn - clean up

528464
try-catch	exception-handling
this is the only valid usage i can think of throwing an exception-handling with throw and catching it yourself in a try-catch block

528476
try-catch	exception-handling
anyway i d argue that throwing an exception-handling from within a try-catch block so the catch block can be executed represents really bad logic flow

528540
inherited	properties
because toolstripitem doesn t inherited from control it doesn t have a cursor properties

528540
mouseleave	mouseenter
you could set the form cursor on the mouseenter event and restore the form cursor on the mouseleave event vb sample follows

528541
selecteditem	selectedindex
i compare an existing clearcase region string in newly added items in combo box if it is found then i want to select it but because nothing is selected for the first time selecteditem is null selectedindex -1

528563
vmware	esx
buy a nice 64 bit box and use vmware s esx server

528594
subtraction	addition
you could do the same thing with ordinary addition and subtraction if you could ignore overflow

528612
nsscanner	nsurl
if you want the url s query string arguments then you need to create an nsurl from the url string then send the url the query message then parse that yourself probably using nsscanner

528628
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it looks correct in internet explorer but in firefox safari and google-chrome there s a 4-pixel gap between my image header and my div menu

528628
firefox	safari
internet explorer firefox safari and chrome.

528679
merb	ruby-on-rails
im struggling to find good material about developing web applications in ruby without using a framework such as ruby-on-rails or merb in the usual places i ve already spent a while on google safari books online and stackoverflow looking

528739
stdout	fflush
try calling fflush stdout after the fwrite

528762
aggregate-functions	sum
i m not a cognos guy but it sounds like your detail is not wrapped in an aggregate-functions like sum x

528848
uiview	calayer
i m not sure that touch events will find their way to the view as it s moving across the screen so if you need to have the uiimageview respond to touches you may need to replace it with a calayer insert it as a sublayer of your main uiview s layer and call the hittest method on the presentationlayer of that main layer

528868
charindex	substr
you could split up the string you already know the delimiters . with charindex substr and order by the different parts

528908
decimal	ieee
all have their limitations and this includes both the standard ieee floating point and signed decimal

528908
decimal	ieee
this is decimal arithmetic not ieee floating point

528911
getter	setter
i m trying to clean up an old api that has way too many public getter and setter to fit with javabean standards

528920
folder	directory
each user has full access to write into that directory though when a user writes a new file to the directory the group permissions of the folder are not persisted to the file that was written

528934

interbase	firebird
interbase and hence firebird provide an api you can use in your installer script to automate installation

529126
free	malloc
memory with malloc and free and change the types of your variables to char mydata and char tabledata

529226
post	put
since put is connected to create post to that url will give you an unauthorized and redirect

529235
svnlook	visualsvn
you could try using 1 instead of c path to repo above but i found that it didn t work because visualsvn give the 1 path with back-slash path separators and svnlook gives them with forward-slashes

529307
inherited	properties
you can also group them in hierarchies to inherited some common properties

529314
treeviewitem	listboxitem
the various itemscontrols including treeview let you override the creation of the item such as listboxitem treeviewitem etc

529375
int	double	mutators	setter
if you are talking about primitive variables like int double etc then this will be tough but if you need to trace access to your custom classes then all you need to do is place a few trace statements in your property setter and methods which modify state mutators

529380
profiling	debugging
essentially it s closer to profiling or debugging than to tracing

529430
ordinals	difference
an ordinals comparison compares strictly on the numeric character values stopping at the first difference

529523
rss	feed
i am trying to scrape some website and republish the data as a rss feed

529538
submit	submission
by cancelling the submit dialog we will keep the add operation pending and will be able to edit the files before submission to p4

529603
mouse	keyboard
you can listen the document you can listen keyboard and mouse events you can listen for action events

529612
feof	fread
you read only the first 4 096 bytes from the pipe you ll need to place the fread print _r in a loop and check for the end-of-file using the feof function

529665
put	get	post	put	post	get
the general form for all the test methods of get post put delete are as follows

529666
stdout	stderr
the directs stderr into stdout which you are capturing with popen

529700
internationalization	localization
however at some point typically between internationalization testing and localization linguistic testing internationalization and localization tend to overlap

529700
internationalization	localization
one person mentions l10n feeding back to internationalization but if you are doing quality i18n testing and creating pseudo-localized content then iterating on development issues during localization should be the exception not the rule

529700
internationalization	localization
interface resizing and particularly adapting pages to support bi-directional languages like arabic and hebrew also tend to blend both localization issues and internationalization engineering

529815
getter	setter
edit well the simple answer is that the mere fact that a property getter or setter could include far more than just a field read write makes it undesirable not to mention possibly unexpected to allow the sort of sugar you are proposing

529825
post	get
i can t exactly paste the text i m trying to parse because the characters get filtered out of the post

529825
int	chars
but when looking at the chars value its an int of 2

529869
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
the issue is that the link works and returns values when clicked in ie and safari and google-chrome and opera

530014
profiling	benchmarking
if you really believe that piece of code to be a performance bottleneck profiling or benchmarking it both ways

530018
vmware	esx
if you have one vmware esx server on a high-end hardware box converting it to a physical server will give you a minimal performance advantage

530062
versioning	upgrade
finally i would want to be able to draw a clear line between the base code and each website s customizations so that we can easily upgrade an existing site to the latest versioning of the core software by just bringing the core code up to date

530067
getdate	dateadd
where current_date between dateadd day -31 getdate and getdate

add or subtract in days

530079
put	get
it will run on that hardware sure but it depends entirely on what kind of load the apps will put on it lots of complex db access for instance and also how many hits it will get

530086
freebsd	linux
just a tip but from personal experience i ve found that freebsd works much better on low-end hardware than a modern linux distro does

530116
qsort	malloc	realloc	qsort	realloc	malloc
i m thinking of using qsort to do the sorting on a malloc realloc -allocated array

530139
hide	show
once the drag drop is complete hide the label and show the grid

530155
printf	fgets
fgets and printf deal with strings which in c are char-arrays ending with the special character 0

530243
oledbcommand	sqlcommand
if so start by looking at sqlconnection and sqlcommand if you re using sql server otherwise use oledbconnection and oledbcommand

530249
google-chrome	safari
javafx also promisses to release a webkit component engine used by safari and google-chrome named jwebpane in a future release

530250
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
i m not sure from your question what you ve got going on but if you just want to learn how to use a sqlconnection sqlcommand and a sqldatareader object to retrieve items from a database check this out

530286
post	get
when i run this servicehost on my local machine windows xp it works fine - when i post a soap message to it i get back an http 202 code accepted which is the correct response for my service because the contract has isoneway true

530289
type-safety	typechecking	type-safety	erasure
all of this results from a known and deliberate weakness of generics in java it was implemented using erasure so generic classes don t know what type argument they were created with at run time and therefore can not provide type-safety unless some explicit mechanism typechecking is implemented

530298
free	malloc
comment out calls to malloc free around the problem area and any associated areas where those pointers are used

530298
profiling	debugging
on unix check out this guide for debugging memory on unix and the valgrind profiling sol thx for reminding me about this one

530332
ienumerable	iqueryable
the .where implementation for iqueryable is different than the .where implementation for ienumerable

530354
listview	gridview
especially inside repeaters listview and gridview name your controls something short

530368
strncmp	strncpy	printf	strncpy	printf	strncmp
so things like printf s scanf s strncat strncpy strncmp etc aren t really happy with null 0 characters embedded within our binary data array

530395
multibyte	setlocale
you ll have to set the locale first with setlocale to utf-8 so it chooses this implementation of multibyte support

530404
rank	max
i d argue that given that definition of rank that straights can only start with a max of ace.points - 4

530405
instances	transient
2 would work but if there are a lot of dependencies then all of these would have to be transient too and this would result in a lot of instances being created every time i needed the person repository

530426
hash	salt
an example hash password and salt is and the password used was password

530467
hash	salt
you need to unencode the salt to convert it back to it s byte representation and then concatenate that with the password to get the hash password value

530522
getter	setter
suppose i have an object representing a person with getter and setter methods for the person s email address

530525
pascal	delphi
in delphi or object pascal as we oldies like to call it calling conventions come after the function declaration like this

530581
getter	setter
i find lots of getter and setter to be a code smell that the structure of the program is not designed well

530581
getter	setter
you should look at the code that uses those getter and setter and look for functionality that really should be part of the class

530581
getter	setter
having both getter and setter is equal to the field being public when the getter and setter are trivial generated automatically

530581
getter	setter
but there are also cases where having getter and setter is a good pattern

530581
getter	setter
in one project there is a gui model which has 15 getter and setter of which only 3 get methods are trivial such that the ide could generate them

530626
client-side	server-side
i know how to do this server-side but i d like to do it client-side if possible

530630
rss	feed
have you looked at feedity - - for creating custom rss feed

530630
rss	feed
i ve been using it for a while to create rss feed for those feedless webpages

530700
x86	64bit
and on x86 in 32 and 64bit mode that is 32-bit integers

530706
x86	64bit
in those situations where 64bit data operands are desired they can be activated using the new rex prefix woohoo yet another x86 instruction prefix

530735
jar	war
we have an ear file which contains a few jar files one of them being named ugc-ws.jar for libraries that we use and also a war file which has the web.xml to load a servlet - this war file also has the same ugc-ws.jar in it s lib directory because the servlet is inside that jar

530735
jar	war
so basically we have the main ear file and within it multiple jar files as well as a war file - which also has a jar file inside it s lib directory

530759
lisp	prolog
procedural is part of the procedural functional logical or logic oriented distinction compare c lisp and prolog between different ways of describing what a program should do

530776
ienumerable	iqueryable
you might need to cast it to ienumerable or iqueryable first or something

530779
int	double
you can double int strings matrices complex numbers reals window sizes on your monitor and all sorts of different things

530794
inherited	properties
your code can be more or less oo depending on how heavily you rely on inherited polymorphism classes and the methods as a properties of data worldview as a means of structuring and explaining understanding your code

530848
versioning	upgrade
additionally when you allow subtyping you actually present a very complex contract to consumers and you inevitably end up with versioning problems when you attempt to upgrade your class in the future

530875
int	chars
or instead of invoking int 21 with which prints one chars at a time you can set to print a string set ds dx to a block of memory which contains

530886
phpunit	simpletest
there are at least two mature stand-alone junit style test suites available named phpunit and simpletest respectively

530886
codeigniter	cakephp
as far the mvc frameworks go symfony has its own testing framework named lime codeigniter has a unit_test library and cakephp relies on the aforementioned simpletest

530886
phpunit	simpletest
i know that zend studio has built in support for phpunit tests and both phpunit and simpletest have command-line runners so integration into any workflow is possible

530902
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
we may notice that one class is very much like another so instead of copying and pasting code we let one class inherited from another the subclassing inherited from the superclass or base class

530902
superclass	subclassing
in this way the subclassing has access to all of the data structures and procedures of the superclass and can augment or override them in certain ways

530992
qdockwidget	qwidget
i m just trying to get into qt and kde program and have hit a snag trying to add a floatable draggable qdockwidget to the .ui file based as a qwidget that is embedded into my kde 4 program

530993
easymock	jmock
one final note when a field cannot be injected for whatever reason but i still would like to mock it out in a test i have found the junit-addons privateaccessor class helpful to be able to switch the class s private field to a mock object created by easymock or jmock or whatever other mocking framework you prefer

531060
datamapper	activerecord
if you have that much associated data you could look at using something like datamapper instead of activerecord with rails as it supports lazy-loading data as required

531083
swt	swing
i ve developed both with swing and with swt but not with qt

531083
swt	swing
however there are a few things that swt does that swing doesn t do as well or at all -- such as launch the system s native browser and execute javascript scripts in this browser

531083
swt	swing
swt and swing of course do not have licensing fees jambi i don t know about either way but it may depend on your intended use -- for example are you distributing a gpl application or a commercially licensed one

531105
vb6	vba
in vb6 and vba

531146
direct3d	gdi
wpf graphics are hardware accelerated where possible through direct3d - it is not gdi based

531166
superclass	subclassing
template method originally states that the method should be abstract in order to force subclassing to implement it adhering to the superclass contract

531173
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it currently supports firefox 1.5+ safari 2.0+ ie 7.0 opera 9+ and google-chrome 0.2.x

531253
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
jquery and other libraries make it easier to code the behavior -- but you generally can t get around the fact that ie6 has so many weird rendering issues that you ll be frequently banging your head on the keys trying to make it do what firefox safari and opera do right the first time

531260
folder	directory
if you put the images directory into the public folder of the rails app for example public images then you shouldn t have any problems with mime types unless your web server is configured wrongly

531291
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
i d suggest using dotnetzip or sharpziplib

531350
queue	fifo
in fact this defeats the whole purpose of queue and the class you ll eventually come up with the will violate the fifo semantics altogether

531365
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
on the internet as a whole ie is the most popular browser with firefox a close second and safari opera and google-chrome taking up most of the remainder

531388
public	protected
that will restrict the returned properties to public instance properties excluding static properties protected properties etc

531408
try-catch	exception-handling
wrapping something in a try-catch doesn t really have any impact at all if the exception-handling is seldom raised

531462
textarea	textbox
input type text and the textarea to 500px doesn t work in ie6 and chrome only works fine in ff2 haven t tested other browsers ie and chrome add two pixels to the textbox

531509
ant	maven
we ve since abandoned that practice and now use maven to manage library dependencies - even for projects that we re still building with ant

531578
ant	maven
if you re developing in java then you can set up a local repository and then use a tool like maven or ivy + ant to access it

531600
disk	ram
assign subsequent drive letters to any ram disk

531656
dictionary	map
the most i ve been able to do is to query the data dictionary to do things like map the package dependencies

531706
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
if it works on firefox it will almost certainly work on opera safari google-chrome etc with only a few minor tweaks

531734
toolbar	tabs
my viewport on firefox with tabs open quick links and the excellent web developer toolbar extension is only 572px when set to 1024x768

531765
keydown	keyup
the keyup event isn t actually fired for all keys not just arrow keys etc. until you release the key there are just many repeated keydown events

531772
x86	64bit
reason why double can t be declared volatile it s 64bit which makes it more than the word size on x86 which prevents it from being declared volatile in the cli if i remember correctly

531814
ilist	iqueryable
edit1 changed ilist to iqueryable in repository and filters

531824
strcpy	strncpy
strcpy vs strncpy in a similar way to how g++ used to warn for inclusion of vs

531825
rational-numbers	fractions
to give you a practical example take the set of rational-numbers or fractions are they re commonly called

531920
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization times increase linearly with the amount of data being processed as opposed to exponentially with snakeyaml

531961
portrait	landscape
it s still possible to use the designer for basic layout but you ll need to run the forms on various emulators devices and try switching portrait landscape to fully test the regenerate methods

531973
min	max
i have a jquery slider on my page having min -100 and max 100 and startvalue 0

531977
ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest
you should use the ftpwebrequest and ftpwebresponse classes unless you have a specific reason not to

531989
google-chrome	safari
there is a known incompatibility with ajax.net and google-chrome safari 3

531989
post	put
recently there was a great post put up detailing what to do which you can find here

531989
google-chrome	safari
the general gist of it is that both google-chrome and safari 3 report themselves as webkit in their useragent strings

531997
kde	gnome
on gnome kde you can select in which application you want to open file right click on file - open with - other

532038
rss	feed
i am using an excel macro to generate an rss feed

532038
rss	feed
the user s timezone offset needs to go in the field of the rss feed

532045
post	get
all your state must be explicitly passed via post or get or explicitly saved to a session

532072
ubuntu	debian
i ve installed svn through apache under various versions of ubuntu and debian but never with the newest ubuntu

532072
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r www-data www-data home subversion

532122
kde	gnome
these commands should open up the in the preferred application in gnome or kde respectively although i don t have an installation of either to test on

532138
pop-up	dialog
the only pop-up dialog i ve found in the doc is the wshshell.popup method

532173
mouseover	mouseout
one is tripping over your own state because the mouseover effectively hides the object which triggers a mouseout when the cursor moves again ad infinitum

532254
cvs	svn
a simple plain text file todo in the top level of the project s cvs svn area works for me for simple projects

532278
parallels	bootcamp
i ve just discovered which is a free alternative to parallels and bootcamp

532279
free	malloc
oh and don t forget when you re done with this structure you need to free up all the pointers that were malloc d in this structure or you ll have a memory leak

532286
metaclass	subclassing
look at the modelbase metaclass db models base.py to see what all is done for you behind the scenes when you subclassing model

532290
mouseover	mouseout
the first div outer 1 has event handlers for mouseover and mouseout events

532290
mouseover	mouseout
when you cross the boundary between outer 1 and inner 1 the mouseout and mouseover event handlers fire which in your case is causing the flicker

532290
mouseover	mouseout
the second div outer 2 has event handlers for mouseover and mouseout events but these have been created through the jquery .hover command

532320
mouseover	mouseout
i m currently catching the mouseover and mouseout events to disable enable dragging and zooming but i still can t highlight text and now scrolling the mouse wheel on an area of the overlay that doesn t have anything to scroll causes page elements outside of the map to move up the window

532324
antlr	irony
there s a discussion on that in this question you re essentially stuck with writing your own parser and tokenizer rather than simply writing a bnf file for it and then using antlr gold irony

532378
cvs	svn
oops - used csv instead of cvs to many imports and i use svn heh

532386
integer	fractions
use the integer datatype if you don t want the fractions part or convert to int

532440
glassfish	weblogic
i am not familiar with glassfish but you could do this in websphere or weblogic using a commonj workmanager

532440
jboss	glassfish
apparently the same can be accomplished in glassfish and jboss via a jca workmanager which i am not familiar with

532442
put	get
what i actually intended to do was to create a factory that provides implementations of a generic file transfer interface containing get and put methods based on a given connection uri

532447
vsto	add-in
i want to deploy a vsto 3 application level word 2007 add-in that i ve written with visual studio 2008

532506
rss	feed
my company is starting work on building a web-based rss reader that users can sign up to and track feed

532559
hide	show
i m going to implement an access control list for each individual user so they can assign access to their own resources so they can hide stuff for example from their mothers but show their friends

532564
getter	setter
the standard xmlserializer serialization only acts on public properties that have both a getter and setter

532577
factors	matrix
s is a diagonal matrix which represents scaling or squashing with different scaling factors the diagonal terms along each of the n axes

532577
factors	matrix
so the effect of left-multiplying a vector v by a matrix m is to rotate reflect v by m s orthonormal factors v then scale squash the result by a diagonal factors s then rotate reflect the result by m s orthonormal factors u

532580
opera	safari
im unsure about other browsers like opera or safari it is possible that you need to extend this list with further variants

532599
typedef	struct
typedef struct wf_list_workunit_fe

532617
versioning	upgrade
i have had a lot of success with older versioning i haven t upgrade in a while though

532668
inherited	properties
the datagridview contains an autosize properties inherited from control which garbles the control if enabled

532733
iasyncresult	idisposable
because iasyncresult does not implement idisposable another place must be chosen to free the resources

532745
next	except
also you cannot return a result set except through a ref cursor output parameterâ this is discussed in the next section

532786
iasyncresult	idisposable
anyway there should not be any leak because if the iasyncresult is holding some native resource it should correctly implement idisposable and dispose such resources when the gc calls his finalizer

532787
filesystems	ntfs
have a look at quotas for ntfs filesystems

532828
int	chars
if you can waste a little storage well 25 you might gain from adding a fourth dummy unsigned chars to the structure imgrgb provided that this would increase the size of the structure to the size of an int

532828
int	chars
native int are usually fastest to access and if you re looking at a structure of chars that are not filling up an int completely you re potentially running into all sorts of interesting access issues that can slow your code down noticeably because the compiler might have to generate additional instructions to extract the unsigned chars

532828
int	chars
in the same vein upping the size of the structure members from unsigned chars to unsigned int might waste lots of space but potentially can speed up the code

532888
swt	swing
i have no experience with swt yet i was working with jambi qt swing and gtk as well

532921
filtering	grouping
so ordering grouping filtering

532986
pascal	delphi
i have seen plenty of options for c++ and .net but nothing for delphi pascal

533040
puts	gets
the first puts prints hello foo gets called returning hello which is the argument to puts

533046
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
one more thing you can also bind the width height of the child element to the actualwidth and actualheight properties on the canvas so that the child will adjust the size of its parent

533094
fflush	gets	stdout	fflush
i write a lot of perl scripts and on a fast server unless you set stdout to always fflush after each write the output gets all mixed up just like yours

533167
width	text-align
try making the link a block with an assigned width and then applying text-align center

533229
profiler	aqtime
aqtime from automatedqa offers a static analysis profiler

533229
profiler	aqtime
i have never used this profiler but am happy with those aqtime profilers that i use regularly

533263
public	protected
from a purely practical standpoint java s visibility constructs allow classes in the same package to access methods and properties with protected and default visibility as well as the public ones

533277
gridview	objectdatasource
next modify your objectdatasource to define a deletemethod in your mynamespace.itemmgr that accepts the id datakeynames paramater from the gridview and performs the task you wish to perform

533318
overwrite	preserve
you can change that to public or you can add a method property to your form2 class to set the label and call that latter method is generally preferred to preserve encapsulation and because the designer may want to overwrite your public change.

533338
int	chars	int	double
and the types of variables were defined by a suffix chars a was a string while a was an int and a# was double precision

533368
pascal	delphi
pascal analyser delphi 2006+ has built in audits and metrics source monitor and code healer are the ones that i m aware of - all are pretty useful

533374
int	chars
i think the best approach will be to unroll the loop enough times to ensure that each iteration processes a chunk of data divisible by 4 bytes so in each iteration the loop can simply read a small number of int rather than a large number of chars

533392
width	height
it accepts a height or width argument that you append to the url that calls the script

533398
bash	tcsh
the string will be interpreted by bash and then interpreted by tcsh

533398
bash	tcsh	fish	bash	fish	tcsh
i realize that bash is the cat s meow but i m working in a corporate environment and i m going to choose to not fight a tcsh vs bash battle -- bigger fish to fry

533421
bazaar	git
however it may also be a good chance to look into alternative version control systems that allow greater ease of use and flexibility take a look at bazaar and git

533435
zsh	tcsh
i don t have tcsh installed but with zsh

533447
ubuntu	centos
there s a little extra work involved since you re on centos and it s a lot easier if you re on ubuntu but it s still do-able

533453
button	checkbox
there are various asp.net standard web controls within these tables usually checkbox radio button lists text entry boxes labels etc

533453
put	get
i am trying to put a datagrid within one of the rows under a tag and get the error message

533462
google-chrome	safari
i would like a solution that works on all popular modern browsers ff3 safari google-chrome ie plus ie6

533475
createfile	getlasterror
but my application is failing calling createfile with getlasterror code of 123

533496
post	get
you could easily provide your partners with the javascript to do the get and post

533509
put	get
using tags and css one can hide and display areas of html so while i couldn t get the datagrid in the table i could put it outside of a table and simply display or hide it

533611
put	get
once you get that working you could try to put similar code into a subclassed version of the listview control

533631
inherited	subclassing
reading between the lines of this example which i ve linked to because it s quite long i m presuming it s a case of using multiple inherited to extend a class as opposed to proper subclassing

533656
versioning	upgrade
for example what if a user installs the ie6 versioning of your app then upgrade to ie7

533670
hash	md5
i don t know of any flash-specific ways but it certainly wouldn t be difficult to write a script that compares the md5 hash of the original file with the version you have online

533701
public	protected
i m looking into releasing a public rest api which i d like to keep protected via api keys

533720
jobs	cron
i have found when managing large numbers of cron jobs for a single application that it is best not to have the jobs all hanging loose in the crontab because that encourages you to overlook dependencies between them one task that runs at 14 minutes past the hour depends on a task that runs at 12 minutes past the hour succeeding but every so often that task takes 2.1 minutes to complete and the other script fails giving you a heisenbug

533879
int	chars
i want to either replace the int values with chars values based on some criteria or i want to add another column of chars type that automatically inserts values into itself based on some criteria

533945
post	get
when i get home i ll try to remember to post the script

534006
put	get
you can put the safe on the street corner because what makes it secure is that no one can get inside it but you

534049
bash	tcsh
replace bin sh with a script that executes bash or tcsh depending on who calls it you could for example pass an additional environment variable.

534094
jdom	xom	jdom	dom4j	dom4j	xom
using jdom xom dom4j makes no sense if there is such a dom limitation

534112
ironruby	ironpython
if you host the dlr you would quickly be able to take advantage of ironruby or ironpython scripting

534112
post	get
if you post your question to the ironpython mailing list i m sure you would get a better reply around the xbap scenario and some of the developers there created toyscript

534183
ubuntu	linux
note that i use ubuntu linux and so does my friend and that this application compiles and runs without the -wl -bstatic options just fine.

534243
rsa	dsa
in order to check the signature of the hash anything from rsa over dsa to ecc can be used

534243
crypto++	libtomcrypt
i can recommend crypto++ or libtomcrypt for that

534250
linqdatasource	objectdatasource
however i would prefer to use a linqdatasource or objectdatasource if possible

534283
profiler	visualvm
visualvm is just the standalone edition of the profiler tool included in netbeans

534287
opera	firefox
we have just about the same build runtimes maybe slightly less on selenium i d say around 3x50 minutes runtime same site tests on firefox ie and opera

534298
titlebar	window
you can also try to make the window borderless and make your own titlebar adding

534311
boost	stl
things like what is suggested in meyer s effective stl such as trying to avoid for loops and replace them with more functional constructs using boost bind and boost function etc

534318
mvp	presenter
with mvpc the presenter component of the mvp model is split into two

534335
versioning	upgrade
applicationsettingsbase has a method called upgrade which migrates all settings from the previous versioning

534405
portrait	landscape
i build 2 views one in portrait and another in landscape mode in the interface builder

534444
rss	feed
another idea is to separate your pages between servers - rss feed on one server homepage on another checkout on another one

534447
rss	feed
trac offers you rss feed for everything you can think of

534447
rss	feed
it should be possible to generate daily reports from this or you simply tell your rss client to check the feed once a day

534456
maven	pom.xml
edit if you are using maven you will need ehcache and commons-logging in your pom.xml as well

534475
cos	sin
as below note that in c# for example sin and cos take radians not degrees - multiply by math.pi 180 to get the value in radians first

534520
boost	stl
i m not sure about well written but there are a few things out there like hypertable and kfs that are system-level software that both use boost and stl extensively

534566
versioning	upgrade
google designed protocol buffers for this type of scenario they shift a huge amount of data around - their format is compact using things like base-128 encoding but extensible and versioning tolerant so clients and servers can upgrade easily

534570
put	get
with the bin obj directories gone you don t need to exclude all exes xml files etc - which is handy as it means you still get to put in the ones you want you might have sample xml files etc.

534575
hide	show
this works fine but i d like one of the controls to hide if the boolean is true and show if it s false

534581
ssl	https
also this sets the server up for an ssl connection so once you ve set it up the address will be and https address not the regular

534628
cos	sin
you can use cos and sin to work out the amount of movement in the x and y coordinates

534628
cos	sin
the other thing to note is that the cos and sin functions are using radians instead of degrees

534756
stdout	stderr
produces a log file from stderr and stdout the contents of which are displayed as well but

versioning	upgrade
when you follow these steps you try to upgrade assembly a and assembly b to versioning 2.0.0.0

534996
onfocus	onblur
you might have to just hook into the onfocus and onblur events for the checkbox to keep track of when it gets and loses focus

you might also get some ideas from history flow which jeff atwood linked to in a recent coding horror post

535144
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
instead of having two identical for loops in your presentation logic you should have one for-loop outside of it that builds two arrays then your presentation logic should use each the way that would actually be beneficial to it

int	double
the first step after all the declarations is to make the double an implied decimal by multiplying it by the relevant power of ten then turning it into an int

535324
addslashes	multibyte
the two practical effects are addslashes tends not to work well with multibyte characters and more importantly by asking mysql what characters need to be escaped you avoid a possible future compatibility

535363
mouse	keyboard
i m not a fan of looking at a monitor from an angle am wondering what the pairing experience would be like if you had 1 computer with 2 monitors displaying the same info each with it s own keyboard and mouse

535366
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in firefox 3 google-chrome but fails in internet explorer but only sometimes certain actions such as resetting the form which really just does a response.redirect with some querystring parameters .

535492
versioning	upgrade
but issue is that iphone sdk gets frequent updates and requires updated versioning of mac os x - updating hackintosh is pain you can do better development on macmini instead of wasting time to upgrade and you will never know when your hackintosh will be unbootable

535496
std	ostream
edit true manipulator semantics a persistent quoting state could also be achieved by wrapping an std ostream rather than deriving from it as noted by benã it in the comments.

535496
std	ostream
to the best of my knowledge this cannot be done directly without either deriving a new class from std ostream or similar or wrapping such a class in another class that forwards most methods to its contained std ostream object

535589
urllib	httplib
jamesâ specific example was the http libraries httplib urllib urllib2 urlparse mimetools and ftplib

535654
getter	setter
if the dto is a class that is exposed by a web service the wsdl that is created defines the property as an element and the proxy that gets created on the other side just creates a getter setter property that is run on the client itself so the getter and setter do not cause a roundtrip

535654
getter	setter
even if you just create a public variable in your dto the proxy will be implemented as a getter and setter

535655
hide	show
given that most people have a tendency to top post i d like to be able to hide the duplicated message in an email reply in a manner similar to how gmail does it show quoted text

535655

implements	extends
with poco you have to use the runnable interface and the usage is close to what you would get with java threads if you implements runnable not extends thread

535826
implements	extends
instead of implements extends an interface it depends on the operator being defined

x86	64bit
back to basics 32-bit and 64bit confusion around x86 and x64 and the .net framework and clr

535933
apache	nginx
i typically use nginx as a frontend and apache passenger as a backend

535933
apache	nginx
so have apache listen on port 81 to handle rails requests proxied by nginx and let nginx deliver static content

535933
apache	nginx
not only is nginx supposedly faster than apache at delivering static content but this also offloads your rails application for every image stylesheet javascript or whatever other static content

535937
versioning	upgrade
also i would suggest you to upgrade your jvm versioning if its possible as that is what sun will suggest at first place

535944

then add the number of preceding enumvalue siblings of the current node and subtract the number of preceding enumvalue siblings of the node from which you took the data value

536081
mouse	trackpad
in general the scrolling action on a trackpad simply sends the same signals to the pc as the scroll wheel on a mouse so your current implementation should work

we have started to use gcov and lcov together

536207
gcov	lcov
i also want to add that if you are already using the gnu compiler tools then gcov lcov won t be too difficult for you to get running and the results it produces are very impressive

536275
sorting	grouping
given that the view you want is - as you say - just a view of the underlying data then you should do the sorting and grouping in the view module

536290
superclass	subclassing
slicing means that if you assign a subclassing instance to a superclass variable the extra information contained by subclassing is sliced off because the superclass variable doesn t have the extra space to store this extra information of the subclassing

536290
superclass	subclassing
when you assign a subclassing instance to a superclass variable you actually just copy the reference

536350
put	get
i want to have a db script for cleaning up an existing db which is not in use rather than creating new ones especially when you have to put in a request to your db admin and wait for a while to get it done

today everywhere i look i see raii and sfinae and stl and boost and well modern c++

536479
accessor	properties
the synthesize directive tells the compiler to generate accessor for your member variables according to the specifications given in the properties directive in your .h file

536486
division	multiplication
note that converting this number to from a human-readable form is by no means a trivial task - it requires multiplication and division by 10 or 256 and i cannot present code as a sample without proper research

536486
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
the advantage is that the operations add subtract and multiplying can be made really efficient and the heavy conversion to from base-10 is done only once in the beginning and once after the end of the calculation

536492
factors	mean
i m sorry i m unsure of exactly what you mean by passing around the function pointer to the factors method but i generally wouldn t use a function pointer if you don t have to

536511
folder	directory
for example given the files folder x.file and folder folder y.file i want to create the directory folder x and folder folder y

536584
hash	salt
typically i always recommend using a cryptographically-strong random value as salt to be used with hash functions for passwords such as to protect against rainbow table attacks

536584
hash	salt
note i am not asking about why to use salt how to protect it it doesn t need to be using a single constant hash don t or what kind of hash function to use

536605
pop-up	dialog
i have a button when a user clicks it i want to pop-up a jquery ui dialog with two go nogo confirmation buttons

536620
hash	salt
using a salt that is known to the attacker obviously makes constructing a rainbow table particularly for hard-coded usernames like root more attractive but it doesn t weaken the hash

536620
hash	salt
the concatenation of a username and password might still provide an entry for an intelligent rainbow table so using a salt of a series pseudo-random characters stored with the hash password is probably a better idea

536642
cvs	svn
if you use the svn cvs git

536667
inherited	properties
soaphttpclientprotocol which your proxy should inherited from has a timeout properties inherited from its ancestor webclientprotocol

536671
hash	salt
salt should have as much entropy as possible to ensure that should a given input value be hash multiple times the resulting hash value will be as close as can be achieved always different

536671
hash	salt
using ever-changing salt values with as much entropy as possible in the salt will ensure that the likelihood of hashing say password + salt will produce entirely different hash values

536671
hash	salt
the less entropy in the salt the more chance you have of generating the same salt value as thus the more chance you have of generating the same hash value

536671
hash	salt
by varying the resulting hash value as much as possible by using high entropy salt values ensures that hashing the same input+random-salt will produce many different hash value results thereby defeating or at least greatly reducing the effectiveness of rainbow table attacks

536698
width	height
what you can do offcourse is to open a new window with defined small width height and all menus are stripped.

536746
vmware	esx
on one server running on vmware esx i see the following tell-tale signs of a virtual machine

536756
hash	salt
salt is traditionally stored as a prefix to the hash password

536756
hash	salt
however using the username or any other user-controlled value as salt would reduce cross-system security as a user who had the same username and password on multiple systems which use the same password hashing algorithm would end up with the same password hash on each of those systems

536763
serializable	deserialization
mostly because of serializable deserialization and network latency

536767
postgresql	mysql
oracle vs postgresql vs mysql

536773

536777
put	get
if you don t put resources into it time money focus effort then you won t get anything out of it except failure and cost

536778
hash	salt
though this doesn t add much to security against dictionary attacks etc. it does remove the fringe case where someone copies their salt and hash to another record with the intention of replacing the password with their own

536829
pop-up	dialog
on the dialog that pop-up check the run with different credentials

536829
pop-up	dialog
when you start the program through the shortcut it will pop-up a dialog asking for which username and password you wish the program to run under

536852
hash	salt
since you need to be able to recreate the hash you have to already know what the salt is

536852
hash	salt
you have to assume that the attacker who has your hash values probably knows your salt values as well

536878
mouseleave	mouseenter
you could use mouseenter and mouseleave in this way

536895
nunit	mstest
the problem is when trying to unit test our code nunit or mstest are not running from within the autocad context and they also cannot start it

536900
implements	extends
so if anyone tries to use your library it won t have difficulties implements your interface as opposed to the case where he would have to extends your abstract concrete class given that he already extends another already

537008
client-side	server-side
i m not familiar with the server-side .net part of this but if this issue were happening in a regular jquery client-side setup this would need to be added to the click handling function

vbscript	jscript
windows xp and vista have vbscript and jscript engines installed by default

537180
vbscript	jscript
as for my 2 cents vbscript and jscript are both very mature technologies that have plenty of resources available

537188
vbscript	jscript
windows scripting host invoked through cscript.exe supports vbscript and jscript

537197
vbscript	jscript
xp and vista come out of the box with vbscript and jscript support

submit	submission
to stop the submit if you don t intend on it submission

537493
ncover	partcover
if you have a build process you could use a tool like ncover or partcover and fail the build if the coverage isn t sufficient

537531
hash	md5
if saving is a very expensive api call db transaction etc then you might find that it s worth the expense to serialize the object on-load and save an md5 hash of it

537549
processors	hyperthreading
basically my understanding is hyperthreading on the same processors shares the same l1 l2 cache which can cause issues between the two

537553
vmware	virtualbox
contemplating on moving to vmware or virtualbox setup for development and keeping the development tools off of my main system but then think that would cause a headaches if i want to just try something really quick

537562
put	get
if you put your code before the base.onxxx you get executed before the event does

537616
children	parent
the class inherits the interface but it is still the responsibilityy of the children class to implement the interface it inherited from the parent

that s the same with psql the postgresql command-line interpreter and mysql the mysql shell

537693
debian	linux
it happened with an alternate signature field for pgp and weaknesses with ssl implemented on debian linux

superclass	subclassing
using prototypes would save you this and make a property update on a superclass filter through to the subclassing as expected

537848
put	get
i really want to put a little question mark image next to some of the input fields on my for so the user can click and get a little box to come up and provide some help text

538003
hash	md5
checking the md5 hash by itself is sufficient for most purposes

538011
hash	md5
md5 is probably safe for what you re doing but there s no reason to continue to use a hash with known flaws

538016
hash	md5
in general if the md5 hash don t match the sha1 or any other similar hash won t match either

538040
hash	md5
because the two hash are calculated differently two files with the same md5 hash are no more likely to have the same sha-1 hash than two random files

538050
apache	nginx
i d recommend using a fine-tuned apache or nginx for this purpose

538069
min	max
start at either the top or bottom of your convex hull search for coordinate with min or max y and split it into horizontal trapezoids

538074
hash	md5
md5 is considered weak in the sense that it is possible to construct two documents with the same hash with a much lower amount of cpu time needed than it would take for a brute-force search collision resistance of md5 has been broken

538074
hash	md5
but it s not as far as i know weak from the standpoint of if you have an arbitrary document x someone else can create a document y with the same hash with a much easier time than a brute-force search md5 still has preimage resistance

538074
hash	md5
even if md5 is broken in that regard it s improbable that someone can come up with an algorithm to create documents to match an arbitrary md5 hash and an arbritrary sha1 hash

538074
hash	md5
but again if this is just integrity to protect against errors one md5 hash is fine

538116
google-chrome	safari
for safari google-chrome the console methods accept only 1 argument while the firebug console api which is what i m trying to replicate accepts any number of arguments that are printed as a concatenated string

vbscript	vba
to start with vbscript the flavour of vb that scripteditor is aimed at is very different to vba in quite a lot of ways

538132
octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
with a little practice hex or octal are easier for a human than binary

538152
multibyte	substr
but in case if your string contains multibyte characters non-english characters mb_substr should be used which is a safe multibyte substr function

538236
hash	md5
ignore the time of the error and get an md5 hash of the error message

538236
hash	md5
check to see if that md5 hash is already in your database of errors

538317
children	parent
rules like a parent object will have up to 2 children could be enforced in database using triggers

538325
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
aggregate-functions like count max min avg sum and others by definition perform their function on a set or group of records so the max arrivaltime needs to be in the form of

jruby	mri
it seems that jruby and mri have different limits to separate fixnum and bignum

i ve got a task table with the following columns the taskorder is for ordering the children within the scope of the parent not the entire table

539193
gridview	repeater
no databinding no gridview and no repeater

539224
put	get
i was thinking that if i could put a list collection into a gridview then perhaps i could get it right back out

539278
antialiasing	transparent
specifically using drawtext any text that s rendered with antialiasing flags set is rendered as though the background were not transparent

539295
textmate	bbedit
although only the trials are free both bbedit and textmate are excellent text editors and reasonably priced

539295
textmate	bbedit
i like textmate a little bit more but i tend to use bbedit as it has better printing capabilities and i often find myself printing hard copies for reference

539316
width	margin
you need to set the margin of the body to 0 for the table to stretch the full width

539360
subtraction	modulo
you can convert that to hours and remainder by using a combination of modulo and subtraction

539450
vim	emacs
i would also consider trying to learn how to use vim or emacs

autoresetevent	manualresetevent
you can use a static autoresetevent manualresetevent data member in your application class

539488
hash	md5
what i need to do is provide a file browser box on a web page where a user selects a file from their computer and through javascript or flash if necessary some sort of hash is returned such as crc md5 or sha1

539497
put	get
what you d also proabably need to do is put it in a namespace and implement the free function operator overloads and rely on adl for it to get picked up

539501
super	implements
class.getinterfaces will not return the interfaces implements by super classes

539561
public	protected
there s no syntactical way of making a method private public or protected in javascript it strictly relies on where the method is defined scope

539568
inherited	properties
the inherited interfaces define simple data properties like

539584
boost	stl
if you do decide to take a c++ job make sure the shop uses the stl effectively and that they are using boost

539584
boost	stl
not looking at using boost stl but actually using it

539609
rss	feed
each entry in the so rss feed has a category node which contains all of its tags and pipes would allow you to build and or not expressions based on those categories

539609
rss	feed
even if you don t want the pop-up notifications you get with e-mail the pipes solution will let you monitor what you want in an rss feed

539628
allocator	stl
i m trying to write a custom stl allocator that is derived from std allocator but somehow all calls to allocate go to the base class

539631
sorting	filtering
it depends on what you are filtering sorting on and how the table is indexed

539633
sorting	filtering
also if you do the filtering sorting on the client-side then the records would only have to be retrieved once

539717
javadb	hsqldb
it includes javadb built on top of derby hsqldb sqllite

539739
ssl	https
you can enable https in your iis config but it won t be secure unless you acquire an ssl certificate and plug it into iis

539769
implements	extends
you could always extends smtpappender to implements the functionality you need

539801
client-side	server-side
php is a server-side technology and what you describe is mostly a client-side issue

539804
hash	md5
convert the integers to strings separated by commas and hash the resulting string using a common hashing algorithm md5 sha etc

539816
salt	md5
can i use md5 or sha1 or salt

539820
packets	pcap
then fireup tcpdump ethereal wireshark choose your pcap poison and move around do random stuff to find out what packets is doing what

539828
hash	md5
md5 sha1 are used to derive hash that are used to verify that data has not been tampered

539850
hash	md5
to create a hash value using md5 try

539850
hash	md5
hash md5 string to hash

539857
translation	localization
localization it s easier to translation text than images

539944
listview	gridview
i have a listview gridview that has a list of clients

539987
chgrp	chmod
eventually you ll want to extend the script so you can pass through chmod and chgrp commands

539988
installation	downgrade
downgrade your installation of xampp to the previous version and the bug is fixed

540045
expression-blend	silverlight
to get design control over your silverlight 2 xaml you need to install expression-blend 2

540045
button	checkbox
once the asset library is open a good tip if you can t find the control you are looking for you mention you cannot find the button control in expression blend 2 is to type it s name in the search area at the top left or click the show all... checkbox as shown above

540045
expression-blend	silverlight
this blog post is a good place to start for a first look at using expression-blend with silverlight 2 with plenty of screenshots

540045
expression-blend	silverlight
there are also some follow up videos to that blog post called introducing blend to silverlight developers and silverlight programming and expression-blend that you can watch

540123
haskell	ocaml
edit if you want general information try perusing a bit of haskell or ml family ocaml f# to see how they re used and then form your own decisions

540128
wordpress	joomla
for instance joomla uses an extra xml file that defines each area whereas wordpress uses comments within a page template to inform the system that the php file is a template

540128
wordpress	joomla
i like the joomla approach because you don t have to parse the php file to find the areas but i like the wordpress approach because you don t have an extra xml file associated with every template

540141
basecamp	trello
you really should consider something like trello versionone rally or even basecamp for this

540208
database-normalization	denormalization
database-normalization and denormalization are at the heart of this trade off

540316
firefox	safari
although the gradient without the image is only working in firefox and safari

540329
ubuntu	debian
get your apache up and running and try do configure it like debian and ubuntu do it eg have directories for loaded modules

540349
hide	show
using jquery i want to show hide the rollover image when the onmousemove onmouseout event happen

540373
postgresql	mysql
you might like to look at the chapters in the mysql manual and postgresql manual on indexing

540375
wxpython	pythoncard
ive never used pythoncard but in pure wxpython you can just put a scrolledwindow inside the frame then use a sizer to controll the scrollbars asumming the contents of the sizer dont fit in the window

540391
firefox	safari
actions 1 2 works in in firefox but not in safari and ie 6 7

540393
vb.net	vb6
well the vb.net has some stuff for backward compatibility with vb6 but you can access the moste of it from c# if you add a reference to the right assembly

540452
mouseleave	mouseenter
consider using a textblock and adding each word as it s own inline or then either bind to the inline s ismousedirectlyover property our add delegates to the mouseenter mouseleave events

540468
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
the advantage to have a multiplatform application is that our customers sometimes have knowledge in linux sometimes in solaris sometimes in freebsd .

540515
inherited	subclassing
however the above breaks when i subclassing foo since even tho init is inherited it still returns which contains a pointer to instance of foo

540543
nsoperationqueue	nsinvocationoperation	nsoperation	nsinvocationoperation
nsinvocationoperation objects can be added to an nsoperationqueue just like nsoperation so that you get multi-threading without having to subclass

540561
disk	ram
getting your software use less resources run faster be smaller use less ram less hard disk space both when running and when storing documents less network access .

540684
folder	directory
i pull of my source from tfs into my vs projects folder and it doesn t take this app long to search all sub directory and it always seems to find what i need

540768
x86	64bit
i am only really focussed on linux x86 and 64bit and the mac which is important if you are building on a powerpc due to endian issues

540784
bazaar	git
it isn t clear to me how to support this work flow well with git or mercurial or bazaar

540832
children	parent
two combo boxes on a winforms form the first has a list of parent categories the second is children of the parent the child list changes contents depending on the selection in the parent

540832
children	parent
this also works fine and as soon as i change the parent selection the presenter changes the list children on the dto and the values shown in cbochildren changes fantastic i hear you cry and i did myself

540842
ubuntu	debian
which works on at least debian and ubuntu and since it s lsb it should surely be on most of the other mainstream distros at least

540846
ssl	https
recently i ve set up the clearcase remote client an eclipse plugin to work through ssl so instead of an http url it follows an https url

540847
pull	push
thus checkout clone push pull for git users will be fast

540903
client-side	server-side
gwt provides client-side and server-side components

540907
vmware	esx
i have a vmware esx server

540974
easymock	jmock
use mocks easymock is one of the best mock frameworks or you could use jmock if you like the name better

540977
gridview	detailsview
and changed autogeneratecolumns to false in gridview and autogeneraterows to false detailsview

541034
junit	easymock
once you have small components it s pretty easy to test them with junit easymock or any other standard test utilities

541054
folder	directory
at work we use code igniter as a php framework for our web applications and have created a new project template which does exactly that simple directory structure blueprint css jquery and the code igniter application folder filled with a couple of commonly used libraries authentication some speciales models for often used databases...

541098
post	put
because the code was a bit too much to put in a post i moved it to github as a gist

541147
public	protected
it s pointless to test your private and protected methods since those will be consumed by public methods that you should test in your subclasses

541147
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
whenever you re testing a subclassing of your base class have your test class inherited from your test superclass

541179
equals	gethashcode
you should override the equals and gethashcode method in order to implement your own equality comparission

541179
equals	gethashcode
as you have pointed out they have to be same type cause if not it would fail on compile-time but i would insist that it might be convenient to implement your own equals and gethashcode functions

541179
equals	gethashcode
that s because .net internally uses gethashcode and equals methods from object

541203
put	get
if i try to add a user to that group i get the access denied page but the user is not put in the group

541205
hide	show
i need to produce letters that hide and show sections paragraphs based on formulae but the users want to be able to edit the text

541222
uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource
you have to implement the uipickerviewdatasource and uipickerviewdelegate protocols to get data into your picker and know when the user makes a selection

541258
tripledes	aes
in that case use any decent symmetrical encryption algorithm you can such as tripledes or aes or blowfish

541260
hash	salt
you hash the password when the user first creates it preferably hashing with a salt value and store the resulting hash value

541260
hash	salt
to check that a users password is correct you simply ask the user for the plain-text password hash their input again and compare the resulting hash value with the hash value you have stored taking salt into account of course

541278
subtract	add
datetime.today holds today s date from which you can subtract 1 day add -1 days to become yesterday

541305
inherited	properties
everything from the prototype is inherited including the constructor properties

541329
typedef	struct
a stack frame is held in a struct typedef d to pyframeobject which is defined in frameobject.h

541329
versioning	upgrade
versioning and upgrade of workflows

541334
base	fractions
automated testing is not possible and can only be applied to a small fractions of the code base

541348
accessor	properties
this can also be used on accessor properties and events

541349
hide	show
yes the entity framework hide foreign key id properties and show navigation properties instead

541361
vsto	add-in
i think compared with the alternatives ie constantly rebuilding excel workbook files it d be much less hassle to move over to vsto or com add-in using vba for light prototyping work

541363
put	get
to do that you have to associate each key with a set of values with corresponding logic to create the set and enter remove values from it instead of simple put and get on the map

541372
width	height
from what i can tell in xamlpad the problem appears to be that your canvas does not have an explicit height width and that its horizontalalignment defaults to being in the middle of the border

541372
width	height
without an explicit height and width the border appears to collapse to 0 height and stretches on the width

541372
width	height
your best bet is to give the canvas an explicit height and width

541417
xsl-fo	xslt
typically xsl-fo is generated using xslt and then the transformation result is passed to a formatting objects processor such as fop

541417
xsl-fo	xslt
in some cases xslt at least not 1.0 is not enough if your xsl-fo document is very complex

541417
xsl-fo	xslt
in some cases maybe xslt is not right for the job you could then consider using code to generate xsl-fo

541454
put	get
now that the level of indent becomes meaningful you no longer have to rely on balancing parenthesis to get that information and since it s more compact to put them on the same line as the closing statement that s what lispers do

541456
width	height
var popup window.open popup height 400px width 400px

541500
implements	extends
i m not an expert but i can think of one reason to implements runnable instead of extends thread java only supports single inheritance so you can only extends one class

541506
implements	extends
in practical terms it means you can implements runnable and extends from another class as well

541549
migrate	upgrade
each upgrade is specified in php code which will change the database schema and migrate all existing data

541609
pull	push
then every time it was called it would check what state it was in and process i o accordingly push bits onto output pins pull up a line etc

541640
stateless	stateful
what you want is to open a session with the client stateful soap instead of stateless

541758
width	height
setting height and width to 100 does not size the image to its actual size

541758
width	height
it sets height and width to approximately 1.04 inches which skews the image

541758
width	height
leaving off the height and width has the same effect

541758
width	height
setting height and width to auto has the same effect

541758
button	checkbox	width	height
most annoyingly if i open the generated document in word 2003 right click on the image open the format picture dialog and go to the size tab it display the correct height and width under original size. it even provides a reset button that resizes the image to its original size assuming the relative to original picture size checkbox is checked.

541871
profiler	yourkit
i use yourkit java profiler which lets you measure this sort of thing and much more but using it s own format rather than analysing the log

541875
int	chars
you d then map that random number or a series of random numbers to a chars possibly by casting the int to a chars and repeat that until you have a string of chars long enough

541881
qwebview	pyqt
i haven t used qt-jambi but if it is anything like qt in c++ or pyqt the qwebview would resize automatically as the window size changes

541938
post	get
problem solved it was in the .js file it was pointing to post and should have been get

541964
spaces	linefeed
the pre tag in html marks the text as preformatted and all linefeed and spaces will appear exactly as you type them

542010
dictionary	map
you can use a dictionary or hash map if you are coding in java it s called table driven development by steve mcconnell

542075
for-loop	loops
a for-loop is merely a nice convention - a for-loop is easily decomposed as a while loops

542102
submit	submission
in your handler function you can determine the submission element simply by inspecting the event target s name and if you need access to the form s information or other elements you can get this from the submit elements form attribute

542176
post	get
my guess is that the issue you are experiencing is due to the fact like others have advised that you are doing a get request instead of a post request

542189
ssl	https
also this example does not work properly over an https ssl connection tcp 443 by default because the telnet client cannot negotiate the necessary encryption commands to establish the ssl session

542189
ssl	https
although an initial connection is possible over the https ssl port no data is returned when you issue a get request.

542192
processors	hyperthreading
robin day is probably right however if you are using a processors that supports hyperthreading you may get a performance benefit by turning this off in the bios

542192
affinity	processors
has not a got processors affinity set

542211
rss	feed
from a windows command line i d like to be able to publish to an rss feed

542234
awt	swing
which java framework awt or swing makes more sense for something this simple

542252
swt	swing	awt	swing
use swing or swt since awt has no tabs built in

542257
ssl	https
the telnet client is not going to know to send a properly constructed request to initiate an https handshake so i imagine the ssl secured server is just waiting for more data

542329
google-chrome	firefox
this works in the three browsers i use for testing ie firefox and google-chrome

542387
awt	swing
swing is your best choice if you re stuck choosing between swing and awt

542396
post	get
if i take the attrib out the form post and i get the cf enctype multipart form-data error

542435
rss	feed
we also have some internal rss feed so i want a control to be able to add an rss feed to the page

542442
awt	swing
awt was the first java gui framework it had a lot of flaws and was abandoned in favor of swing

542446
googletest	gmock
gmock which only works with googletest

542537
post	get
you can check out this post with the sample code to download to get you started on how to do it

542550
prepare	execute
for instance in the above query i could prepare the statement once and then loop over creating the data array from a bunch of data and repeat the - execute as many times as needed

542585
inherited	subclassing
the subclassing cannot automatically inherited init so that init would still call the subclassing constructor because init is not a virtual method and is called without an object

542723
post	get
correct but non-working example because google only supports get â sorry i couldn t think of any open post forms off the top of my head

542759
client-side	server-side
again the js library is built the backend is build - so its just a question of should i build out pages and logic using jquery client-side repeaters and such or the more traditional server-side approach

542788
min	max
i would tend to use defined min and max dates instead of nulls

542864
min	max
define min and max constants and let null be null

542934
imperative	declarative
it then goes on to express that functional languages because they are not imperative are declarative by their very nature

542991
matlab	simulink
matlab and simulink are good examples of this

542992
ubuntu	debian
for instance if you re on debian ubuntu you can install a ming win32 cross-compiler by doing

543017
ncover	ndepend
i seem to recall ndepend being able to compare with data from earlier builds so it looks like the combination of ndepend and ncover might do the trick

543027
puts	gets
the trick in get_values starts with the top-level reference gets the next lower level and puts it in the same variable

543029
dictionary	map
basically no you will at least need to have a dictionary or function to map operator characters to their implementations

543048
disk	ram
i use ram tables frequently to avoid any transaction costs and save on disk activity

543069
width	height
stretch to width and height of the stage

543105
filtering	grouping
the situation is this i want one user grouping to have one filtering as default on blogs while another grouping - another filtering without having an effect on filtering defaults for other content types

543107
bazaar	svn
i m working on emulating svn externals in bazaar

543126
telerik	componentart
i d also have a look at many third party grid tools from telerik infragistics componentart componentone devexpress that have a lot more capability than the inbuilt gridview control

543151
collabnet	svn
we re using collabnet svn binary on a windows machine

543163
rss	feed
i m trying to build a simple user template system so that my users can edit the layout of rss feed items and system-generated emails without messing with view files and such

543173
inherited	properties
that is because the content properties of tooltip inherited from contentcontrol and the content properties of a contentcontrol can be any type of object such as a string a uielement or a datetime

543258
stdout	stderr
if you want the actual traceback sent over you need to create a socket channel for both stderr stdin and stdout which goes over the network instead of printing to your local host

543283
nsmenu	nspopupbutton
to the left main-window with a nspopupbutton under the nsmenu

543290
inherited	properties
the most basic differences in this context are that by providing an abstract base class you provide an inherited point for custom plugins written either by you or other developers and ensure that certain methods properties provide default behavior and force the derived classes to implement certain required methods properties

543290
public	protected
you also cannot specify anything other than public members in an interface while an abstract class can have abstract or virtual non-public members typically protected

543300
keydown	keyup
you could trap the enter key in keydown keyup keypressed

543304
children	parent
it seems as though you are accessing children folders through their parent

543327
put	get
the reality is that if you make data hard to get to in the database developers will use other techniques to not put the data in the database or perverting the database

543361
stdout	stderr
including stdin stdout and stderr

543379
vim	textmate
i d like to know how people deal with this in other editors including vim texshop textmate and any others you think would be useful to collect here

543437
width	height
it s also possibly to manually programatically rotate the image in a lossless fashion if certain criteria are true - rotation must be 90 180 degrees and the width height must multiples of the block-size

543448
children	parent
it doesn t allow for an unlimited hierarchy max 10 levels max 1000 children per parent node - if i d started the orderby at 0 but more than enough for my needs

543451
min	max
and looking for any instances where the max and min values returned differ

543520
getter	setter
it also depends on what standard is used in your organization in your application or even on what language you are using if you use a language with getter and setter you can more easily replace member variables at a later time for example

543531
min	max
there may be a third way using nulls for dml statements and then have a trigger change that to a predefined min max value

543566
actionscript	mxml
flex is an mixed open-source proprietary framework + compiler by adobe written in actionscript and an xml based declarative language called mxml used to construct user interfaces in a declarative style

543575
csc	vbc
if you open the config file for nant you can see where it expects the .net version to be go check to make sure it s there and that you can see hte compiler methods csc vbc etc

543581
actionscript	mxml
flex is many things but in short flex is a technology that combines mxml and actionscript and allows you to quickly build rich internet applications for the flash player

543581
actionscript	mxml
good to know is that mxml is compiled down to actionscript so it is perfectly possible to write everything in actionscript and avoid mxml although i wouldn t recommend that in most cases

543582
hide	show
you d attach a handler for the log in button s click event that would hide it and show the _chatform instead

543591
equals	gethashcode
equals and gethashcode for anonymous

543608
cos	sin
now let s review some sample values for cos and sin

543608
cos	sin
note that calculator.app gives wrong results for cos xï and sin xï

543647
equals	gethashcode
if they are not value types then the type needs provide it s own equals and gethashcode implementations for it to work

543693
versioning	upgrade
to versioning simply deploy the solutions as an upgrade and use powershell to update in your apps as appropriate if you update your versioning number

543693
versioning	upgrade
in a recent upgrade i had to versioning two web parts and then used powershell to loop through all 1 500 my sites removing the old web parts and adding back in the new ones

543714
put	get
since you re opening up a new window this is about as efficient as you re going to get unless you want to put it into a function to shorten it for typing purposes

543730
width	height
and then also set other relevant attributes like the width height background color etc for that

543734
width	height
setting the to block lets it fill the width and you can give it height padding etc

543783
cpu	processors
on a machine with a load less than 1 per core your desktop machine when you re not doing much of anything a cpu bound process will consistently have more that 50 of a processors often more than 90

543800
dictionary	map
it can be treated as an array list vector hash table an implementation of a map dictionary collection stack queue and probably more

543848
outputstream	inputstream
you don t need to fiddle with inputstream and outputstream and so on just to extract a file

543865
rss	feed
rss feed must be paid for by hashcash or captchas

543873
keydown	keyup
rather than trying to stack up the animations you could start an animation on keydown and if at the end of the animation you haven t yet received keyup then start another animation

543905
cvs	svn
the downside is that you cannot assume that students will know how to use cvs svn at the beginning of the semester

543962
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
works in ie8+ webkit google-chrome safari seems will work in next opera and firefox

543963
opera	safari
usually ie6 vs everyone else with safari and opera adding their salt

543964
min	max
according to the documentation in mysql the max and min aggregate functions accept a distinct keyword

543964
min	max
distinct is supported for avg count min max group_concat and sum

543965
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
works on firefox ie google-chrome safari and opera

544011
width	height
i haven t debugged the app at this level but i m assuming that they have a horizontal stackpanel populated with containers that are fixed to the height and width of the dialog and they slide them in and out with a storyboard

544015
min	max
in the case of min and max this seems meaningless since the result is the same either way

544015
aggregate-functions	sum
but for other aggregate-functions such as count sum and avg the distinct option may affect the result

544065
actionscript	mxml
this framework allows you to use a markup language called mxml to define structure similar to html and a scripting language called actionscript to define behavior similar to javascript

544070
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
sqldatasource or objectdatasource

544183
cpu	hyperthreading
how does the latest ms-sql server or oracle or mysql handle using the additional resources of both multi-core and multi-socket if a quad-socket motherboard has quad core cpus in each socket and something like hyperthreading on top there are 32 threads that could run at once which is really different than a single core cpu back in the days

for reference the naive approach i m referring to could be summarized as select all items with no parent then for each item recursively get it s children

544795
children	parent
traverse the array and assign a reference from the parent object to each of it s children

544805
filtering	grouping
findstr does have some regex support but it is pretty weak no grouping or alternation especially so if you want to filtering out multiple response codes using findstr you would have to chain them eg to also filtering out auth failures

544840
put	get
however if i put the in a hash i get the same syntax error you got with print

544918

545526
pop-up	dialog
both will pop-up the connect to database engine dialog box

545526
openrowset	openquery
if your wanting to write some tsql between servers then you ll need to create a linked server and then use openquery or openrowset in your sql

545562
accessor	properties
that is the base class provides a virtual properties with only a get accessor but the child class overrides the get and also provides a set

545586
public	protected
unfortunately you can not even override and change the accessor level from protected to public for example as documented on msdn

545589
accessor	base-class
so if the accessor in the base-class was protected

545601
implements	extends
the disadvantage would be reactions like yeah great but i just need to know what class i need to extends to implements this controller.

yacc	bison
tools like bison or yacc can help with the generation of a parser from such a grammar and make it quite trivial to produce an interpreter

545730
ant	maven
i used to be a java developer and we used tools like ant or maven to manage our development testing uat environments in a standardized way

545744
sprint	roadmap
on your first sprint you have to estimate at least 80 of the backlog items i m assuming the product owner already had it prioritized to build a reasonable project roadmap which will consist of stories grouped in sprint and a initial estimated projection of the project length

545744
sprint	roadmap
on the following sprint this roadmap will be revised over and over at the start of each sprint adjusting the velocity to the actual velocity that the team is obtaining and re-calculating the project length as needed

545744
sprint	roadmap
so basically these are the 2 types of estimation you should be doing at the start of each sprint where usually the 1st sprint requires a little more effort to build the initial project roadmap

it will allow you to create post and get data and serve to communicate relatively well

546309
filtering	grouping
chart properties - data tab - series grouping edit - filtering - add the appropriate filtering to remove series that you don t care about

546314
gridview	repeater
i have found out that the repeater doesn t have a dom which can be used to do client side operations like adding of rows and stuff the only easy way out due to some constraints i had was to use the gridview control instead and then use its dom and that s what i finally did

546316

546629
sorting	filtering
sql is specialized code well-suited to manipulating sets of data such as sorting filtering and joining

546629
client-side	server-side
for this answer i ll use the term server-side to refer to sql code and client-side to refer to everything written in a different more general purpose language

546629
client-side	server-side
so i prefer to write client-side code rather than server-side code unless i have a compelling reason to do otherwise

546629
sorting	filtering
joining filtering and sorting data almost always belong in sql because the database will do that faster and easier than you can do on the client side

546681
g++	gcc
the other thing to do is turn on your compiler warnings - if you are using gcc g++ the option is -wall

547195
children	parent
ideally we would model scopes as having parent children etc

547222
post	get
the update edit and delete actions post data from a form to the server while the cancel and list actions are can be handled by appropriate get requests

547222

547295
getter	setter
inotifypropertychanged when used also gives you the ability to add more logic in the code of your getter and setter of your properties

547295
getter	setter
in your getter and setter --- all you can do is simply call setvalue and getvalue respectively b c in other parts of the framework the getter setter is not called instead it directly calls setvalue getvalue so your property logic wouldnt reliably be executed

547295
getter	setter
this could be in a getter setter or anywhere else

547300
put	get
a good place to put the logic to get the next route is probably the movenext of your iterator

547337
.htaccess	httpd.conf
to permit ssi on your server you must have the following directive either in your httpd.conf file or in a .htaccess

547383
superclass	subclassing
subclassing is an option you don t loose the designer as long as you don t set the superclass as mustinherit it doesn t really like that

btw i don t like the getter setter convention that is so commonly used on java i think a using leftchild instead would be better

547747
client-side	server-side
long before there were application servers web servers have been running server-side scripts based on client-side input

547747
client-side	server-side
so the answer to your question is that you can almost certainly run a server-side script based on client-side input

547887
post	get
if you mean they literally initiate a get or post request from their server to yours then john rasch is correct they don t have your authentication cookie

and is there a propertymodel alternative that uses getter and setter by default

548356
int	chars
as already stated those are int declared using chars constants

548440
post	get
plus those systems tend to have a lot of plugins or built-in functionality that will further encapsulate things like authentication session management post get data etc

548476
hash	salt
firstly its a best practice to hash passwords one way encryption with a salt random string you tag on the end of your password i know it sounds complex but it isn t

548501
jruby	mri
a quick sanity test showed that using your example i would get 2 os threads on mri and 12 when running the same thing under jruby

548501
jruby	mri
this was on os x using mri 1.8.6 and jruby 1.1.6

548526
inherited	properties
i have a user entity and i want to have two additional entities called creator and assigned that inherited from the user entity basically they should just have the same exact properties as the user entity i don t need any additional properties

548526
inherited	properties
the problem is that when i try to associate the inherited entities with another entity - i don t have access to any of the properties from the base entity

548549
public	protected
note that the propertymodel will check private and protected fields in addition to public fields for a match

548549
getter	setter
this way you can force all property accesses to occur through getter and setter

548551
implements	extends
how do i extends implements the irtd stuff

548567
tstringlist	tlist	inherited	properties
i find myself unsure of which route to take when setting up these properties -- using an array properties a tlist a tstringlist a tcollection or something else altogether perhaps a new class that inherited from one of those

548589
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i don t know if ie supports __proto__ or even has an equivalent frome some s comments this looks to only work in firefox and safari based browsers so camino google-chrome etc work as well

548591
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the closest cross browser thing i have come is this tested in firefox ie google-chrome and opera

548620
yacc	bison
the usual version for c is lexx yacc or flex bison and the easiest way to do it is construct a parse tree

548624
yacc	bison
and of course you could compile a full-fledged parser via yacc bison

548630
public	protected
we don t have this problem in c# because there are namespaces and private protected and public keywords to denote visibility

548635
postgresql	mysql
openoffice.org users however can choose to connect to external full-featured sql database such as mysql postgresql and even oracle through odbc or jdbc drivers

548705
lisp	scheme
in lisp scheme a function is thought of a piece of code and examining a function simply means examining its code

548705
lisp	scheme
similarly as in your question in lisp scheme you would write a derive function that differentiates correctly when given expressions and just errors out or returns garbage on arbitrary inputs

548737
profiling	debugging
strange i had to use an entitlements.plist with the get-task-allow checked for debugging profiling and unchecked for distribution profiling for the respective profiling to work

548749
integer	unsigned
16 bit unsigned integer

548761
udp	tcp
the answer points out that tcp + binary serialization or udp + binary

548772
width	height
there s a problem with the constructor - you use width and height before they are assigned

548774
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
strings equal case-sensitive equalp case-insensitive

548779
boost	stl
if there s functionality provided by the stl but not boost concentrate on learning those bits of the stl

548784
postgresql	mysql
mysql can do it and also postgresql

548791
lisp	scheme
lisp are the only ones with a regular syntax at the core and well-defined standards in the case of cl and scheme

548808
width	height
it is customary for data members to be called m_width and m_height and not just width and height

548827
boost	stl
i d suggest getting a clear handle on stl before looking at boost

548827
boost	stl
boost is meant to build on top of stl and many of the libraries are slated to become part of the standard library eventually

548827
boost	stl
boost libraries are generally less mature and less standard than stl

548848
boost	stl
once you re past the basics with c++ learning how to use parts of stl and then how it works will be better than tackling boost

548855
postgresql	mysql
it s a cross platform framework on top of wxpython which supports mysql postgresql firebird and sqlite

548859
boost	stl
the principles used to design the stl are built upon and expanded on by the boost libraries

548859
boost	stl
if you don t and boost ends up hard to follow you can go back to the stl to get your bearings

548875
button	checkbox
an alternative to a checkbox in this case could be a togglebutton or normal button control

548921
g++	gcc
and you would have to use ld directly and not gcc g++ to link to avoid linking with the dynamic versions as well

548921
g++	gcc
libstdc++ for that reason is tightly coupled with gcc and code compiled with one version of g++ will in general only work with the libstdc++ from with this or a very similar version of g++

548987
tlbimp	sn.exe
edit the solution with using the tlbimp tool from the sdk works beautifully you just have to remember to give the generated file a strong name by generating a keyfile using the sn.exe tool else the visual studio wont compile the solution

549004
portrait	landscape
going from portrait to landscape

549041
int	chars
the error in ie says that it s expecting the identifactor string or int on 17th row and 4th chars

549085
width	height
in the initialization list the fields constructors for the fields width_ height_ and data_ are called passing a width height and the returned pointer of the new sentence as arguments

549085
int	chars
changing the unsigned int to unsigned chars will reduce the size of the structure to 32 bits instead of the 16 that the fully optimized structure

549118
gnu	uclibc
i assume you checked this and i know that uclibc is intended to be a lightweight but rather full standard c library but do not forget that c++ code is hardly independent on the c library and g++ and libstdc++ depend on quite some delicate things i remember problems with libc on some proprietary unix versions so i would not just assume that g++ or the gnu libstdc++ actually works with uclibc without trying - i don t recall seeing it mentioned in the uclibc pages

549212
ienumerable	icollection
here s a small function i m using to determine if an object is a collection which will be enumerable as well since icollection is also ienumerable

549254
rss	feed
i need to create an rss feed from a sqlite3 database containing blog posts

549278
boost	stl
but stl can be learned in isolation whereas boost won t make much sense until you understand the stl since that s what boost is modeled on and designed to extend

549285
kde	gnome
then most systems have some other information stored about users like their long or full name which is nicer to read and therefore many user interfaces windows xp mac os and i guess also some newer unix desktop interfaces like gnome and kde display on desktop login choosers messages etc

549294
curry	first-class
some features of note include type inference generators multimethods optional duck typing macros true closures curry and first-class functions

549331
opera	firefox
i recommend developing for firefox opera w3 spec then using conditional comments for ie6 7

549365
ironruby	ironpython
where a dynamic language is more appropriate use ironruby or ironpython

549427
post	get
the idea is that you have your ajax client written in javascript or maybe something else it doesn t matter and then it will call your backend php with post or get data

549427
post	get
what do you send via post get and how do you interpret it in your backend

549437
vim	emacs
i m 17 and i started using emacs when i was 14 and vim when i was 15

549441
hide	show
the better alternative is to place that code in the page load the values based off the id s and show hide it if necessary

549470
accessor	properties
use bind toobject withkeypath options to bind the view s properties to the array controller s arrangedobjects i assume properties and implement array accessor including indexed accessor if you like in the view

549470
sorting	filtering
if so you may need to bind the view directly to the array s content propertyâ or to the original array on the underlying object and suffer the loss of free filtering and sorting

549521
gtk	fltk
recently i had the opportunity to work with both wxwindows and qt while some time ago i wrote some small programs using fltk and gtk

549570
versioning	upgrade
the correct answer now is to ship a single binary and offer your paid versioning through in app upgrade

549572
swt	swing
swt could also be an option but so far i ve been happy with swing

549573
client-side	server-side
they have allowed server-side developers to prototype and build features that otherwise would require someone with real client-side experience to do all without having worry about the quality of the javascript code they write and leaving the real front-end engineers free to focus on the advanced client-side features

549646
decoder	encoder
lodepng is a lib-less png encoder decoder

549649
oncreate	ondestroy
create the class in the oncreate and free it in the ondestroy of the form

549662
postgresql	mysql
for postgresql or mysql you might check out sphinx

549693
google-chrome	firefox
then what s going on that in firefox google-chrome steel android browser and ie 6 the page loads and does not execute anything in schedulegrid.js

549719
redhat	fedora
reasons being that it is a branch off redhat so experience with fedora should help me if i ever switch to development on redhat a common server choice

549737
stdout	stderr
because it will mix the original stdout and stderr

549789
put	get
get a button and a listbox on a form and put this in the button_click

549790
docx	xlsx
office openxml format based files include the new 2007+ xml based file formats including microsoft office files such as xlsx docx and pptx

549796
getter	setter
properties actually have getter setter implementations they are just done for you by the compiler via the synthesize keyword in an objective-c classes implementation

549796
getter	setter
since the key-value observing protocol is based on the standard getter setter conventions in objective-c observing properties works fine

549817
equals	compareto
equals should also be consistent with compareto though this is not strictly necessary

549840
pseudo-class	visited
first of all if you don t want the browsers own history to interfere with your styles then use the visited pseudo-class to match the style of the non-visited link then just apply classes manually based on your db records

549882
config	ini
legendary windows guru raymond chen described the advantages of xml config files over ini files

549934
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
i think you can implement your own easily using flowlayoutpanel and mouseup mousedown mousemove events of the controls where you change the location property approximately and flowlayoutpanel should handle it

549961
accessor	superclass	accessor	properties	superclass	subclassing
the list is defined in a superclass but the hibernate annotations are applied to properties accessor in a subclassing

549967
post	get
post get and how do you interpret it

549992
pyexcelerator	xlrd
there are also some utility libraries such as pyexcelerator xlrd and xlwt for python and spreadsheet writeexcel spreadsheet parseexcel for perl

549999
sorting	filtering
i can t give up using an array controller because i need the filtering and sorting and because there s an nstableview bound to the same controller

550002
public	protected
so if you don t export all your class it s usable by client code as far as it don t have any public or protected function definition in a cpp file

550026
uitableview	uisearchbar
i m trying to set up an app with a uitabviewcontroller and one of the tabs will have a uitableview and uisearchbar but no navigation controller

550028
googletest	cppunit
personally i don t think the test framework googletest boost test cppunit etc matters that much

550057
accessor	properties
implement accessor including indexed accessor for the mutable array properties that you ve exposed as a binding

550057
accessor	properties
the other way is to implement accessor in the object with the bindable properties the view

550073
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
also we test our sites in firefox safari ie6 ie7 and opera

550097
versioning	upgrade
keep in mind this is not upgrade proof - you will probably have to do this again if you upgrade your versioning of wp

550129
pdfbox	itext
although i do know about itext pdfbox and various other java pdf libraries i am hoping for a pointer to some working example or some how-to

550157
post	get
assuming you are trying to get just the post data into a fieldstorage object

550209
width	height
for instance the radiator item might have data like condition material weight height width and thickness

550243
cgpoint	cgsize	cgpoint	cgrect	cgsize	cgrect
a cgpoint is a c struct and so are cgrect s and cgsize s

550246
nssearchfield	nstableview
i have a simple cocoa user interface with a list of items and a search field implemented using nstableview and nssearchfield respectively

550275
textile	creole
the easiest way to do what you want is to find an appropriate formatter for some lightweight text format like textile or creole pass that through to generate xhtml and then parse the xhtml using any regular parser

550319
width	height
ignoring the whole ns4 sections of code the above will break in today s browsers as the width and height css rules being applied to the #ref #outer and #inner elements are missing a px quantifier

550322
pull	push
so after much push and pull i m curious..

550341
ubuntu	debian
if the machine doesn t have apt-get then chances are it isn t a debian or ubuntu machine which means that using a tutorial designed for debian or ubuntu is unlikely to get you very far

550365
getter	setter
rather the expectation is that you ll access and mutate properties via getter setter methods

550365
getter	setter
in objective-c 2.0 it s easy to declare these properties and automatically synthesize the getter setter so there s not much excuse for not using them

550365
getter	setter
the reason the ivar should be used directly in these cases is beacuse the getter setter may have side effects that depend on a fully initialized instance thus making them dangerous in -init and -dealloc where the state of the object is fully initialized

550365
getter	setter
prefixing with _ works and is relatively common i believe the synthesize d setter and getter will automatically do the right thing in this case but you may have to explicitly set the _ivar as the backing

550480
width	height
you can now apply additional transformation that will scale the width differently along the height

550564
int	double
but your function matches the second argument by a standard conversion sequence from int to long double integral to floating point conversion

550564
int	chars
it s confusing so here are some examples conversions from chars to int are called promotions which are better than conversions from chars to something other than int which is called a conversion

550564
int	double
even though a standard conversion sequence converting from int float double to long double is better than a user-defined conversion sequence converting from myclass to long double your operator version is not chosen because your other parameter long double requires a conversion from the argument which is worse than what the builtin operator needs for that argument perfect match

550565
int	double
edit you ve updated your question to suggest that your conversion is to long double and your comparison is against an int

550565
int	double
either t s operator long double is called and the built-in operator for long double and int is used or d must be promoted to a long double and your member operator is used

550568
int	double
i assume you are comparing against a literal int and not a long double

550568
int	double
built-in conversion int to long double

550570
fat	hfs+	filesystems	fat	filesystems	hfs	filesystems	hfs+
in addition to carbon fsgetvolumeinfo which returns a fsvolumeinfo containing signature and filesystemid fields there is the cocoa -getfilesysteminfoforpath method of class nsworkspace which returns a string representation of filesystems type hfs for hfs+ and msdos for dos fat

550589
hide	show
you can then use the visibility on each element to show hide them

550589
hide	show
setting grid2.visibility to visible hidden will show hide your overlaid content

550629
nsstring	nsdata
i wanna have a nsstring object as nsdata

550636
ndepend	fxcop
a client i work for has begun using ndepend as a replacement for fxcop and the architect has compiled a list of practically unusable cql queries which i gather he has taken from advice from the ndepend website

550643
extjs	mootools
for javascript jquery prototype mootools extjs

550654
dia	visio
i m not after something that will do pretty diagrams that take ages to do btw. like visio dia kudos the the dia developers though kick ass app etc

550677
imperative	declarative
now you can use role-based security either declarative or imperative

550690
division	multiplication
i was thinking if there is a simpler and less expensive considering that this is timing code way to do such scaling than doing the equivalent of iterative 64-bit multiplication and division with two 32-bit integers

550693
libpcap	wireshark
for protocol reverse engineering common tools of the trade include wireshark and libpcap

550710
public	protected
webforms do not offer that convenience however for internal applications or the public ones protected by customer login it is no concern at all

550714
spaces	delimiter
i want to add a text box on a web page in order for users to add spaces delimiter tags

550732
floating-point	fractions
you might wanna read up on floating-point representation as fractions seems to be the first bits of the significand

550732
int	double
you ll need 64-bit int and double floating-point

550735
firefox	safari
full seo compatible supports firefox ie6 and safari and degrades gracefully on other browsers

550767
onkeyup	onkeydown
onkeypress onkeyup or onkeydown check the key that was pressed and if it is a tab then append t to the textbox and return false so that focus remains on the textbox

550792
versioning	upgrade
we have a table that stores the versioning number of the latest patch applied - so upgrade tools can apply any newer patches

550855
profiling	benchmarking
if you really believe that piece of code to be a performance bottleneck profiling or benchmarking it both ways

550901
pull	push
this is the default remote used when you type git fetch or git pull to retrieve new commits into your local repository and the default destination when you git push to push your new local commits out to a remote repository

550909
kate	kde
personally what i feel that in order to develop kde applications in qt better use kate

550934
rss	feed
2. keep up-to-date as best as possible with each apps security updates most have an rss feed

550940
onkeyup	onkeydown
try onkeydown or onkeyup instead

550967
ienumerable	iqueryable
linq reuires only that ienumerable and iqueryable interfaces are implemented

550974
printf	fgets
there are other functions that can help such as printf fscanf fputs and fgets

550979
versioning	upgrade
your best bet is to upgrade to the next versioning of windows7 when it comes out and hope it permanently fixes the issue

550988
cvs	svn
i doubt any generic version control system git svn cvs etc. can handle database in the ways you described

550997
int	chars
switching on a value is fine ok but switch statements are in the majority of cases used to test on a single int chars enum .

550999
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you want to stay within micrsoft s .net world linq is a great technology to learn and not just linq2sql which as you say isn t a full-blown orm anyway as linq can be applied to objects xml and basically anything that s ienumerable iqueryable

551031
pull	push
when a is happy he will git push to push the newly merged changes to the shared repo and b and c can git pull to fetch them

551043
inherited	properties
you can create a single set of project properties vsprops and have multiple configurations inherited from that single set

551043
inherited	properties
when you edit the properties of the configuration you can select for inherited from parent this will set the value to whatever the parent has

551046
folder	directory
we make a complete directory listing all drives and folder to a text file each day

551068
datamapper	activerecord
if what you want is to compare activerecord rails and datamapper hibernate the data source architectural patterns chapter from patterns of enterprise application architecture is a good place to start

551122
int	double
the built-in operator long double int

551126
free	malloc
i believe they simply override the memory allocation and deallocation methods malloc free which has some logic that keeps track of the pointers

551178
typedef	struct
the above link covers commonly encountered issues typedef pointers to struct etc

551180
width	height
a table with the scroll pane cell s width and height set to 100 and all others to 1

551236
domcontentloaded	onload
also greasemonkey executes the script after the domcontentloaded when the dom is ready event so you don t need that onload nonsense

551251
fink	macports
of course if you re not generating the ps yourself then the simple answer is that preview sucks and you should use a better postscript viewer instead install gv through macports or fink or macgsview from here or macghostview or 22 postview

551301
vim	emacs
the difference between emacs and vim is that emacs includes many many features and combines mail news filemanager and of course a text editor

551301
vim	emacs
i personally like vim more but give emacs a try and find the best suitable text editor for you

551310
vim	emacs
these days i use emacs for my serious editing and vim for quick things when i m ssh d into a server

551342
vim	emacs
since emacs is much older than the extensible vim as opposed to the relatively non-extensible vi it has a much larger collection of extension modes covering almost any purpose you can imagine

551342
vim	emacs
your tool of choice can be either vim or emacs or perhaps something else but in any event take the time to learn it well

551394
vim	emacs
1 in this question emacs could be replaced with vim or any other cross-platform editor

551394
vim	emacs
this for me is the primary benefit of being fluent with emacs or vim

551408
google-chrome	firefox
the typical user there is not an administrator on their machine and can t change browsers say by downloading firefox or google-chrome

551446
width	margin
put another div around everything in the and set your margin and width styles on that div rather than the body itself

551463
uninstall	upgrade
also remember that you d probably have to uninstall upgrade the installed .net runtime or reinstall it

551489
post	get
i have seen this with the web application we are supporting - a stray get request out of the blue for an already logged in user wrecking the server-side state and resulting in an error on the subsequent legitimate post request

551520
rss	feed
if you want your drupal site to periodically retrieve content from other sites rss feed for example check out feedapi

551539
rss	feed
i ve tried rss feed but these always-updating sites that have tons of entries per day just fill up my poor reader

551545
postgresql	mysql
i will be running things like mysql postgresql tomcat and my own code

551573
gentoo	debian
right off the bat i d say the major contenders are debian red hat and gentoo depending on management preferences and needs

551595
disk	ram
the tmpnam command appears to be what i need but from what i can see it saves the file on the disk and not the ram

551595
disk	ram
i would like to avoid using a ram disk method if possible

551595
disk	ram
if i m totally honest i m a linux user so ditching windows wouldn t be too bad i m looking into using ram disk for now as fuse seems a bit overkill for a learning thing

551602
portrait	landscape
the line breaks that are visible in portrait remain the same in landscape

551613
puts	gets
wrote a small app that accesses a bunch of search websites and puts the results in a word document which gets run a few hundred times a day

551634
int	chars
in this example assuming that int is 4 bytes and chars 1 byte and the cpu aligns at 32bit boundaries you need 3 padding bytes after b to get the structure aligned

551634
typedef	struct
as for typedef around struct you can even use the same name for the typedef and the struct something like this

551634
typedef	struct
from my point of view typdef-ing a structure is a bad idea as that hides the information that the typedef like foo is a structure and writing the keyword struct isn t really additional work especially if those typedef get a postfix added to indicate them being a structure -- i ve seen this quite often

551652
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried in google-chrome firefox and ie7 but none work

551660
vim	emacs
if use now use and like an ide and you are already familiar with vi vim then don t give emacs a second thought

551660
vim	emacs
emacs will never replace your ide and if it could then vim would do you just fine

551669
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
strictly speaking there are possibilities to do real ajax file uploads but this is only possible in firefox 3+ safari 4 and google-chrome 2

551709
ant	maven
this will put the desired jdk first in the path and any secondary tools like ant or maven can use the java_home variable

551711
post	get
i could then sort this table based on data of replies to get the start to last post

551720
cvs	rcs
it will make rsync ignore files that the rcs program cvs ignores not just .cvs directories

551762
post	get
but to get the whole thread you also need to have some sort of path or sequence column that presents the post in a logical order

551762
post	put
for that reason i would put it in another table - with a 1 1 relationship to the post table

551764
ssl	https
for https this works fine except that if you have a web server which supports ssl session caching then the ssl session cache will be lost if the client comes back to a different server

551771
cpu	processors
just using the stopwatch class won t work and having a look at the process processors time doesn t respect the fact that the cpu time could have been consumed on another node

551778
firefox	safari
the css active link style is being correctly applied in ie7 firefox and safari but is not applied ie6

551824
multiplying	subtract
also generally speaking you shouldn t multiplying or divide by variables adding and subtract is fine though when you move them to the other side of the equation because you ll generally forget of about the condition where the term you multiplied or divided by is zero

551875
required	placeholder
if you need even more fine-grained positioning then you need to put a placeholder or div or span etc on your page in the required position and add your control to that as in scarletgarden s answer

551877
vmware	virtualbox
if virtual machines will work for you you can choose between virtual pc vmware and virtualbox

551877
vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox supports same hosts and guests as vmware

551927
getattr	subclassing
my best guess is that the c++ getattr method should check which will of course be the subclassing dict if this an instance of the subclassing and only call getattr_methods if you fail to find name in there see the pydict_ api functions

551965
folder	directory
for this i need to switch off the normal mapping of url paths to directory folder in apache all requests to all paths should go to one central script pages.php which than analyzes the path component of the url

551970
put	get	post	put	post	get
all resources can be manipulated through a constrained set of well-known actions usually crud create read update delete represented most often through the http s post get put and delete

551970
put	get
it can be a different set or a subset though - for example some implementations limit that set to read and modify only get and put for example

551976
post	get
to contrast a non-restful api might use many more urls and only use the get and post actions

551976
post	get
you ll note how in this case the urls are different and the methods are chosen only out of technical necessity to send data you must use a post while all other requests use get

551990
post	get
what i d like is to get a tabulated list of all my controllers my actions show whether they respond to get or post what their cache settings are etc

552065
pop-up	dialog
and the site requires either a cookie from a previous logon or a response to a pop-up dialog

552113
post	get
you might want to use the post method rather than get with the login form otherwise their password will appear in the url and urls aren t very secure they might get bookmarked or sent to another server as a referral url for example

552123
entity-relationship	diagram
i use omni graffle for entity-relationship or class diagram and graphviz for showing flow charts state diagram really

552148
pull	push
what you probably should do is look up the various git workflow questions and answers - they describe the means by which various team members pull push from to each other

552149
getter	setter
in the second project the code is identical but the first thing that is called is the setter for the selectedsubscription property it is null then the getter for the subscriptions collection is called and finally the setter for the selectedsubscription is called a second time and it has a value that matches the first item in the subscriptions collection

552162
google-chrome	firefox
and yeah that means it gets flagged in say firefox or google-chrome for a partially invalid ssl certificate

552210
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
there are lots of gotchas which are browser defendant and that you may not see unless you check in ie firefox safari opera etc

552240
fadein	fadeout
for instance when you re doing a callback after an animation or a fadein or fadeout

552241
unsigned	short
c1 is unsigned int src is unsigned short

552268
temp	tmp
php session data is stored in the os tmp temp directory by default so the data could be viewed by others

552284
opera	firefox
html5 provides window.postmessage which provides a mechanism for safe cross domain messaging and is supported by firefox 3 opera 9.6 and webkit nightlies

552292
width	margin
if you want to fix up the logo see top right then add an extra container div immediately inside the wrapper and apply the above width margin to the container as suggested by jonathan sampson.

552295
int	chars
int foo float chars chars

552385
stdout	stderr
or use proc_open which gives you much more control than popen as you can specify where you want stdin stdout and stderr to be handled

552390
hex	binary
when trying to determine the content of binary data string use repr or hex

552397
width	height
i want to keep the width but the height should adjust automatically

552412
kerberos	ldap
apache can hook into ldap most any type of sql server or even use kerberos authentication

552446
int	double
suppose i have a takeintreturndoublearray method in this c# library that takes an int and returns an array of double

552446
int	double
all i need to do is have a c++ method that takes an int calls the c# library and returns an array of double to the calling application

552474
lisp	scheme
in a functional style data and functions tend toward having more in common with each other as in lisp and scheme while offering more flexibility in terms of how functions are actually used

552479
avr	microcontroller
it uses a pic microcontroller but my personal favourite is avr

552486
getter	setter
you can certainly observe readonly properties but be aware that in order for kvo to work you need to be kvc compliant - which means using either the setter getter for a property since you re readonly you don t get a setter for free via synthesize or the property s -setvalue forkey method

552496
clang	llvm
the features in question require both compiler and runtime support and so while it is certainly possible to build a compiler that supports the syntax llvm clang comes to mind many of these features call out to the objective-c runtime and to my knowledge and quick double checking on google the gnu runtime doesn t have the necessary support

552506
width	height
if you want to get the image dimensions width and height with out loading the image you need to read some part of jpeg file yourself as below

552609
width	height
which will extend the height of your textfield but not width as the multiline has been set to true

552734
ironruby	ironpython
both languages will have some level of broken backward compatibility in their next majopr releases both have .net implementations ironpython is production ironruby getting there

552783
for-loop	loops
a for-loop is evaluated as a while loops under the hood anyway

552784
for-loop	while-loop
you can think of the for-loop being a more compact way of writing the while-loop

552789
versioning	upgrade
perhaps it was a problem with a partial upgrade or a versioning mismatch on the settings

552797
for-loop	loops
however unless you need to access the i variable outside loops then you should use the for-loop

552825
move	drag
then you only have to define different working sets and can move projects into them using drag and drop

552851
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
the problem lies with domcontentloaded - that s where the hacks with doscroll defer onreadystatechange and whatever else someone has cooked up come to play

552890
ubuntu	debian
i was surprised to know that lenny already promoted to stable - among some of my clients there is some fear that debian would want to compete with ubuntu for the desktop and forget its server devotion

552895
pull	push
every repository is also a backup of the â œmain repositoryâ which is â œmainâ by convention only so a git push from the repository that did the most recent git fetch or git pull should be all it takesâ up to its state of course

552908
pull	push
a git pull and then a git push should be enough

552917
abc	isinstance
these are useful because you can then test to see if something implements a given abc by using isinstance

552943
idictionary	ilist
you declared images property as idictionary while bag should be declared as ilist

552986
integer	fractions
this is the way to do rounding for integer values because the division discards the fractions part

553032
hash	md5
also md5 hash contain only alphanumeric characters all of which are safe to use pretty much anywhere

553097
userid	usergroups
public sub logevent byval userid as string byval usergroups as string

553133
svnkit	subclipse
i am installing subclipse 1.4.x into eclipse ganymede and i m thinking that i should use the svnkit adapter

553160
svnkit	subclipse
svnkit was specifically developed with subclipse in mind so no surprises there

553160
svnkit	subclipse
the subclipse guys support svnkit but i ve had issues with it in the past that was several years ago

553275
post	get
search for get after post - - basically redirect to the current page after you re finished processing your event

553284

553296
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
of course you need the inotifycollectionchanged interface to fire whenever one of the member inotifypropertychanged items fires its event

553320
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
convert both strings to timestamps in your chosen resolution milliseconds seconds hours days whatever subtract the earlier from the later multiplying your random number assuming it is distributed in the range 0 1 with that difference and add again to the earlier one

553325
int	double
on some platforms you can generate a time as a double date is the int part time is the fractions part is one implementation

553325
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
subtract the difference multiplying by random number 0 r 1 add to start time and done

553330
autofac	castle-windsor
having seen how ninject can do it and autofac can do it i m trying to figure out how to inject dependencies into mvc actionfilters using castle-windsor

553370
cvs	svn
its possible to use cvs in this situation altough i would recommend you take a look at other options like svn

553398
queue	fifo
i don t think lilo is the real term...but you re looking for a fifo queue

553400
vbscript	vb6
this is in vbscript but it should work the same on vb6

553417
rss	feed
but it only takes in rss feed

553440
switching	screens
remember every second the splash screens is visible is a second that the user is impatiently staring at your logo swearing they ll switching to the first decent competitor they can find.

553444
rss	feed
visual studio gives you the choice of showing a start page which is based on an rss feed or to show a home page which can be any page on the internet

553444
rss	feed
if you choose the start page you can modify the rss feed from tools options environments startup start page news channel

553482
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i m making a website that will have to render correctly on firefox ie6 ie7 opera safari

553519
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
build in a more-compliant and developer-friendly browser like firefox first test thoroughly in ie and safari google-chrome webkit and opera later

553524
internationalization	localization
the specifics of internationalization localization in .net applications are outside of the scope of this answer but there are many books on the subject

553576
subtract	add
if you were to add up all the inbound deliveries and then the outbound deliveries and subtract one from the other you have the current stock level

553623
pascal	delphi
it s fast and can be compiled with most current pascal tp 5 5.5 6 bp 7 vp 2.1 fpc 1.0 2.0 2.2 and delphi versions tested with v1 up to v7 9 10

553719
post	put
then later on you can collect all the logged data from the file parse it do any required post processing like looking up host names from ip addresses and put it into a database table

553733
inherited	properties
if you have a label control you want to use over and over again inherited from it and set your own properties

553764
firefox	safari
then i d just wrap the entire chunk of code in a conditional that checks to see if the user is on ie as there s no need to run this on firefox or safari

553765
trac	mantis
is a solid step up from trac and mantis and provides migration tools

553928
nurbs	3dsmax
i d like to slice the nurbs surface with a slicing-plane thats on-axis not as advanced as 3dsmax

553981
listener	eventhandler
so in your remove method it s trying to remove a new eventhandler object that was never added as a listener to the event in the first place

553989
int	double
casting double to int truncates the .99999 right off

554009
versioning	upgrade
when the user upgrade to a new versioning of the app i want to maintain their existing data but replace all config data

554093
rss	feed
i ve used this method in creating rss feed and they pass validation based on the validator available at

554099
switching	screens
each can then have their own distinct conventional menubar and toolbar and the users can put the windows side by side on their screens to do their work instead of switching back and forth with a tab control

554108
int	double
shog9 has it right using the type double for a problem like this is not the best way to go if you are going to cast things to int

554108
integer	unsigned
looking at it i realize that you could probably get away with a standard unsigned 32 bit integer as the sum number but i will leave it as is just in case

554138
free	malloc
and don t worry - basically all i want to do is print a more user-friendly error message and free some malloc ed memory and then die

554145
implements	extends
the big problem is that .net seals lots of classes that would occasionally be nice to extends and they don t usually implements a common interface so api methods that take a foo would not accept a superfoo and you can t add an overload

554159
ilist	iqueryable
i am also using the tolist method on the iqueryable interface so this is another reason for sticking with ilist - it just works

554160
folder	directory
for this case you might be able to improve on that by immediately creating a small placeholder file in directory in question and holding a lock on that file until you re completely finished with the folder

554161
median	rank
find median point value count rows less than this value the count gives a rough estimate of rank not considering those with same amount of points

554181
post	get
i m probably missing something obvious but i don t seem to be able to get my ajax post to run consecutively instead of concurrently with jquery

554215
ceil	floor
if you are still stuck with older standards you may use std floor which always rounds to the lower number and std ceil which always rounds to the higher number

554237
postgresql	mysql
mysql is appallingly bad with complex joins innodb when compared with other cost-based engines like oracle and postgresql

554237
postgresql	mysql
i switched from mysql to postgresql and complex joins that would take 30s+ on mysql with all indices in place take milliseconds on postgresql

554247
vb.net	vb6
in vb6 a long was a 32-bit value hence the need for a change in vb.net

554303
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
support the latest versions of all major browsers internet explorer firefox safari opera google-chrome

554307
textwrangler	bbedit	textmate	textwrangler	textmate	bbedit
on mac os x i would suggest textwrangler free textmate or bbedit

554369
getter	setter
the best alternative seems to be abandoning properties in favor of getter setter methods in this case

554396
accessor	properties
in c# you can specify the visibility of a properties accessor independently of the properties

554512
int	double
i looked around for a good idea on how to make your implementation of generatenthfibonaccinumber handle cases where it returns the double 54.999999 but when you cast to an int or a long you get 54

554552
inherited	subclassing
if the number of additional fields columns is small for subclassing then single table inherited is usually the simplest to deal with

554564
getter	setter
basically marking the overall property as public but giving a more restrictive scope to the setter or getter

554564
getter	setter
since the property you re defining in there is marked as mustoverride you can t provide a default implementation it too is abstract and this includes the get and set outlines therefore whichever overall scope you give to this abstract property declaration vb.net will force you to use this scope for both the getter and setter within derived classes

554564
getter	setter
leaving off the readonly qualifier still will not work since whatever scope you give to the abstract property will be the scope you must apply to both the setter and getter within derived implementations

554564
getter	setter
ordinarily when not overriding a base class s abstract definition with a specific scoping level you can give a getter or setter a more restrictive scoping level but you can t give it a less restrictive scoping level

554564
public	protected
doesn t work either due to the public scope being less restrictive than the overall property scope of protected and moreover not of the same scoping level as defined on the base class s abstract property declaration

554564
getter	setter
if the design of your classes is as you mention in your question i personally would go with a java-style getter and setter methods as they can then be declared separately with their own scoping levels

554579
addition	multiplication
this grammar handles only multiplication and addition and already it s not immediately clear whether the grammar is ll 1

554611
put	get
i couldn t seem to get the require-bundle header in the manifest file to work so put everything in the feature.xml

554629
keydown	keyup
for many keys i check on keyup and keydown

554629
keydown	keyup
i use keydown while trying to watch the entire time that the key is held down and keyup when it was used just once

554631
width	height
if the source object is perfectly centered within its canvas you can simply offset it by half its width and height of course.

554689
post	get
i d like to dynamically generate from the controller the jquery script code associated to perform the classical .ajax calls to the controller for create read update delete operations in ajax instead of classical get post form actions

554695
put	get
also in the folder app_code i get an error if i put my js file saying that the language is not the same as other file in app_code

554731
children	parent
ado.net entity framework object with parent and children

554731
children	parent
each of these things has a single parent and zero or more children

554731
profiling	debugging
i m monitoring the sql server profiling while i debugging my application

554731
children	parent
ado.net entity framework object with parent and children and a related object

554734
superclass	subclassing
you ll find articles on how to set up tables that store the attributes of the generalized entity what oo programmers might call the superclass separate tables for each of the specialized entities subclassing and how to use foreign keys to link it all together

554758
objectdatasource	detailsview	sqldatasource	objectdatasource	sqldatasource	detailsview
i have always used the standard asp.net detailsview formsview controls along with either sqldatasource or objectdatasource controls to accomplish what you are trying to do

554768
put	get
though to get a new row you could work with the nth-child selector or use an attribute for older browsers and put clear left

554775
fgets	fgetc
it is possible to read the stdin by creating a file handle to php stdin and then read from it with fgets for a line for example or as you already stated fgetc for a single character

554792
getter	setter
if you are developing it yourself it might still help because if you have a difficult to track bug you can set a breakpoint in the getter setter and see exactly when you are changing the values

554800
getter	setter
chances are good that trivial getter and setter will be inlined anyway - but with public fields you ll have lost the distinction between contract api and implementation

554801
getter	setter
getter setter is a way to expose part of the class to java s simple introspection

554801
getter	setter
the java bean specification relies on having public getter and setter as a way to determine which attributes are important

554811
getter	setter
from the perspective of who has written the code and who is going to use it then it doesn t matter whether its you or anyone else you might still need getter and setter - if anyone at all uses it later on its a defacto public api

554822
getter	setter
if you are replacing getter setter for performance memory optimisation then you are taking the wrong approach

554822
getter	setter
also i would be careful about designing the application as you suggest since it will mean that some properties eg simple properties will be directly accessible while others more complex derived properties or properties where you do not want to expose the underlying types will have getter setter

554826
getter	setter
the jvm will inline frequently used getter and setter

554838
getter	setter
imho for properties that by their very nature are just meant to passively hold data and couldn t do anything more complicated without completely changing their meaning from the perspective of the api user getter and setter are just unnecessary boilerplate

554842
versioning	upgrade
the database has a versioning table that i can programatically access and determine which upgrade scripts to run to get the database upgrade

554844
versioning	upgrade
apparently our infrastructure upgrade to a new versioning of the pop server and new uids were assigned on the new versioning

554874
profiling	instrumentation
if you don t have access to a profiling add simple instrumentation to determine where the bottleneck is

554888
getter	setter
getter and setter are not just for protection privacy

554888
accessor	properties
the external properties accessor mutator has a different meaning to the underlying variable

554909
rss	feed
i m creating a website where i need to show the top 5 records from an rss feed and these need to be sorted by date and time

554909
rss	feed
the date fields in the rss feed are in the following format

555014
public	protected
when referencing a public or protected method or property on the base class be sure to prefix it with base

555073
post	get
i have an operation contract below that i want to allow get and post requests against

555079
xlwt	xlutils
there is a package on pypi call xlutils which might help and there is this presentation from chris withers lightning talk from last europython i think where you can see some example code with xlrd and xlwt

555115
formview	detailsview
i m trying to develop a small utility a winforms app and i was hoping to save time to use a winforms equivalent of an asp.net formview or detailsview to bind to - for single objects as opposed to multiple objects which we could use a datagridview for

555123
sorting	filtering
basically entitydatasource is build to support entity framework entities for features like sorting filtering inserting deleting etc.

555136
lisp	scheme
the above bullet points apply to scheme another lisp dialect

555153
actionscript	mxml
for a true flex application i think you need to start with a top level mx.core.application often defined in mxml rather than actionscript to which you would add mx.core.uicomponent s

555179
ssl	https
_server https isn t there switched on or not no matter if you re looking at the site via ssl or non-ssl

555327
gif	png
i m only concerned about jpg gif and png

555330
put	get
logan suggests to use -fno-implicit-templates and put somewhere presumably into a separate .cpp file that gets compiled with -fno-implicit-templates but i still get linker errors

555353
globalization	localization
i m working with an asp.net app with localization and globalization

555361
libjpeg	libpng
libpng and libjpeg offer pretty low-level access to png and jpeg files respectively

555391
post	get
i post that to service and used htmlencode then i get a result

555461
agile	metrics
it s a metrics and one of the key things i tell teams with any form of agile is that metrics should be captured for clear purposes that the team agrees with

555494
vim	emacs
engage in hackery like having the program check for the lockfiles that vim or emacs create

555535
gridview	formview
using this method you can still use dynamic data formview gridview validation etc

555595
post	get
i don t mind if it s a post or a get

555595
post	get
but i ve heard that these days browsers don t allow cross-site calls with either post or get

555660
gridview	objectdatasource
normally if i m linking an objectdatasource to a gridview and i have a templatecolumn that has an eval in it and it s null i can just put a .tostring it works fine

555660
gridview	objectdatasource
i tied it to the gridview with an objectdatasource

555670
post	get
there s no way to do a post in this manner the src url must be a get so you can pass arguments that way

555718
internationalization	localization
i feel localization can go without internationalization but.

555718
internationalization	localization
internationalization with localization should not be done.

555776
folder	directory
this should work recursively inside the sub folder of the selected directory

555781
getter	setter
designing functionally you are never going to need getter setter is just as bad as premature optimisation

555900
testdriven.net	coderush
also integrates with a code-generation tool called coderush and i ve seen them both used very effectively together with testdriven.net check out the summer of nhibernate screencasts

555904
getter	setter
you should store the state of your wizard in the wizardmodel and add getter and setter like a javabean appropriately

555971
codeigniter	kohana
codeigniter kohana and my own mvc framework

555998
boost	stl
you may use boost stl whatever to learn these

556019
mouse	keyboard
i will respons to both keyboard and mouse

556089
integer	fractions
if you want integer rounding for positive floating point values so that values with a fractions component below 0.5 round to the next lowest integer and values with a fractions component of 0.5 or greater round to the next higher integer

556109
free	malloc
it was designed in the sense there was a definite easy to comprehend architecture - malloc a struct send the main loop a user message with the pointer to the struct as the lparam and then free it when the message is processed

556131
serializable	deserialization
however if you need some flexibility in the serializable deserialization logic and not get tightly coupled with datacontracts then option 2 looks good

556139
children	parent
now the parent has a reference to you via the handler as well as in its children controls collection

556145
backslash	double-quotes
putting a in front of a string enables you to use special characters such as a backslash or double-quotes without having to use special codes or escape characters

556193
mp3	wav
first convert to wav trim off the samples you don t want and then convert back to mp3

556274
serializable	deserialization
support will be a nightmare imagine adding a single column to the resultset which will lead to an avalanche of modifications in both serializable and deserialization code

556279
try-catch	exception-handling
when exception-handling are used sparingly you don t need to turn your code into a try-catch -spaghetti in order to avoid receiving incomprehensible-in-the-context exception-handling from the deeper layers

556288
button	checkbox
in my forms i want to make html labels bold in general but not bold when they are labelling radio button and checkbox

556346
post	get
get and post imply different actions though

556353
versioning	upgrade
maybe in the options there could be an option for prompting when a new versioning comes available but the default should be to just upgrade it silently without telling the user unless it is a major upgrade which is not fully backwards compatible or might break some other stuff

556390
sum	coalesce
prior to the introduction of annotations you might have used extra to do something like this which i think should return 0 in cases where there are no votes if it doesn t for any particular database implementation you can at least directly insert the necessary coalesce function call - coalesce sum value 0 - using this method

556390
sum	coalesce
this looks rather ugly as you need to monkeypatch the new aggregate into django.db.models.sql.aggregates due to the way the sql aggregate classes are looked up but all we ve done here is added a new aggregate which subclasses sum hardcoding a call to the coalesce function and adding a placeholder for the default value which you must supply as a keyword argument in this very basic example implementation at least

556456
lisp	scheme
it obviously is possible to write almost any kind of application in almost any programming language especially in such a powerful one as lisp be it scheme or common lisp

556478
pop-up	dialog
a while back i read before i lost it a great book called gui bloopers which was full of examples of bad gui design but also full of useful tidbits like don t call something a dialog one minute and a pop-up the next

556526
getter	setter
with the given resultset extracting the metadata i want to build a class file dynamically with getter and setter methods for all the columns that exist in resultset

556549
implements	extends
your other code will not be able to call any methods on this class because it did not exist when they were compiled and consequently the only way to actually use this generated class would be either via reflection or via methods on its parent class or implements interfaces i m going to assume it would extends resultset

556643
getter	setter
often you do need getter and setter perhaps but when i write a getter i always ask myself whether that data should be exposed or whether the object should hide it completely for me

556660
inline	inlining
declaring the method within the class declaration makes the function inline which is a hint for the compiler to do you guessed it -- inlining

556684
vim	emacs
eclipse netbeans kdevelop vim and emacs are all good options

556692
client-side	server-side
also the feature you reference in outlook actually just keeps it in your client s outbox until the designated date so it s a client-side feature not a server-side feature

556698
children	parent
however the control needs to be able to instantiate itself when the user clicks the button of the parent control at least 1 nested children control of the same type will be displayed underneath kind of like a tree

556704
profiling	debugging
in circumstances like this i get the actual call to the sproc either from a debugging in my app or using sql profiling and then plug that into ssms or whatever ide you use wrapping it in a rollback transaction so it can t accidentally make any changes

556750
int	chars
avoid at all costs utter abominations like throwing int hresults chars std string.

556789
hide	show
having an html page with a simple table and js code to do show hide on it

556792
onkeyup	onkeydown
also if you don t use his script make sure you use one that involves either a time interval check and or the onkeydown onkeyup events of the textarea

556794
getter	setter
in theory and as long as you keep m_somevalue always equal to somevalue like a simple getter setter nothing

556794
public	protected
the proxy class will generate a public property whether you use a public protected internal private field or property

556810
addclass	removeclass
or you can use addclass and removeclass if that s more appropriate

556844
int	chars
you can print out chars using the chr int function if you know the chars code

556859
hide	show
jquery offers browser independent hide show and toggle methods

557004
put	get
hence you can get a free blog and just put in the bits you want to share that way you would also have a steady online reference whenever you need it

557038
mouse	keyboard
and then i must make sure to block away keyboard mouse and focus messages so the underlying edit control doesn t mess with me

557139
mouseover	mouseenter
this is different behavior than that of the mouseover event which is dispatched each time the mouseenter the area of any child object of the display object container even if the mouse was already over another child object of the display object container

557143
put	get
i think most of the work to get a smooth result in such a case which of course does happen needs to be put in beforehand in having a good automatic test suite

557226
xsl-fo	xslt
in past i ve always gone for xml xslt xsl-fo using apache fop with perl being used to create the initial xml data

557232
jlist	jtree	jlist	jtable	jtree	jtable
to address your issue with jtree which i agree with you should look into using glazed lists if you want nice jlist and jtable interaction in your app

557333
waitpid	fork
after fork ing and running the test.sh script the bin sh shell which was the child of the perl system call exits and so you get a -1 return value from waitpid

557462
plone	buildout
i am using buildout to automatically download and setup the many dependencies of my plone installation

557524
post	get
this will work for both get and post but you can modify accordingly if you only need one or the other

557538
stdout	stderr
the use of simple print statements to write stuff to the log doesn t work wonderfully consistently for all django implementations mod_python for example loses all the stdout and stderr stuff.

557544
for-loop	arrays
and run a for-loop over the arrays boxes or use the foreach member function

557595
observer-pattern	memento
a combination of the memento pattern with observer-pattern should fit your needs

557598
rss	feed
i use simple html dom to scrape a page for the latest news and then generate an rss feed using this php class

557695
textarea	textbox
for instance i d like to use it with jquery validate so i can restrict a textbox textarea to have say 250 words

557719
public	protected	folder	directory	folder	dir
you can t get to a public folder inside a private folder in general and if you can t add new directory outside the web root your cache dir will have to be protected another way

557720
accessor	properties
new languages or even a future version of the c# compiler might decorate the properties accessor in a different way then _get and _set

557720
accessor	properties
you should really just implement your properties bag accessor to take a parameter to identify the properties - either a string name like hastable or an object like the wpf dependency properties bag

557721
width	height
one thing you will need to do to make it look right is to have a fixed width and height of cyclecontent with overflow hidden

557721
width	height
the css i m using is this note the width and height are the sizes of my test images

557753
folder	directory
from what you posted i think you are trying to expose a working copy instead of a repository the .svn folder is typical of a working copy and i bet the e dev.svn is a checkout directory

557755
cpu	processors
in addition to that this design will make maximum use of multiple processors or cores at the cost of slightly more memory consumption and more cpu cycles spent

557811
dsn	paradox
first of all when i m registering the odbc as a user or system dsn the microsoft paradox odbc driver only display versions up to 5.x so it looks like that it does not support paradox version 7.x

557825
client-side	server-side
this is not possible because you re mixing client-side behavior with server-side behavior

557838
xslt	xquery
that helps a lot since you can use a lot of tools originally designed for xml such as xml parsers xslt xpath xquery .

557882
mxmlc	compc
the compc task is using locale en_us and the mxmlc task is using locale en_us

557891
getter	setter
i then have getter and setter on my class that return accept only dates

557909
pow	floor
however using something like pow floor log seems a bit much for a simple problem like this

557948
nhibernate	massive
in my experience nhibernate now is relatively easy to use with the fluent interface entity framework is a legitimate contender and microorms such as dapper and massive are becoming quite popular

557973
firefox	safari
target users are users with ie firefox and safari browsers

557996
observer-pattern	command-pattern
the gui will keep watch on the game engine by using observer-pattern and interact with this by using one of several command object created using command-pattern

558009
getc	gets
i m looking for a way to do getc or gets or whatever that does not echo to the terminal

558011
rss	feed
i m looking into writing a proxy aggregator for feed where a handful of users specify a feed url and some set of conditions and the system outputs a continually-updated rss atom feed of entries that match those conditions

558042
stateless	stateful
the blog post author says that the true strength of asp.net was the controls i would argue that the strength was the event driven model and the presentation of a stateful environment overtop a nearly stateless environment

558075
udp	tcp
you ll want to choose a protocol udp or tcp

558115
int	chars
with regards to strings datalength returns the number of bytes and len returns an int value for the number of chars

558134
nginx	lighttpd
before that it was nginx but i came back to lighttpd because i needed cgi

558143
rar	zip
it supports almost any office office-like file format even dwg msg pdf and files in zip rar archives

558159
nginx	lighttpd
in my experience lighttpd and nginx are easy enough to configure and you can use fcgi bindings for most programming languages

558186
comparator	icomparer
icomparer or the comparator methods it relies upon did not return zero when array.sort called x

558227
g++	gcc
i am using gcc gcc g++

558243
width	height
html width 229 height 300

558274
stdout	stderr
the problem is that normal output like compiler command lines go to stdout and compile errors go to stderr

558275
min	max
not sure how to control where the fill goes i.e the graph min or max rather than to the x-axis

558284
int	double
you should really look into using some int type for these values that supports equality comparison rather than trying to use double

558302
stdout	stderr
this should work better for you because it is not redirecting stderr and stdout separately but redirecting stderr to stdout which should make the buffering sync up

558304
ienumerable	ienumerator
what s the difference between ienumerable and ienumerator

558308
vb.net	vb6
background i m rewriting a vb6 app that used ms access for data storage to one that uses vb.net and ms sql server

558309
ienumerable	ienumerator
implementing ienumerable enables you to get an ienumerator for a list

558321
ienumerable	ienumerator
implementing ienumerable means your class returns an ienumerator object

558331
ienumerable	ienumerator
most of the time ienumerable ienumerator are used transparently as part of a foreach loop

558332
ienumerable	ienumerator
thus when your class implements ienumerable you are saying that you can call a method getenumerator and get a new object returned an ienumerator you can use in a loop such as foreach

558427
onmousemove	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmousemove	onclick	onmouseup	onclick	onmousedown
then you can easily implement selection override onclick dragging and resizing onmousedown onmousemove onmouseup

558469
cpu	affinity
i have a pthread_t and i d like to change its cpu affinity

558469
cpu	affinity
i need to be able to set the cpu affinity of an arbitrary thread

558497
super	extends
because composite itself doesn t need to be initialized with a constructor no need to call super my constructors of widgets extends composite look something like

558582
hash	md5
also instead of using registration_confirmation_code you might want to consider using a md5 hash or the like of the users email address

558593
pop-up	dialog
if you want to pop-up a potentially long list i would suggest creating your own dialog

558650
hide	show
assuming you have the different tabs working showing already you can just loop through all elements the blocks with the form fields you show and hide as requested when the user clicks all and show them all

558652
ready	each
position all the div elements relative to each other on the all page in the ready method and set each div as visible

558760
min	max
here s the specific section on min max k values in a list

558772
redmine	trac
for something completely different the best way to do agile development with trac may be to simply migrate everything to redmine

558798
put	get
take the time and get the schema right and put some thought into data quality in the design of your application

558815
affinity	processors
other than accessing internal data structures of the threading library which you understandably do not want although with your assumptions about processors affinity and linux thread ids your code will not be portable anyway you may be able to play a trick at creation time if you control the code that creates the threads

558815
cpu	affinity
whether this trick is worth it depends on how important setting the cpu affinity is in your case versus not accessing internal structures of the thread library or depending on a thread library that provides pthread_setaffinity_np

558828
client-side	server-side
i have found it most convenient to maintain the client-side and server-side code in separate solutions

558837
width	height
i ve had all sorts of trouble with measuring the width and height of textfields before

558839
int	boolean
subclasses for specific int boolean might also be needed

558958
mouse	keyboard
i believe click will be triggered for both keyboard and mouse

558985
put	get
your code works when i follow this procedure but if i put it in the code module attached to thisworkbook i get the #name result you report

559025
int	chars
native data types chars int and floats

559102
pop-up	dialog
also you can experiment with css visibility by setting display none and undoing that just before you pop-up the dialog

559104
folder	directory
you can generally tell by looking at iis manager whether or not your directory is a virtual directory as it will not look like a yellow folder

559104
folder	directory
if it does look like the typical yellow folder right click the parent default web site or whatever and choose new virtual directory

559107
getter	setter
getter and setter are usually inlined replaced directly in the machine code instead of a call to a subroutine and constants are folded

559139
osql	bcp
if these still don t suit your needs you ll need to use another tool such as bcp or sqlcmd osql

559157
cvs	svn
we are still mostly on cvs but newer projects are in svn

559157
cvs	svn
i know that the resulting file is the same in cvs and svn for example a visual studio project file has two different versions

559161
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
this is about the domcontentloaded mozilla opera and webkit nightlies currently support this and the onreadystatechange for ie events which can be applied to the document object to understand when the document is available to be manipulated without waiting for all the images stylesheets etc

559168
mouse	keyboard
at the moment i m using a custom nsview inside a scroll view that quartz draws each node the arcs etc at each render and processes mouse and keyboard input by hand including hit testing movement and so forth

559183
gridview	repeater	listview	gridview
eval is mainly intended for use in expressions within controls such as repeater gridview listview etc where there is a list of data items being bound using templates and you need a method to be able to access the properties of the current data item

559225
cvsnt	svn
just a wild guess here but if you re using cvsnt on the server this observation might be based on the fact that cvsnt simply is much better at merging than svn because it has the notion of mergepoints

559287
vim	emacs
note that emacs vim etc can work as ides - i m not talking about forcing you the world of guis if you want to stay in a text-only situation because you re sshing in

559289
int	chars
alternatively the staff.role column s data type line 40 role int not null could be changed to chars 30 not null

559290
firefox	safari
for example to use it in firefox you would use the property -moz-border-radius for safari use -webkit-border-radius etc

559306
hash	md5
keep in mind that md5 hashing has been cracked by brute force attacks so having a hash password in the open is not 100 secure but for most cases it may be a non issue especially if you use some stronger hashing algorithm

559323
hash	salt
to defeat this attack you need to salt the hash

559323
hash	salt
this salt can be stored unencrypted next to the hash

559335
firefox	safari
firefox handles it fine but safari and ie7 silently fail and do not insert the element

559340
floating-point	integer
in ocaml you can t even mix integer and floating-point math or use the same operators + is for adding integers +

559340
haskell	sml	haskell	scheme	sml	scheme	lisp	sml	lisp	scheme
haskell is an exception ghc executables are almost as small as c programs both at compile-time and runtime but sml common lisp and scheme programs always require tons of memory

559450
range	max
if the angle is within some threshold of the current heading and within the max view range then it can see it

559451
g++	gcc
i usually run in nix so i usually use gcc and g++ as well

559480
getter	setter
limit permissions on getter setter method of each ejb

559531
ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest
the ftp protocol can be accessed through the ftpwebrequest and ftpwebresponse classes in the system.net namespace and was introduced in .net 2.0

559544
move	drag
one thing i like about resharper is that you can use ctrl-shift-alt-up or down to move a method field property etc up or down in the file directly above or below the method field property adjacent to it or you can use the file structure browser to both view and rearrange the structure of your file through drag and drop

559550
ienumerable	icollection
see the icollection ienumerable etc

559578
stdout	stderr
stdout and stderr output can be interleaved on the

559578
stdout	stderr
how do i log stdout and stderr

559595
subclass	abstract-class
something you might consider depending on the rest of your design is a factory where your abstract-class has a static method or multiple static methods depending on how you implement it that constructs the appropriate subclass and returns it as an iconverter

559595
super	abstract
with this you can expose only the abstract definition in the header file and have all the concrete class definitions and implementations in a single .cpp file along with the super class implementation

559676
stdout	stderr
your already defining the stdout stderr of the processes your executuing by the stdout stderr methods

559713
post	get
really i wanted the tooltip to show immediately so i used the mouseenter event instead. i can post my exact code tomorrow when i get to work

559722
inject	interceptor
but for certain events in the engine you can attach interceptor aka aspects the events being the point-cuts etc -- i use this to inject using ioc business entities into my domain objects

559729
put	get
you could even put the code to get the connection string into getconnection unless you need the flexibility of opening multiple connections with different connection strings

559775
yacc	bison
lex and yacc or their gnu equivaents flex and bison do their work at compile time and may not be flexible enough for your needs

559808
daemons	systemd
in other words if my daemons exits normally and closes dev watchdog the systemd would still re-boot 59 seconds later

559808
daemons	systemd
if the setting is on my daemons would need to preferably start an orderly shutdown on exit or at least warn the user that the systemd is going to reboot shortly

559831
serializable	deserialization
the advantage of this setup the blazeds proxy server will take care of all the serializable deserialization of the amf request and response

559856
put	get
this implementation provides constant-time performance for the basic operations get and put assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly among the buckets

559856
put	get
this implementation provides guaranteed log n time cost for the containskey get put and remove operations

559906
getter	setter
examples are getter setter and or things that a compiler interpreter will catch immediately

559927
fadein	fadeout
you could consider implementing and learning jquery which has a few plugins to fade things as well as built in functions such as fadein fadeout etc

559937
trac	bugzilla
i would suggest something more modern than bugzilla such as trac or lighthouse although bugzilla may fit your bill

559937
trac	bugzilla
there are lots of vendors that do trac bugzilla other bug tracker hosting

560016
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
viewwillappear viewdidappear of view 1

560068
min	max
picking min max and 20 random points could be some starter

560097
put	get
thanks to the clarifications from brian and alan haggai alavi it seems that enough love is being put in archive zip to get these bugs out soon and finally have a fully functioning zip module in windows

560113
agile	sprint
you ll have to plan out your sprint ahead because the central planners will probably want an all-up feature list early and won t stand for the more laid back agile approach

560114
accessor	properties
and lastly the properties makes refactoring easier for example when the value later is no longer stored in a variable but is calculated inside the properties accessor or comes from some other source variable

560155
valgrind	memcheck
i have also tried running the program through valgrind memcheck tool but not getting anything significant about the above piece of code

560176
int	chars
byte short int long chars

560189
disk	ram
if you re worried about the overhead of constantly load and unloading the executable into process space i suggest you set up a ram disk and time your app from there

560246
cifs	smb
if the underlying disk is fat ntfs or cifs smb you must also make sure you use the latest version of the appropriate driver

560268
ant	maven
i want to make this process work from the cmd line using ant note i know maven is out there but i know ant pretty well from past experience so would prefer sticking to it for now

560304
cvs	svn
while i m primarely a mercurial user git is also supported as are darcs svn and cvs

560314
google-chrome	safari
i ve a style sheet object to manipulate but in google-chrome and safari

560339
google-chrome	firefox
it works just fine in firefox and google-chrome but image won t show up in ie .

560361
put	get
one way to get around this is by pasting with put instead of just p like this yat put

560397
away3d	papervision3d
afaik away3d is a fork of papervision3d

560413
spaces	delimiter
i have the following vb.net code to take the values out of a textbox on a webpage actually spaces delimiter tags and split them with a spaces delimiter into an array

560474
mouse	keyboard
using intentionally triggered mouse keyboard events to create pseudo worker threads as in this example

560492
int	double
you d only have to create a handful of custom types to wrap string double date int etc

560504
google-chrome	safari
i only tested in safari 3.2 and the webkit nightlies google-chrome just uses the webkit from safari 3.1 but i don t believe there s any engine changes between 3.1 and 3.2

560549
getter	setter
keep in mind the only place i want people mucking around with the backing field bar is in setter and getter of the property

560554
versioning	upgrade
and i havent had any need to convert any of my programs to another language in my 20 years as programmer only upgrade from different versioning of same language

560566
folder	directory
when you set up the three projects to work this way you will find that you are compiling each project to it s correspondent bin folder and to a combined target directory

560657
freemarker	velocity
velocity or freemarker might be a better option

560679
postgresql	mysql
a free database like mysql or postgresql

560679
postgresql	mysql
should i use mysql postgresql or something else which ideally is free as we have a limited budget

560694
spaces	delimiter
i want to add a text field to a web page that lets users add spaces delimiter tags

560828
ssl	https
if the uri begins with https ssl is used

560832
cvs	svn
if you need bi-directional sync both uploading and downloading changes then you ll need to go with either a remote filesystem-based solution or better imo a proper revision control system such as git svn or cvs

560862
.htaccess	httpd.conf
solution add the execcgi option to that directory via either httpd.conf or a .htaccess

561079
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
memory allocation every pointer new ed should be deleted malloc free should not be mixed with new delete when to use delete instead of delete why the c functions are still useful expand realloc

561188
jboss	weblogic
the java application is a standalone application not deployed on any java ee application server like oracleas weblogic jboss etc

561272
comparator	icomparer
this can work where icomparer comparator cannot because it operates on an entire collection instead of individual items

561272
comparator	icomparer
then i could implement a shuffle from the iarranger interface using a proper fisher-yates algorithm and also have implementations that wrap each additional ienumerable.sort comparator icomparer varieties that i care about

561297
qt-designer	pyqt
i would suggest using pyqt and the qt-designer wysiwyg gui designer for making cross platform gui apps

561346
fadein	fadeout
my problem is that the fadein for the second div fires at the same time with the fadeout for the first div

561463
udp	tcp
you should read up on tcp udp ip programming

561464
getter	setter
in general class data members shouldn t be directly visible either by being public or by having getter and setter

561486
int	chars
since base64 uses is a 64 chars encoding it should be possible to represent an int in base64 using even less chars than hexadecimal

561498
min	max
to find the min or max value for a specific indexed column

561643
int	double
seriously though if i is a native data type such as int double etc -- no difference

561698
ienumerable	iqueryable
update made the code generic and to use iqueryable instead of ienumerable

561729
inherited	subclassing
now i have a subclassing d that inherited of b and c

561790
getter	setter
my prefered solution is to add a getter setter method on the ampibianvehicle class to change the surface member enumeration

561819
post	get
for those interested this code parses get and post parameters and stores them in the global associative array query_parameters

561861
bazaar	git
i you want to stay up to date you still can play with git mercurial bazaar at home

561874
versioning	upgrade
i think the url form you are looking for is at least that is what works in 1.3 and 1.4 i will point out 1.4.3 should be out soon and with all of the bug fixes and added functionality 1.4.3 would be a good upgrade target if you are thinking of going that way then you could get everything back on the same versioning

561893
width	margin
edit if you give .col-middle a left margin thereâ s no need to float it or to give it a width

561901
activemq	rabbitmq
these days i ve moved away from stomp activemq towards amqp + rabbitmq using the txamqp and py-amqplib libraries

562018
awt	swing
4 graphviz would be nice but the grappa java library is quite outdated and is built upon swing awt

562065
folder	directory
go to the cc.net installation directory and delete the webdashboard folder

562074
migrate	upgrade
i would say if you are able to migrate anyway you might as well upgrade to increase the longevity of your code base

562167
codeigniter	kohana	symfony	kohana
thankfully the language is going in a good direction oop and we are getting a share of quality frameworks cake symfony codeigniter kohana and so on and the tools are getting more serious

562168
128bit	64bit
if fixed-width 32-bit integers are used then it is requires only two fixed-width numbers for 32-bit one 64bit number and one 128bit number

562227
globalization	localization
i ve found tons of information on localization globalization how these files work and lots of ways to manipulate them but nothing on preventing them building in the first place

562273
post	get
because of this i m humbly asking that anyone able to help me run the following on their computer and post back the results so that i can get an idea of what s out there

562273
directsound	mixer
mixer direct audio device directsound playback primary sound driver

562273
directsound	mixer
mixer direct audio device directsound playback soundmax hd audio

562273

mixer direct audio device directsound capture primary sound capture driver

562273
directsound	mixer
mixer direct audio device directsound capture soundmax hd audio

562283
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome not so great in ie7

562293
yacc	bison
input files for bison should follow the yacc convention and be named foo.y

562323
integer	unsigned
integer keys to unsigned integer

562323
integer	unsigned
object keys to unsigned integer

562358
rss	feed
i use monotorrent to run a private 100-node data network an rss feed to announce what files need to be where modified version of wordpress and doing everything in ssh tunnels

562361
int	chars
create or replace function my_function mychar in chars return int as

562380
solaris	aix
we support all the major operating systems out there commercially aix hp-ux linux os x solaris windows even the as 400 mainframe

562485
width	height
tells if the layout handles height for width calculation

562490
cpython	ironpython
ironpython 2.0 is cpython 2.5 compatible so pure python that uses 2.5 apis should work fine under ironpython

562495
pascal	delphi
a delphi pascal parser can be used to validate the input

562512
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
add to the confusion that firefox google-chrome safari don t ask twice - only ie 6 and 7

562524
google-chrome	firefox
i tried opening the page in firefox ie and google-chrome but nowhere do i see the proper font

children	parent
heaps a tree where the parent of a node always maintains some relation to the children of the node for instance the parent of a node is always greater than each of it s children max-heap

562552
skip-lists	tree
a skip-lists is a probabilistic data structure based on multiple parallel sorted linked lists with efficiency comparable to a binary search tree order log n average time for most operations

562554
folder	directory
if it matters the folder structure of the global server is a subset of the dev server it s just a few select files directory but all have the same relative paths etc

562559
getter	setter
in my form class i getter setter methods for the properties like the ones below

562587
vsto	add-in
before vsto office add-in had to implement this idtextensibility2 interface themselves

562587
vsto	add-in
hence if you added a udf to your vsto add-in it won t be visible to office

562657
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this works beautifully in firefox safari opera and google-chrome but - of course - not in ie

562700
groovy	gpath
so far i am quite impressed how quickly i can hack up something usable and groovy s features especially gpath expressions play a big part in that

562759
put	get
i get intellisense in both the master page and in content pages tried it with the code you put in your question

562787
implements	extends
if so you could extends them in a different file and extract an interface and let it be implements by all address classes

562810
accessor	properties
just so people know accessorizer does more than just generate accessor both 1.0 and properties for 2.0 it also generates core data code for persisting non-standard attributes your nsset accessor for custom to-many relationships

562853
subtract	add
updating vote_values on a vote record should also update total_vote_values with the difference subtract old value add new value

562907
vb.net	vb6
don t forget how negative numbers are expressed in binary and that vb6 and vb.net interpret numbers like h8300 differently

562907
post	get
as mentioned in the other post you can get around this by explicitly marking values as longs

562978
pop-up	dialog
no idea but we pop-up a separate error dialog displaying the issue rather than updating an existing label

562986
inherited	properties
i have another class that inherited from foo that adds a properties for a value

562990
boost	stl
.net library support is way better and cleaner than stl mfc and boost

563063
linqdatasource	objectdatasource	gridview	linqdatasource	gridview	objectdatasource
i don t just use the linqdatasource because i usually have to run some other subroutines whenever i do my normal crud stuff i know this is pretty standard so i use the objectdatasource controls to populate my gridview

563130
hide	show
if you are simply changing the visibility of the panels and not retrieving new data via an ajax call you didn t specify remove the updatepanel replace the panel controls with standard divs not running at server and just use javascript to hide and show the divs

563171
codeigniter	kohana
you ll get up to speed with codeigniter or kohana quickly

563229
int	double
this might be confusing because most of the c++ primitive types do have default constructors that init them to zero int bool double long etc

563235
udp	tcp
it will be making tcp connections sending udp datagrams and listening for udp broadcasts

563235
ubuntu	linux
i m running on ubuntu 8.04 w linux kernel 2.6.26

563259
clang	llvm
have a look at the llvm clang static analyzer

563259
clang	llvm
the llvm clang static analyzer is a standalone tool that find bugs in c and objective-c programs and it is very early in development

563259
clang	llvm
the goal of the clang project is to create a new c c++ objective c and objective c++ front-end for the llvm compiler

563276
rss	feed
it ll read rss feed and pop up notifications that will automatically go away if you don t read them for you

563319
inherited	subclassing
there is nsmutablearray and since that s a subclassing of nsarray it inherited makeobjectsperformselector

563458
post	get
which will rewrite only get requests leaving post requests as they are

563472
lisp	scheme
you don t just have to pick between common lisp and scheme

563472
lisp	scheme
you have to pick between several incompatible implementations of common lisp and several incompatible implementations of scheme as well as other little things like arc and clojure

563472
lisp	scheme
it s popular it s actively developed it has many libraries offering the features of a modern programming environment and scheme is somewhat simpler not to say better just simpler than common lisp

563483
ironruby	ironpython
the issue is i d like to try creating one from ironruby or ironpython which to my knowledge don t support attributes

563552
16-bit	64bit
on a side note the original declaration of activatekeyboardlayout is wrong as it had a return type of integer which is a 16-bit value while the api returns a type of hkl which is 32 or 64bit depending on the platform

563678
rss	feed
ideally you would look for an rss feed to get the raw content

563678
post	get
also get to know the standard element names used by common cms platforms like wordpress post or drupal node

563680
ironruby	ironpython
you also might consider a dynamic language like ironruby or ironpython

563683
put	get
my best advice is just to get a very good spam filter if you re going to put your address on the web

563716
hex	binary
i didn t get the same binary data that was in the table i created but i haven t bothered going into a hex editor to see what was different

563721
post	get
i remember seeing a login handler that took a post request and redirected to a get with the user name and password passed in as parameters

563828
codeigniter	kohana
there are libraries to accomplish this in the php frameworks codeigniter modular extensions and kohana dispatch and component

563869
post	get
the easy workaround is to change your form to do get instead of post

563976
implements	extends
it makes it easier to change what the class extends without having to figure out what interfaces it should implements

563988
folder	directory
as the number of files gets large the problem is easy to solve from the point of view of the filesystem store the files into relative path directory so you can keep the number of file per directory under control for instance creating a weekly folder or creating a new folder when the file count is over a certain limit

564022
public	protected
the only reason i know of is to widen the visibility of a method clone from protected to public but that does not seem to be the case here

564076
jlist	jtable
aside from debugging overriding the tostring method of a class can be useful when ading objects into a jlist or a jtable which by default will use the tostring method to display the object as a textual form in the list or table

564105
passenger	thin
if all that seems like a bit much to keep nginx and thin playing nicely you may want to look into an all in one solution like passenger or litespeed

564144
mouse	keyboard
alex harui provides a good example with source here it s a bit of a lengthy solution but covers mouse and keyboard interaction with the datagrid

564220
button	checkbox
reset checkbox in datalist on click of button that is outside of datalist using c#

564268
put	get
i would expect that you would want to put everything on the table and get a full commitment from the customer before performing the work

564280
hash	md5
the registration key is then generated by calculating an md5 hash of the supplied name combined with a secred code some random bytes in an array

564282
button	checkbox	onclientclick	datalist
in the eventhandler for the button onclientclick event you d loop trough each item in the datalist and find the checkbox and reset it

564363
unix	solaris
for this purpose i m using io.popen and it works as expected in windows but on unix solaris reading from io.popen blocks so the script just waits there until something comes along instead of returning immediately.

564390
versioning	upgrade
ever so often they would release a patch for free and a new versioning that would require an upgrade fee

564392
int	chars
if you have an array of java objects which have a primitive type for example byte int chars etc

564414
subclass	abstract-class
it s an abstract-class of which you d need to create your own custom subclass that knows how to describe its own presentation via the defininggeometry property

564460
urllib	httplib
looking at the code it seems that this will not work due to httplib and urllib limitations in appengine environment but maybe somebody has patched cloudfiles

564498
inherited	subclassing
object-oriented class hierarchies with virtual method dispatch are good when you have a relatively fixed set of methods that need to be implemented but many potential subclassing that might inherited from the root of the hierarchy and implement those methods

564508
swt	swing
can generate guis for both swing and swt

564591
haskell	scheme
program your logic not the ui in functional programming language such as f# or even using scheme or haskell

564629
haskell	ocaml
if you want to write multithreaded number crunching code and you are going to be doing a lot of it in the future i would suggest you take a look at using a functional language like ocaml or haskell

564658
versioning	upgrade
hitting this silverlight page on microsoft.com tells me my versioning rtw is now out of date and i should upgrade to gdr 1

564668
profiler	shark
try optimizing it using a profiler shark for example and make your object-creation method less time consuming

564698
ironruby	ironpython
to be fair either powershell or any dlr based language such as ironpython or ironruby would suit the task and would be less overhead than looking after trivial console applications

564747
lisp	scheme
i think you either want common lisp or plt scheme

564771
getter	setter
if you need to change any of these variables then you can define some getter and setter

564813
getter	setter
that s not the case if you pass a property by reference in vb.net the property getter is invoked once and then the property setter is invoked once

564838
hash	salt
if you do want to redirect then you could create a tamperproof url by including a hash of the error number with a salt known only to your code

564959
postgresql	mysql
in mysql and postgresql

564966
urllib	httplib
previously you d have had to write your own library to do so using app engine s urlfetch api but with the release of sdk 1.1.9 you can now use urllib and httplib instead

564968
akismet	recaptcha
focus on analyzing the message content with akismet or using a proven accessible captcha solution like recaptcha

564970
button	checkbox
i have datalist containing radio button and checkbox

564970
button	checkbox
when i come to previous page the radio button and checkbox in datalist must be selected

565002
submit	submission
though i have had a few odd issues with submission forms with javascript before so if that doesn t work you could try calling click or the equivalent of fireevent click on your form s submit button like so

565014
stdout	fflush
that is because when you use standard stream stdin stdout interactively from cmdline they are in a line-buffered mode in short system fflush on each new line but when you call it from within your program streams are in a fully buffered mode doesn t output till system buffer is full

565041
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy
the language python itself has no such restrictions but perhaps your operating system or your python runtime pypy cpython jython could have such restrictions

565056
postgresql	mysql
i want my application to be compatible at least with oracle and mysql or postgresql

565080
width	height
using float left a fixed width height with a clear both on some images will do the trick

565085
win64	windows
for example on win64 you ll be able to run the 32bit build of python.exe but it won t get the benefits of the 64 bit environment as windows will run it in a 32bit sandbox

565095
getter	setter
after taking a quick look at my code the majority of it was getter and setter 60 compared to the rest that is truly needed for the logic of the game

565095
getter	setter
a couple of google searches have claimed that getter and setter are evil whilst others have claimed that they are necessary for good oo practice and great programs

565117
getter	setter
somewhat evil getter and setter where they re not required

565117
getter	setter
good getter and setter only where they re really required - make the type expose larger behaviour which happens to use its state rather than just treating the type as a repository of state to be manipulated by other types

565121
getter	setter
my opinion is that getter and setter are a requirement for good programs

565121
getter	setter
stick with them but don t write unnecessary getter setter - it s not always necessary to directly deal with all variables

565155
getter	setter
if you need external access to individual values of fields use getter and or setter

565155
getter	setter
in general you should also find that you need to supply a setter much less often than a getter - especially if you are trying to make your objects immutable - which is a good thing but not always the best choice - but even if not

565158
getter	setter
there s nothing wrong with getter and setter though their verbosity in java can be a bit annoying

565158
getter	setter
edit if the main point for the getter and setter is to configure the game classe i understand your comment that way then your probably don t need the getter it s perfectly fine for a class to access its own private variables without using get methods and you can probably collapse many of the setter into group setter that set several variables which belong together conceptually

565168
rational-numbers	floating-point
gmp is a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic operating on signed integers rational-numbers and floating-point numbers

565168
solaris	bsd	solaris	aix	bsd	aix
gmp s main target platforms are unix-type systems such as gnu linux solaris hp-ux mac os x darwin bsd aix etc

565189
traceroute	packets
lots of hops in a traceroute do not indicate closeness just devices the packets routes through

565189
traceroute	lan
if you are on a lan or you get a tie with bgp then fall back to traceroute

565196
getter	setter
your question is framed in the context of java where it seems that getter and setter are generally thought of as a good thing

565196
getter	setter
thus in java it is usually best to use getter and setter religiously so that if you need to you can override access to the variables

565204
getter	setter
the presence of getter and setter tends to indicate a smell if you are into that sort of primary school language that there is a design problem

565204
getter	setter
trivial getter and setter are barely distinguishable from public fields

565204
getter	setter
in some cases getter and setter are fine

565204
getter	setter
but as a rule a type with both getter and setter indicates design problems

565212
getter	setter
just fyi in addition to all the excellent answers in this thread remember that of all reasons you can come up with for or against getter setter performance isn t one as some might believe

565212
getter	setter
the jvm is smart enough to inline trivial getter setter even non- final ones as long as they aren t actually overridden

565216
int	boolean
to fill the table i run a query that returns int a1 int a2 boolean b3 and runs multiple data checks

565222
put	get
but every time you re inclined to put in a value and expose both get .

565227
getter	setter
what i m trying to say is that discussing getter setter vs public fields often obscures bigger problems with objects manipulating each others internal state in an intimate manner and hence being too closely coupled

565245
width	height
if yes how are they linked up ie how do you retrieve width height length for a given solid

565270
getter	setter
is it on a getter or setter or is it on a field

565272
public	protected
as a minimum each identifier with public or protected access should have appropriate javadoc tags and a description

565277
expression-blend	silverlight
i get an exception error when i f5 build any silverlight project within expression-blend 2

565287
getter	setter
getter and setter are very very evil

565287
getter	setter
unfortunately the language has enshrined the use of getter and setter in the javabeans specification so java programmers are forced to use them even when doing so makes no sense whatsoever

565287
getter	setter
but if there s one thing i d get rid of in java its the over-dependence on getter and setter

565290
getter	setter
getter and setter enforce the concept of encapsulation in object-oriented programming

565290
getter	setter
the only ways the object can be manipulated are through exposed public methods such as getter and setter

565290
getter	setter
there are a few advantages for having getter and setter

565290
getter	setter
one of the big advantage of using a getter and setter is that once the public methods are defined and there comes a time when the underlying implementation needs to be changed finding a bug that needs to be fixed using a different algorithm for improving performance etc. by having the getter and setter be the only way to manipulate the object it will allow existing code to not break and work as expected even after the change

565290
getter	setter
therefore having getter and setter are one way to future-proof the class for changes which may come later

565290
getter	setter
another way getter and setter come in handy is to enforce the ways the object can be manipulated therefore the object is in control of its own state

565290
getter	setter
exposing the variables of an object will allow it to be manipulated in ways which aren t intended but only exposing certain ways getter and setter the object can be manipulated in intended ways

565290
getter	setter
i suppose having getter and setter would be more important for classes which are part of an api that is going to be used by others as it allows keeping the api intact and unchanged while allowing changes in the underlying implementation

565290
getter	setter
with all the advantages of getter and setter said if the getter is merely returning the value of the private variable and the setter is merely accepting a value and assigning it to a private variable it seems the getter and setter are just extraneous and really a waste

565290
getter	setter
if the class is going to be just for internal use by an application that is not going to be used by others using getter and setter extensively may not be as important as when writing a public api

565302
post	get
make the form action get not post

565337
hash	md5
otherwise you should use a different hash -- md5 sha etc will work correctly

565344
getter	setter
i ve been programming in java for few monts ago and i ve learned that we should use getter setter only when it s necessary for the application

565355
accessor	properties
objective-c 2.0 let s you declare properties and writes your accessor for you

565382
int	double
for very simple objects int strings floats double which are represented more or less as simple c-language types you can simply calculate the number of bytes as with john mulder s solution

565409
inject	interceptor
with this relatively simple condition to detect i think it would be fairly straightforward to inject a field interceptor on threadstatus to fire an event when the field is set to a specific target value

565455
nsstring	nsdata
i don t think nsstring is really the right type for the digest so it might be worth changing your method to return an nsdata if you can

565628
centos	linux
i have recently installed subversion onto a linux server centos and everything works great

565653
post	get
if you are using restful url s tempdata is a best practice for transfering messages from your post actions to your get actions

565653
post	put
add the message to tempdata in the post controller and put some if logic in the view and your done

565660
octal	decimal
first one printed as 83 because java takes 0123 as octal number and it prints decimal equivalent of that number

565680
udp	tcp
i m trying to change tcp udp of a virtual machine using vboxmanage setextradata

565739
public	protected
because this helper is private and only used inside one class throwing an argumentexception is not appropriate that s for the public protected interface

565752
google-chrome	safari
this problem also exists in safari and google-chrome

565779
min	max
several things that you can try in your application is to hard set the connection pooling using min pool size and max pool size in your connection string

565823
hash	md5
where alpha and beta refer to any characters within which will also be hash using probably an algorithm like md5

565824
post	get
i want to do some get and post inside my unmanaged c++ programs ideally i would like to allow for proxy server configuration or just use the ie defaults

565910
int	chars
you could loop through the input string and use the string.charcodeat function to get the int chars code for each chars

565933
disk	ram
buy as much memory as you can afford ram is alway faster than io from disk

566004
width	height
what i want is to make the table height according to the number of rows and if possible i d like the table to occupy full width also

566012
client-side	server-side
it s a server-side framework written in java with client-side sdks for java and c

566049
public	protected
in php 5 it is deprecated and you must use public private or protected instead

566050
opera	firefox
if i now move back and forward between the form and form handler using the browser buttons as some user sometime will probably do firefox and opera recalls the session variables and can populate the form handler

566078
rss	feed
the real problem here is that there are dozens of small variations in rss feed and atom feed too so supporting all possible permutations of feed available out on the internet gets very difficult to manage

566084
serializable	deserialization
with the regularexpressions off serializable deserialization times increase linearly with the amount of data being processed.

566093
perforce	cvs
i have a legacy cvs repository which shall be migrated to perforce

566097
vim	emacs
vim and emacs handle long lines pretty well and they re installed on almost every unix box

566187
unix	bsd
keep in mind that a previous winner of the obfuscated c code contest implemented a pretty good tetris game for vt100 terminals on bsd unix in fewer than 512 bytes of obfuscated c

566191
installation	upgrade
vs2003 uses http a local installation of iis for example whereas vs2005 projects use the built-in server -- most likely the upgrade project is still trying to use the local iis which doesn t exist

566245
gif	png
the images must be a format that supports transparency so png gif svg and wmf

566256
width	height
if you want to simply want to get the width and height of an element irrespective of where the dimensions are being applied from just use element.offsetwidth and element.offsetheight

566301
wav	aiff
to convert wav to aiff open the sound file in itunes

566356
background-repeat	background-position
even with the transparent png support its worth keeping in mind that transparent background images cannot be tiled repeated using background-repeat or positioned using background-position

566364
stdout	stderr
as you indirectly suggest the junit testrunners redirect stdout and stderr to a separate stream while the test is running

566364
ant	maven
the stream redirections etc are not a part of the junit framework but are implemented by ant eclipse maven idea

566398
google-chrome	firefox
a quick check verified that these do work correctly in at least google-chrome firefox and ie since this works i m assuming you can use your method to have urls like

566451
installation	upgrade
then you could use your installscript as a bootstrapper to upgrade each installation separately based on your conditions

566462
webclient	httpwebrequest
webclient is not cover my requirements so i m looking for a solution with httpwebrequest

566481
merb	ruby-on-rails
my previous experience with web development was with ruby ruby-on-rails merb

566546
inherited	properties
have both types inherited from the same type that have the common properties

566605
ceil	floor
i ve never used number.tofixed before mostly because most js libraries provide a toint method but judging by your results i would say it would be more consistent to use the math methods round floor ceil then tofixed if cross-browser consistency is what you are looking for

566731
for-loop	arrays
when the for-loop runs for the last time the variable a is set to the last element in the arrays n and it never gets touched after that

566782
strlen	substr
forth uses address length doubles -- their strlen is o 1 plus they can easily share substr

566964
matplotlib	scipy
for scipy the most commonly used plot generator is matplotlib for example

566969
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately i proved in the process that this approach will not work for firefox and doesn t appear to work in google-chrome safari either

566971
rainbowtable	salt	rainbowtable	hash	hash	salt
salt the password to prevent attacks using rainbowtable looking up the password in large table with the precomputed hash and the associated password in clear text

566973
comparator	icomparer
you need to create a custom comparator class that implements icomparer

567025
gridview	objectdatasource
i strongly suggest you check out the code project s example of using objectdatasource and gridview as this is clearly the intended way to support what you want

567051
rss	feed
i have a script that reads rss feed using fopen fgets

567068
put	get
from my understanding i need the synchronized block in addtomap to prevent another thread from calling remove or containskey before i get through the call to put but i do not need a synchronized block in dowork because another thread cannot enter the synchronized block in addtomap before remove returns because i created the map originally with collections.synchronizedmap

567103
children	parent
if you query the parent remove a child object from the parent children collection and then call savechanges ef will generate the appropriate delete sql statements for you - you do not need to track this yourself

567116
biopython	bioperl
the bio projects like bioperl biopython or bioruby would certainly like some help too

567186
put	get
see also 6 different ways to get the current identity value which has some code explaining what happens when you put triggers on the table

567346
fgets	feof
btw in case anyone wants to dig deeper according to other reports of fgets hanging it seems it has something to do with the feof or lack thereof.

567392
intersect	contains
i count nine different cases categorized in the figure below by the number of vertices of the triangle inside the circle and the number of edges of the triangle that intersect or are contains in the circle

567408
jobs	cron
on this separate box a cron job runs all outstanding jobs every 60 seconds unless jobs are still running from the last invocation

567437
width	height
if you know the width of your panels left right header and contents and the height of the header you can give the header and the content a position absolute

567490
width	height
that said if you need the height or width you should probably use element.offsetheight and element.offsetwidth

567527
disk	ram
you don t need to know if you re on a ram disk hard drive cd or network drive or if your data is compressed or encrypted -- windows takes care of these little details for you

567537
mouseover	mouseout
edit another suggestion is to disable droppable on all tds and upon mouseover of a tr enable the droppables of tds present in the specific tr and disable them back upon mouseout of tr

567542
sudo	passwd
in the python interpreter with a string i ll get the passwd prompt properly still doesnt work in a python script as in my original problem a list just gives the help screen for sudo

567556
put	get
that is in the past your application became faster when a new cpu was released and you didn t have to put any effort in your application to get that extra speed

567559
rar	zip
you could use a zip rar 7z tar.gz ... library

567569
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
eventhandle manualresetevent autoresetevent mutex semaphore - recursion not supported

567610
profiler	hprof
also try using the built in hprof profiler it can give very different results as well

567643
prerequisites	uninstaller
as a consequence any prerequisites must be installed by a separate bootstrapper by the way the installation is no longer transactional - the prerequisites won t get uninstaller if your msi installation fails

i ve been reading through apple s docs on creating provisioning profiling for distribution but i m not finding any information for simply debugging my app which is running on my device through xcode

567741
profiling	debugging
i m getting conflicting answers on whether or not i need to create an ad-hoc provisioning profiling to debugging my app

567741
profiling	debugging
this link iphone development guide preparing devices for development seems to say that you do need a development provisioning profiling for debugging on a device

567761

in your lexer as you parse the integer string you must multiplying by 10 before you add each new digit assuming you re parsing from left to right

568002
mp3	wav
for most applications and certainly for wav and mp3 encoding you should limit the number of worker threads to the number of available cpu s

568002
cpu	processors
with hard disks you might be better off not using all four processers on you quad processors cpu

568028

rbac	acl
there are plenty of flexible thoroughly-tested authorization libraries out there implementing rbac sometimes mislabeled as acl and my suggestion would be to find one that suits your needs and use it

568068
disk	ram
normally the tables are cached in ram or the data is stored close enough on the disk that reads can be combined

568102
lisp	scheme
it s all of the hard to grok things in lisp - closures macros continuations with none of clojure s java interop complexity cl s namespace confusion or scheme s name fragmentation

what actually happens is the division is done and truncated because both numbers are int and then the final result is cast to a double

568290
csv	tsv
pack the ids into for example csv tsv

568356
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
it looks as if the haskellized api for wxhaskell is still being worked on whereas the gtk2hs project doesn t mention this issue at all

568422
min	max
get max fieldname1 min fieldname2 fieldname3

568430
std	ostream
in the original example std ostream is actually a typedef for the templated class and the same situation applies when calling the templated function

568435
objectdatasource	formview
i don t understand your question but after reviewing your code i can only recommand you to consider using an objectdatasource combined with a formview and stop doing business stuff in code behind

568441

568703
ubuntu	opensuse
opensuse probably has the most up to date packages of any distro without building your own ubuntu s packaging system tends to hold your hand a little bit more though

568703
ubuntu	opensuse
both opensuse and ubuntu are well documented and have good support forums

568703
opensuse	linux
i have used a lot more than 10 linux distributions and i now stick to opensuse

the sqlcommandbuilder examines an sqldataadapter that is set up with a single query that selects from a single table

569343
post	get
i think that on top of reading one or two good books on biztalk which always helps and there are several good ones out there you could get a lot of help on the biztalk specific forums and newsgroups as well as here if you post specific questions as it s quite hard to describe an overall solution to property promotion or mapping

569360
children	parent
ii you can use struct memory alignment feature to cast children into parent

569361
boost	stl
i think a beginner is better off understanding how the basics work before moving up the food chain using higher level tool libs like boost or even stl

569402
post	get
i don t want to lose or corrupt any get or post data that is sent in the domain.com request

569408

boost	stl
i know i m not ready for boost i m not really ready for the stl either so in most cases i steer myself away from that type of suggestion

569500

trac	bugzilla
for full disclosure there are other tools than jira like bugzilla trac ibm rational jazz etc

569854
floating-point	fixed-point	floating-point	integer
be aware that this fpu mode rounding is applied to floating-point operations in situations that might not be obvious when thinking in terms of the currency type which is a fixed-point type scaled 64-bit integer

569886
folder	directory
only the main web application folder will have the installation dialog so if you want to customize the virtual directory names then you will need to add a screen and set the property of the web custom folder to be the same as the field name on the screen you add

570034
sharepoint	spsite
the internal sharepoint account is used when you construct your sp objects like spsite

570069
post	get
use the post redirect get prg pattern

570069
post	get
to avoid this problem many web applications use the prg pattern â instead of returning an html page directly the post operation returns a redirection command using the http 303 response code sometimes 302 together with the http location response header instructing the browser to load a different page using an http get request

570083
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
the alternatives include returning it as an ilist icollection or ienumerable for more flexibility or a whole different way as the code below.

570089
ienumerable	ilist
ienumerable ienumerable t unless you specifically need a list then you should return ilist t

innodb	myisam
innodb does not have full text myisam has no tx support

570166
postgresql	mysql
i ve dabbled with mysql and personally i find it vastly inferior to better rdbmss like postgresql

570166
postgresql	mysql
i m getting increasingly frustrated by these apps that i want to use but they only work with mysql and i won t bring myself to use it because personally i find postgresql a much better database and because i personally feel that your database should enforce it s own constraints instead of doing this only at the code level

570168
put	get
edit darnit richard s approach use put from the backing array of bbuf_src won t work if bbuf_src is a readonly buffer as you can t get access to that array

570175
yacc	bison
consider using yacc antlr flex bison coco r gold parser generator etc

570223
postgresql	mysql
i also greatly prefer postgresql but i think if you re planning to use other peoples php applications forums blogs etc it s just a reality that you re probably going to have to run mysql to support them

570226
postgresql	mysql
the thing is that the web apps didn t really need full power of rdbms so mysql gained huge popularity while postgresql was used by few

570247
postgresql	mysql
you re right postgresql has much better support for sql and other advanced features so there s a very good case for why postgresql is superior to mysql

570247
postgresql	mysql
however mysql is so much easier to install and manage for someone who is just getting started that it gains a lot of adoption relative to postgresql

570247
postgresql	mysql
simple tasks like configuring a login and giving it specific privileges are very confusing on a postgresql server compared to mysql

570247
postgresql	mysql
also there were a few years early on where mysql offered native binaries for windows but postgresql did not

570247
postgresql	mysql
by the time postgresql did support windows natively mysql had a substantial lead in market share and name recognition

570253
int	double
for example if you wanted to have an add method that accepted an int object and double

570299

570302
subtract	add
if you need to subtract or add members to the interface lots of stuff will break

570307
width	height
as far as i know if you want its background to be visible you need to set width and height for the span

570317
free	malloc
i d like to hear your feedback on the best way to free the allocated memory in case the second malloc fails

570437
ubuntu	debian
this works only on debian ubuntu et al check your system documentation for others

570472
put	get
parsers are not complicated if you know how to build them but they are not the type of thing that if you put in enough time you ll eventually get there

570474
rss	feed
i m not very experienced with dbms systems so i need some advice about which dbms to use for storing rss feed

570497
wav	caf
it supports read and write of a variety of caf and wav formats

570497
wav	caf
the caf file structure and wav are fairly similar

570530
rss	feed
any of the dbms can be sufficent to store rss feed the questions should be

570566
firefox	safari
cosmetic web bugs involving styling in various browser o s configurations a page looks fine in windows and mac in firefox and ie but on the mac in safari something gets messed up

570566
firefox	safari
these are annoying sometimes because they require so much attention to detail and making the change to fix safari may break something in firefox or ie so one has to tread carefully and realize that the styling may be a series of hacks to fix page after page

570586
equals	gethashcode
since your equals method uses structural equality make sure you override gethashcode with an implementation based on your fields as well

570592
vmware	virtualbox
another free solution is virtualbox from sun which is able to install on windows xp home which vmware server will not

570624
windows	wow64
wow64 allows using 32-bit windows application on 64-bit windows translating 32-bit pointers to real 64-bit pointers

570644
stdout	fflush
the real problem however was that the the streamhandler s buffer was not fflush until after stdout was reset to its original output stream resulting in the log messages not appearing in junit s output for stdout

570649
folder	directory
enable directory browsing and you can click the folder of the last build and so on

570651
google-chrome	firefox
20 in firefox google-chrome

570680
httphandler	httpmodule
in our asp.net 2.0 application we have the an httpmodule and httphandler

570680
httphandler	httpmodule
httphandler processrequest is not entered on every httpmodule endrequest which seems like incorrect behavior since my understanding of the flow of events

570680
httphandler	httpmodule
httpmodule beginrequest httphandler processrequest httpmodule endrequest

570707
boost	stl
stl boost is a tool for the job

570724
min	max
you get a coercion mechanism with allows you to define rules for max min and present value of the property

570739
distance	polygons
assuming no distance falloff i should be able to use the point on the polygons i ve found and compare the normal at that point to the angle of incidence on the light to figure out my illumination value

570753
asterisk	ivr
i have deployed several ivr s with asterisk and what i usually do is test them on my machine by setting up asterisk with just sip having one sip user which i set up on x-lite

570753
asterisk	ivr
start asterisk run x-lite and dial the proper extension and it will be just as if you call your ivr in deployment

570762
unix	solaris
i need to run perl applications i develop on cygwin windows on hp unix solaris hosts

570809
awt	swing
often it happens to work but you are not allowed to do anything with swing components unless you are in the awt worker thread

570816
asterisk	ivr
if you are doing other stuff with asterisk then set up a hidden extension one not advertised on the ivr menu which you can dial once you re connected

570825
multiplying	add
using the terms defined above you take the x y and z components of each of those unit length vectors multiplying them together and add the sums to get the dot product

570829
asterisk	ivr
i use asterisk for ivr implementations

570829
asterisk	ivr
i currently have an ivr with 8 e1 links 240 channels with asterisk and a sangoma card works pretty well

570829
voip	sip
and it s easy to test new features since i can run it in my machine with just voip setting up sip in asterisk and using the x-lite softphone

570865
httphandler	httpmodule
if i understand correctly httpmodule would get executed for every request which comes to your application while the httphandler would execute only for the registered extension

570918
listview	gridview
i have a window using a wpf listview gridview bound to an observablecollection

570945
pull	push
i d like to clone a pure git repo off this and then use git push pull to move changes between the git-svn tree and the git tree while also using git svn dcommit rebase to move changes between the git-svn tree and the svn repo it s based on

570989
getter	setter
i didn t make a setter for imagebyte but i made a getter that does the following

acutally most browsers are pretty good in supporting the open standards including some of the oldest browsers in the world like opera which is like 15 years old and firefox which is to some extend based on netscape which is like also from 1993 or something i think

571020
xsl-fo	xslt
as long as you can make sure to use proper xhtml you could also use a product like alt-soft s xml2pdf to convert xml xhtml into pdf by means of xslt xsl-fo

571036
switching	screens
you should almost always animate any switching between screens in iphone os

571039
bash	zsh
another way assuming a shell like bash or zsh

571047
super	self
update i skimmed your code and it seems you are setting file.nzb to which uses its media_url and then in the delete method you are calling the delete method of the super-class of file as super file self .delete which is obviously wrong as it will try deleting file.nzb and will try accessing the file through the media_url

571049
gentoo	ubuntu
i use gentoo and ubuntu for development

571061
coldfusion	verity
for the verity part without considering coldfusion it s easy enough to detach a collection rename it and reattach it again

571067
folder	dir
getresource some relative dir will look for anything inside of the web-app folder

571095
gentoo	ubuntu
any of ubuntu slackware gentoo should be fine as a development environment

571095
freebsd	opensolaris	opensolaris	openbsd	openbsd	freebsd
if you are at all interested in making better code i also recommend dual booting or running a 2nd computer into a non-linux system such as openbsd freebsd opensolaris etc

571133
range	min
borderlayout only allows one component to be in each area so min range will never appear as maxrange is now the south component

571196
mp3	wav
if i were to do it again i would have also made a separate repository for media files we have lots of mp3 wav files that need to be in version control but alas they are under our main repo

571199
vbscript	vb6
when i wanted to handle byte arrays from vbscript like a blob coming from a database i made a general vb6 com object that could perform operations on the byte array

571213
hbase	hypertable
there are a few very good free open source alternatives to these namely apache hadoop apache hbase and hypertable

571243
innodb	myisam
innodb doesn t support fulltext indexing and myisam doesn t support transactions

571245
packets	multicast
however udp does support multicast so the same packets can be delivered to one or more hosts

571255
put	get	post	put	post	get
the way to get the best of both worlds is to put the fixed-length fields everything except the post text in one table and the variable-length fields the post text in another

571376
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval are both deprecated

571400
comparator	comparable
for keys that aren t comparable or whose natural ordering isn t what you need you can implement your own comparator and specify that in the constructor

571607
bluetooth	usb
i have written apps that use usb bluetooth serial ports and have never had an issue

571633
post	get
drm raises the bar a bit but not by much since as soon as someone works out how to get around it they just post a program on the internet and everyone uses it

571676
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
some linux distributions such as debian etch and lenny ubuntu and arch include the suhosin patch in their php package so on those systems you ll often find it s turned on by default

571676
redhat	fedora
redhat derived distributions redhat enterprise centos fedora etc don t include suhosin in their php packages

571783
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream

571797
vim	emacs
for various reasons i don t use vim emacs though i don t suffer from terminal-phobia

it uses an rss feed located at the web root under the name rss.xml to give an rss feed of the events to users who are interested in the service

571897
rss	feed
i have the blog piece done but i m not sure the best way to integrate an rss feed for the blog in to the website

571897
rss	feed
do i combine the event listings and blog rss feed in to the main rss.xml or do i need to pick one

571945
calloc	malloc
also i needed the array to be initialized to zeros so when i googled malloc i discovered that calloc was perfect for my purposes

571945
calloc	malloc
malloc calloc also has the advantage over allocating on the stack of allowing me to declare the size using a variable

571954
width	height
the window .load was needed instead of document .ready because safari cannot use the width and height functions if no width height attributes are defined on the image on document.ready

571981
sudoku	crossword
i am attempting to create a sukodu like crossword player in wpf and i realize that i have a whole bunch of controls that will need to know the sudoku grid to function

571981
children	parent
ultimately what i want is one property where if it s set on a parent ui element all children ui elements that knows about the property will share the same value overriding any prior value setting

572011
awt	swing
generally you re supposed to use swing or awt if you want access to the keyboard which is silly

572042
put	get
modelmaker is like any other good productivity tool - the more you put into it the more you get out of it

572083
typedef	struct
your original typedef if you look had typedef struct bucket bucket

572214
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
for more sophisticated date calculations such as the number of days within the ten million seconds after 3pm on january 19th in 1983 you would use the nscalendar class along with nsdatecomponents

572252
accessor	properties
this is useful when fields and duplicated by properties accessor and they don t need to show up twice or if a properties performs some substantial operation like what you re suggesting and you need to suppress it always so that the debugger doesn t evaluate it

572262
google-chrome	firefox
my page is working fine in google-chrome and firefox

572289
free	malloc
you may see the time it takes malloc new and free delete to return increase 10-fold

572296
mouse	keyboard
here i have done all move moving as well as mouse clicking opereations by help of remoting concept here keyboard operation is pending in that i could send keyboard values to corresponding focused controls.

572366
rss	feed
i whipped one up to output atom feed instead of rss

572570
inherited	properties
i think what you want is an attached properties with the inherited frameworkpropertyoption

572577
put	get
threads should get jobs from a queue and put back results on another queue

572622
ubuntu	debian
i highly recommend debian or ubuntu server for domain-0

572622
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu use the apt package manager

572637
opera	safari
but another solution could be firebug lite which works for internet explorer opera and safari

572640
pull	push
for this purpose they setup a shared git repo and exchange their work using pull push commands

572644
google-chrome	firefox
works on ie and google-chrome fine so ideally should work on firefox

572694
put	get
so put your memory to one side get yourself either a really quiet space or a pink noise generator and dive in

572699
springboard	backgrounding
apple and the open iphone community has plenty of programs running on the phone such as the mobilephone mobile safari and springboard applications that can run in the backgrounding and load libraries

572727
public	protected
sometimes public private protected protection level is not quite enough for real world situations

572751
punctuation	words
the idea of parsing the file using a dictionary your only other option really apart from randomly inserting spaces and hoping for the best and inserting spaces at identified words boundaries a real problem when dealing with punctuation plurals that don t alter the base words plural etc would i believe be a much greater programming challenge than correctly parsing the pdf in the first place

572808
gif	png
side note the chart should be exportable to png gif whatever

572840
ant	maven
i found maven to be a horrible tool so build everything with ant

572849
opera	firefox
helps with older versions of firefox and opera aswell occasionally

572872
post	get
here s a post to get you started on that

572876
google-chrome	firefox
i build it for google-chrome then i optimize for firefox most of the time its just little things then i go into ie 8 and then i go into ie 7 since most bugs i will have eliminated by then

572878
bazaar	svn	bazaar	cvs	cvs	svn
all files under version control cvs at that time but look at svn or bazaar for example

572891
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
it s should be highly efficient as it uses sendfile underneath the hood but not entirely portable only linux freebsd and solaris are currently supported

572909
jar	war
it was a hideous mess including one war that had the weblogic jar inside it

572936
unix	bsd
i have used dos windows pc s all my life switched my main laptop to mac two years ago and have used numerous flavors of unix linux bsd while studying for my comp.sci

572938
mouse	keyboard
i guess think i can do this by registering every mouse movement or keyboard movement when users are doing on every page of my application

572946
mouse	keyboard
events are dispatched in a predictable order the runnable objects enqueued by invokelater are dispatched from the same event queue as mouse and keyboard events timer events and paint requests

572946
public	protected
whenever the toolkit calls a method that might be implemented in client code for example any public or protected method in a public class the toolkit must save its state and release all locks so that the client code can grab locks if necessary

573010
put	get
i am currently trying to put together an url where i specify some get parameters

573031
glassfish	weblogic	jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish
otherwise the big name web environments apache tomcat spring glassfish rails jboss grails weblogic ... are all commonly deployed on some flavor of nix

573033
width	height
css box model states that in the width height of an element the padding and border withs are not included

573104
int	chars
you can also use unicode and an int value if you need chars outside of the ascii range

573109
pop-up	dialog
we were using word automation but it s painful because word will do crazy things like pop-up a modal dialog which will break your code

573120
vim	emacs
but you should also probably specify what vim version you re using and how that thing in emacs works

573134
width	height
these classes worth with binary data or streams and can decode and encode several popular image formats and generate thumbnails on the fly off a high resolution store through different decoding and encoding height and width

573182
mysqlconnection	mysqldatareader
then you ll be able to get the date columns out of your database and into datetime objects in the standard way using mysqlconnection mysqlcommand mysqldatareader etc

573305
actionscript	mxml
if i include a an external actionscript file in a flex mxml file i get different behaviours at compile time depending on the method used

573307
crypt	hash
the old app used crypt in perl to hash the passwords

573321
joptionpane	jdialog
i would also recommend to look into jdialog or joptionpane

573335
post	get
following up this other question by the op i post an alternative method to execute a command and get hold of stdout

573355
nsmutablestring	nsstring
immutable classes such as nsstring but not nsmutablestring don t need to offer an actual copy because they cannot be altered

573384
int	chars
i m trying to cast a chars that is stored in stack to an int and this is what i did

573395
int	chars
that s then autoboxed to chars and so when you cast to int the cast fails

573395
int	chars
that should convert from chars to int then box to int and you ll be away

573395
int	chars
in the first case the cast is actually then redundant as the result of the subtraction will be int rather than chars - but i d leave it there for clarity

573400
int	chars
you can t cast chars instance to an int

573404
int	chars
or the a is saved as a chars in the stack rather than as a chars and then the conversion to int fails

573410
int	chars
you re pushing a chars not an int

573422
sorting	filtering
this will allow you to do the filtering sorting at the controller level while maintaining a strict correlation between the client and its data

573425
int	chars
convert the chars to an int

573488
width	height
i have a canvas of variable width and height with a maximum being 2k 2k

573488
width	height
this canvas current height and width vary depending on the user screen size

573534
int	chars
the simple way to convert a chars to an int value is to do

573535
hash	md5
you could then use the md5 hash of some field like filename to sort this into the right directory hash fabe063e.

573545
awt	swing
the java launcher is not swing or awt specific

573550
nhibernate	llblgenpro
you want to use typed business entities instead of data tables to more naturally access your data and aren t already using something like nhibernate or llblgenpro

573564
versioning	upgrade
i would be furious if large parts of an enterprise application just wouldn t compile because my team upgrade to a newer versioning of java

573568
sorting	grouping
this might be sorting projection applying a predicate grouping etc

573590
pull	push
git-clone pull merge push operations

573593
getter	setter
i understand the reason for it but over the years having to call setter and getter and the like has made code huge and noisy

573624
implements	extends
and this worked because the locator class would return the stub class which in addition to extends org.apache.axis.client.stub also implements the addfunction interface class

573634
versioning	upgrade
there are several different algorithms for comparison so if the default doesn t work for you try syntax aware or some of the other algorithms now i am using versioning 8 and haven t upgrade to versioning 10 so ymmv but i doubt that the xml diff has gotten worse

573650
textile	bbcode
another way to handle it is to allow the user to enter comments in some kind of simpler markup language like bbcode textile or markdown stackoverflow is using markdown perhaps in conjunction with a nice javascript editor

573657
xslt	xquery
from there i imagine it s possible to write some sort of transformation via xslt or xquery into whatever end result you desire

573661
firefox	safari
the website i m building for escondido arts gallery has all of it s text in each element left-aligned in firefox and ie but for some reason everything is center aligned in safari

573672
width	height
x and y are the width and height of the grid elements

573682
ienumerable	icollection
generally you should pass around ienumerable t or icollection t depending on whether it makes sense for your consumer to add items

573697
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the center align property must be cascading from some other element because it s not only safari google-chrome which also uses webkit but also opera that shows the things center aligned and both safari google-chrome and opera are more standards compliant than ie and even firefox

573724
stdout	stderr
is there a fairly simple way to redirect stdout and stderr to a text control or other visible place

573733
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stdout stderr and stdin using freopen

573752
stdout	stderr
when you create a process using createprocess you can choose a handle to which stdout and stderr are going to be written

573758
std	ostream
or you can do that with a std stringstream or some other class derived from std ostream

573762
put	get
you need to create pipe with createpipe then attach stdout to it s write end with setstdhandle then you can read from pipe s read end with readfile and put text you get from there anywhere you like

573763
subtract	add
in fact because you can add or subtract elements from a list i would argue that this makes the return value more mutable than an array

573824
google-chrome	safari
in webkit safari google-chrome you can simply do

573843
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
an array inherently supports ilist as well as ienumerable and icollection for that matter

573854
invokelater	invokeandwait
you could switch from invokelater to invokeandwait which will wait until the window is created

573861
put	get
let us know where we are falling down on the job or where you don t have a tool you need and we ll put it on the list and get to it

573869
opera	firefox
debugging one browser is hard but debugging ie 7 ie 6 firefox opera safari.

573873
pop-up	dialog
after you do that vs will pop-up a dialog asking if you want a different product id

573885
logmein	hamachi
heres a link to hamachi - aka logmein

573918
awt	swing
after learning on here that the java console doesn t support keyboard input a great deal i switched to swing and awt

573928
inherited	subclassing
inherited by a subclassing but is not

573936
awt	swing
i am familiar with java awt and swing so no need to explain these concepts to me

573936
width	height
it would be in the left and fill all available height while using a fixed width

573957
implements	extends
if you re a c# and java programmer every time you use a class that extends a base class but also implements a few interfaces you are sort of admitting multiple inheritance can be useful in some situations

574006
sorting	filtering
sorting and filtering by cck fields in particular can be slow because cck doesn t automatically add indexes beyond the primary keys

574068
cherrypy	twisted.web
pure python web server eg paste cherrypy spawning twisted.web

574108
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
i use sqlconnection sqlcommand and sqldatareader set sql string etc

574200
pop-up	dialog
but if i navigate to or firefox pop-up a dialog asking if i want to save the file or view it in a program

574232
folder	directory
i have another db that is in the mssql data folder should that be placed in same directory as well

574245
jobs	cron
i personally use cron but the jobs scheduling parts of django-extensions looks interesting

574249
ironruby	ironpython
also consider that you can write applets in any .net language including ironpython ironruby perlnet etc

574252
ubuntu	linux
i want to go learn web programming but besides names and a little of html i don t know anything.so i ask you what programming languages you recommend why what can be done with it tools to learn etc.i don t know if it matters but i program in a linux enviroment ubuntu

574262
int	chars
i would hazard a guess that the original author of the database perhaps thought that int 4 meant an int with up to 4 digits whereas it actually means an int between -2147483648 and 2147482647 displayed with at least 4 chars left-padded with spaces if need be

574272
client-side	server-side
the server-side language is python the client-side language is javascript inside django templates

574285
folder	directory
first of all i d to establish that i do have the text file in my folder directory

574291
accessor	properties
the self.view properties accessor calls -loadview if the view isn t currently loaded

574317
width	height
with full height and width and a header and footer

574317
width	height
with full height and width and a header and footer

574317
width	height
with full height and width and a header and footer

574318
post	get
post data is not added to the url like get so you don t need to urlencode it

574319
bash	zsh
i m partial to zsh it s like a blend of ksh and bash

574335
getter	setter
this isn t exactly what you are looking for but if you apply the attribute to the getter setter of the property it will prevent the debugger from breaking on the property unless explicitly setting a breakpoint on the line

574360
jar	manifest.mf
in the jar file you can provide a manifest.mf file that tells the java command where to find the other jar files as well as what the main class is

574367
centos	linux
i am on linux centos 5

574405
content-length	content-type
you will also want to set the content-type to text plain and content-length to the size of the file

574421
cpu	processors
vectorized instructions are not limited to cell processors - most modern workstations-like cpu have them ppc x86 since pentium 3 sparc etc...

574423
firefox	safari
i can reproduce this with both ie6 and ie7 but not firefox or safari

574440
firefox	safari
i don t get this error or any other error when running the same application on firefox or safari

574449
cvs	svn
i ve seen it implemented in a number of different organizations using different tools clearcase svn cvs to name a few

574452
actionscript	mxml
i am referring to whether you can use mxml markup in an actionscript 3.0 file in flexbuilder 3

574468
implements	extends
in flex you have the option of extends the sprite class or implements the iuicomponent class

574520
put	get
so on an insert the dto would get its get id like customerdto.customerid property set and then put in this result object

574520
inherited	properties
i suppose i could solve this by having a lot of the different kinds of result objects maybe derived from a base result and inherited the error properties but that doesn t seem very clean

574523
post	get
variables in a form can be sent by post or get methods

574523
post	get
- the combination of get post and cookie variables

574538
mouse	keyboard
if you record your mouse keyboard actions using one project you can then re-run those actions for a set of projects

574548
std	ostream
change std cout to a std ostream and then pass your file or std cout as required

574554
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stdout stderr and stdin using std freopen

574576
post	get
these are known as the post or get methods

574576
post	get
the post method is sent invisibly to the server and is meant for uploading data while the get method is visible to the user as the query string in the url and is only meant to literally get information

574576
post	get
for example a site could use post exclusively to get around caching by proxy servers or your browser or because they use double byte languages and can cause issues when trying to perform a get because of the encoding conversion

574576
post	get
_request keyname to allow you to grab the post get and any cookie information that might have been submitted

574654
hide	show
afaik there is no built-in way to do this so you ll have to do it manually by handling the show and hide events as you mention

574690
apache	nginx
in the meantime i was going to have nginx proxy all connections to that path straight to apache and let apache handle it

574690
apache	nginx
however i m on a memory limited vps and i d rather not run one set of php-cgi processes for nginx with their own apc cache and another for apache using more memory for their apc cache

574726
range	max
normally the exp range is - max+1 - max

574741
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
for native functions firefox ie opera and google-chrome returns a function with the body native code

574741
opera	google-chrome
it is tested with ff3 ie7 opera 9.6 and google-chrome 1

574741
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in that case the code above will work in firefox ie and opera but not google-chrome

574782
implements	extends
as i understand it you want to get a global access to some instance of player but would not need to extends some other class or implements some interface to do so which means you don t have to inherit any behaviour you just want access to one object

574782
implements	extends
you can implements as many interfaces as you like but only extends one other class but you have to reimplement all functionality since you cannot write any code into an interface just define what attributes methods a class implements that interface must provide

574796
move	drag
i ve created a very iphone-y slider element that is both restricted in overall movement horizontally 0-400px and it does not move vertically and snaps to either side of the 400px container when it has passed the 200px mark and the drag has ended

574803
awt	swing
also note you should always use swing components on the awt event dispatch thread

574811
children	parent
because the forkbomb code you provided dies if it cannot spawn a child process the parent processes do not actually hang around but the fact that the children keep creating new grand -children keeps the process table full

574811
bash	zsh
as has already been mentioned the important part of the zsh command is the run-in-background so the bash command would basically be the same as given in the other answers

574919
cpython	ironpython
some of my workmates are working on ironclad a project that will make extension modules for cpython work in ironpython

574936
width	height
first make sure your embed tag is alright width and height set to 100 css etc.

574949
keydown	keyup
you could use the keydown keyup and keypress events as well

574971
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
if you need to trap paste operations with the mouse use onpaste ie ff3 and oninput firefox opera google-chrome safari 1

574990
x86	64bit
i m thinking of upgrading my linux installation to the 64bit version of linux mint but i m worried that because the book is targeted at 32-bit x86 architecture that the code examples won t work

575038
put	get
also if i try to put a loop in start i get only a white screen even if repaint is at the end

575074
haskell	ocaml
as haskell ocaml java c and c++ which are all very very fast

575143
boost	stl
the main idea is that it must have been able to compile itself which means i cannot use stl boost etc

575153
versioning	upgrade
the solution to my luck was rather simple commons-pool is being used only by my webapp so i could delete it from all referenced projects otherwise i think i would just try to upgrade them all to a single versioning

575155
boost	stl
which means i cannot use stl boost etc

575155
min	max
consider andrej alexandrescu s efford to write template-function versions of min and max that behave as correctly as the macro version

575177
vim	emacs
i would like to have emacs which has a vertical hierarchy at the left-hand-side about items in the document similar to vim s plugin taglist

575192
boost	stl
a subset of c++ and in particular the subset which it uses in its own implementation so that it can compile itself then you should avoid using stl and boost in your implementation because the stl and boost are implemented using templates so if and only if you use them then you will have to include implement support for compiling templates

575197
postgresql	mysql
if you re used to thinking a relational database has to be huge and heavy like postgresql or mysql then you ll be pleasantly surprised by sqlite

575206
put	get
i put a condition to breakpoint and press f5 to get it

575265
width	height
of course we could increase the width accordingly but that s not what we would expect when we were to ask an object of declared type rectangle which is actually a square underneath to change its height

575285
mouse	keyboard
when requirements are communicated a language of symbols is used whether it is keyboard clicks mouse clicks or any other form of input

575293
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
what it basically does is getting some data from connected another device and send that data to the server periodically using nsurlconnection and read data from the server periodically and visualize that data as a graph using nsxmlparser

575313
range	max
you could also lock the table get the max key insert your rows and then get your max key again and do a range

575346
treemap	treeset
insertion time for a red-black tree which is used to implement java s treeset treemap is guaranteed worst case to be o log n

575353
treemap	treeset
the treeset treemap etc

575390
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
both interfaces are part of the posix standard and nowadays both interfaces are available on most systems i just checked linux freebsd mac os x and solaris

575390
pthreads	fcntl
in most systems these are equivalent operations in fact under linux lockf is implemented on top of fcntl but pthreads says their interaction is unspecified

575393
pthreads	fcntl
fcntl pthreads locks

575473
sorting	filtering
anyone know were to find a plugin for jquery that can help me build a filtering pageing sorting for items like

575493
folder	directory
pdfcreator has examples for different languages in the com folder of the install directory

575532
wtl	atl
i am using a combination of the atl and wtl for a project and have derived my own class from cwindowimpl which looks something like this

575573
getter	setter
as mentioned most properties must have both a getter and setter

575579
invokelater	invokeandwait
if the above is impossible i d go with invokeandwait instead of invokelater as paul tomblin already suggested

575602
children	parent
which means that even though the children are running concurrently they can only be processed one-at-a-time because they are all waiting for the parent

575602
children	parent
how can i have the parent communicating with a children using pipes in such a way that it is not blocking

575602
peer	p2p
we are implementing a p2p protocol that uses a centralized server to manage the peer

575616
children	parent
to answer your concurrent parent question you will need to have the parent set up a select loop to handle possible responses from any of its children at any time

575641
lan	intranet
on intranet sites where all the users have high-speed lan access to the server but the ram available for holding session data is limited it may make more sense

575668
cos	sin
a cos ïˆ cos î a cos ïˆ sin î a sin ïˆ

575697
lisp	scheme
i hated the parentheses in lisp and scheme because after c c# and languages like that it seemed very obfuscated and it wasn t really clear how things are related

575706
gif	png
i m trying to create an image and write it to gif or png and i want it to use a black pen on a white background

575752
post	get
when the form is submitted the same order will be send to the server in the post or get

575782
ready	each
so far i have just put a static pending... text into each cell that is not yet ready to speed up display

575830
jtable	jlayeredpane
if i needed to do this i would use a jlayeredpane to draw my animated renderers on top of the the jtable

575830
jscrollpane	jlayeredpane	jtable	jlayeredpane
jscrollpane - viewport jlayeredpane - jtable jpanel transparent with animations

575906
pull	push
this changes will remain local to this repository unless you decide to push pull them to another repository

575924
gtk	drawingarea
basically i have nodes represented as small dots on a gtk drawingarea and i update the positions of these nodes and redraw the drawingarea in a loop

575928
pull	push
there s nothing else you have to do -- you simply don t pull from or push to the libraryb repo any more

575934
irc	bittorrent
it comes with a lot of features such as an irc and bittorrent client which is important to me at school where there is a quota of 50 megs on disk space

575934
opera	firefox
most of opera s features are eventually available copied to firefox as plugins but i still prefer opera at home because the text looks better

575958
google-chrome	firefox
for some others especially many reading stackoverflow.com it might be flawed because their expectation is that google-chrome can also seamlessly import their firefox or whatever other plugins which was not part of google-chrome s original features

576040
swt	swing
in practice you would want to pick eclipse for swt and netbeans for swing matisse is great when you are getting started

576080
width	height
i have a number of objects each one have an arbitrary number of shared and distinct property-value pairs more specifically files and their related properties -such as width and height values for images album artist length for music files etc

576084
getter	setter
i d make the isoname property derivative the getter will return self.selectedlanguage.isoname and setter will perform the look-up for a given iso name and set self.selectedlanguage to that language object

576129
typedef	struct
if you are writing a c library where you don t want to expose some internal data-structure it can be good to go an extra route and hide implementation with a unspecified struct typedef

576152
hide	show
if you are making it so a user can only see certain info after selecting a drop down you can hide it in a panel and only show that panel when the drop down is selected

576183
super	self
note that the syntax changed in python 3.0 you can just say super .__init__ instead of super childb self .__init__ which imo is quite a bit nicer

576295
rss	feed
if you are focusing on creating an rss reader and not on rss parsing logic you might want to delegate creation reading rss feed using this free rss library called argotic on codeplex.com

576296
skip-lists	tree
a bloom-filter a skip-lists and random binary search tree

576296
skip-lists	tree
so as you can see the random binary search tree was rather a lot better than the skip-lists

576300
rss	feed
if you re really writing a feed reader you might want to start with parsing atom as it s a more standardised format and might get you further faster with a good design to branch off into rss from

577073
post	get
i don t think that you should be using gets in a rake task if you need to get input from the command line you probably should pass it in as a parameter but if you post some code that is not working then i am sure you will get a better answer

578047
mouseup	mousedown
see if you can find a way to use mouseup instead of click which is possibly working off mousedown

i don t know if there s such a thing as an official place but a reasonable thing to do would be to do what you ve done and refer to tomcat through a softlink at usr local tomcat or some such which would allow you to upgrade versioning by simply installing a new versioning in opt and changing the softlink

578142
width	margin

578764
disk	ram
i talked with one of the head guys maintaining gnat gcc s ada compiler about this and he told me that he actually used to put everything he could onto ram disk so that even his file i o was really just ram reads and writes

578834
irrlicht	ogre3d
instead i m implementing the renderer using c++ cli and irrlicht which seems to be faster and more well designed than ogre3d

578952
kerberos	ntlm
i suspect that what s slowing my down is the ntlm kerberos challenge response and the number of simultaneous requests pegs even the multi-core processor

579033
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
you could however use wsdl.exe or svcutil.exe depending on whether you want system.web or wcf-style client proxy to your services from the command line and specify the appropriate option for shared types

579036
pull	push
i have done exactly this in a spelling and grammar checker which not only pull out plain text from outlook and checks it - it can then push all the user s changes back into the html without destroying any tags

i ve tried every display property on this page and none of them preserve the ordered list numbers when displaying the list horizontally in ie nor are they preserved in firefox opera or safari for windows - and by extension probably google-chrome although i admit i didn t test every display property there

579434
range	max	range	min	min	max
the control caters for a min and max date so that date of birth can have a range from say -100 years to current year while credit card expiry might range from current year to +5 years and so we use range validators

if you can parse edid you can read the width and height of the monitor in centimeters

579496
getter	setter
the place where i ve seen this is in webworks where a single class had tons of getter setter methods -- the setter used for dependency injection url args passed to the object upon execution and the getter for making values accessible to various page templates i think it was jsps

579496
getter	setter
so the breakdown grouped stuff logically assuming the class was called myaction there was myactionbasicargs fields and setter for basic cgi arguments extended by myactionadvancedargs advanced-option args extended by myactionexposedvalues getter extended by myactiondependencies setter used by spring dependency injection non-cgi args extended by myaction which contained the actual execute method

579508

put	get
consider that the people at netbsd have to put in a huge amount of work to get cross-compiling to work and they re running the same os just different architectures

579827
kde	gnome
a solution that comes to my mind is if you have the opportunity of using gnome or some other widespread distribution as kde you can rely on the messages informations they give

579864

getter	setter
4 personally i hate naming my getter setter getx and setx but prefer to lean on the overloading mechanism and use xtype x const for getter and void x xtype newval for setter

580317
mouse	keyboard
it counts every key up key down press as an onchange event meaning that you can t navigate a redirect select list via keyboard killing accessibility for users who can t use the mouse

coalesce and isnull are essentially just shortcuts for a case statement

580450
pull	push
git for one even lets you pull from and push to a subversion repository directly

580455
inherited	properties
apparently the default implementation will only return direct properties from an interface and not the inherited ones

580455
inherited	properties
but maybe you could even write a generic typeconverter that would find all inherited properties by using reflection

580457
int	chars
here index1 and index 2 are simple int variables..the configstring is a chars array contains 127.0.0.1 7005 address and port number ...address and port are chars array variables to store address and port number

580489
boost	stl
rather than using shared_ptr with standard stl containers take a look at the boost pointer container library

580500
pull	push
you could also make a branch of the mirrored repository and use that as your checkout then your commits are also a local-only operation and when you re ready with a batch of commits you push them to the remote svn repository and pull other user s changed back similar to an svn update command

580500
bazaar	git
other than that i second using bazaar mercurial or git as others have suggested

580517
disk	ram
assuming each of your machines had 4 xeon six cores 32gb of ram a fast disk array and a highly optimized database for writes you could do it

580593
postgresql	mysql
what i m looking for is a way to convert the access database to an open-source database such as mysql or postgresql

580597
versioning	upgrade
as you upgrade to new versioning of the other vendor s dll you will need to extend the mock dll to support any new entrypoints that your application uses

postgresql	mysql
either mysql or postgresql will work fine as a replacement data store for your access data

580690
int	boolean
the commented-out line as it is should work just use int values of 1 and 0 in your data to represent a boolean

580692
int	boolean
sqlite has no built-in boolean type - you have to use an int instead

580692
int	boolean
also when you re comparing the value to true and t you re comparing it to those values as strings not as boolean or int and therefore the comparison will always fail

580718
put	get
not all devices will store their information in the same column either so you may have to put some logic into your wmi results to get he format you re looking for

580754
nodevalue	innerhtml
that s because the property nodevalue returns null for element nodes so you return innerhtml instead which is gonna contain the whole html code inside an element

580768

get the print button to send a or post get with the details to the page you want to print

580881

580927
versioning	upgrade
make sure to check your project references after you upgrade from 2005 to 2008 for some odd reason the upgrade wizard does not upgrade references to microsoft.visualstudio.qualitytools.unittestframework and leaves references to versioning 8.0 of this assembly

580952
width	height
instead of display none you could try visibility hidden and setting the width and height to 1px each

581155
nginx	lighttpd
calls into the app get passed through by proxy to apache+mod_wsgi and then nginx lighttpd serve the static content directly

my problem is that in fx safari google-chrome etc all the decent browsers this works fine

581386
getter	setter
question 1 i would like a getter and setter for a property to be grouped together

581386
getter	setter
maybe you can group your getter setter methods with their latest mmx tool

581386
move	drag
drag and drop sorting in the mmx class explorer you drag the method to the new location and modelmaker move the code

581387
unsigned	short
at some point in the future i might want to switch the buffer to a different type like unsigned char or short

581492
rational-numbers	integer
for example the rational class represents all rational-numbers so it can be directly represented as a fixnum or bignum integer by calling to_int

581515
put	get
call registerinterfaceinglobal to put your com interface in the git pass its cookie to your other threads which can then call getinterfacefromglobal using that cookie to get the original interface

581525
firefox	safari
it seems that firefox and ie will happily render a png image from s3 even though it has the wrong content-type header whereas safari doesn t like this at all and consequently won t render the image

581538
post	get
basic get post or ajax request

581543
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox safari and google-chrome see the first object and use the quicktime plugin if installed to render a control

581567
put	get
also not documented is the fact that you can put arbitrary get parameters on the url of your change_list page to filter the results

581630
mouse	keyboard
users should be able to have expected behaviour from a select list regardless of whether they use mouse keyboard or mousewheel or voice screenreader whatever...

581648
src	attr
line 3 get the current image s src with attr and replace img_t with img_l

581719
entity-relationship	diagram
as you will see from the entity-relationship diagram i ended up with too many pks in the link table in many places

581738
int	chars
note that as you re sending data over a network chars and other int types may not be interchangeable due to endian-ness

581753
entity-relationship	diagram
looking at the actual entity-relationship diagram - the er_lp url in the question - the tbl prefix seems a trifle unnecessary

581786
implements	extends
you could extends system.collections.objectmodel.collection and override the insertitem method to get the behaviour you want and it also implements ilist

581799
jobs	cron
a couple of cron jobs backup monitoring

581876
agile	sprint
this is allowing us to stay agile by doing a partial migration of one or two directories or several files inside one directory over a series of sprint rather than having to migrate the entire site in one go over a much longer duration

581896
freebsd	linux	freebsd	centos	centos	linux
it may not be a bad first step to deploy into a lx branded zone think freebsd jails or linux vserver for a comparison as the lx branded zones can run linux binaries and are explicitly centos rhel based

581932
boost	stl
boost interprocess takes care of that part and you can use stl containers like trees lists etc

581947
post	get
here are a few post to get you started

581966
temp	tmp
on my computer the environment variables tmp and temp both point to the same location

581978
temp	tmp
also i never saw using tmp every time it was talking about temp

581996
next	except
next you can take a look at the more complex pointers into a big byte array chunk except my advice would be to have a queue of 4k 16k some power of two multiple of the page size blocks that you index into and when it is full you add another big chunk to the queue

582007
versioning	upgrade
for example your wxs files specify the product and its contents which files you install whereas you would use your wxi files to specify product versioning upgrade codes common paths etc

582021
execl	fork
if you roll your own system using fork and execl you won t get that

582030
lwjgl	jogl

i found this space invaders tutorial useful as its a nice rosetta stone between java2d and jogl lwjgl

582042
rss	feed
i was using a rss script that was causing the html-encoded angle brackets to be mixed in with the real html in the rss feed

582042
rss	feed
but in my rss feed it was being generated as notice no distinction between escaped html and the non-escaped html

582042
rss	feed
that way it was displayed in the rss feed properly

582065
put	get
so if you put 5 objects in and your template on the read take matches all 5 it is unspecified which one you will get

582070
put	get
we had a defect where objects being put into a remote cache would get overwritten because of this

582126
firefox	safari
it s a nightmare to get it to work properly on mac safari and mac firefox thanks liveconnect

582130
temp	tmp
since there were no standards some dos and win 3.x applications would look for the tmp environment variable and others would look for temp

582130
temp	tmp
temp is the standard now but tmp lives on

582173
jboss	glassfish
using the appropriate plug-ins http requests can be redirected to an application server tomcat jboss glassfish or a script language interpreter php

i have some vb6 code that i am converting to vb.net and came across this section

582257
folder	directory
hence i wanted to deny access to that folder or move it to a directory that is not served as content by the web server

582263
post	get
if you were to give an input field a name like and then have the script that receives this data loop through the post or get variables looking for something matching the pattern you could pull this off and this would have practically guaranteed success regardless of browser

582318
spaces	delimiter
update added spaces to the delimiter

582366
vb.net	vb6
vb6 as any in vb.net

582392

582481
typedef	struct
what if the conversion was to a custom struct and what about typedef

582485
listview	gridview
the point is i have designed a way to create a margin of error when picking something on a canvas with a mouse and then reading the hole that the selected ellipse belongs to and then i can read the holepattern that the hole belongs to and my entire ui listview textboxes gridview fo coordinates are all updated by the existing xaml binding and the canvas is updated with one call to an existing method to regenerate the canvas

582486
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i have already run into problems with old javascript code which i thought was standards compliant by firefox or opera standards - which are pretty good but google-chrome was even more picky

582556
hash	salt
i need to salt and hash some passwords so that i can store them safely in a database

582585
portrait	landscape
if your main concern is accidental orientation changes mid-activity that you think the device s sensors and software won t cope with well for example in a tilt-based game consider supporting landscape and portrait but using nosensor for the orientation

582585
portrait	landscape
this forces landscape on most tablets and portrait on most phones but i still wouldn t recommend this for most normal apps some users just like to type in the landscape softkeyboard on their phones and many tablet users read in portrait - and you should let them

582604
minimum	max
i want the columns of my html table to be the max of a certain percentage of the screen or a minimum number of pixels so if the user has a 1024x768 display the table columns won t be all scrunched up and may require some scrolling and if a user has a 1920x1600 screen they can get more information

582611
hash	salt
store the user id the hash and the salt in your db

582611
hash	salt

582631
folder	directory
i do have django in this directory but it simply isn t getting executed i have _ init _.py in all my directory under the tech folder and this is a copy from my own personal computer which ran off of the django test server so i don t think that s the problem

582728
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
to understand if everything has been fully loaded on the page you have to use the domcontentloaded for firefox and onreadystatechange for ie

582781
atomic	compare-and-swap
you might be able to turn the loop inside out using compare-and-swap to get an atomic lock free increment

582788
postgresql	mysql
usually i say to hell with dbms independence and do it with sequences in postgresql or autoincrement columns in mysql

582823
google-chrome	safari
for some reason safari runs a combo of border-radius with box-shadow just fine but google-chrome doesn t render the combination correctly

582824
opera	firefox
just remove the overflow auto part and close the inner div correctly with a closing tag that way it works in ie6 ie7 firefox 3 and opera probably all browsers

582868
gif	png
it basically creates gif like substance for ie6 and a real png with alpha transparency for better browsers

582877
hash	salt
since you are using the .net and c# use can use the system.security.cryptography.sha512managed namespace for generating the salt value and password hash

582946
getter	setter
inline can be used for small and frequently used functions such as getter or setter method

583002

583004
folder	directory
all i need now is to figure out how to add sub folder in the controllers directory

583045

tapestry	struts
can struts and tapestry co-exist

583085
folder	directory
i added a sub folder in my controllers directory and called it subfolder

583096
pull	push
so ignore what you found in googling about push and pull and merge -- there s a lot of nearly right discussion by people who act as if push and pull and merge are the same in git and svn

583107
getter	setter
along with its getter setter

583111
filtering	grouping
you could create a sub report for each grouping - each sub-report would select the same records except filtering them to show only the particular grouping

583121
firefox	safari
we have developed the application against the two most popular standards compliant browsers - firefox 3 and safari 3 then made necessary fixes for ie 7

583121
firefox	safari
firefox 3 safari 3 ie 7 will cover 85 of our target audience -- according to urchin stats during a brief adwords campaign

583127
calloc	malloc
it is unlikely that the dll is using a client supplied buffer as both client and server would need to know the base address of that buffer and you can t ask calloc or malloc for a preferred address at call time

583140
tapestry	struts
the one sticky problem i can foresee is if struts and tapestry have conflicting requirements for third-party libs

583147
firefox	safari
if you ve developed and tested against the latest versions of firefox and safari you re going to get a lot of other browsers for free i d say

583163
inline	inlining
personally i don t think you should ever inline unless you have first run a profiler on your code and have proven that there is a significant bottleneck on that routine that can be partially alleviated by inlining

583184
post	put
edit after dave s post i found that anything put in the .ascx file does not work while overriding that user control s render method works

583191
integer	unsigned
the key element is an unsigned integer uint64 and that object is stored in the hashmap with this key with the size of 160 kbytes

583228
slideup	slidedown
instead of slideup slidedown you ll want to use animate

583239
sudo	passwd
or you can configure sudo to not need a passwd for etc init.d postfix

583239
passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
sudo configuration via visudo allows nopasswd to allow the command without a passwd

583258
folder	directory
other files folder to avoid checking are the obj directory and the ncb file

583321
rss	feed
it has email support rss feed both itemized and digest and has an attractive console

583323
bazaar	git
or alternatively move to a dvcs like git or bazaar or .

583337
kde	gnome
i m not sure what the term service menu means in kde land but if you want to add to the context menu of gnome s file manager nautilus then this link maybe what you are looking for

i have this bit of code that is being converted from vb6 to vb.net

583605
jar	manifest.mf
your jar file must have its manifest.mf file set to declare the classpath for the jar.#

583615
put	get
once i get it into text then i m going to use a program i m writing to parse it and put the data into a database

583675
spweb	splist
i recently put together a web part to do this - basically each splist in each spweb on your site has a collection of sproleassignment objects which define the permissions for that object

583684
cos	sin
when doing some heavy number crunching and you want to avoid wasting cycles on computing sin cos you replace sin cos with a lut

583684
cos	sin
and any floating point operations like sin cos killed my performance

583701
chunked	transfer-encoding
firebug reveals that transfer-encoding is chunked and content-type is application x-www-form-urlencoded

583742
prepare	bindparam	prepare	execute
db- prepare allows you to replace patterns on php.net the example is putting a colon in front of the field name using bindparam or an array on the pdostatement- execute

583743
children	parent
in this case mdi children cannot be created using the normal createwindowex api you have to send a message to the mdi parent frame to actually create the handle

583752
cvs	svn
anything like cvs svn etc can handle incoming changes from multiple developers at once

583781
int	boolean
for example if you have int 1 field in db representing boolean state and use checkbox in html that results in empty string or on in _post or _get array you cannot just assign one into another

583799
mysqlconnection	mysqldatareader
then you ll have access to mysqlconnection mysqlcommand mysqldatareader objects etc

583804
vbscript	jscript
on the other hand if you already have all the required functionality available in the web app running on the server then you could probably set up a scheduled task that starts a script vbscript jscript which in turn calls a page of the web app

583850
pop-up	dialog
dialog pop-up

583852
put	get
objects are stored as key value object object pairs so the interface would be a bit like hashtable get put

583857
post	get
the snippet django snippets require login across entire site suggests how to do site-wide authentication but i expect it will lose the get component of the string namely because request.path does not include it and definitely lose the post data

583857
post	get
how can one preserve the post and get across those inconvenient timeouts

583866
notepad	textpad
i was always horrified when other java programmers used notepad or textpad to write code and nowadays there are just too many advantages of a good ide for that madness

583898
int	chars
if the amount of values is variadic and the type of the values is from a fixed set like int bool chars you can look into a container of boost variant

583913
put	get
if you keep this updated whenever someone does put or get you can efficiently track access order and use order

583969
int	chars
icv_av_write_frame_ffmpeg avformatcontext avstream unsigned chars unsigned int avframe in cvcap_ffmpeg.o

583969
int	chars	int	double

584050
iprincipal	iidentity
i m using a custom iprincipal and iidentity to do asp.net authorization

584128
udp	tcp
udp has a much lower overhead than tcp

584129
udp	tcp
originally nfs was probably used on low latency networks where there was very little possibility of error so the overhead of initiating the 3-way handshake to set up the tcp connection together with the bi-directional acknowledgement of all messages outweighed the simplicity of using a connectionless protocol like udp

584131
udp	tcp
udp is the default for nfsv2 which nobody should really use these days but nfsv3 use tcp by default

584131
udp	tcp
tcp mounts are more reliable and you know you have a network problem much faster than with udp

584135
post	get
in the case system ends in issuing redirect while handling post switching to get from original post and risking loosing data one should store the data somewhere db memcached etc. and make the key under which they are stored be carried through authentication or other process

584191
tabcontrol	tabitem
i am creating a ui in which a tabcontrol has a series of standard tabitem s with ordinary wpf controls as their content

584191
user-controls	tabcontrol
specifically the tabcontrol is bound to an array of user-controls s except for the last object which is a button

584198
pdfbox	itext
start with pdfbox as it s text extraction abilities are better than itext s

584208
post	get
i d suggest spending some time reading up and possibly trying a few likely google searches the post i linked you to comes up as the top result for standalone django script to get a feel for what will actually best suit your needs and tastes -- it may be django s orm isn t right for you and you shouldn t use it if it isn t but unfortunately there s a lot of misinformation out there which muddies the waters

584225
pdfbox	itext
we have found many examples of pdfs that pdftotext cannot extract from but java libraries such as itext and pdfbox can

584249
post	get
you may need to use runwithelevatedpermissions to get access to the system account to work as per the following blog post

584274
ssl	https
then append ssl to any link in the webpage for which you want to force https and nossl to any link for which you want to force regular http

584285
google-chrome	firefox
my problem is that ie6 supports hover psuedo-class only for anchor elements and ie7 does support it for all elements as firefox google-chrome etc

584346
int	boolean
which we can unroll into a pseudo basic using only size n arrays of int and boolean and the operations of 1 array indexing and indexed array assignment 2 int math including comparison 3 if then else and 4 one single loop of o n

584370
google-chrome	firefox
however the browser google-chrome and ie - not tested on firefox yet only refreshes at the end of the function so the color simply changes from black to white

584381
setinterval	settimeout
note setinterval and settimeout execute code on the single same ui thread

584448
clang	llvm
yes there is clang which is a c language frontend for the llvm compiler infrastructure

584448

both clang and llvm are coded using c++

584499
post	get
if not logged in capture the get and post data in the middleware and store it in the session

584499
pop-up	dialog
if you post asynchronously your javascript handler could recognize a login required response code and then display a pop-up dialog requesting login

584540

i am using an ini file to save the adapter config data

584697
multiplying	transpose	multiplying	multiplication
as others have indicated - swapping the order of the multiplication is equivalent to multiplying by the transpose

584760
polymorphism	specialization
parametric polymorphism in c++ this is templates and all the fun things you can do with it such as crtp specialization partial specialization meta-programming etc

584779
portrait	landscape
when i switch the phone between landscape and portrait modes the values passed from the intent are lost and i get a nullpointerexception

584796
tapestry	struts
shiny and new pointed out that means you can filter different urls with the tapestry filter and the struts filter or servlet

584796
tapestry	struts
i ve used both and i would strongly recommend that you try to keep tapestry from having to deal with struts urls

584796
tapestry	struts
with struts you can pretty much hand-code the url so it shouldn t be a problem to link to tapestry pages but if you want tapestry to link back to struts urls you may have trouble using it the standard way

584799
oncreate	recreate
when you switch orientation the activity is recreate and oncreate is recalled so you have to use the bundle to save your current state and restore after an orientation change

584807
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
if you instantiate a uinavigationcontroller with the initwithrootviewcontroller initializer you can pass it your first uiviewcontroller

584807

the uinavigationcontroller will automatically set up the uinavigationbar and back button you are looking for

584822
goto	break
that is they must all end with either a break statement or an explicit goto

584822
super	implements
if you are simply trying to design a super small language that can be implements in the course of a single semester then the story is different

584855
mouse	keyboard
is the a programmatic way or something more simple to map some keyboard key to the same action windows-wide as the left mouse button in windows xp vista

584868
getc	putchar	getc	puts	puts	putchar	stdout	stderr
i want to reopen the stdin and stdout and perhaps stderr while i m at it filehandles so that future calls to printf or putchar or puts will go to a file and future calls to getc and such will come from a file

584871
inherited	subclassing
i presently only have two subclassing types circularholepattern and singlelineholepattern that inherited from holepattern but i expect to have more as my app grows

584887
setinterval	settimeout
using settimeout or setinterval as proposed by some of the others here works around this by returning flow control to the browser and requesting it to call you back in a specified number of milliseconds

584890
yslow	pagespeed
in my testing so far google s pagespeed addon is far and above much better than yslow

584904
children	parent
i can find all the children of a given record in a hierarchical data model see code below but i m not sure how to traverse back up the parent child chain with a given child id

584917
subclass	abstract-class
unfortunately microsoft neglected to make many of the bcl objects easily mockable as they tend to use abstract-class and .net classes are closed by design in other words for a method to be overridden by a subclass it needs to be explicitly marked as virtual whereas java is open by design that is a subclass can override any method unless they are marked as final

584917
moq	typemock
typemock isolator may be able to help but i don t believe moq can in this case

584946

then you can get the width and height of the browser with and with jquery and load the appropriate pictures

585091
folder	directory
i want to copy all .xml files from the directory root source including sub folder to root destination

585100
asp.net-mvc	openrasta

585102
mockups	balsamiq
i d still recommend balsamiq mockups

585148
opera	safari
not sure about safari or opera

rss	feed
how would i write the linq query to filter the rss feed to only show items where a certain subchannel matches a specific value eg

585371
for-loop	loops
for example if i read usr share dict words with a for-loop and a while loops and have them sleep when they re done i can use ps to see how much memory the process is consuming

585418
int	boolean
there can be dozens of variables configurable different types boolean int float at least maybe string

585442
hudson	bamboo
i ve administered both bamboo and hudson and i would recommend hudson

585442
hudson	bamboo
and it s statistics hudson for ease of use and third-party support is better regardless of dollar amount it is free bamboo is not

585515
post	get
without sessions i d do something similar to daniels answer catch the original post get in the middleware but i d change the redirect to include the posted info

585515
post	get
for post you can either convert to the get method which works fine for smaller forms but for bigger forms that would make the url too long i d do a repost posting the data to a login form possibly encoded and storing it in a single hidden almost like a .net viewstate actually

postgresql	mysql
mysql vs postgresql is an endless war

585586
width	height
i tried width and height 1px or 0px

postgresql	mysql
as someone who recently switched a project from mysql to postgresql i don t regret the switch

585784
lisp	smalltalk
using images in lisp is very similar to what smalltalk systems do

585786
int	chars
static inline unsigned int foo const chars bar

585807
pascal	delphi
the only time i ve handled a reader for this format was in delphi pascal and it s messy ill-defined difficult to process and tends to have lots of variations such that although i managed to get my reader handling models exported from 3d-max itself just fine it rejected many models from other packages that claimed to be in 3ds format but were not properly formed

585835
translation	localization
these are xml files that can contain texts and images and they have standardized handling of localization translation

585852
hide	show
my idea was to let the tab-buttons link through to #tab1 and #tab2 and then let jquery pick up the #tabx and show hide the relevant tab

585968
jboss	glassfish
i understand that this is not covered by the ejb spec so details of how to do it on either a jboss or glassfish specific manner would be great

585970
width	height
my guess is that blit will automatically use the result of image.size when you don t specify anything else and thus blitting the whole image from 0 0 to width height

586044
dictionary	map
what i m inclined to do is map a dictionary where each element in the dictionary represents a column in the table that way it will be 100 dynamic with regard to adding columns in the database and i would only need to update the mappingfile with which table to use if i m integrating versus a different system

586087
getter	setter
when generating setter and getter in eclipse one of the options is to use the getter and setter within the class rather than accessing the class members directly

586209
scatter	graphing
jfreechart has good scatter bar and line graphing as well as fun ones like pie and dial so maybe it will work for you

586225
squash	branch
you can use whatever workflow you like on your branch merging rebasing squash etc but of course the standard rebasing rules apply don t rebase if anyone else has been basing their changes on your branch

586225
fast-forward	merge
also this won t work if your merge was a fast-forward see the how merge works section of man git-merge for a description of a fast-forward merge so you have to use the --no-ff option when performing the merge

586250
client-side	server-side
edit regarding spawning threads client-side vs server-side

586302
division	addition
besides doing far fewer comparisons it also uses addition rather than division

586326
hide	show
when the next button is clicked hide and undock the previous panel then show and dock the current panel

586331
draggable	droppable
setup which cells are droppable inside your draggable s start event

586378
postgresql	mysql
since it uses mysql or postgresql you can update your dns on the fly with php or just about anything else

586382
post	get
asp.net v1.1 accepts by default http get http post or http soap

586382
post	get
using jquery you are mainly going to go to http get or http post

586386
cdr	cons
cons + x car excl cons x cdr excl

586403
folder	directory
i was looking to do the same thing but it did not work so i decided to do the opposite as you know the web.config can be inherited so i pointed iis to a folder containing the client config connection string file path etc files and the website files i put them on a virtual directory with the rest of the webconfig where it load dll and other application files needed

586425
folder	directory
example code is in the com folder of the install directory

586490
stdout	stderr
remember that stdin stdout and stderr are file descriptors 0 1 and 2 for every newly created process

586492
xsl-fo	xslt
it s also possible to automate pdf creation for large sets of documents by converting them to xml and using xslt and xsl-fo

586547
mouse	keyboard
i m looking for some code preferably c# that will prevent keyboard and mouse input

586565
bmp	png	png	ico
by the way all icons come in png ico bmp format and a conversion utility

586569
swt	swing
i m relatively new to swt programming former swing programmer but encountered similar situations in which the layout wasn t properly updated

586609
min	max
inside the loop i mask some bits of the integer and then find the min and max values

586647
acrobat	indesign
changing a pdf is much more difficult than generating it so you need to use a pdf editor like nitro pdf untested or why not acrobat illustrator indesign

586721
debian	linux
since you expressed interest in rsync here s an article that covers how to make a bootable backup image via rsync for debian linux

586737
mouse	keyboard
have a look at this article processing global mouse and keyboard hooks in c# a

586755
inherited	properties
as the page properties is inherited from usercontrol i don t see how this can easily be done

586757
getter	setter
if you convert the name property to a field remove the getter setter the databinding will stop working

586760
cpu	processors
although it is true that sse is specific to some processors sse may be relatively safe sse2 much less in my experience you can detect the cpu at runtime and load the code dynamically depending on the target cpu

586834
postgresql	mysql
i had mentioned that in our rails application all select queries dropped below 100ms after switching to postgresql whereas some of the complex joins generated by activerecord would occasionally take as much as 15s or more with mysql 5.1 because of nested loops with inner table scans even when indices were available

586888
instances	transient
object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing

586896
udp	tcp
a port is part of socket end point in tcp and udp

586896
udp	tcp
they allow the operating system to distinguish which tcp or udp service on the host should receive incoming messages

586899
width	height
then simply offset your contained postcard 50 of its width height back

586900
opera	firefox
however none of the images are loaded and instead alt text are displayed in firefox ie and opera

586911
width	height
your putimagedata call is trying to draw the entirety of imgd which you created to be the canvas s width and height into the canvas with top left corner at j i

586915
udp	tcp
in ip terms a protocol number is the value assigned to the layer 4 protocol carried within ip 6 for tcp 17 for udp as often found in the etc protocols file on most unix systems

586915
udp	tcp
a port number is used within the udp and tcp headers to represent different higher level protocols carried within those protocols 25 for smtp 80 for http etc per etc services

586919
put	get
how do i parse it so i can get the out put like this

586988
button	checkbox
on the other hand if the options themselves differ by only a few words and lose meaning if they are truncated a list of options like peanut butter and grape jelly sandwich with carrot sticks and soy milk and peanut butter and boysenberry jelly sandwith with carrot sticks and 2 milk maybe you would be better served by displaying all the options sequentially accompanied by a checkbox or radio button as appropriate

587026
openbsd	linux
looking at man 3 printf on linux os x and openbsd all show support for z for size_t and t for ptrdiff_t for c99 but none of those mention off_t

587084
min	max
to get the max min visible latlong s you could call the dopixeltoll method for each corner of the map

587159
.nettiers	codesmith
i have used .nettiers codesmith at work and really enjoy the speed with which code generation gives you a clean working data access layer

587207
inherited	properties
if you make the classa.securitykey properties also shared that would make a little more sense but then the inherited relationship is no longer important

587207
inherited	properties
you might just as well say classa.securitykey inside that method because you would have to already know about classa to know about it s inherited properties anyway

587207
inherited	properties
if you make classb.dowork as an instance method rather than a shared method you can use the mybase keyword in vb.net to reference the inherited classa properties even if classb overloads or shadows it

587249
width	height
also note that you can position and size your controls even if the top left width and height properties don t necessarily come up in intellisense.

587270
datalist	repeater
if you re not using paging as mentioned in a comment consider going to a datalist or even a repeater to reduce the overhead of the object itself

587310
system.in	system.out
you also could read and write text to the console by using system.out and system.in

587327
hide	show
just hide one and show the other

587337
tcpclient	networkstream
networkstream of the tcpclient

587354
vim	emacs
for people who don t use emacs or vim i d like to add that you can open excel and use its autofill feature and text concatenation function to generate such code

587369
hash	salt
use a cryptographically secure hash function along with a salt if possible and hash more than once hundreds of times for example

587370
post	get
my post here shows how easy it is to get up and running although you could argue that it is aimed at your specific code it is possible to test perf issues when things like large lists are populated

587385
post	get
i also read here that there are some steps you can do the post and the comments to get outlook to repair or replace the dll

587444
bluetooth	usb
due to interesting race conditions for usb to serial bridges and bluetooth to serial bridges changing the speed is a very tricky problem

587484
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
there s an example that uses fileoutputstream to write an image i m sure there s fileinputstream too

587486
implements	extends
with interfaces you have to implements the combination s functionality yourself except one class you can extends

587501
children	parent
i added the parentid field you have just because i ask the direct children and parent questions a lot and that speeds those up

587532
hide	show
this bit works fine - i m using javascript to show and hide the divs which contain the large images but as the page first loads it starts loading all of the images at the same time

587532
hide	show
ideally i d like to use my current setup - just show and hide divs - and have the hidden divs start loading their contents as soon as the first pane has completed

587623
udp	tcp
as you are probably aware when a tcp udp message is sent on the wire the data being sent is wrapped or prepended with a corresponding tcp udp header

587623
udp	tcp
however if you re using regular sockets to send and receive your data the ip headers as well as the tcp udp headers are stripped off you don t get this information from the socket

587623
udp	tcp
use the ip and tcp udp headers to filter the data based on your client and server sockets ip addresses and port numbers

587663
postgresql	mysql
when i made the migration from mysql to postgresql several things really got in my way

587672
folder	directory
3 builds the code in the default directory which is the precompiledweb folder its a web app

587678
post	get
however when i post back the whole page i get an error about the state information is invalid for this page and might be corrupted.

587695
getter	setter
there s alot of talk about getter and setter being evil and what not

587718
getter	setter
i don t believe that that is what is meant when people talk about getter and setter because this is not simply setting a member to the given value

587718
getter	setter
i don t care for setter and getter but mostly because i think of my objects as higher-level entities in the codebase

587718
getter	setter
this allows much more centralized handling of exceptional conditions than the getter setter example i gave above

587757
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
for example if an exception breakpoint for runtimeexception is configured to suspend on subclasses it will also be triggered by a nullpointerexception

587774
getter	setter
if you have getter and setter for all fields and everybody and his dog have access to the object then that is very bad as there is essentially no encapsulation of the data

587775
accessor	properties	getter	setter
setter and getter are generally accessor methods for private variables properties

587787
3des	aes
i know asp.net 1.0 used 3des but newer versions generally use aes by default

587849
stdout	stderr
either freopen stdout and stderr with con or do the other linker compile workarounds there

587850
width	height
to check out the results add to the img tag with width and height set appropriately if necessary

587874
openbsd	linux
my only recommendations are go for a unix-y server linux usually but openbsd is very light and easy to manange

587885
hide	show
you can create your own alert component subclassing titlewindow and then use popupmanager to show hide them

587887
versioning	upgrade
note that this was working in versioning 1.2.6 and represents a possible upgrade issue

587918
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
file downloads done right have some links that describe how to do it for apache lighttpd mod_secdownload security via url generation nginx

587922
postgresql	mysql
i dunno how mysql does vacuum s innodb tables innodb is mvcc like postgresql and so needs to clean up .

587933
inherited	properties
we just inherited mycontrols.hellocontrol and set the name properties and it looks like we re done

587979
treeview	expander
i m noticing that sometimes frame and form units which normally have an associated dfm file do not always show the dfm file underneath accessible via the little + treeview node expander underneath them

587981
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
so let s say i have a site and i do not have a crossdomain.xml or clientaccesspolicy.xml on it

588036
disk	ram
even in 64bit systems though you re not going to have a lot of control over what portions of your program actually sit in ram in cache or are paged to disk at least in most instances since the os and the mmu handle this themselves

588085
telerik	radwindow
i have a strange issue with a telerik radwindow that only occurs in ie8

588088
hash	md5
i take the raw tex and run it through the md5 function then i insert the hash into the database along with the current timestamp and use the hash .png as the filename

588089
firefox	safari
this works fine on ie firefox and safari

588099
int	chars
if you take a number in int form it will be smaller than the same number in chars string form

588104
int	chars
joining on a chars or var chars will normally have an overhead as opposed to joining on an int

588104
int	chars
each chars is represented by 8 bits a 10 chars value is thus 80 bits long compared to 32 bits for an int

588109
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome are flawless

588122
width	height
you need to specify an exact width and height with overflow hidden if you want your div to clip your image

588139
int	chars
an int is 4 bytes wide - so any chars value larger than 4 bytes requires more disk i o cache space etc

588160
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr to stdout

588187
width	height
for 6 frame strip the image will have a width of 6 16 and height as 16 pixels

588226
post	put
i did see this post about url debugging but i don t think that helps because although i m writing a debugging console i want the runtime values and don t want to put in an extra layer of abstraction

588253
apache	lighttpd
apache process or lighttpd for

588267
mockito	easymock
i dumped easymock because it wasn t easy and went for mockito

588269
ironruby	ironpython
in addition to being free they are also a good way to get support for lesser-known clr dlr languages like boo ironpython and ironruby

588275
put	get
type p4 user to see your user configuration and then under reviews put the filespec of the area in depot where you d like to get notified on a check-in as in

588373
vpn	lan
i would like to port forward 8080 tcp from the vpn ip interface into my internal lan 10.0.0.50 80

588381
freebsd	linux
freebsd for example is based off the ports system where you compile from scratch although there are binary packages pre-built for much of it whereas it s often the case in mainstream linux distributions that you ll find a completely pre-prepared binary package for something popular

588445
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
what it basically does is getting some data from connected another device and send that data to the server periodically using nsurlconnection and read data from the server periodically and visualize that data as a graph using nsxmlparser

588457
crypt	hash
you can do this easily enough with a sha-1 hash and a secret or you can use full-fledged cryptographic providers available on your platform or in java if using java. you do not need to crypt it as long as no secret information is stored inside

588496
3des	aes
another solution is to send the password between your programs encrypted with something like 3des or aes

588599
superclass	subclassing
you need to invoke the overloaded method on the subclassing not the superclass

588599
superclass	subclassing
can you instead write handleevent methods for the specific event subclassing without having a handler for the event superclass

588622
conio	ncurses
i would like the answers to be cross platform if possible but i realize i will probably need conio or ncurses

588683
codeigniter	cakephp
third magento mvc is very different from the ruby on rails django codeigniter cakephp etc

588712
versioning	upgrade
not only does it break all precompiled binaries making it unnecessarily difficult to use precompiled binaries if you happen to work for a software company that makes use of third party proprietary libraries then whenever they upgrade to the latest versioning of visual studios - your company must now do the same thing or the code will no longer run

588715
perforce	svn
while leaving the live server on you start your import from svn to perforce using the backup

588715
perforce	svn
this is especially helpful if your migration is over large geographic distances svn and perforce servers are far apart because the large part of your import is done locally possibly on the same machine instead of over the internet

588718
svg	vml
i don t need the vml ie support in raphael or the plotting abilities of jquery svg

588721
google-chrome	firefox
other modern browsers like firefox and google-chrome provide better support

588726
gif	png
one thought i had was to write the list to an html table with the punjabi converted into a gif or png file

588729
typedef	struct
although it s probably a lot more complicated than this in the standard you can think of it as the compiler knowing about struct cell on the first line of the typedef but not knowing about tcell until the last line - that s how i remember that rule

588745
boost	stl
particularly useful is the algorithms header which you can probably begin using immediately without many problems with legacy code. if you re writing a lot of new code it s far better to use the stl and boost if you can than to write your own utility classes and algorithms

588753
cpython	ironpython
for ironpython 1.1 support whose syntax mirrors cpython 2.4 i successfully built and installed the sample from the visual studio 2008 sdk 1.0 with the professional edition of visual studio 2008 sp1

588753
cpython	ironpython
for ironpython 2.0 whose syntax mirrors cpython 2.5 there is currently no good way to write and debug under visual studio 2008 and unfortunately it would be a significant undertaking to adapt ironpython studio to host ironpython 2.0--one of the big updates in ironpython 2.0 was to base it on the dynamic language runtime and this breaks the tricks for enabling intellisense that were used previously such as static compilation

588773
folder	directory
put all of the files that you obtained into the lib site-packages simplejson folder under your ironpython installation directory

588784
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this should do the trick tested in ie7 firefox google-chrome safari

588800
ftp	telnet
or perhaps read up on something simpler like the ftp daemon ssh daemon telnet daemon

588813
post	get
the important thing is what is encrypted in you cookie post get parameter and how is it encrypted and checked on the server side

588820
inherited	properties
set up your data layer to inherited from a base class which contains 4 properties for those values

588823
post	get
so as others have said post and cookies and get data query strings are all easy to spoof since they re all just text in the same http packet

588834
actionscript	mxml
the thing to remember when using actionscript instead of mxml is that the style properties are not accessed as properties on the object but through the getstyle propertyname method

588835
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	linux	gentoo	debian
on linux systems the system s package manager portage for gentoo aptitude for ubuntu debian yum for fedora etc. usually takes care of installing the program including placing init scripts in the right places

588874
clang	llvm
it s not a 100 solution but the llvm clang static analyzer can be a big help in tracking down incorrect manual memory management usage

588874
clang	llvm
you can find the llvm clang static analyzer here llvm clang static analyzer

588880
width	height
i set height and width on the user control works on drop

588880
width	height
should i be using explicit height and width to get it all started

588890
profiling	debugging
you can verify the actual query that was run using sql profiling which is very handy for debugging these sorts of things

588891
stdout	stderr
stdout and stderr

588904
daemons	systemd
to answer one part of your question there are no tools i know of that will do daemons setup portably even across linux systemd let alone windows or mac os x

588922
accessor	properties
by default properties accessor are atomic

588938
tabcontrol	expander
when i place this control on a tabcontrol page or expander control it appears as if data binding only occurs when the control becomes visible for the first time therefore i never receive any of the routed events until i swap to the tab the control is on or expand the expander

588963
width	height
this is done by setting the height width of a control to double.nan which essentially says i have no specific size

588997
width	height
that way we can see that we re taking the average of n samples of f x to get an average height of the function then multiplying by the width x2-x1

589079
ant	maven
if you wanted to get really fancy you could use the maven ant plugin to call the task that can send emails

589080
mouseover	mouseout
events are attached on mouseover and mouseout to switch the css class

589085
mouseover	mouseout
css menus can also take advantage of the hover property on the anchor tag which will work in the same fashion as a mouseover mouseout event

589092
unix	bsd
bsd and unix don t present or handle their system calls in the same way linux does

589141
implements	extends
the game has a custom haxcanvas class which extends gamecanvas and implements runnable

589213
nunit	mstest
do automated web acceptance tests using watin or selenium - this would still be written in your testing framework of choice mstest nunit etc

589239
udp	tcp
if you google and find some tutorials on ethernet in general the structure of packets how tcp and udp data gets from point a to point b etc then the information wireshark presents will make sense naturally

589281
width	height
just retrieve the current pixel height width of the monitor you re on.

589281
width	height
when you get within say 25 pixels or so of an edge your main form s location.left + form width or height your main form s location.top + form height then go ahead and set the .left and .top properties so that your application docks in the corners

589282
stdout	stderr
you re not making a call when you use popen you re running an executable and talking to it over stdin stdout and stderr

589289
versioning	upgrade
if you ever outgrow their ad-sponsored services you can upgrade to a premium versioning that doesn t include ads

589312
stdout	stderr
of course you should check stderr too or else ask popen to merge it with stdout

589312
stdout	stderr
update after looking at the related questions answers it looks like it might be simpler to just use python s built-in select module to see if there s data to read on stdout you should also do the same for stderr of course

589313
post	get
also response.redirect works better than a postback since that causes a get rather than a post

589326
hid	keyboard
granted you ll need a barcode scanner that supports the usb hid pos and isn t just a keyboard wedge

589362
keydown	keyup
otherwise in keydown keyup events set the e.handled property to true which will tell the box that you want to handle the input yourself and don t want the message to filter down

589363
implements	extends
you can extends httpservlet and implements runnable

589392
clang	llvm
it is specified only by the absence of nonatomic -- atomic was added as a keyword in recent versions of llvm clang

589392
getter	setter
if you are writing your own setter getter atomic nonatomic retain assign copy are merely advisory

589392
getter	setter
with atomic the synthesized setter getter will ensure that a whole value is always returned from the getter or set by the setter regardless of setter activity on any other thread

589392
getter	setter
that is if thread a is in the middle of the getter while thread b calls the setter an actual viable value -- an autoreleased object most likely -- will be returned to the caller in a

589392
getter	setter
if thread a is calling the getter simultaneously with thread b and c calling the setter with different values thread a may get any one of the three values returned -- the one prior to any setter being called or either of the values passed into the setter in b and c

589437
interbase	firebird	postgresql	mysql
you can choose between sdac for direct access to sql server or unidac direct access to sql server oracle mysql postgresql and interbase firebird

589471
children	parent
this will enumerate the tree in a breadth first fashion it will yield the parent element first then it s children and then the children of those children

589501
width	height
the div is created by setting its x y coordinates and height and width

589503
vb.net	vb6
in the middle of converting vb6 code to vb.net i need to replace the following code that intends to close all open forms remaining in the application

589520
post	get
i won t list the configuration in the web.config to keep this long message short but i can post it if anybody thinks they can use it - i just want to stress that i can call a method and get a result - string or even a json object i can read from as long as i don t pass any data to the wcf service

589546
rss	feed
i have a php script which parses an rss feed and outputs the top 2 news items

589575
16-bit	64bit
i know that it depends on the architecture 16-bit 32 bits 64bit and the compiler

589575
int	chars	int	double
i tried to find without much success reliable information stating the sizes of chars short int long double float and other types i didn t think of under different architectures and compilers

589586
integer	unsigned
you can expect std size_t to always represent the unsigned native integer size on current architecture

589586
16-bit	64bit
16-bit 32-bit or 64bit

589586
int	chars
there are five standard signed int types signed chars short int int long int and long long int

589586
unsigned	short	int	chars
for each of the standard signed int types there exists a corresponding but different standard unsigned int type unsigned chars unsigned short int unsigned int unsigned long int and unsigned long long int each of which occupies the same amount of storage and has the same alignment requirements

589589
getter	setter
make it private name it perfectly and give getter and setter public

589591
children	parent
if you want to get the parent along with whether all its children are active

589618
filtering	grouping
for my purposes i predict that most nodes are visible to most users so i feel that it is acceptable to simply to make the grouping by use the index as the filtering doesn t need it so badly

589619
firefox	safari
jquery takes a lot of the pain out of coding for the incompatibilities and quirks between ie firefox and safari

589625
integer	unsigned
if you need fixed size types use types like uint32_t unsigned integer 32 bits defined in stdint.h

589664
put	get
then when i put this code into my cvs clearcase i notice that these files get hijacked when a call is made to my service

589684
range	minimum
the c++ standard does not specify the size of integral types in bytes but it specifies minimum range they must be able to hold

589684
range	minimum
you can infer minimum size in bits from the required range

589684
range	minimum
minimum range required by the standard page 22 are

589684
unsigned	short
unsigned short 0 to 65535

589685
int	chars
that meant iirc that sizeof int was also 1 because both chars and int were 32-bit

589698
google-chrome	firefox
this is working well in google-chrome ie but causes a problem in firefox when i right click on an element my function that handles the left click is surprisingly called and then my function that handles the right click is called

589709
cobertura	emma
for code coverage i use cobertura but emma works too emma had an annoyance that cobertura didn t have.

589727
pdfbox	jpedal
pdfbox and jpedal also offer text extraction methods

589728
accurev	plasticscm	perforce	plasticscm	perforce	accurev
try accurev www.accurev.com or perforce www.perforce.com or plasticscm www.plasticscm.com

589836
free	malloc
i decided to try it out myself and it looked like all i had to do was change a few malloc statements to new statments and replace free with delete

589841
daemons	systemd
i know that ubuntu and fedora uses upstart istead of the classical systemd v init daemons sysvinit

589857
free	malloc
the last line could also be some error with your imagedata but since you said it worked in c and you only replaced malloc free with new delete it s unlikely that something is wrong there anyway you should check this too

589866
puts	gets
if the compression puts a heavy load on the server and or the compression ratio is poor a 20k page gets compressed to 19k then i would consider switching it off

589909
getter	setter
for a bean it is expected to have getter setter for all member variables

589968
serializable	deserialization	getter	setter
this is a good approach for me because it means i can call my getter and setter with the type and token methods during serializable deserialization

589976
accessor	properties
the dataset tables properties also got an accessor by string instead of int

589988
serializable	deserialization
the following url shows examples of serializable deserialization of json in c# by scott gu and the .net 3.5 framework

589988
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization

589990
getter	setter
so you can say x name or name and they will both be accessing the getter setter from the frameworkelement

590006
wordpress	joomla
i ve used wordpress and joomla to build a couple of small websites and done some hacking about to get them running exactly as i want

590006
wordpress	joomla
more bonus points if it provides an easy method to import data from joomla and or wordpress

590020
int	double
numeric types int decimal double byte 0

590044
postgresql	mysql
all major database engines that is oracle ms sql postgresql and mysql should should in theory support sql-92

590051
unsigned	short	integer	unsigned
the integral value types byte 1-byte unsigned integer short 2-byte signed integer integer 4-byte signed integer and long 8-byte signed integer

590060
subtraction	multiplication
you can solve this with a program exactly the same way you solve it by hand with multiplication and subtraction then feeding results back into the equations

590060
multiplying	subtract
they are the same equation multiplied by two so you cannot get a solution from them - multiplying the first by two then subtract leaves you with the true but useless statement

590070
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
thanks to web standards all the other browsers you might want to target ie7+ firefox2+ opera safari google-chrome konqueror are generally close enough to intercompatibility that you will rarely need to do much browser detection

590074
unix	bsd	unix	solaris	solaris	bsd
most unix like platforms support the posix api some more some less and if you limit yourself to posix functions the solution will work in linux bsd mac os x solaris and similar oses

590107
postgresql	mysql
you will find that some database store datatypes differently for example mysql stores booleans as 1 and 0 and postgresql stores them as t and f

590108
postgresql	mysql
as for dbs popular with php it not that hard make sql portable between mysql sqlite and postgresql

590119
onmousedown	onmouseup	onclick	onmouseup	onclick	onmousedown
how can i get the id of a html control just by specifying the coordinates of a triggered event like onmousedown onmouseup onclick etc..

590129
wordpress	joomla
it has a lot of plugins support towards wordpress joomla and whatever you need

590147
postgresql	mysql
you don t mention which database you are using so here is a link about information_schema support in mysql postgresql and mssql oracle etc

590148
actionscript	mxml
edit if you re writing the class in actionscript instead of mxml you can apply the metadata tag directly to your class

590216
cpython	ironpython
one of the pros of ironpython is that unlike cpython ironpython doesn t use the global interpreter lock thus making threading more effective

590231
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
i d like to guarantee that these variables get overridden assigned something useful in the subclassing that inherited from this superclass at compile time

590300
rss	feed
personally i would install db first - the reason is that if you install db second the default feed for the start page is set to the sql teams rss feed and not the msdn one

590309
firefox	safari
i m doing something similar dragging from the parent doc to drop targets in the iframe and can see the onmouseover events fire for the targets in ie and firefox but not safari

590317
128bit	64bit
for example you can take advantage of the new 64bit general-purpose registers r8-r15 and new floating point and 128bit sse sse2 floating point registers xmm8-xmm15

590324
hide	show
but if you want to show only accordion heads then hide only contents dd or div or whatever did you use with display none

590345
opera	firefox
the page looks the same to me in firefox 3.0.6 and opera 9.62

590395
folder	directory
under the c users user appdata directory if found the folder that sql express was using and deleted them

590405
superclass	subclassing
the thing i want to do is to create a static method on a superclass so the subclassing can be converted to xml

590410
int	double
some improvements operations with double on 64 bits compute equally fast as floats on 32 bits as well as operations on long at 64 bit compared to int

590412
cpython	ironpython
while there was some consideration the official stance as far as i know is that cpython is not only a python implementation but it s meant as a reference implementation and it won t include stackless functionality because it can t be implemented by jython or ironpython

590480
bgp	ospf
our ospf implementation made use of red-black trees our bgp implementation made use of skiplists

590493
mp3	flv
as we re about to start planning an application that will handle media files mp3 flv pdf images i m thinking about how to handle the file storage

590517
tunnel	packets
and yes it uses head and not get but do note some not http standard servers send different results for head and for get the python environment zope is a typical culprit. also in some case network problems for instance tunnel + broken firewalls which block icmp prevent big packets to get through so head works and not get.

590526
fortify	veracode
you may want to check out veracode and fortify contrasting styles that automate the process

590527
outputstream	inputstream
the easiest way is to replace the inputstream outputstream from a socket in one of the programs with a proxy implementation that either prints logs or tees to the original and a print log stream

590535
mp3	flv
when storing mp3 flv and pdf files subversion might not be the optimal solution

590546
width	height
protected void layout int width int height

590602
width	height
jquery has height en width functions that returns the height or width in pixels as integer.

590620
httphandler	httpmodule
we have a performance measurement module that relies on httpmodule and httphandler and works like this

590634
put	get	post	put	post	get
it is suitable for performing basic http requests and interacting with rest-based services get post put delete

590686
margin	height
compare outer and inner height widths to get the total margin and padding

590692
jnetpcap	libpcap	winpcap	jnetpcap	winpcap	libpcap
jnetpcap - wrapper around the native libpcap winpcap libraries exposing all of their functions and structures

590698
serializable	deserialization
so in essence as long as you know the proper type upon deserialization then the serializable of the proper type is trivial

590755
post	put
problem was solved i put the connection in the service config file however all post were helpful

590782
cpython	ironpython
feature lag since cpython is the reference python implementation it has the latest and greatest python features whereas ironpython necessarily lags behind

590785
builtin	isinstance
i don t work with django but it looks like you want the isinstance obj type builtin python method

590867
versioning	upgrade
the last versioning of wordpress 2.7 branch have auto update for core and plugins making it really easy to upgrade when a fix is available

590886
boost	stl
the only argument for increasing productivity with stl i can think of would be a possibility of integrating other libraries easily - boost arabica soci etc

590974
sqldatasource	detailsview
i am trying to use stored proc to insert record using detailsview and sqldatasource

590974
sqldatasource	detailsview
what i dont understand how the input parameter interacts between sqldatasource detailsview etc

590990
debian	centos
this is probably going to be platform and version dependent but on the platforms i use centos debian top normally displays the last part of the command run as the id

591046
subtraction	addition
i have implemented addition succesfully and i thought that subtraction was just a special case of it but it seems i am making a mistake somewhere

591058
cos	sin
to verify if theta 0 this leaves the coordinates unchanged otherwise if xc yc 0 it maps 1 0 to cos theta sin theta and 0 1 to -sin theta cos theta

591099
rss	feed
is there a ruby class or project that processes rss atom feed and keeps a track of the items i have already processed

591147
pop-up	dialog
if a rich modal pop-up is really what you want though you can use jquery s dialog feature and put whatever you want in there

591176
serializable	deserialization
no time to work through this in detail right now you might have a look around google or so using the words serializable and deserialization

591202
daemon	cron	jobs	cron
another process either from a cron or running as a daemon executes the jobs as they show up

591265
subtraction	addition
if your addition code is correct and your subtraction isn t the problem is presumably in the two s complement and addition

591265
subtraction	addition
it seems possible to me that the handling of the hidden bit is proper for addition but not subtraction

591271
min	max
my guess from what you describe is that your hotspot will probably be branch prediction failures resulting from min max calculations using if else

591271
min	max
therefore using simd intrinsics should allow you to use the min max instructions however it might be worth just trying to use a branchless min max caluculation instead

591276
int	boolean
the best way is to choose a random generator that specifically emits boolean or int with range

591291
versioning	upgrade
however the problem doesn t arise on my own machine when i upgrade the same windows versioning to 4gb of ram

591314
awt	swing
the first obvious thing to always say is confine usage of swing components to the awt event dispatch thread edt

591322
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
throws illegalargumentexception instead of nullpointerexception

591323
post	get
i suggest you break the rest of your question down maybe post separate questions - you ll need to be a bit more specific to get many usable answers

591342
caanimation	calayer
my next step was to look into using calayer and caanimation to do it but after a quick glance at the docs they don t seem to indicate that it s meant for animating between images note i m not changing position or anything else just images

591345
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
for example if an exception breakpoint for runtimeexception is configured to suspend on subclasses it will also be triggered by a nullpointerexception

591361
disk	ram
i talked them into setting up a read-only database with de-normalized r o data and setup sql server running on a desktop machine cost around 2500 for the hardware and the 2500 off-the-shelf desktop pc blew away by a magnitude of 10x the performance of massive compaq quad processing server with gobs of ram and gobs of disk trying to serve the oltp batch processing and reporting needs of the unit

591389
floating-point	integer
if the integer rng produces 0 1 2 and 3 the floating-point equivalent will be 0.0 0.25 0.5 and 0.75 so the answer is to test 0.5

591441
put	get
if you put a bit more work into the modelbinder you could get it to work with the binder being globally registered - but the implementation i gave you above should work for cherry-picking values out when needed

591470
put	get
the get and put principle in section 2.4 is a real gem from java generics and collections

591470
put	get
the get and put principle use an

591470
put	get
when you both get and put

591538
unix	solaris
can t reproduce easy in test environment but in commercial env under unix solaris the core occurs but libumem shows nothing bad

591591
handwriting	icr
for handwriting you have the icr module

591600
inherited	properties
turns out it does have an enabled properties inherited from control

591644
int	chars
the issue comes when you use the value types like int chars or float

591674
folder	directory
on your web server the folder you copied your files into needs to be set up as an application or a virtual directory

591727
kde	gnome
if you re using a desktop environment like kde or gnome i d check the alt+f2 launching apps gnome-open is the one for gnome i don t know the name of the kde app and see if you can pass them the command to launch as an argument

591727
daemons	launchd
also if your intention is to launchd a daemons you should check the nohup documentation

591759
public	protected
essentially you make a wrapper class that exposes the private protected methods of the class under test via equivalent public methods pass an instance of the class under test to the wrapper and then use reflection from the wrapper class to invoke the private protected method on the class under test

591810
subtraction	addition	int	boolean
if you re looking at only int boolean and i think longs you have some options for atomic reads writes and addition subtraction

591844
disk	ram
it can make much better decisions than a static cache having awareness of ram usage by other programs and the position of the disk write head

591851
prefuse	flare
note that prefuse now has the flare package which uses flash

591861
children	parent
so when your mouse moves out of the parent menu item into its children the parent is still considered having the mouse hovered over it

591862
hide	show
will hide the part you want to show instead of generating the popup on the fly leave a small part already made and hide it in the begining when you need to show unhide and add the information you need to

591900
codeigniter	cakephp
i ve been using codeigniter myself after using cakephp for some time

591904
eruby	erb
as i understand it eruby is like erb - it lets you stick ruby code into html

591949
firefox	safari
the exact same code works great on firefox and safari outside of the iphone but once in the embedded webkit it fails

591950
versioning	upgrade
working out when and how code upgrade work the incantation to get a gen_server to upgrade to the latest versioning of a callback module code load mod sys suspend pid sys change_code pid mod undefined undefined sys resume pid

591960
put	get
just put this running somewhere in your window and associating it with the session guaranteing this is in all pages you get exactly how much time some user was in your page

591965
jqmodal	blockui
looks like both blockui and jqmodal can do this

592008
button	checkbox
does someone knows a way in javascript to download selected files for example i select through checkbox 2 files and then i click on a button in order to download these 2 files choosing the route where i will save the archives

592015
openbsd	linux
it works as expected on linux and openbsd and fails as you describe on os x

592024
post	get
once i clean my code up a bit i will try to post it somewhere where folks can get at it because i m sure this must be a common use case for people migrating existing apps to gwt

592070
put	get
all you need to do to load rails and get access to all your models etc is put require .. .. config environment.rb at the top of your file then you re away

592087
gridview	repeater
probably inelegant but i did this by replacing the gridview with a repeater

592090
tpagecontrol	tpanel
guy had a good idea but it didn t handle child control tpanel tpagecontrol etc

592100
getter	setter
however if you want to perform the formatting in the model you can use wrapper methods for the getter and setter and avoid having to use the value option entirely

592104
profiling	debugging
the debugging book for .net has some info on profiling but it is not very deep

592112
clang	llvm
to add another layer of certainty to this bug i would consider running the llvm clang static analyzer on your code

592112
clang	llvm
the llvm clang static analyzer is a standalone tool that find bugs in c and objective-c programs

592125
vim	emacs
having said all this i find emacs meta keys approach a little uncomfortable and a little daunting plus i have spent a lot of time learning to do things in vim

592125
vim	emacs
and if so has anyone else made this switch or used both vim and emacs and have an opinion about which they prefer and why

592127
gridview	rowdatabound
if that option is undesirable then i recommend that you use the gridview s rowdatabound event to selectively set the row s e.row visible property to false

592231
versioning	upgrade
at work we upgrade a tool when our versioning reaches end of support lifetime

592231
versioning	upgrade
we upgrade to the next-older versioning

592250
post	get
fiddling with http get and post requests to make sure validation is handled properly

592256
freebsd	linux
however some simple benchmarking shows this is dramatically slower than the pid_exists function on unix-based platforms linux os x freebsd where we re using kill pid 0 with a 0 signal to determine if a pid exists

592265
vim	emacs
using emacs doesn t mean you have to stop using vim

592265
vim	emacs
you will always be using the best editor for the job if you re able to choose between vim and emacs

592265
vim	emacs
the only way to know if you like vim or emacs better is to invest time in both so you can make an informed decision

592292
emacs	aquamacs
a very good emacs for mac os x is aquamacs

592319
folder	directory
you might want to at least consider putting them in a new folder in the documents directory

592409
mouse	keyboard
similarly for input we just substituted the event loop that checked for keyboard and mouse events with the corresponding windows event loop

592420
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i am using a javascript called facelift 1.2 in one of my websites and while the script works in safari 3 4b and opera omniweb and firefox it does not in any ie version

592455
pascal	delphi
part delphi 1 part turbo pascal

592479
innodb	myisam
just checked myisam locks innodb doesn t lock

592495
authorization	access-control
on windows you ll have to use the various authorization functions to make an acl access-control list with the proper permissions

592496
put	get	post	put	post	get
ideally i d post to a servlet get the loginid build the user and put it directly into the managed bean

592504
profiling	debugging
i can step through my code line-by-line while debugging and watch sql server profiling for every query executed but i can t figure out where all those sql commands are coming from

592536
filtering	grouping
if there will be null values of theese fields in table that will became an issue to filtering out useless grouping

592562
submit	submission
i solved this with another way using a button rather than a submit and using javascript to check the value before submission

592576
ssl	https
if you d like to read more on flipping over from http to https and vice versa - do take a look at at my writeup on selective ssl -

592592
udp	tcp
it supports tcp and udp alike

592618
firefox	safari
alas css does not support rotating images in any way shape or form unless you count css transforms which are only supported by safari 4 and firefox 3.1

592618
svg	vml
your best bet is to use raphael s image and rotate which should support all semi-modern browsers using svg and most versions of ie using vml

592640
kerberos	ntlm
kerberos is complex to set up and even though it generally is considered faster than ntlm this is only true when you reach a certain limit of simultanious users on your site

592640
kerberos	ntlm
for a low traffic site the huge tokens that kerberos send across the network actually makes it slower than ntlm

592640
kerberos	ntlm	rss	feed
sure there is some functionality that will only work with kerberos rss feed cubes in excel services authentication of web service calls in custom code due to double hops but trust me when i say that ntlm will do a very good job of running your moss also

592655
datagridcomboboxcolumn	datagridtemplatecolumn
but any update to any of my templated columns datagridtemplatecolumn or combobox columns datagridcomboboxcolumn don t work the underlying data source never gets updated

592677
spweb	spsite
it is considered a good practice to always check for null and dispose both your spsite and your spweb explicitly even though spsite arguably will dispose your spweb for you

592716
button	checkbox
using this jquery ui plugin you can customize radio button and or checkbox to look however you want

592722
treeview	tabcontrol
in vs 2008 i am attempting to design a windows form that is similar to a set of property pages but uses a treeview to select the page rather than a tabcontrol

592757
put	get
i am happy to put this text data in the datatable or in the datagridview after binding but i can t see a way to put this text data in either as the column formats for both require numeric data - i get a can t put a string in a decimal error for both

592770
post	get
the get and post values are passed as separate collections

592783
gridex	janus
i ve used the janus gridex for this type of non-standard behaviour

592828
post	put
usually i ll put the actual update fields in the post data with query data used to format the response

592830
opera	firefox
i have tested this on firefox opera and seamonkey

592860
post	get
ie tends to use cached results of ajax calls unless you use post instead of get

592913
put	get
the get and put principle that julien cites is a great answer to this question but i don t think it makes much sense unless you see it in the context of an example. here s my take at an expanded version of the get and put principle for when to use wildcards

592922
background-image	background-color
they define their own background-color but not background-image overriding the color in the body

592932
pull	push
there are only two secure ways that i can think of use svn by way of an ssh tunnel or use svn to pull push via ssl-enabled http via a web server

592936
disk	ram
creates mounts and formats a ram disk

592936
disk	ram
exports the trunk of the repository into the ram disk

592936
disk	ram
calls rsync to upload any changed files from the ram disk to my hosting provider

592936
disk	ram
unmounts the ram disk

592957
background-image	background-color
background-image and background-color are sub-properties of the background property

592957
firefox	safari
css3 allows you to set the opacity of the background using the rgba expression but ie doesn t support this firefox 3 and safari webkit do

592962
filesystems	ntfs
some filesystems offer special functionality that can be used for metadata - like ntfs alternate streams

592963
versioning	upgrade
one of the other good things about the abl is that it is extremely backwards compatible no vb6 nightmares when we upgrade versioning although some may say this backwards compatibility is a fault

592976
configobj	configparser
for the revised question of how to read in configuration parameters i d strongly recommend saving yourself some time and effort and use configparser or my preferred tool configobj

592983
readonly	temporary
i am constrained to what i can do with one sql statement and i have readonly access so i can t create a temporary table or anything

593094
lift	wicket
however i strongly prefer wicket and or lift especially the latter

593147
uiview	subviews
a uiview may not overlap its siblings so i can t make it a subviews of the window

593147
uiview	calayer
should i roll my own progress indicator that animates a calayer instead of a uiview

593160
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
while the sqldatareader is being used the associated sqlconnection is busy serving the sqldatareader and no other operations can be performed on the sqlconnection other than closing it

593174
opensuse	linux
it is on my opensuse 11.1 linux laptop

593184
equals	gethashcode
you should override equals and gethashcode method

593200
uiview	uiwindow	uiview	subviews
uiview objects are arranged within an uiwindow object in a nested hierarchy of subviews

593200
children	parent
parent objects in the view hierarchy are called superviews and children are called subviews

593224
yacc	bison
you can use normal context-free parser generators such as yacc bison to generate regular language parsers even if the atoms are not characters

593253
post	get
it uses post to perform a data-handling process instead of using get

593265
union	distinct
this is probably not relevant but the list values is a list of distinct integers with the property that for a given value of asofdate the union of values over all values of key produces a list of distinct integers

593332
serializable	deserialization
its easy to use and a natural choice for serializable and deserialization of c++ data structures

593345
rss	feed
have you tried using feedity - for creating a custom rss feed from any webpage

593424
asterisk	pbx
asterisk the open source pbx uses the spandsp library to implement faxing

593458
joomla	vbulletin
it s the most popular method among php applications like joomla vbulletin gallery and numerous others

593459
vb.net	vb6
visual studio did all of the necessary service plumbing setup for the framework and i found c# very easy to learn migrating from vb6 vb.net and c

593461
firefox	safari
alas they re not yet present in all released browsers i think the latest betas of safari firefox and ie have support for some of these features but i m not sure which browsers support which apis

593483
onreadystatechange	onload
you can use the onload and onreadystatechange event to understand when the tag is loaded

593487
width	height
you may get 0 for the width and height if the image is not visible

593508
int	double
you are taking two int values and storing it in a double without typecasting.

593531
installshield	orca
it provides invaluable low-level knowledge using visual studio setup projects and orca that applies no matter if you re using wix installshield or any other tool to build msi files

593577
cos	sin	cos	sine
for instance instead of sin a or cos a if your application doesn t necessarily need angles to be very precise maybe you represent angles in 1 256 of a circle and create arrays of floats sine and cosine precalculating the sin and cos of those angles

593591
jqmodal	blockui
i did proof of concept modal dialogs with both jqmodal and blockui and i can say without a doubt that blockui is the thinnest of them

593605
firefox	safari
i m using some asp.net controls in my project especially webcombo grid for inline editing and i face t working good in firefox and ie6 but not in safari throwing exceptions

593733
children	parent
in general i would probably popen a number of communications sessions in the parent before spawning the children

593738
ant	maven
visualvm 1.1.1 is a nice alternative to using netbeans being a standalone app so you don t have to bring a maven ant eclipse project into it s project format

593738
profiling	debugging
run btrace scripts to add run-time profiling debugging advice to your code

593764
switching	screens
screens provides several virtual ttys you can switching between without having to open new ssh telnet etc sessions

593790
affinity	processors	cpu	processors	cpu	affinity
in terms of changing the amount of cpu resources a process can use if you don t mind the granularity of per-core limiting of resources task manager can change the processors affinity of a process

593790
affinity	processors
if the development machine has many cores but the user machine only has one then rather than allowing the process to run on all the available cores set the process processors affinity to only one core

593830
bmp	png
java can display png jpg a some other picture formats but i have to display a bmp file in a jlable by getting the file path

593830
gif	png
imageicon support the typical png gif jpg images

593866
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
the common theme is wsdl.exe sharetypes and svcutil.exe reference

593879
getter	setter
how do i unit test a property with a setter and a getter like surname in the example

593879
getter	setter
writing a test that uses the setter to test the getter and vice versa is not good because if there is a fail i won t know which method to blame

593898
put	get
this will be combined with a bigger query but for now all i need is this to get started i ll try to figure out how to put it all together on my own

593901
put	get
the only problem with that is you can t put in something like hibernate without qualification as you get too many false positives

593903
getter	setter
don s waste your time on writing silly tests for getter and setter

593924
profiling	debugging
the debugging and profiling system of the xdk is also an amazing tool which is not available using xla

593931
boost	stl
stl and boost may seem logical to some and should be part of most but i worked with mfc for years before ever using templates

593932
maple	sage
they mostly use maple and mathematica but most of this work translates to sage

593943
google-chrome	firefox
both work fine in firefox and google-chrome

593945
getter	setter
testing getter and setter is an absolute waste of time unless there is something complex going on behind them....which is rarely the case

593989
getter	setter
if we had setter for name and surname but only a getter for fullname the test could look like this

594019
sorting	filtering
i want to have different sorting and filtering applied on my view

594019
sorting	filtering
i figured that i ll be passing sorting and filtering params through query string

594019
sorting	filtering
i want when user pressed sorting link after he applied some filtering - filtering is not lost so i need a way to combine my params

594027
fgetc	isspace
save the value of fgetc stdin to an int variable then test it to make sure it s a blank using isspace reporting an error if not

594027
int	chars
use an int not a chars because fgetc returns eof at end of file which cannot fit inside a chars

594094
kde	gnome
it could probably be done using a canvas or text box component in a full-screen window on whatever window manager you are using kde or gnome

594127
gridview	sqldatasource
here s a good sample how to easily insert row in gridview with sqldatasource

594246
post	get
you can do that in javascript - give them one class name and get them all into a collection and loop through the collection and then simply post the values using ajax

594264
disk	ram
if the rdbs server has enough ram all the data will be in ram and just saved to disk so as to allow recovery

594391
put	get
my activex control is coded in c++ and i already know how to create properties by implementing hard-coded c++ get and put functions

594428
inherited	properties
i ve tried using the prototype properties and various methods of real inherited but i can t quite get my head around what is going on with ie6

594436
int	double
in this case there is an implicit cast from int to decimal or double - because there is no loss of precision when you do the cast - so the compiler doesn t complain but the value you get is always 0 presumably since trackbar.value is always less than 5000

594444
mouse	keyboard
using the mouse and keyboard rather than watching is what builds muscle memory and ingrained responses

594446
mouseleave	mouseenter
ajax bind functions to the mouseenter mouseleave events of every main cell there you use ajax to get the detail table from the server and display in a positioned preferably on a fixed place or maybe a few pixels to the right of the cursor if it s a small table

594466
int	double
so i asked myself can a double be faster than a int

594500
int	double
about int vs.double may be gpu does faster arithmetic with double then regular cpu but i doubt it does double arithmetic faster then int since int arithmetic is just registers arithmetics

594552
int	double
you could say that adding two int takes this many cycles adding two double takes this many cycles etc

594561
int	chars
if you subtract a from the chars the user enters you ll get an int 0 for a 1 for b etc

594573
google-chrome	safari
unfortunately i don t know enough about integration with safari or google-chrome to help you with your second question

594582
cout	cin
i m taking some c++ tests and they are littered with cin and cout s

594583
multiplying	subtract	int	chars
you convert the chars insertered a b or c to int subtract 70 multiplying it with -1 and display the value in the messagebox

594590
cout	cin
yes as long as console applications exist cout and cin will exist

594601
cout	cin
no such questions are not very relevant but yes people use std cin and std cout all the time

594615
cout	cin
if you only ever write gui or web applications in your career you probably won t have much use for cin and cout

594635
getter	setter
i prefer field access because that way i m not forced to provide getter setter for each property

594665
micro-optimization	benchmarking
and ditto to what daniel said - don t go looking for micro-optimization like this until you have benchmarking your code and discovered that it s worth doing

594670
textchanged	selectedindexchanged
in the first we needed a consistent valuechanged event so that we could easily implement a dirty flag on our forms without a massive switch statement to choose between a textbox s textchanged event or a listbox s selectedindexchanged etc

594670
put	get
all three have the same effect in the end you get a new type of button to put on your forms

594730
inherited	subclassing
if i subclassing it to create a class f for example i want f to use the inherited drawing routines from a but to use the static class-wide path object declared in f

594768
sorting	filtering
your data sounds quite relational and the data stuff has a lot of filtering sorting linking functionality

594778
button	checkbox
checkbox and radio button are

594812
hide	show
i was looking for that as well and i now just got used to using full screen shift+alt+enter which hide a little too much which you seem to think as well but does in fact still show the menus

594821
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this code works 100 ok with firefox and ie7 but google-chrome and safari do not seem to move the focus at all

594822
put	get
overall i think you need to put your foot down and get them to code it right without stifling their creativity

594881
decoder	encoder
one reason you may choose the numeric escape sequences would be if a transport mechanism in between your encoder and the intended decoder is not binary-safe

594881
decoder	encoder
just use utf-8 unless your method of storage or transport between encoder and decoder is not binary-safe

594916
post	get
looks fine to me - except i d probably have thankyou as a view - the register get perhaps uses a different view to register post

594957
min	max
note how the gauges are remarkably similar they all take a scalar value from somewhere and represent it by moving a needle to a position between min and max

594970
post	get
if you can post a url to download the workbook assuming it is not a trade secret you would be more likely to get an accurate answer

595048
apache	lighttpd
apache for dynamic and lighttpd for static content is one typical example

595049
binutils	glibc
also the reason i don t want to use any of the gazillion already build i386 compilers is because i plan on mixing and matching glibc binutils gcc versions depending on my testing needs

595084
haskell	ocaml
my understanding is that haskell ocaml etc

595125
button	checkbox
i have form with button and checkbox

595179
public	protected
but from what i can tell there is no difference between using protected or public modifiers

595179
public	protected
all of this compiles and is valid whether i declare innerfoo protected or public

595179
public	protected
please point me out a case where there s a difference in using protected or public

595186
public	protected
in the example shown the public and protected will have the same effect as they are in the same package

595204
installation	upgrade
upgrade your installation to the latest 8.2.x which right now is 8.2.12

595224
post	get
i ll post an update when i get my hands on something more concrete

595234
pascal	delphi
this applies to many languages including object pascal delphi

595328
folder	directory
i use perl but the same general solution can apply i split the directory into an array of folder then pop off the last element the script then push or for you append on whatever i want and then join them together again and bam

595345
yacc	bison
looks like it shouldn t be too hard to generate a simple parser using yacc and bison and integrate it into your code

595351
cout	cin
i ve worked on many professional applications and we ve not used cin or cout on any of them even for logging debugging

595351
stateless	stateful
one thing i ve learned over the years is that stateless trumps stateful for maintainability

595359
joystick	keyboard	mouse	joystick	mouse	keyboard
simple directmedia layer is a cross-platform multimedia library designed to provide low level access to audio keyboard mouse joystick 3d hardware via opengl and 2d video framebuffer

595365
firefox	safari
iâ m assuming itâ s a windows bug rather than a browser bug since firefox and safari both support it as long as itâ s not on windows

595439
struts	stripes
web client write once any mvc framework will work stripes struts even grails if you are brave rememder to keep it thin..

595443
getter	setter
if the accessors are simple getter setter i d say testing them is wasting your time

595451
accessor	properties
if there s a bug in an accessor and the rest of your unit tests don t catch it indirectly then i d start questioning why that properties is there at all

595455
union	distinct
i would try a distinct query and do a union of the two tables

595461
awt	swing
stick to updating swing components and swing text objects in the awt event dispatch thread edt

595477
getter	setter
when they are not simply generated getter and setter

595505
post	get
i ll edit this post if i get a chance to fiddle a bit with silverlight

595507
getter	setter
i m working in vs2008 and c# and i m looking for a free code generator tool to generate a property with getter and setter as well as the backing private field to go with

595638
udp	tcp
if a few bits were flipped in the ip header during transit and a packet changed course but the ip checksum was still correct the tcp udp stack of the redirected receiver can still know to reject the packet

595649
accessor	properties
everything else is handled by the bindings and kvo systems behind the scenes and by your properties accessor

595649
accessor	properties
you must only change properties of your model objects by their properties or by accessor messages never by direct instance variable access

595660
unix	solaris
on linux and i believe solaris and other unix operating systems java s file.renameto method will overwrite the destination file if it exists but this is not the case under windows

595667
super	extends
it s also super easy to use and super easy to extends

595690
goto	break
break is considered a structured goto and should be used sparingly

595693
for-loop	loops
i would choose for-loop when there is known number maximum number of iterations before loops starts

595694
pop-up	dialog
say you want to pop-up a confirmation dialog before sending an email

595701
tabcontrol	tabitem
i am using tabcontrol and tabitem as navigationpane and navigationpaneitem

595714
loops	while-loop
note that i would still avoid using break in a while-loop however as this can muddle loops condition and make it confusing

595714
loops	while-loop
if you ll allow me to use a foreach loops i consider the code below to be a lot easier to read than its while-loop brother

595729
put	get
coming back to your actual question that of a deep copy you need to get the sub-elements of every element and put them in each element s dictionary

595731
for-loop	arrays
but in your example you want to walk an arrays of bounded length and using a for-loop makes it easy to do that and guard against running off the end

595734
pop-up	dialog
if your users dont read the dialog pop-up and they say ok i might consider asking a second time

595738
qsort	strcmp	qsort	bsearch	bsearch	strcmp
you might also look at the parameters for qsort and bsearch which require compare functions much like strcmp

595741
pop-up	dialog
you can make the pop-up dialog on unload to save form automatically even before the dialog is displayed

595766
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
and it does work fine in firefox but not in ie google-chrome safari opera they return all properties methods of the native array object as undefined using this test

595767
getter	setter
in interest of full disclosure i am one of those people that only adds a setter or getter when it is proven necessary

595768
firefox	safari
been working on this site for some time now works perfectly on mac and pc firefox as well as safari

595771
for-loop	loops
and it s nice to have everything you need to know grokwise about the loops rules in a single line at the top of the for-loop

595792
vim	emacs
the problem is if you want to open the executable in say emacs or vim or whatever it s not a matter of the executable so much as the editor doesn t know any other way to interpret it

595860
goto	break
the thought of not using break since it is just as evil as goto is pretty nonsensical

595863
int	chars
it supports matching of not only strings of chars but also arrays and lists of int and arbitrary objects

595870
persistent	transient
query cache locks are transient and don t persistent for any length of time

595882
post	get
if you are using a get method instace post in the ajax call the problem is the limit o characters you can receive

595899
postgresql	mysql
sqlite supports limit mysql postgresql

595899
informix	interbase	informix	firebird	interbase	firebird
interbase firebird support select first and skip like informix

595905
pop-up	dialog
pop-up suck use a modal dialog instead especially for something as simple as a notification

595930
unsigned	short
well you could pack it all in an unsigned short that s 2 bytes 5 bits for day 5 bits for hour 6 bits for minute .

595930
unsigned	short
edit use unsigned short - not signed short .

595936
hash	salt
my research so far has turned up this which essentially says salt your authentication token hash with the ssl session key.

595959
unsigned	short
6 bits for the minute equals an unsigned short

595966
multiplying	modulo
if you want to get the fields in and out by multiplying adding dividing modulo multiplying together the number of possible values for each field and take log2 of that divide by eigth and round up

595969
division	multiplication
do a bit of multiplication division to convert the values using the following formula as a guide

595969
integer	unsigned
so you need 20 bits minimum to store this value as an unsigned integer

596019
background-color	transparency	background-image	background-color
another way if it s all the same color is to make a background-image in gif that is more and more transparency and set a background-color of your choice

596054
config	ini
i use zend config ini for this and other settings are stored in sql db

596075
getter	setter
and the answer is when you don t need a setter getter for the field

596121
put	get
right now help tickets get put in for issues questions etc and they get assigned to the appropriate person pc tech help desk staff or if it s an application issue they can t solve in the help desk it gets assigned to a developer

596129
filesystems	hfs+
at least on the mac you can re-format the filesystems as hfs+ with case-sensitivity turned on

596129
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if you don t control the developer s environments enough to force them to format with a case-sensitive file system then i think your only options are a pre-commit hook that checks for duplicate case-insensitive comparison obviously file names in the same directory or to modify your project to not use files with the same name and different case in the same directory

596150
children	parent
the element may not have an id and i can t assign it a random one for reasons beyond this so i can t apply my selector to the element s parent and look for children with the same id as mine

596154
allocator	stl
however for nearly all of the stl classes users do have a choice of where things are put in that they can specify an allocator

596154
allocator	stl
here are some details on writing your own stl allocator

596155
getter	setter
when you are binding to a particular field you have to use reflection to find the setter and getter for that field of the personobject

596170
mouse	keyboard
from a physical point of view he is comfortable with a keyboard mouse and can put together lego sets with relative ease so following directions with a fun outcome works for him

596171
width	height
maybe put a canvas inside another canvas and set it to 100 width and height to fill the outer canvas and give the inner canvas a max height and width

596178
rsa	aes
most of our applications are a good fit for 112 bits of security so that corresponds to triple-des or a small bump up to 128-bit aes for symmetric ciphers and a 2048-bit key for rsa

596187
width	height
each image can have different width and height and there are different formats ranging from black and white 1 bit per pixel over 2 4 2 8 2 16 2 24 or even 2 32 gray values or colours

596187
width	height
and of course it is much easier to simply create a tbitmap and assign its width height and pixel format

596209
ready	each
each one of those systems in turn has a redundant pair of systems ready to take over if both fail

596298
put	get
so my solution sort of sucks in that regard but it s kind of nice being able to use carray for a lot of different scenarios and it turns things like stringlists and datasets into things you can put a watch on and check for when you get to a specific value

596302
put	get
whether you put it on the second server or not what cf could do if you can get away with it you could put report requests into a queue and email them to the users as they get processed

596327
gentoo	linux
i run the synergy server on my mac and the client on both a vista machine and a gnu linux gentoo box

596389
activemq	rabbitmq
activemq rabbitmq and it s publisher consumer system is something i m looking for

596477
allocator	stl
i had an interview once where a programmer was testing my knowledge of the stl which i used extensively and was trying to get me to answer that a custom allocator was needed

596507
superclass	subclassing
if you extends a class and add a couple of innocuous methods to it then check to see whether some object of the subclassing is equal to an object of the superclass even if the objects are equal in all important aspects you will get the surprising answer that they aren t equal

596507
superclass	subclassing
if you put a member of the superclass in a hash table as the key and then look it up using a subclassing instance you won t find it because they are not equal

596528
firefox	safari
i have not noticed any real issue with it being displayed in firefox or safari

596593
ienumerable	idictionary
microsoft.jscript.jsobject implements ienumerable but not idictionary

596593
ienumerable	idictionary
if i create a .asmx in jscript.net when i try to return a jsobject it gets serialized as an array because it implements ienumerable but not idictionary which means that only the property names in the object get serialized

596603
children	parent
element s parent and look for children

596645
updatepanel	onclientclick
clarification i can t call the js from onclientclick event because the page is inside of the updatepanel and i only want the js to execute when ajax request ends and it was triggered by one particular button on the page

596746
maven	cobertura
i ve got some projects that are already doing site generation via maven and i want to integrate cobertura reports in them but no maven goal i seem to run will generate a local preview for me to look at that includes the cobertura reports in the site

596746
maven	cobertura
below is what i ve added to the maven poms parent and module but the site i see when i run mvn site run does not include the cobertura reports

596764
pop-up	dialog
the pop-up is working well but after dragging it to a different location then clicking the test partial postback the dialog is recentered to its default location

596828
superclass	subclassing
the latter essentially implies that no subclassing must extend the superclass s state but can only add functionality or fields that are irrelevant for the object s state and behavior such as transient or static fields

596828
superclass	subclassing
implementations using getclass do not allow comparison of sub- with superclass objects not even when the subclassing does not add any fields and would not even want to override equals

596829
folder	directory
when the command is called the destination folder files are wiped and replaced with the result of the new build assembly file are created as well as some marker files .as my website is getting bigger and bigger i have to transfer to the server all the assemblies in my bin directory and keep in mind which other files i may have modified

596832
hide	show
there is a jquery onchange event that fires and generates the list for step 2 and hide the step1 div and show the step2 div

596832
hide	show
there is a jquery onchange event that fires and generates the list for step 3 and hide the step2 div and show the step3 div

596872
ubuntu	linux
ruby 1.9.1p0 jruby 1.2.0 ubuntu linux

596952
fiddler	charles
charles and fiddler are http proxies that can throttle your speed among other things

596988
pylons	turbogears	django	turbogears
if you go further you might come to pylons or turbogears or django after that maybe zope but it grows bigger and maybe the pain as well as you always buy into the opinions of that framework

596994
avr	microcontroller
i haven t used myself but bascom is quite popular for avr microcontroller

597073
google-chrome	safari
it works on all other browsers i ve tested osx windows google-chrome safari ie7.

597138
x86	64bit
vs.net is extremely unhelpful in this case if you add a c++ library and c# library to the same solution and the c# and c++ libraries have both 32 and 64bit targets your solution will contain an any cpu target a mixed platforms target a x64 target a x86 target which is what c# calls 32-bit a win32 target which is what c++ calls 32-bit and maybe more

597140
vim	emacs
of course the emacs crowd says the same thing regarding emacs-style thinking but i gave up on learning emacs because vim was simpler and did the job for me

597152
vim	textmate
i m personally a very happy textmate user now after years of using vim gvim

597152
vim	emacs
if you do nothing else learn the basic navigation controls for both vim and emacs since they pop up all over the place

597236
ssl	https
to get urllib2 to open https urls you need python with ssl support

597238
debian-based	linux
the message also naturally occurs if the public key on the server has been explicitly changed which can happen for a number of legitimate reasons - a vulnerability in debian-based linux distributions in the not-so-distant past necessitated key regeneration for many people for example

597240
rss	feed
also get the rss feed for sites like ruby inside ruby flow and rails inside

597248
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
for most accessors mutators getter setter you do not have to

597248
getter	setter
or use getter setter if you like them and don t mind bit more verbosity

597248
post	get
and finally sending receiving requests plain old httpurlconnection works ok for get and post requests construct using say url.openconnection

597256
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
ie and firefox have solved this problem for the most part but google-chrome and safari are both based off of webkit which does not have a solution

597265
division	multiplication
for example a lot of people that started at a higher level have no idea why shifts are so much faster than multiplication and division or the impact of branching etc

597268
google-chrome	firefox
the function is below works in firefox and google-chrome

597312
datamapper	activerecord
i don t know the size of the project but it might behoove you to put queries in a common place or develop some layer based on a common pattern like activerecord datamapper table row gateway

597316
stdout	fflush
try a fflush stdout

597343
stdout	stderr
think about it - in some shape or form the names stdin stdout and stderr refer to global variables too

597345
accessor	properties
instead you d specify accessor for the properties assuming this is objective-c 2.0

597356
bash	zsh
now i use either bash or zsh

597425
equals	gethashcode
the first thing i would look for is to make sure that you have explicitly implemented equals and gethashcode

597429
hide	show
this method is also helpful when you want to hide a column that is in the bound datatable but you don t want to show then you set width 0

597460
vim	emacs
it s definitely worth learning either vim or emacs

597467
post	get
i can t say about rapidshare in particular but if you see what the manual download is doing you can get curl to post the same forms for example

597548
getter	setter
use the getter setter to access the requesttimeout property of your remoteobject

597608
put	get
if i remove the which i was told to put there i get an invalid escape character error on the s

597620
apache	nginx
you ll need to run a web server on the vps such as apache or nginx

597620
apache	nginx
with regards to pointing it to the proper directory you ll want to set up an apache virtualhost or nginx server block

post	get
and then i would implement a javascript call tying into the form s onsubmit event which would check before the form was submitted and only submit the relevant data to the server possibly through a second form on the page with the id needed to process the thing as a hidden input or refresh the page location with the data you need passed as a get request or do an ajax post to the server or...

597704
opera	safari
there are debuggers in opera and safari that i use if either browser is having particular issues

597709
typedef	struct
i think you d be better off defining your own types and then mapping them to the api types with wrapper struct classes and typedef

597733
postgresql	mysql
these are supported across multiple database vendors sql server mysql postgresql and more

597737
folder	directory
then in vwd express 2008 i created a new tab in the toolbox i chose the .dll from the unzipped folder i used the control all is fine try it i recommend it but when i backed up my code copied the site and tried to run it on another computer i got a bunch of error all indicating that its looking for the dll file on my desktop but when i checked under my bin folder in my website directory the dll is there..

uilabel	uibutton
and if it s not a uilabel it may be a uibutton which contains a uilabel etc

597799
inotifypropertychanged	ieditableobject
the .net system.componentmodel namespace comes with an ieditableobject interface you could also use inotifypropertychanging and inotifypropertychanged

597808
firefox	safari
this isn t guaranteed to work as __proto__ isn t a standard variable but it works at least in firefox and safari

597813
ubuntu	linux
note i d like this to be cross-platform but since from the first answers this doesn t seem to be possible i m working under macos and ubuntu linux so bash

597815
post	get
i would not use a http get method to delete records from the database i would use post

597846
button	checkbox
the form has a text field some checkbox a set of radio button and two text boxes

597846
post	get
what are the pluses and minuses of using get over post and vice versa

597846
post	get
i always thought you should use get for retrieving the form and post for submitting but i ve just learnt you can do both

597847
northwind	adventureworks
talk about sql server 2005 adventureworks is better than northwind

597850
post	get
the html specifications technically define the difference between both as get means that form data is to be encoded by a browser into a url while the post means that the form data is to appear within a message body

597850
post	get
as a simplification we might say that get is basically for just getting retrieving data whereas post may involve anything like storing or updating data or ordering a product or sending e-mail

597852
post	get
both get and post hold intrinsic meaning if you re making an html-based api

597852
post	get
but in general get is used for fetching data post is used for submitting data

597852
post	get
the biggest difference is that get puts all the data in the url which can be limited in size while post sends it as a data part of the http request

597852
post	get
in addition no browser will warn the user if they refresh a get page that does data entry which would make a duplicate entry if you re not careful but on a post most browsers will show a warning

597854
post	get
get requests are always added to the url where as post is submitted with the body of the request

597858
post	get
using get for critical data such as sending password over a get request will expose the password more than post because it ll be stored in browser s history cache proxy caches server logs etc

597879
dbf	dbase
the dbf might well be a dbase file which is easy enough to read and the .bak is probably a backup of one of the other important files or just a backup left by a text editor

597879
hex	binary
if this doesn t give you a good result try opening them in a binary editor that shows side by side hex and ascii with control characters blanked out

597934
kde	gnome
there s no single standard terminal command on linux - the ones available depend on which gui is present whether kde or gnome etc

597936
gtk	vte
edit2 maybe your needs can be served by vte which is a gtk component for embedding a terminal

598013
width	height
you have forgot to put the width and height d put this for ex

598072
dbf	dbase
as others have suggested i recommend a hex editor if you can t figure out what those files are and that dbf is probably dbase

598092
inherited	properties
in order for properties to work correctly you need to use new-style classes instead inherited from object

598093
width	height
in ie6 when you dynamically generate an iframe via javascript the iframe sometimes doesn t fill its container automatically even with width and height set to max

598193
mouseup	mousedown
to draw a selection rectangle from the mousedown mouse move then remove it on mouseup i currently do the following

598193
width	height
i update his width and height related the the mouse move position

598213
paradox	btrieve
.dat was used by btrieve and iirc paradox for dos

598221
versioning	upgrade
if you use common language idioms then you ll see all the benefits of fast prototyping and clean design and your code will naturally run faster as new versioning of python are released and the computer hardware is upgrade

598257
ready	each
assuming there s a 1 cycle latency between each it ll take 3 cycles from 1 is complete until the result of 4 is ready and we can call the function

598276
mouseleave	mouseenter
so mouseenter and mouseleave are fired twice

598276
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
in internet explorer 7 firefox 3 opera and safari both events are fired only once

598376
content-disposition	content-type
we ve alternated between forcing the download using content-disposition attachment + content-type application octet-stream and actually returning the proper mime type

598408
disk	ram
the database pages that needed to be read were only loaded from disk the first time - the second time they were still cached in ram

598449
scons	autotools
but if you compare to make alone not autotools scons alone is superiour

598507
hide	show
you might not need to show it all at once let me expand areas if i want more hide stuff i don t want to use

598512
implements	modifiers
to access your members functions implements in custom code of ssrs report you should set the access modifiers to public

598518
postgresql	mysql
at the database level by enabling appropriate logging or by looking at the database statistics show table status like my_table on mysql select sum avg_width from pg_stats where table_name like my_table for postgresql etc. for the average row size of the tables of interest provided that the database supports it you need to specify the database you are using otherwise you can compute your own statistics from a database dump

598599
installation	upgrade
not only does this make installation simpler the application remains stable and working the way you expect it to even when other components on the system are upgrade

598682
google-chrome	firefox
here is an example tested in firefox google-chrome and ie7

598699
firefox	safari
i am trying to load an xml file using javascript and i have yet to find a good function that works in ie firefox and safari

598723
multiplication	modulo
for integers to be a group under multiplication you have to be modulo a prime number

598723
addition	multiplication
for floating point values simple multiplication or addition saturates to + - infinity and there are no values which are the inverses of infinity so either the set is not closed or it lacks invertibility

598723
multiplication	modulo
if on the other hand you want something similar to integer multiplication modulo a power of 2 then multiplication will do - there are elements without an inverse so it s not a group but it is closed - you always get a floating point value back

598735
ant	maven
i am working on a fairly large project with a number of modules a bunch of external libraries etc. and we are now considering switching from ant to maven

598735
ant	maven
there are a lot of resources on the web describing how to migrate from ant to maven but i haven t found that many that say why -

598736
cruisecontrol	teamcity
continuous integration tools like cruisecontrol teamcity or hudson can work with version control repositories to extract latest versions of source code build that code execute and archive test results and package stuff for deployment

598773
unix	bsd	unix	solaris	solaris	bsd
mono can be run on linux bsd unix mac os x solaris and windows operating systems

598774
ant	maven
first like i m sure a lot of people will mention ant and maven are not exactly intended to solve the same goals

598774
ant	maven
since you said you understand what each provides i won t get into the details of that so suffice it to say that ant lets you define the details of how to build individual components while maven manages the dependencies between components plus maven lets you define a complete project build cycle from compile through test and deploy in a programmatic way

598774
ant	maven
there are plenty of articles on the net that compare ant and maven so you can look at those but from my experience its always worthwhile to consider how you can improve a project

598779
maven	pom.xml
now with maven in place we re relying on artifact repositories to hold those versions and we let our pom.xml dependency declarations be the official means of defining version dependencies

598779
ant	maven
use ant build.xml files to incorporate maven task

598779
ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
the nice thing about the maven task for ant where you specify all dependencies in a pom.xml file is that it involves just modest modification of the existing ant build.xml file to incorporate maven for this

598779
ant	maven
from the ant file s perspective maven is just a means for defining classpath definitions which are subsequently used by the various ant build task

598779
ant	pom.xml
other definitions in the pom.xml can also be accessed as ant property definitions

598779
ant	maven
this hybrid approach of having maven manage all the dependencies and leave the bulk of the ant build.xml file as is is most pragmatic

598788
fast-forward	merge
that way the rebase --onto does not introduce conflicts during the merge since it rebases history made after the last commit b to be squashed into the initial one which was a to tmp representing the squashed new initial commit trivial fast-forward merge only

598847
cvs	svn
the great aptana studio has support via plugins for svn cvs and git via this plugin

598850
getter	setter
you have to have getter and setter

598850
getter	setter
under d2009 didn t check other versions the parameters to the getter setter can t for some reason be const

598882
tinyint	boolean
boolean in mysql is tinyint 1

598885
google-chrome	firefox
i don t know a lot about how the protocols work something that you definitely need to research or much about what goes on in a browser but a great place to start would be the source of the open-source browsers primarily google-chrome and firefox

598920
google-chrome	safari
webkit used in safari and google-chrome 0-27

598920
webkit	blink	opera	google-chrome
blink used in google-chrome 28+ opera 15+ webkit fork

598920
opera	google-chrome
v8 google s javascript engine used in google-chrome and opera

598922
pull	push
stuff get s added deleted renamed automatically and basic syncronization tasks push pull work fine.

598936
rss	feed
keep in mind that would affect everything -- sidebar blocks build with views rss feed etc

599022
int	boolean
if these are not actual boolean but just an int column you only store 0 or 1 in then you should fix your schema

599034
boost	stl
don t write any templates unless you re writing a very very generic library stl and boost are two prominent examples

599053
memset	malloc	memcpy	memset	memcpy	malloc
e.g memcpy malloc memset

599070
ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
if your long term goal is to migrate to using maven to manage the entire build process which one might intend to do for new greenfield projects then i heartily recommend using maven pom.xml files to manage dependencies on behalf of ant build.xml files

599070
ant	maven
and it turns out maven really does a better job of managing dependencies for ant build.xml files than does ivy

599070
ant	maven
prior to adopting maven as our flagship build tool i had a developer attempt to use ivy in combination to existing ant build.xml files

599070
ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
however i went back to the ant legacy projects and started using the maven ant task to define classpath definitions and occasionally other ant property definitions pulled in from the pom.xml

599070
ant	maven
the existing ant build.xml files need only be modified slightly to use maven ant integration to define any classpath that were in use in the build.xml file

599070
ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
all dependencies required by the project became defined in an accompanying pom.xml file that gets processed by maven via the ant task incorporated into the build.xml files

599070
ant	pom.xml
also pretty much any element of something defined in the pom.xml file can be referenced as an ant property within the build.xml file

599070
ant	maven
really with the ant task for maven there is no viable reason for ivy to even exist

599086
post	get
for the successful use case the post redirect get prg work flow is pretty simple simply redirect client-side to the desired page

599118
getter	setter
tests for getter and setter

599122
base	fractions
double uses half as much memory as decimal and double will be much faster because of the cpu hardware for many common floating point operations but it cannot represent most base 10 fractions such as 1.05 accurately and has a less accurate 15+ decimal digits of precision

599124
getter	setter
to clarify the set and get methods referenced above are not getter and setter methods

599134
cpu	processors
cpu is the processors what runs your code against your data

599219
folder	directory
i created a new extension folder under my development firefox profile s extension directory

599235
haskell	sml
sml which is also functional but not lazy can use arrays more naturally than haskell but lists are still more common because they map well to recursive algorithms

599255
affinity	processors
what you re interested in is smp processors affinity

599309
udp	tcp
tcp ip as well as udp packets include some reference to their size

599309
udp	tcp
using the standard run-of-the-mill sockets in windows whether you re using the system.net.sockets namespace in c# or the native winsock stuff in win32 you never see the ip tcp udp headers

599309
serializable	deserialization
from what i can tell it is a binary serializable deserialization scheme for wcf i m sure that s a gross oversimplification

599322
yourkit	jprofiler	profiler	yourkit
i ve not used netbeans profiler but tried jprofiler yourkit and jprobe

599375
ant	maven
i hate maven less than i hate ant and for java you need to choose one of those evils

599377
public	protected
however the biggest difference between an https connection and an http connection protected by digest auth is that with the former everything is encrypted with public key encryption while with the latter content is sent in the clear

599393
ubuntu	linux
note i am new to rails and fairly new to ubuntu and linux in general

599421
jndi	jta	jms	jta
list of features ejb 3.0 and 3.1 jta jax-ws jms j2ee connectors jpa jndi

599421
openjpa	openejb
openejb uses several other open source frameworks such as openjpa to provide jpa and cmp persistence activemq for jms mdb and apache cxf for jax-ws features

599421
jar	war
deployment types collapsed ear war jar

599421
openjpa	openejb
limitations openejb uses openjpa to provide jpa and cmp persistence and openjpa currently requires a javaagent to function properly

599424
button	checkbox
i use a model to define dynamic forms made from group frame labels textboxes numberboxes option button and checkbox in wpf

599438
aptana	rubymine
i d recommend netbeans ruby edition obviously or jetbrain s rubymine over aptana

599471
vim	emacs
our developers either used emacs or vim and no one wanted to switch to anything else so we fortunately sticked with that

599528
int	double
for example with widening coercions int - long float - double

599558
hash	md5
try uniqid - and perhaps combine with an md5 hash as given in the examples

599638
nodevalue	nextsibling
nodename nodetype nodevalue firstchild lastchild nextsibling previoussibling data value htmlelement.getelementsbytagname all htmltableelement members most cssstyledeclaration members simply do not exist

599651
kate	kde	kate	kdevelop
kde seems to have a drawers-like functionality as seen in kdevelop and some other applications kate the editor uses them too but i have never tried to use them in anything i ve written and so would have no idea how to write them

599680
width	height
if you compare the width and height of the flash movie on both pages you ll see that it s the same

599743
cvs	svn
vim can work well with cvs svn make debuggers etc

599743
notepad++	jedit	vim	notepad++	vim	kate	vim	jedit	kate	jedit
infact kate or notepad++ or jedit have gui and features you may miss in vim

599773
freebsd	linux
the project is a set of c libraries so no ui or user interaction testing is necessary and aimed at being cross platform with linux freebsd and windows being my first priority and os x planned once the first release is out the door assuming i can get a hold of a machine running os x to test on

599795
vim	emacs
the advantage of using either vim or emacs as an editor is precisely that it s available on virtually any decently configured unix platform and this includes more esoteric systems as well darwin os x

599796
vim	textmate	notepad	textpad
fwiw i use textmate sometimes vim on osx textpad sometimes notepad or even edit on servers not under my direct control on windows and vim on linux

599818
google-chrome	firefox
this could take you years but anyway there are many open source browsers out there firefox google-chrome

599826
mouse	keyboard
i have a timer program that count for inactivity of keyboard mouse

599873
int	double
since some of the numbers will be small and some large the question is whether it is worth checking the length of the number and if it is small use a regular c# int or double and if is is large use the other classes i have or if i am already using the large int and large float classes i should just stick with them even for smaller numbers

599919
git-merge	git-rebase	squash	branch
squash a and b into a new commit ab would result in two distinct trees which in most cases is not desirable since git-merge and git-rebase will no longer work across the two branch

599929
pop-up	dialog
when the authentication fails i would like to pop-up my plugin s settings dialog and retry

599934
boost	stl
this works for nested containers but this is for their implementation for stl only and does not work if you are putting a stl container in a boost container

599971
children	parent
as an example let s say we have a blog and we want to show the blog articles as the parent and then any comments made to each article as children in a hierarchical ultrawebgrid

599984
post	get
i would like to select 5 latest records from the post table get their related tags and return the ilist where each post has their tags property filled

600010
width	height
but remember your file has 2 integers at the begining -- width height which determine how many more to read another width height number of integers

600010
width	height
you will need to use two buffers -- one for the width and height and then depending on their value another one to read the rest of the file

600017
dxcore	coderush
this will producethe effect described here lines between methods in the c# editor coderush dxcore plugin

600017
dxcore	coderush
if you don t want coderush xpress then an alternative is to install the free dxcore extensibility engine and then install the above plugin

600075
rss	feed
automatic rss feed

600083
disk	ram
unfortunately a lot of the time you have to make decisions about whether to optimize for time cpu usage or space ram or disk space

600170
onmousedown	onmousemove
i have overrided the onmousedown and onmousemove to redraw the picture where the user move it

600170
onmousemove	onmouseup
i think that the event onmousemove is fired with the event onmouseup but i m not sure

600279
scons	automake
think of scons as an improved cross-platform substitute for the classic make utility with integrated functionality similar to autoconf automake and compiler caches such as ccache

600329
hash	salt
i want the server to store the username hash password and different salt per user

600390
width	height
i recommend downloading firebug and experiment with changing the pixel width height

600395
integer	unsigned
i need to be able to perform lookups by unsigned integer keys

600416
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	modulo	multiplication	modulo	division	subtraction	division	modulo	division	multiplication
since most hash functions used for hash tables are of k c_1 c_2 the difference to an array lookup in a rather sparse and or optimal hash table consists of one indirection two multiplication a subtraction and a division an efficient modulo implementation using the cpus capabilites might reduce that by a subtraction and a multiplication and the array lookup

600451
width	height
if you do take this approach your css will need additional properties for the height and width of the background image

600469
cairngorm	flex	cairngorm	puremvc
given that flex is still a relatively young technology there are already a bunch of architectural frameworks available for flex air and flash development the main ones being cairngorm and puremvc

600499
scipy	sympy
also be aware that sage contains numpy scipy and sympy

600504
post	get
as i guess i ll get stuck in between you guys answering my first questions and finally getting this thing up and running i ll update this single post various times

600548
packets	pcap
packets or stream reassembly is not mentioned in pcap 3

600582
google-chrome	safari
this problem will play in out webkit based browsers as well google-chrome safari

600605
profiler	yourkit
from my experience yourkit profiler is most usable one

600607
equals	compareto
they have methods like compareto equals ...thus they should take more than four bytes on the stack

600666
subtract	add
you can subtract one from another you can add integers to them and so on

600758
rss	feed
i ve created an rss feed in php using the below code

600769
serializable	deserialization
do you need to optimise for disk access and low-impact serializable and deserialization

600817
google-chrome	firefox
in some browsers in firefox google-chrome and apparently ie8 you can use the data url scheme to embed an image file in html

600830
integer	unsigned
both these can be stored as a 4 byte integer and if space is really tight can be combined into unix time seconds since the epoch 1 1 1970 as an unsigned integer which will be good till around 2106 as

600830
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer max val 4 294 967 295 - can hold 136 years of seconds

600873
children	parent
the parent table gets the autoincrement oid column and the children get plain oid columns

600885
implements	extends
also unless you are doing something fancy in changeview that can t be done using the methods in a uiviewcontroller object then you should just use it instead if it is neccesary to implements your own view switching method then you can extends uiviewcontroller instead of implemtning part of the view controlelr in your view

600895
datarow	dataadapter
you will also want to look at dataadapter especially dbdataadapter.fill datatable especially datatable.load and datarow and dbdatareader

600910
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
not because of firefox safari or google-chrome but because 2 3s of the internet is still stuck on ie

600939
post	get
actually i m already building a moderation section where moderators can remove post and suspend members also members can report abuse and spam i m not trying to make this impossible simply there s no way to do this i m just trying to get rid of the less savvy ones the majority and not forever i m planning to block them for a certain period of time probably a couple of days or something like that

600945
jsf	seam
as part of a datatable in a seam jsf page one column requires the output of a name

600969
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
system.data.oracleclient from microsoft and odp.net

600969
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
personally i prefer odp.net but system.data.oracleclient will get the job done

600997
folder	directory
the problem is all the stupid .svn folder show up in the directory listing of php

601006
folder	directory
folder show up in the directory

601013
put	get
once an account has some extra value someone needs to put some good work in an account to get more privileges you ll see that abusers will probably go to other websites

601028
cairngorm	flex
i wrote two large applications with cairngorm in the flex 2 days and i can t recommend it

601085
nunit	mstest	mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest
there s a comparison of the attribute and assertion differences between nunit mbunit mstest and xunit.net at

601085
mbunit	mstest
as for mstest vs opensource solution it s widely seen that the open source packages in particular mbunit and xunit.net are where the innovation around unit testing is occuring

601089
x86	64bit
in 64bit editions of windows xp 2003 vista there are also programfiles x86 which defaults to c program files x86 and programw6432 which defaults to c program files

601139
peer	p2p
the project i m working on uses p2p to transfer data between peer much unlike bittorrent

601141
gif	png
i have a script that will output a jpg gif or png image

601155
min	max
it gets worst since time average time min and max all count nested function calls they re all incorrect if you re using ajax

601224
accessor	properties
in one of my business objects i throw various exceptions in the set accessor of one of the objects properties

601233
uptime	reboot
i ran uptime to see the time of my last reboot and looked for a cluster of urls all opened around that time but either i m missing it or the last visited time doesn t work that way

601238
minimum	max	min	max
min column and max column it shows the minimum execution time of a particular function

601247
folder	directory
the export directory contains many of the same files folder that the root does however the root contains additional ones not found in export

601247
overwrite	preserve
preserve the permissions users groups of the file if it is overwrite the export

601251
put	get
remember that finally will always get executed and is just risky as you have just witnessed to put something that may throw an exception there

601256
voip	sip
iaxmodem simulates a real modem while really being an iax2 voip protocol like sip connection to asterisk

601269
getter	setter
this saves you from having to write custom getter setter

601269
getter	setter
if you re using 10.4 then you have to write custom getter setter see apple s docs on creating non-standard persistent attributes

601301
polymorphism	specialization
basically c# just doesn t want you to work with specialization except for polymorphism

601325
daemon	cron
for that matter why don t you just put all the daemon external functionality on a controller and have rake cron just call that

601379
put	get
for example if you put values in cells a1 b1 and c1 then entered the following formula in d1 you d get a usable insert statement

601412
vim	emacs
for example i use vimacs plugin which makes vim behave like emacs in the insert mode alone

601440
folder	directory
open the out.txt you will see the name of folder and files in current directory

601480
perl	tcl

i usually use centos or debian

601663
getter	setter
they are analogous to getter and setter in java

601696
next	except
continuing with the next line in the original proc function would be a very bad thing - it would mean the code executing radically differently in a debugger to in release where the exception would indeed cause execution to exit that proc function unless there s an except finally block

601786
mockups	balsamiq	entity-relationship	diagram
but balsamiq mockups is a really easy tool for mocking up diagram sql and entity-relationship included

601833
ant	maven
in particular 1.7 comparing maven with ant has an interesting discussion

601833
ant	maven
maven has strong points but nothing that can t be done by an ant build process

601833
ant	maven
dependency management ant has the ivy subproject which can interact with maven repositories

601833
ant	maven
build logic reuse maven plugins you can also achieve that in ant with macrodef s and task libraries

601833
ant	maven
the thing is with maven you get these features out-of-the-box while with ant you need a rock-solid build a very strict set of rules and a way to enforce them for instance make sure that everyone follows the conventions when they create a new subproject that they reuse the existing blocks instead of doing everything from scratch etc.

601833
ant	maven
then i would try to balance the cost of adding the missing features to the existing ant script against the cost of migrating to maven if you don t know maven that also includes the cost of learning it

601844
freebsd	linux
i use python on my mac mostly for development of server side applications which later will run on freebsd linux boxes

cxxtest	cppunit
we intend to use a testing framework like cppunit oder cxxtest

601996
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
my impression is that wxhaskell allows you to spend a little more time in the higher-level bindings but i ve not done much gtk2hs and in any event you definitely find yourself working on the thin end of the wrapper for both libraries - and i think the overall programming complexity is similar in both cases

601996
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
wxhaskell is probably a little easier to build if you are not on linux gtk2hs is likely easier if you are linux hosted but both are pretty complex to build to be honest as there are a significant number of dependencies in both cases

601996
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
i would admit that with only a small amount of extra work the same could be done with gtk2hs so this is probably the weakest argument in favour of wxhaskell

602044
implements	extends
each extender plug-in then extends the listeners extension-point by supplying a specific listener that implements the ilistener interface or by supplying a sequence of such listeners

602048

there are two opposite types imperative and declarative

602641
windows	wow64
what s meant by that incompatibility you read about is that 32 and 64-bit assemblies can t be part of the same application - an application has to target either one or the other though 32-bit application will generally run fine on windows x64 using wow64 which just acts as a translator

602759
intersect	contains
the excel.application object has the intersect function which tells you what cells are contains in two or more ranges but not the opposite

602787

i do this so that i can share the same core animation calayer layout code between my iphone application and a mac client the iphone inverts the normal quartz coordinate system for calayers to match that of the uiview

602926
cassini	iis
in iis you need to restart it by opening the command prompt and typing iisreset then hit enter however if your using the build in visual studio web server cassini then this wont solve your problem

602937
folder	directory
i have run the exe file of cygwin and in the installation directory i have got all necessary files i think bin folder lib cygwin.bat etc

602937
g++	gcc

i don t understand why i get gcc above and not g++

602974
bash	zsh
this works in zsh i ve checked version 4.3 and in bash 4.2 or newer

put	get	post	put	post	get
i m manually testing a restful api that makes full use of get post put delete methods

603194
postgresql	mysql
for postgresql there is phppgadmin for an online solution and the equivalent for mysql

mouse	keyboard
there is other event handlers that you can use to intercept keyboard input but they have some limitations the winproc will allow you to check any message directed to the control including delete backspace copy and paste etc mouse clicks etc

603297
postgresql	mysql
for database i think you can get mysql or postgresql as they are both free and will lower your costs

603307
ant	maven
if you re using ant and you want maven style dependency management without maven take a look at ivy

603307
maven	pom.xml
it can download from maven repositories and can even read maven pom.xml files

603381
uninstall	upgrade
upgrade work fine if no components have changed but any time a component changes the upgrade fails and it requires the user to manually uninstall and reinstall

603384
spaces	delimiter
the other option is delimiter name pseudo name spaces trick

603411
post	get
when i get home i can post the full code if you like

603428
kerberos	ldap
but if your python is running under unix you need two things to talk to active directory kerberos and ldap

603444
antivirus	mcafee
we have shadowprotect installed on the server along with mcafee antivirus

603454
inline	member-functions
this is not about virtual function in particular but about inline and member-functions generally

603454
inline	member-functions
for member-functions if you define your function in the class it is implicitly inline

603458
instances	transient
but for access from scripts and actions the way is to inject transient variables into the process instances keeping in mind you may need to work around bug jbpm-304 by sub typing script and adjusting the associated hibernate mapping files

603506
ant	maven
you should also keep in mind that there is a plugin for running ant commands from within maven

603533
maven	cobertura
if you use maven for doing your builds you can use the cobertura plugin

603542
folder	directory
delete the entire activemq_home directory and reinstall it in a different folder

603573
opera	firefox
this works in firefox 3 ie7 and somewhat in opera 9.6

603592
division	multiplication
you can use some simple multiplication and division

603616
gridview	rowdatabound
use the rowdatabound event built into the gridview then you could do something like this in vb.net

603630
lxml	beautifulsoup
okay first in regards to parsing the html if you follow the recommendation of zweiterlinde and s.lott at least use the version of beautifulsoup included with lxml

603630
lxml	elementtree
secondly .find and .findall come from lxml trying to be compatible with elementtree and those two methods are described in xpath support in elementtree

603689
post	get
as for doing it in php you can easily make the button send a post or get request for the starting amount

603705
folder	directory
if not then start looking at the iis configuration and make sure that web site directory is the same folder as you are dumping the web service files

603783
arraylist	treeset
you have to either put all the values into a treeset with a comparator that uses the fileid or put them into an arraylist and sort them with collections.sort again with a comparator that compares the way you want

603806
accessor	properties
some like private fields next to properties accessor some like fields together above the constructors

603816
unix	bsd
or you can read up on bsd unix which is a little closer

603896
put	get
simply put i am looking to get onto a project small opensource so that i can gain valuable information and learn from others in the community before i go crazy here i have reached a proverbial ceiling where i am

603935
getter	setter
it uses getter and setter to access its protected members

603941
post	get
the urlloader post and i get my e-mail a minute later but for some reason i m not getting my response back

603973
int	double
these commands do seem to work with native types like int double etc

603984
move	drag
on the iphone if you touch and hold your finger on an icon it starts vibrating then you can drag them around while the other icons move aside and rearrange dynamically

604047
ant	cruisecontrol
the cruisecontrol ant invocation has nothing to do with the svn label that is contructed as such

604047
ant	cruisecontrol
the svn label is used to annotate the build-names whereas the build.log is really just the output from ant as it is passed through cruisecontrol

604047
ant	cruisecontrol
another way is to use the svnlabelincrementer to assign the revision number to the label and pass that onto the ant script using the buildproperties that are passed from cruisecontrol to the build scripts

604123
calloc	malloc
objects that are allocated by malloc or another function of that family like calloc have allocated storage duration

604143
selecteditem	selectedindex
when this happens the combobx sees it as a complete reset of the selection and clears the selecteditem selectedindex

604153
free	malloc
if you allocate something on the heap using malloc that memory is good for as long as you want to use it - until you call free at which point it is released

604161
margin	font-size
i have an h1 with a defined font-size and line-height and zero padding and margin

604176
rss	feed
rss certainly has astronomical adoption rates compared to atom so if you re interested in being in the mainstream i suggest providing an rss feed

604219
getter	setter
in java the getter and setter are in essence properties

604225
getter	setter
the way i see it properties allow me to interact with the exposed data in a natural way without losing the encapsulation provided by getter setter methods

604225
getter	setter
all of this can be done with getter setter methods but the verbiage is much higher and the usage is much less natural

604231
button	checkbox
if you have an existing pdf that you want to populate and that pdf just has text fields no checkbox or radio button then cam pdf may be able to help you

604314
width	height
if the problem is strictly with images i believe you can use the height and width attributes of the tag to tell the browser what size the images will be

604314
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
edit someone else suggested css and i believe that using the height and width directives from css will give you the same result as using the same attributes of the tag but doesn t limit you strictly to images and a will play nicer with any margin or padding directives you might use

604338
fink	macports
if you get python from macports or fink you will not be able to run wxpython unless you run it through x11

604372
int	chars
i threw int chars another type and it was all caught the same way

604396
getter	setter
this makes it so that you can specify getter and setter for properties as necessary but makes it so that you don t have to define boilerplate functions for every property just the ones where you want to do some sort of processing on it before returning the value

604407
cvs	svn
i use cvs not svn

604410
mouse	keyboard
such as loading a large amount of data this would cause the keyboard and mouse to lockup

604410
mouse	keyboard
i m looking for a lightweight solution that would allow this to be done without tying down the keyboard and mouse

604430
sqlcommandbuilder	sqldataadapter
sqldataadapter + sqlcommandbuilder still requires you to write select .

604460
prefuse	flare
so i took alook at all the given answers and links it looks like prefuse flare will by the optimal choice

604467
ioexception	objectoutputstream
you should also consider that the objectoutputstream constructor can throw an ioexception so may want to cover this case in your tests

604470
int	double
functions with only simple arguments int double worked fine but i could not determine how to marshal the arrays

604477
put	get
the low-tech way to get around this is simply to set the property licenseaccepted to 1 and put some useful readme type information into the license box

604484
folder	directory
edit -- i did as suggested and added the output folder to the linker s additional directory

604499
getdate	dateadd
the key thing is using the proper syntax for a jet database and that means that the first argument for dateadd is a string value d and that you can t use a sql server function getdate but must instead use jet s function for the same purpose date

604500
toggleclass	slidetoggle
i might also suggest slidetoggle and toggleclass

604505
int	chars
the streams and strings use those traits to figure out a variety of things like the eof value comparison of a range of chars widening of a chars to an int and such stuff

604528
installation	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
a couple of final things that an installer tool should provide are ways to apply upgrade to an existing installation and a way to uninstall the program undoing all those installation tasks deleting files restoring backups unregistering com servers etc.

604539
numericupdown	maskedtextbox
from what i ve seen in vc# s control toolbox winforms .netf 3.5 i m looking for a mix of maskedtextbox numericupdown and datetimepicker

604550
post	get
i know that with addons like firebug i am also able to get all post parameters with normal submit

604559
mouse	keyboard
you might also want to consider windows keyboard and mouse hooks

604776
vbscript	jscript
you could have an exe which exposed methods and properties in a form usable by both other processes including vbscript and jscript

604806
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i need this to work across all browsers ie6-8 firefox google-chrome opera safari

604812
fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream
mock objects you could use a factory method to create an overridden objectoutputstream or fileoutputstream

604841
hash	whirlpool
that leaves several families of hash functions including sha-2 haval ripemd whirlpool and others

604852
emacs	aquamacs
it uses aquamacs for emacs

604852
emacs	aquamacs
aquamacs is a specially for mac os x enhanced gnu emacs

604860
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if i use a loop to execute it i found something more interesting i got four true in ie and safari and true false true false in firefox google-chrome

604870
inherited	subclassing
i am using single table inherited and have comments on all the subclassing

604891
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the following code works fine in firefox google-chrome safari ie8 - but not ie8 in ie7 compatability mode

604902
postgresql	mysql
or maybe i want to use mysql for forum posts but postgresql for geo-clustering more realistic for me heh

604940
width	height
what i did was store in a database the object type and some properties x y width height etc

604964
actionscript	mxml
mxml code needs to be compiled down to actionscript before flash player can do anything with it

605057
kerberos	ntlm
fiddler2 will indicate if the authentication header is ntlm vs kerberos

605124
cos	sin
i was aware from this as a possible issue from the outset and so have limited my use of non-integer position math as much as possible but for smooth diagonal movement at varying speeds i m calculating the angle between points in radians then getting the x and y components of movement with sin and cos

605124
floating-point	fixed-point
i m also doing some calculations for line segment intersections line-circle intersections circle-rect intersections etc that also probably need to move from floating-point to fixed-point to avoid cross-machine issues

605124
put	get
if i can get this working i plan to open-source the math functions i put together so that there will be a resource for other c# programmers out there

605130
post	get
the parent code would handle connection tracking keep alives get post head requests and feed them off to handlers that were loaded on start up

605171
spoofing	traffic
this will protect you in two ways firstly it will protect you from spoofing an attacker will be rejected if he does not have your certificate even if he bypasses iptables by spoofing his address or because your iptables config gets overwritten by an admin and secondly it will protect your data from prying eyes an attacker will not be able to snoop traffic for your passwords. some applications most database engines net-snmpd set up in v3 mode etc. support ssl natively

605196
apache	nginx
there have been two pretty good blog posts lately about setting up nginx but both are using nginx to serve static or cached content and apache + mod_wsgi to serve django

605196
apache	nginx
edit ok i dug out an old tar file with my nginx + django + virtual host config files from a year ago before i switched to apache + mod_wsgi

605211
udp	tcp
to extract packets expressly for my application requires me to filter the data using the addresses and ports in the ip and tcp udp headers

605239
int	boolean
i believe that a bitset is more memory- and cpu-efficient is it can internally pack the bits into int longs or native data types whereas a boolean requires a byte for each bit of data

605240
debian	linux
in my experience properly configured it can be helpful even for large installations like debian linux 2gb download though for debian case there are specialized tools like apt-cache

605260
inherited	subclassing
off the top of my head you could subclassing qcombobox and override hideevent qhideevent inherited from qwidget

605260
mouse	keyboard
i looked at the qt source code and it looks like when the keyboard and mouse events are captured that as soon as qt has decided to emit the activated int index signal hidepopup has been called

605295
accessor	properties
i am having an issue where an exception being thrown from within a properties set accessor is not being caught by my global exception handler

605308
.htaccess	httpd.conf
does every server have the equivalent to block xml files and if they do can they be altered on a folder level like the .htaccess can and not just a httpd.conf file

605337
cvs	svn
for example in full branch source control like cvs or svn merging can be difficult and you might be better off with the first model while if using more complex system like ibm clearcase and with a larger size of team you could be better of with the second model or a combination of the two

605337
cvs	svn
the above model does not make much sense with teams under 50 developers and source control system without sparse branches and proper merging capability like cvs or svn which would just make this whole model a nightmare to setup manage and integrate

605380
joomla	vbulletin
gallery vbulletin and joomla all use the second method i mentioned

605385
portrait	landscape
i m working in landscape so might not have noticed any deficiencies in portrait mode. here s my code - it s part of a categeory on uiimage

605395
hide	show
i m new to jquery and need some help to show and hide a div on click

605434
hash	md5
it is riddled with regular expressions and it relies on md5 hash to escape certain characters

605455
bazaar	git
distributed version control systems such as mercurial bazaar or git are better suited for such tasks

605476
hash	md5
with md5 hash

605544
int	double
the range of double is way greater than the range of 32 or 64 bit int which is why std floor returns a double

605544
int	double
casting to int should be fine so long as it s within the appropriate range - but be aware that a double can t represent all 64 bit int exactly so you may also end up with errors when you go beyond the point at which the accuracy of double is such that the difference between two consecutive double is greater than 1

605547
int	double
another reason is that the range of double is far greater than that of int

605547
int	double
it may not be possible to round all double to int

605565
uilabel	uibutton
first of all you should be aware that uibutton already has a uilabel inside it

605620
subtract	add
you can add and subtract normally

605620
cos	sin	cos	sqrt	sin	sqrt
when you need to sqrt sin cos etc

605620
int	double
then convert to long double divide by 1000 sqrt multiply by 1000 convert to int

605631
queue	fifo
it is a simple fifo queue with locks to allow simultaneous access from multiple os threads

605705
min	max
i then broke out the individual min max parts into four queries to see how the server responded and got full throughput with the cpu peaking at 100 and the block ran in 2 seconds as opposed to 5mins for the above

606017
int	chars
it should be possible to cast explicitly or implicitly the chars to an unsigned int and then just use such constants

606369
regasm	regsvr32
you must now register it with regasm instead of regsvr32

606375
vmware	virtualbox
another approach i would suggest is to install server 2003 iis6 server 2008 iis7 on a virtual machine - virtualpc vmware virtualbox if you don t have access to msdn downloads of server images you can always download trials - server 2008 trial is good for 60 days plus two resets

606398
int	chars	int	double
i m sure by now - cause i ve taken my time typing this - there are lots of answers telling you how to do this tryparse int first then double then test length for chars if not then it s a string etc but if i were you i d try to not do that and see if there s any way you can get or pass some meta-data that will tell you what type it is and not just what type it might be

606406
matplotlib	scipy
the basic packages you will probably need to get started would be numpy basic array numerics scipy more algorithms and matplotlib plotting

607580
int	chars
hence it would put into the array a one byte op code followed by 0 1 or 2 bytes which could be a chars an int or a pointer to a string based on the op code

607580
int	chars
my simple solution 4 separate stacks s one for the opcode enum and one each for chars int and string

607609
stdout	stderr
here s how you would redirect stdout and stderr to a log file

607609
stdout	stderr
the redirect stdout to a file and and the redirects stderr to stdout so any error messages will be logged as well

607612
salt	md5
if valid update the user table salt and password with a new salt you have the password from the user so you can md5 it and the salt again

607619

the client swears that the only change they made to that computer since i installed this app was installing norton antivirus which has never caused problems before with our software

607804
rss	feed
as a side note you might want to look at the universal feed parser for handling the rss parsing as feed have a bad habit of being malformed

607814
rss	feed
you can use an rss feed from currency source to get information that s about as up-to-date as possible

607827
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
i am currently working with panel s in wpf and i noticed that as regards the width and height properties there are also two other properties called actualwidth and actualheight

607841
width	height
it like with winforms there was a size and a clientsize property the differ slightly and you should use the atual client size of rendering and the width height for layout

607849
width	height
width height is the i requested or layout i size

607849
actualheight	actualwidth
actualwidth actualheight is the i rendered i size

607967
put	get
put the data someplace statically accessible and have the subclasses get it from there

607972
superclass	subclassing
if you have a fixed set of subclassing then you can put the data in the superclass

607972
superclass	subclassing
you might get subclassing let the superclass know of their existence from the static initialiser or use an agent

607972
superclass	subclassing
generally superclass should not be aware of their subclassing

607972
superclass	subclassing
however you might want to think or better refactor your superclass into a supertype and some other class responsible for your subclassing

607975
put	get
if no match then i get the record from the database and put it in the array

607978
subclass	abstract-class
the other option is to put a registry map in the abstract-class - if you need to mandate it the abstract constructor takes the static value or just stores the subclass if calculations are needed

607984

you set up the now loading in viewwillappear but you never see it since by the time viewdidappear completes it s done with the heavy work

608207
base	fractions
most decimal fractions cannot be represented as base 2 floating point numbers

608207
base	fractions
precision as displayed will round based on the number format so a number format of 0.00 will cause it to round to two decimal places - but most decimal fractions are not representable by excel s base 2 number system so 0.58 might still get you the same thing when written to xml

608267
width	height
found an apple dev sample that created rendered each character and got its pertinent info width height offset etc.

608286

608330
boost	stl
it will work on any stl collection vectors boost array etc

608340
int	chars

bash	tcsh
the only thing i could think to try is to change the shell settings plesk has a dropdown list of bash csh tcsh and so on next to the allow ssh using option

608540
filtering	grouping
sometimes it makes sense for a single type to have a lot of methods - such as system.linq.enumerable but partial classes can help in such cases if you can break the type up into logical grouping in the case of enumerable grouping by aggregation set operations filtering etc would seem natural

608556
filtering	grouping
however if you assign temp out to a send port grouping the message is sent to all the ports in the grouping irregardless of the filtering set on each port

608571

608728
int	double
int int + double is essentially

608728
int	double
int double + double

608728

608832
hid	keyboard	mouse	keyboard
the transfer cable isn t explicitly an hid like a mouse or keyboard but it conforms to the hid spec

608839
equals	gethashcode
okay so if i override equals i need to override gethashcode and vice versa

608893
daemons	systemd
systemd administration commands and daemons

608931
equals	gethashcode
if you as the class designer consider two instances of that class to be equals if they share the same myid then you only need to test myid in your overriden equals and gethashcode methods

i dont know how to setup sqldatasource and detailsview to accomplish this

609089
division	modulo
the modulo returns the remainder from a truncating division

609133
int	chars
for highly stressed servers you are going to have to get more involved in how bytes are sent back and forth but at this level you should abstract out your sends into a separate protocol type class that builds the data to be sent and sends it in a burst and have a receiving protocol that receives a bunch of data and processes it as a complete unit instead of breaking things down to sending receiving an int chars byte array etc

609156
memcached	apc
for this in php you need apc which comes pretty much as standard with php these days and will be standard as of php 6 --all you have to do is enable it in the config--or memcached particularly if you ve got some sort of clustered solution

the steps taken in this nunit example apply to an mbunit implementation

609279
free	calloc
in the second calloc and free are used instead of _alloca

609279
free	calloc

609313
gtk	gdk
the difficulty here is that swt talks to gtk which talks to gdk which then talks to x

609326
submit	submission
next if the request type is a post and the mime type is application x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart form-data then that is usually a form submission a user has clicked submit or similar. 2

implements	extends
to support it natively you probably have to extends webhttpbinding or make your own binding and implements custom encoder

609622
tiff	png
i d suggest you to have lossless source images tiff or png comes to mind or re-evaluate your image quality requirements â resampling a jpeg once again given decent original files is indistinguishable to the vast majority of people out there

609632
versioning	upgrade	pop-up	dialog
the dialog that pop-up has a section for a minimum required versioning for this application which lets you enforce that a user upgrade to a specific versioning

609668
implements	extends
often times and interface and an abstract class are used together to achieve different results utilizing inheritance and polymorphism extends implements

609674
int	chars
an enum can not use chars as it s base type but you can use chars literals to specify an int value

609698
opera	google-chrome
the results are very different for different browsers with google-chrome getting all the points for speed and opera a good second - but that s not the question here

609700

610104
versioning	upgrade
it also isn t guaranteed to return the same hash value on different versioning of the .net framework meaning that an upgrade could potentially produce a different hash for the same string rendering your passwords unusable to you

610104
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
it is recommended that you use a salt hash or even md5 at a push

610120
capitalize	capitalization
real names have special capitalization rules the van der in johannes diderik van der waals is never capitalize farrah fawcett-majors has the m and cathal ã heochaidh uses the non-ascii ã and h which modify eochaidh to mean grandson of eochaidh

610147
strncmp	strcmp
you may consider using strncmp as a safer alternative to strcmp

610149
strstr	substr
try strstr if that is the case it finds substr

610159
ubuntu	debian
if am not wrong ubuntu s postgresql packages are derived from debian

610159
ubuntu	debian
if that s the case debian and all it s derivatives like ubuntu will depict the same behaviour

610223
folder	dir
the problem then is that the plugin uses the dependencies from in the plugins folder while the executable uses the dependencies from the root folder which are basically the same file in a different dir so while running the clr sees them as 2 different dll s and that really confuses the clr

610229
hash	salt
the client adds the salt to the password hash it and sends it to the server

610231
draggable	droppable
if you also include jquery ui and make your main div a draggable and all other divs droppable all you need is hook up on the droppable s over event to get notified when the main div is dragged over the other one

610232
width	height
if you re using jquery you can find the left top width and height of a div by using these

610238
strcpy	strncpy	strcpy	strdup	strdup	strncpy
while i admit that it s usually better to use strncpy in order to avoid buffer overflows the following an implementation of the strdup function for those not lucky enough to have it safely uses strcpy and should never overflow

610238
strcpy	strncpy	strlen	strncpy	strlen	strcpy
is guaranteed to have enough space to store and using strcpy saves us from having to store the strlen result in another function to use later as the unnecessary in this case length parameter to strncpy

610238
memcpy	strncpy
yet some people write this function with strncpy or even memcpy which both require a length parameter

610238
memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	strcpy	strcpy	strncpy
if you have a good reason not to use strcpy in this situation please give it - i d like to know why it might be better to use strncpy or memcpy in situations like this

610238
memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	strcpy	strcpy	strncpy
basically i just want to know why some people use memcpy when others use strcpy and still others use plain strncpy

610248
hash	salt
if the server only accepts the salt password on a connection which originally challenged with that salt then the hacker would have to keep connecting until he got the same salt as the one he saw the hash for

610260
memcpy	strcpy
i d tend to use memcpy if i have already calculated the length although strcpy is usually optimised to work on machine words it feels that you should provide the library with as much information as you can so it can use the most optimal copying mechanism

610260
memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	strcpy	strcpy	strncpy	strlen	strncpy	strlen	strcpy
but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively

610275
strlen	strcpy
what happens if this function is interrupted after successful memory allocation and thus the call to strlen the string grows and bam you have a buffer overflow condition since strcpy copies to the null byte

610277
strcpy	strncpy	strlen	strncpy	strlen	strcpy
but yeah strcpy is as good as strncpy in any situation where you are allocating memory for the destination buffer and have already used strlen to find the length

610280
hash	salt
if you can make sure that the server sends a sufficiently large salt and never the same salt twice i suspect a small portion of decent random numbers plus an incrementing counter then hash may be enough but i cannot prove that it is that d probably be enough

610288
strcpy	strncpy
the reason why people use strncpy not strcpy is because strings are not always null terminated and it s very easy to overflow the buffer the space you have allocated for the string with strcpy and overwrite some unrelated bit of memory

610288
strcpy	strncpy
with strcpy this can happen with strncpy this will never happen

610298
strcpy	strdup
well strcpy is not as evil as strdup - at least strcpy is part of standard c

610301
min	max
words can be blocked due to min max length restrictions and or the stopword file

610301
innodb	myisam
if you have the storage to spare what you can do is put the main canonical version of the data in an innodb table and then create a separate myisam table that contains a copy of the freetext content purely for use as searchbait

610316
strcpy	strncpy
strncpy is not by origin a bounded strcpy and the committee has preferred to recognize existing practice rather than alter the function to better suit it to such use

610397
fflush	gets
be sure any pending output gets fflush from the output buffer

610404
memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	strcpy	strcpy	strncpy
frankly if you are doing much string handling in c you should not ask yourself whether you should use strcpy or strncpy or memcpy

610440
stdio	strcat	strstr	strcpy	strlen	strcpy	strlen	strstr
i used stdio calls strlen strstr strcpy and strcat to do the string manipulation rather than win32 calls so your only dependancy is the c run time

610470
folder	directory
and like any other django project i have got apps inside the project root directory and some special folder like extensions a.k.a custom django command extensions

610489
width	text-align
padding-left - 1 2 width of element and text-align center

610491
blitz++	ublas
on the other hand high level c++ libraries like blitz++ and ublas allows you to state your intentions more clearly than relatively low-level fortran code and allows for whole new classes of compile-time optimizations

610494
strcpy	strncpy
once you get to real string ops like modifying the middle of a string it s almost as easy to pass the wrong length into strncpy and especially strncat as it is to call strcpy with a too-small destination

610494
strcpy	strncpy
of course you might still ask whether to use strncpy or strcpy in implementing that abstraction strncpy is safer there provided you fully grok what it does

610510
jquery	simplemodal
jquery is your friend for this try simplemodal

610530
gif	png
gif or png

610542
gif	png
png is a newer format and often better than either jpeg of gif - especially for screenshots

610557
gif	png
gif is not really a very good format and png can replace it completely in compression and quality for most applications but sometimes there are compatibility issues not sure if these have been ironed out in all the current webbrowsers

610563
gif	png
png is good in both regards but that discussion tends to get a little religious because there are license fees to pay if you develop a programm that reads writes gif or jpeg while png is free

610565
gif	png
png can do all that gif can except animation and even that is coming in apng and should almost always be smaller

610565
gif	png
if png isn t smaller than gif then your software may be saving it poorly - look for png optimisation progams like pngout and pngnq

610573
gif	png
historically gif was here first then jpg then png

610573
gif	png
jpg and png work well for most applications but the files will be larger than gif for very simple graphics

610585
gif	png
jpeg can have a higher compression ratio than png gif but is lossy as the cartoon above demonstrates

610597
gif	png
despite myths to the contrary png outperforms gif in most aspects

610597
gif	png
png is capable of every image mode of gif apart from animation and when using the same image mode png will have better compression due to its superior deflate algorithm compared to lzw

610597
gif	png
png is also capable of additional modes that gif cannot do such as 24 bit color and alpha transparency but this is where you need to be careful if you forget to convert to palette mode your png image may be saved in 24 bit color which will take more space

610597
gif	png
if you find png files are larger than the equivalent gif files then you re saving the png in 24 bit color and the gif in palette mode because a gif is always in palette mode

610628
runtimeexception	invocationtargetexception
however this exception is wrapped in other exceptions a number of times in an invocationtargetexception which in turn is wrapped in a runtimeexception

610649
int	boolean
since we re dealing with boolean is true and is also true you may wonder why this didn t either work anyway true being treated as an int quantity should still mean true true is a true value or throw an exception eg

610716
put	get
the problem is that it seems when the updates are performed they don t go to mongrel with the put action instead i just get the cached page no action in the database no flash message no nothing....

610769
gif	png
despite myths to the contrary png outperforms gif in most aspects

610769
gif	png
png is capable of every image mode of gif apart from animation and when using the same image mode png will have better compression due to its superior deflate algorithm compared to lzw

610769
gif	png
png is also capable of additional modes that gif cannot do such as 24 bit color and alpha transparency but this is where you may run into problems on the web

610769
gif	png
if you find png files are larger than the equivalent gif files then you re saving the png in 24 bit color and the gif in palette mode because a gif is always in palette mode

610769
gif	png
if you find that your png files with transparency aren t working properly in ie6 while your gif files are then you are using 24 bit color + alpha transparency in png and palette mode with a transparent color with gif

610771
portrait	landscape
this seems to works ok at the moment however all the images are of the same size regardless of their orientation portrait landscape which means that only some of the photos appear properly and no all crushed up

610990
width	height
you could certainly just use a templatefield and an img tag without specifying width or height to address this

610994
union	distinct
your result set with union will eliminate distinct values

611038
appdata	denied
access to the path c users chloraphil appdata local temp tmp873b.tmp is denied

611047
mbunit	nunit
i want to add a plug for mbunit which i think is pretty much a superset of nunit features

611075
vmware	esx
i am just having a look at using powershell along with vi-toolkit to produce reports and charts showing vmware esx performance and resource usage

611102
post	get
you could use a webclient to send the login credentials to the server s login page via whatever method is required get or post but that wouldn t persist a cookie

611102
post	get
there is a way to get a webclient to handle cookies so you could just post the login info to the server then request the page you want with the same webclient then do whatever you want with the page

611122
abc	isinstance
so hasattr is useless but isinstance together with abc s provides a clean solution

611123
memset	memcmp
the problem is memset sizeof struct and setting structures members one by one produce different byte-to-byte result and therefore memcmp returns not equal result

611123
memset	memcmp
in my real code i m working with arrays of structures via generic pointers to execute memset memcmp and i m usually don t know exact type i have only sizeof struct value

611136
ncover	xunit.net	ncover	fxcop
also msbuild is intended for building something so i guess that ncover xunit.net and fxcop should not be part of it or should they

611150
jar	war
bundle code into a jar war or ear file

611154
portrait	landscape
one i keep in landscape and one i keep in portrait mode

611155
portrait	landscape
we have 1 28 monitor in landscape and 2 24 monitors in portrait which flank the big monitor

611218
hide	show
if you scroll down you can see that this function returns an object with show and hide methods

611244
width	height
your listsetcontainer needs to contain some non-floated content for it to hava a height width

611244
width	height
add a non-breaking space to the container then you should be able to set its width height as there will be something in it to render

611248
n-gram	words
a data-driven approach similar to n-gram frequency analysis that finds sets of semantically related words

611303
ostringstream	std
i prefer std ostringstream for complex concatenation

611371
int	chars
could you leave it as an int and format it for humans in your sql for example to pad with zeros to 4 chars wide

611374
getter	setter
you could use standard javabean setter getter to encapsulate your field

611472
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
rather than do it the way everyone else does windows explorer firefox google-chrome internet explorer opera certmgr etc they specifically only allow verisign

611484
uiview	calayer
i did a similar thing in order to invert the coordinate system the other way on the iphone so that a calayer hosted in a uiview would obey the mac s quartz coordinate system using the following code

611491
folder	directory
when my page loads onload i call a method createstuff that create a number of linkbuttons representing folder in a current directory which are wired to an event that changes the current directory to the one that is associated with the linkbutton

611491
folder	directory
therefore i also call createstuff in onloadcomplete resulting in the linkbuttons being updated and reflecting the folder in the new current directory

611491
folder	directory
the result is that while the text-property of the linkbuttons reflect the folder in the new directory clicking the linkbuttons doesn t fire the event

611493
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
right off the bat if viewed with firefox opera safari etc. when you click submit w o entering any values you get some nice error messages in the form the intended effect

611542
memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	strcpy	strcpy	strncpy
memcpy can be faster than strcpy and strncpy because it does not have to compare each copied byte with 0 and because it already knows the length of the copied object

611689
ffmpeg	avisynth
you can use ffmpeg or mencoder to do the actual encoding and avisynth .avs files for the actual editing

611713
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
build in a more-compliant and developer-friendly browser like firefox first test thoroughly in ie and safari google-chrome webkit and opera periodically

611860
subtraction	addition
also watch out when doing addition subtraction

611898
hide	show
the results are that the style declaration hide every fieldset but the script doesn t show step1 at all

611906
post	put
such as post put and delete in a

611906
put	get
the methods get head put

611956
post	get
where there could be advantages disadvantages might be in how specific client platforms work with post and get routines in their networking stack as well as how the web server deals with those requests

611956
post	get
nonetheless from a programmer s perspective i prefer allowing either a post with all parameters in the body or a get with all params on the url and explicitly ignoring url parameters with any post request

612012
children	parent
give the parent element an id and you can use getelementbyid to grab it and iterate its children

612022
post	get
a web form can t be used to send a request to a page that uses a mix of get and post

612035
put	get
get put and delete methods are required to be idempotent

612035
post	get
typically query strings are used to sort or filter a get request like but i suppose it makes sense on a post to also limit the scope perhaps like

612118
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade an asp.net app to .net 3.5 and switched to the newer versioning of the asp.net ajax library

612136
google-chrome	firefox
this code will work fine in webkit google-chrome but not in firefox

612146
client-side	server-side
this has the advantage of working even when javascript is turned off accessibility but at the cost of doing much more work on the server spending more time reasoning about the logical state of your page and possibly needing to duplicate client-side and server-side logic

612149
post	get
every 3 seconds i make an ajax post request to get the status of a process

612164
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout executes only once whereas setinterval repeats every x milliseconds so you d need only one

612164
setinterval	clearinterval
to cancel a setinterval use clearinterval

612179
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome but not in firefox where the

612183
versioning	upgrade
i think testing with adhoc versioning that is dragged dropped in itunes is a similar upgrade situation

612237
min	max
this can be set in the connection string by giving values for the min pool size and max pool size values

612237
min	max
i think the defaults are 0 for min pool size and 100 for max pool size but i m not sure

612241
jtextfield	jtable
i don t know if it s the same because my jtable uses jtextfield and jcombobox as editors

612243
webclient	ftpwebrequest
use the ftpwebrequest class or the plain old webclient class

612253
cpu	processors
since downloading web pages is network bound rather than cpu bound using more threads than my number of processors cores is very benificial since most of the time in each thread is spent waiting for the network to catch up

612285
serializable	deserialization
so when i said that forced a serializable which lost the name so it was not recovered upon deserialization

612350
typedef	struct
the c language standard c89 â 3.1.2.3 c99 â 6.2.3 and c11 â 6.2.3 mandates separate namespaces for different categories of identifiers including tag identifiers for struct union enum and ordinary identifiers for typedef and other identifiers

612350
typedef	struct
in c++ all struct union enum class declarations act like they are implicitly typedef as long as the name is not hidden by another declaration with the same name

612377
math.h	sqrt
i already checked to make sure that math.h exists on this system and it does define sqrt

612388
post	get
feel free to post your question there to get the responses of a few people there who have done it

612389
typedef	struct
without the typedef in some cases you can just add a forward declaration of struct foo

612439
uniq	grep
but my stubborn nature insists that i should be able to do it in bash using standard commandline tools like sort uniq find grep cut etc

612465
post	get
in that case your server could redirect non-js users to a get post page version

612476
typedef	struct
in this ddj article dan saks explains one small area where bugs can creep through if you do not typedef your struct and classes

612476
typedef	struct
typedef for struct unions or enums

612496
jar	war
pack the application in jar war ear or whatever

612507
128bit	64bit
my experience with floating point variables has always involved 4-byte multiples like singles 32 bit doubles 64bit and long doubles which i ve seen refered to as either 96-bit or 128bit

612533
hide	show
on each row of the form are links that when clicked launch a script to show new links allowing the user to add view or hide comments

612546
accessor	properties
the way i would approach this would be to manually observe the cost properties of each invoicelineitem object by implementing the to-many kvc accessor for the lineitems properties on the invoice class doing an addobserver removeobserver call in the insert remove methods respectively and then trigger the totalcost change manually using willchangevalueforkey didchangevalueforkey

612577
hash	salt
as mtnygard suggests make a sha-1 hash of the url parameters and a secret salt string

612616
hash	salt
store a salt hash instead

612620
perl	tcl
i ran the tcl autoexpect and it created a script file i then wrote couple lines of perl code that parses the lines with send and expect tags and then uses the perl expect module to run them along with some other actions

612639
division	multiplication
thus the floating-point unit of the cpu can be used to implement multiplication and division for integers

612681
public	protected
try to set the modifier property of the tab control to protected or public from the designer of the base form

612711
profiling	debugging
recently i used redgate ants profiling which seems pretty good but the application i tried to profiling was crashing due to dividebyexception where as running in inside visual studio was fine for both debugging and release

612754
tiff	bmp
if you are converting text-based documents word excel etc versus image documents tiff jpg bmp etc then it would probably explain the smaller file sizes that distiller gives you

612774
listview	gridview
i have a wpf listview gridview and the cell template contains a textblock

612845
post	get
i was going to post this as a comment on marius excellent answer but it started to get long in the tooth and i wanted to add an example

612893
post	put
you need to make a request for this resource whichever one is used in the submit action for the form tag and put all your field-value pairs in a post payload no the request

612937
spaces	delimiter
awk uses a comma surrounded by 0 or more spaces as field delimiter

612939
openerp	tryton
if this doesn t work i think you ll have to step outside of django and try to incorporate something like openerp or tryton an openerp fork into your django app

612969
width	height
for example how would i display the order of attributes height and width first so that it looks the most tidy

612976
int	double
it basically maps some description to int double string iserialiazable etc types

612994
centroid	concave
if you cared about the concave areas you can calculate a concave hull by taking the centroid of your polygon and choosing a point to start

612994
distance	polygons
for each vertex on the rectangle find the distance from the point to the polygons

613011
min	max
implement max flow min cost flow and a linear program solver

613018
freebsd	solaris
however this function is a glibc extension it is most likely not supported by other platforms neither part of the c standards nor of the posix standards afaik - this function does not exist on mac os x for example it may neither exist in solaris or freebsd

613176
trie	tree
for a huge stable list a tree trie may be the most performant

613186
put	get	post	put	post	get
in other words if your api action changes the server state rest advises us to use post put delete but not get

613208
put	get
get rid of and put a flag to indicate partial match

613246
move	drag
is there a way only from the commandline and yes i mean using absloutly no c# c++ etc to move a file into the recycle bin and have it appear as a file trashed by drag and drop or deleted via shfileoperation etc

613247
vsto	add-in
since you are writing c# code you might be better off implementing your add in as a c# vsto add-in

613254
getter	setter
if you want to custimize it you can get great use of getter and setter though this is often used for more complex situations but may be interesting

613265
client-side	server-side
you risk not getting it trimmed if the user has js disabled or doesn t support it 10 of internet users plus the development overhead of keeping your client-side and server-side logic in sync

613288
aggregate-functions	sum
if your measures are defined as using the sum aggregate-functions which is the default then analysis services will do the summing for you and you just need to add the measures together and do the division

613403
sqldatasource	detailsview
if customer lands on this page with id in querystring then i want it to load that record into detailsview via sqldatasource and have edit button enabled

613403
sqldatasource	detailsview
if customer lands on this page with out id in querystring then i want it to display blanks for first lastname record into detailsview via sqldatasource and have insert button enabled

613406
memcpy	memmove
memcpy memmove are compiler intrinsics and will usually be inlined to rep movsd or the appropriate sse instructions if your compiler can target that

613410
sorting	filtering
each view would need its own cursor sorting sequence filtering etc

613473
post	get
i don t know if you were implying this in your post or not but it isn t possible to get your public ip from your own computer

613475
expander	grid
you can define the row heights in the grid and then put the expander in the bottom row and let the grid sort it out

613495
put	get
on the key do key 4 or binary or on to pick which map to do a put get remove

613514
min	max
for instance min max memory settings

613603
jtextfield	jlabel
note i need a jtextfield rather than a jlabel because i need the thread-safe settext and wrapping capability

613613
chunked	transfer-encoding
keep in mind that if the xml file is sent with the http transfer-encoding chunked header http does not tell you how big the file will be

613643
boyer-moore	knuth-morris-pratt
investigate the kmp knuth-morris-pratt or bm boyer-moore algorithms

613651
put	get
if you don t put them in different files it s easy to get merge conflicts that take a while to fix when checked into version ctl

613673
firefox	safari
in fact i tested this on firefox 3.0.3 on windows xp firefox 3.0.4 on macos 10.4 safari 3.2.1 on macos 10.4 and omniweb 5.8 on macos 10.4 and it all works the same

613705
google-chrome	safari
it uses webkit safari google-chrome etc. to render an html page into pdf and it is free

613743
width	height
although i am sure many will suggest to use a one-dimensional array with width height elements

613761
width	height
what daniel is talking about is that you will need to allocate memory for your array dynamically when your test width height method is called

613809
kerberos	ntlm
acting on behalf of the user on another box requires delegation to be set up if integrated windows authentication ntlm kerberos is used

613897
min	max
if there is an index on the particular column it can observe that the particular value is large or smaller than any value in the index min max values take constant time to extract from indexes

613917
opera	firefox
i do it with firefox opera but i prefer firefox because of firebug

613971
portrait	landscape
i need to have the first couple of pages in landscape then switch to portrait at a certain page and out

613995
post	get
php s own session module supports fetching the session id from get and post data besides cookies

614006
post	get
since the user has a session cookie the browser will get a response and there s nothing stopping the site from doing an ajax post to save the sensitive data on their server

614091
disk	ram
for example i would like to read the assembly as a stream of bytes from the network or from a zip archive and run it from ram itself without having to create an image on the disk

614105
free	malloc
to demonstrate your point use malloc to allocate the buffer then copy the string into this buffer and don t forget to use free when you no longer need the string

614126
google-chrome	firefox
to my surprise the push method often showed to be faster especially in firefox and sometimes in google-chrome

614148
public	protected
use a public method and chain it to a protected virtual method with the core shared implementation

614188
post	get
get method is use to send the less sensitive data whereas post method is use to send the sensitive data

614188
post	get
using the post method you can send large amount of data compared to get method

614188
post	get
data sent by get method is visible in browser header bar whereas data send by post method is invisible

614204
width	height
how can i scale a div to 100 height and width inside of another element

614210
borderless	panel
a little trick i override jinternalframe to remove the extra border and the title pane so that it looks just like a borderless panel

x86	64bit
everybody seems to know it but i just found out yesterday when i used this code in a new poject if you are compiling this with vs on a 64bit windows you have to set the target platform to x86 or the code won t run

614253
integer	unsigned
when calling put on an array object the argument has to be converted to an unsigned integer first because all property names - including array indices - are strings

614255
inherited	properties
all js object s so not strings numbers true false undefined or null inherited from a base object type -- the exact implementation varies it could be c++ inherited or manually in c there are benefits to doing it in either way -- the base object type defines the default properties access methods eg

614255
put	get
otherwise the value is placed into the array s own storage if the data is sufficiently compact then the engine will use the flat array storage in which case insertion and retrieval is just a standard array indexing operation otherwise the engine will convert the array to sparse storage and put get use a map to get from propertyname to value location

614255
put	get
the specifics of how the additional storage and how put get are dispatched differs from engine to engine -- but this is the clearest i can really describe the design implementation

614275
width	height
images must have same width and height else it s useless to compare their hash values

614279
getter	setter
i heard that .length property of array in javascript engines in fact uses invisible setter and getter to achieve functionality of ecma-s standard that says whenever the length property is changed every property whose name is an array index whose value is not smaller than the new length is automatically deleted

614299
getter	setter
getter and setter can be defined in as of javascript 1.6 i think but it s not widely adopted and i haven t seen much use of it

614299

614386
getter	setter
a property is either implemented as a field or as setter getter methods

614386
getter	setter
if you have a setter method in order to perform something more whenever the value is set you also have a getter method to match even if the getter method doesn t do anything more than just return the value

614417
kde	gnome
eclipse runs fine when i use gnome session however i need to use it in kde

inherited	properties
i would like to use the value inherited capability of dependencyproperty outside of a typical wpf page such that object a is the logical parent object b and thus a value assigned to a properties on object a will automatically propogate to object b unless it has been locally set a bit like the flowdirection properties works in wpf

614649
put	get
i also haven t had much success with making the image a background image because i haven t been able to get it to show the full image--it just shows enough of the image to put behind the div

614696
telerik	componentart
although it depends on your project size and requriments i recommend devxpress and telerik web windows .i ve used componentart telerik devxpress and i think telerik is better if u are developing web applications.and devxpress are better in winforms.by the way while developing in some cases i came across especially performance problems in telerik products.nevertheless telerik is good choice for web development

614701
xslt	schematron
assuming the source data that is being validated is also in xml one approach would be to transform your set of rules into schematron which would not be hard in xslt and then use the schematron infrastructure ie stylesheets to validate your content against the schematron file

614738

opera	google-chrome
tested in opera 9 ff3 ie6 google-chrome

615150
haskell	ocaml
it is up to what exactly is the kind of applications you want to program for example for websites that need access to databases i would go for ruby and ruby on rails framework for financial applications or applications that need a lot of parallel processing i would go for a funcional programming language like haskell ocaml or the new f# these last 3 wil make you a better programer even if you don t programm a lot in them by the way c# has been lately in the latest versions adding more and more funcional programming features

615161
inherited	subclassing
on load all the columns are automatically loaded into the designated subclassing - so create a fake inherited structure with just the one class and it should do exactly as you describe

615201
hex	binary
either way it s a much better idea to actually convert the hex code to a binary string before hashing it

615202
children	parent
the method is called on the root node after that children may have two parent so it isn t as simple as calling the parent property on each node and traversing back up

615271
cos	sin
switching to lookup tables for sin cos acos

615343
post	get
1 pass via get or post the text control id

615359
cos	sin
if your goal is to rank compare distances then approximations sin and cos table lookups could drastically reduce your amount of computations required implement quick reject .

615359
cos	sin
using lookup tables with 1000 samples sin and cos sampled every the lookup uncertainty is at most 0.006284

615359
cos	sin
so if evaluating using sin and cos lookup tables for two coordinate-set pairs distances yields a certain ranking one distance appears greater than the other based on the approximation and the difference s modulus is greater than the threshold above then the approximation is valid

615377
datarow	dataview
i know this may sound crazy but i swear that on two separate ocassions via intellisense i ve seen an overload for the dataview constructor that took in a datatable and either predicate or func i don t remember what t was either datarow or datarowview

618419
vim	emacs
one real benefit is that you can learn how to work with emacs or vim and this can help you in the future when you will use remote terminals

618446
inherited	properties
when i call the get i return the actual selected value so in essence you need a custom class which inherited from the radiobuttonlist and give it an extra properties

618459
mouse	keyboard
in this case it is what we see on our monitor perhaps hear from our speakers and manipulate through our keyboard and perhaps a mouse

618483

well maven is not supposed to be good in doing fine granular tasks it is not a scripting language like bash or ant it is rather declarative - you say - i need a war or an ear and you get it

618524
put	get
if you however put enough effort in your poms and few custom plugins you ll get a much better build environment as with ant for example depends on you project of course but it gets more and more true for bigger projects

618631
prepare	execute
edit in this case your real problem appears to be mixing up prepare statements as supported by mysqli prepare and mysqli_stmt execute with plain old queries as done with mysqli query

i don t exactly know why the -1 but it probably has something to do with the margin and border not being counted towards width and the fact that a single pixel can t be devided into subpixels

618973
min	max
one way is you could group by a time scale seconds minutes etc. and query the avg max or min to reduce the data points to a smaller scale

618978

it s about databinding let s say i have an object for binding to my ui and i want to hide show it based on other properties of the object

619128
hide	show
if you have a container widget which holds a panel you want to show and hide why not layout your inner panel however you want then add it to the container panel then use static methods against the container to say

619191
put	get
when put into il - you get this

619244
boost	stl
this means teaching them about the stl containers and algorithms and some of the boost libraries at first so the first thing they think about when needing a group of things is a vector

619247
pop-up	dialog
when it fails the first thing it does is pop-up a dialog saying the feature you are trying to use is on a cd rom or other removable disk that is not available. the dialog provides a text box to enter a path and a browse button to find it so i provide the path click the open button and get this error error 1706.no valid source could be found for product microsoft .net compact framework 3.5

619251
yacc	bison
6 take a look at lex and yacc or flex and bison

619296
snmp	mib
there are jmx snmp connectors you can use to map values to a mib and generate traps

619382
mp3	wav
if you need to analyse a digital audio stream mp3 wav live input etc bear in mind that while pitch detection of simple monophonic sounds is quite advanced polyphonic pitch detection is an unsolved problem

619406
multiplying	transpose
multiplying it by it s own transpose

619428
decoder	encoder
there is only one modern use for escape unescape that i know of and that s as a quick way to implement a utf-8 encoder decoder by leveraging the utf-8 processing in uricomponent handling

619474
free	malloc
you could do this in the bad old days of malloc free but not for new

619544
cpython	pypy
part of the compiler toolchain includes an experimental jit generator now in its fifth incarnation and starting to work really well - the goal is for a jited pypy to run much faster than cpython

619572
ienumerable	ienumerator
ienumerable and ienumerator are both interfaces

619572
ienumerable	ienumerator
ienumerable has just one method whereas ienumerator has 2 methods movenext and reset and a property current

619574
ienumerable	ienumerator
ienumerable is an interface that defines one method getenumerator which returns an ienumerator interface this in turn allows readonly access to a collection

619608
serializable	deserialization
if so custom serializable and deserialization with explicit schema version numbering i d say

619636
ienumerable	ienumerator
an ienumerable is a thing that can be enumerated...which simply means that it has a getenumerator method that returns an ienumerator

619636
ienumerable	ienumerator
but you d still need to return that ienumerator in an ienumerable class

619648
mouse	keyboard
i need to automate load tests on a .net desktop application using an automated script preferably one that is able to record mouse clicks and keyboard entries

619713
bazaar	git
take a look at this article comparing subversion mercurial git and bazaar for managing the files in a home directory including image files and large photoshop files that are being edited and versioned

619804
stdout	stderr
i am suspicious that the mysql password prompt is not actually on stdout or stderr although i don t know how that could be or if it means i could trap it

619804
stdout	stderr
it simulates a tty and gets all output even that which bypasses stdout and stderr

619819
hide	show
edit this code should go into your handler i assume you already have your show s and hide s in there

619838
tinyurl	bit.ly
i would do a lot of research on tinyurl and bit.ly to see how they ve addressed these issues

619847
post	get
this works on the rewritten pages but on the default.aspx in the root dir i get a message that the verb post is not allowed on iis 6 and i have no control over mappings

619849
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
sharpdevelop monodevelop

619868
children	parent
the multi-model screencast from ryan bates explains how to add multiple children on the fly but doesn t delve into multiple parent

619900
getter	setter
the user class has the expected load insert update and delete methods setter getter and a few others

619957
calloc	malloc
since you are using c99 you could avoid calloc malloc if you really want to by using c99 s variable array declaration

620011
hash	md5
a good idea for passwords is to convert the password into a md5 hash and store that as the user s password

620040
pull	push
looks a little weird but basically it gets fired after a push or pull is completed but before it is committed

620041
versioning	upgrade
i m using oracle 10g and hibernate 2.1 old versioning but not allowed to upgrade to fix

620045
getter	setter
i know about properties and i could write getter and setter on the person object

620119
hash	salt
furthermore you should store just a salt hash of the password instead of the password itself

620119
hash	salt
you can use the following function to generate and check a salt hash with a random salt value

620121
telerik	radwindow
you could use radwindow from telerik the jquery ui dialog plugin like tvanfosson recommended or you could take a look at

620139
jquery	jqmodal
i have used both the ajax modal extender as well as the jquery jqmodal both have worked pretty well

620139
jquery	jqmodal	jquery	simplemodal	jqmodal	simplemodal
if i were to pick an option today i would probably pick the jqmodal or simplemodal for jquery

620144
wmi	managementeventwatcher
- using wmi query with managementeventwatcher

620153
post	put
i ve put together a basic applet where the user selects a file from their hard drive it reads the first line of this file and passes that off to javascript for some additional preprocessing and then when you click a button it tries to upload that file through an http post request

620172
sproutcore	cappuccino
since then two amazing frameworks have appeared sproutit s sproutcore and 280 north s cappuccino +objective-j

620249
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r youruser yourgroup .

620302
getdate	dateadd
in sql server you can use dateadd mi -1 getdate

620304
int	double
on some cpu s double in general suffer from the same problem - on the other hand while a floating-point square root will block the fp pipeline it won t prevent you from executing int instructions simultaneously

620317
pull	push
first attempt to pull from the same refspec that you are trying to push to

620336
int	double
when i is an int and d is a double works but does not

620348
int	double
i i + d does not work because you would be assigning a double to an int and that is not allowed

620348
int	double
the + operator casts the double automatically to an int so that is why it works

620399
hide	show
at runtime you can call setstatusbarhidden on your application to show hide the status bar

620439
pull	push
push pull with per-user permissions not tied to linux accounts

620465
getter	setter	equals	tostring	tostring	getter
this in turn references a source template for getter setter equals tostring etc that was written to trim all java.lang.string properties in the setter

620530
superclass	subclassing
so looking up str would return a string and looking up classb would return this is classa or a subclassing the problem is i don t know how to find the superclass or rather trace the mro chain of a type object

620532
sproutcore	cappuccino
sproutcore and cappuccino are frameworks for front-end development that require the user to have both javascript and css enabled

620532
sproutcore	cappuccino
i like the fact that sproutcore and cappuccino and probably others are testing the limits of what s possible within a web browser

620542
width	height
in order to set the height and width of the element you need to set it s display mode to block and use float to align the elements horizontally

620550
width	height
in css elements with display inline cannot have width or height applied to them

620550
width	height
ie will incorrectly convert any inline element to inline-block if you give them a width or height

620570
onchange	onblur
on the onblur or onchange clientside events you should check two textbox s values

620595
button	checkbox
when the submit button is clicked use javascript to post the post data by grabbing everything in row whose checkbox is checked

620621
cvs	svn
a developer should have enough know how today to setup a development environment with a webserver ftp ssh svn cvs on a unix based system.

620653
children	parent
in that i am showing the data in hierarchical format in that i have one parent with two children

620653
children	parent
in the parent i have a checkbox and when i select the checkbox i have to remove the existing data of children and replace with new ones

620662
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
then you can use a combination of nsurlconnection nsxmlparser and key-value coding to make it almost as easy

620672
floating-point	integer
for example it used to be true that computations done in a floating-point unit were almost always slower than similar computations done in an integer unit

620672
floating-point	integer
if you can keep multiple integer units and a floating-point unit busy at once that s a plus

620695
getter	setter
because you have implicit getter and setter functions and you cannot modify the result of a function as it is a const parameter

620695
getter	setter
see the different behaviors in the following code with the explicit getter and setter functions

620702
sorting	filtering
if you re just displaying data or sorting and filtering using the methods properties provided by arraycollection rather than editing the array directly it should have no effect on the underlying shared array

620721
int	double
if you have a type that is constantly created and discarded like an int float double etc then you can get a good boost by turning these into structs

620724
cvs	svn
it is similar to cvs you can use revision you just have to set the keyword property for that file for svn to know it is supposed to do a keyword replace

620726
sproutcore	cappuccino
in this regard sproutcore and cappuccino are giant improvements in my book

620749
simplemodal	blockui
for simplemodal displays i ve found blockui to be a great solution

620752
post	get
in the edited section of my post i have included what error messages exactly i get

620816
post	put
the only ones that will do what you want according to the specification are put and post

620816
post	put
so if you don t want to use post use put

620859
width	height
you need to offset by the width height of the tile

620871
implements	extends
you can further extends this by creating objects that all implements the same interface and are in a repository of handlers that your run method can iterate over to see which will handle it

620876
clsid	createobject
when vbscript uses new or createobject the registration ensures that com knows what dll to load in order to make a new instance whether by name or clsid

620928
prng	random
say you did use a base pseudo random number generator prng

620928
prng	random
since your simulation would only be as random as the other prng you were using you may as well just use the other prng directly without all the extra work

620928
prng	random
in fact your simulation may not do anything except make the output less random than the values from your base prng

620929
width	height
actually the width of the background orange in this case is identical with the height of the surrounding jframe which is .

620932
firefox	safari
testing with firefox 3.0.7 safari 3.2.2 and msie 7.0.5730.13 all on winxp sp3 it appears that everything within the tags is completely omitted from the dom tree

620957
updatepanel	scriptmanager
you have to register your script with the page scriptmanager to work within an updatepanel

620976
cpython	ironpython
i m not sure exactly how you re drawing the conclusion that ironpython is faster than cpython

621003
rar	zip
text files will be mostly alphabetical characters while binary files - especially compressed ones like rar zip and such - will tend to have bytes more evenly represented

621015
inherited	subclassing
if you had things that were subclassing of other things in the lookup or you wanted to support multiple inherited you d have to pick out the one that was the first in mro

621033
width	height
if you have this label in the center of a borderlayout the size is always the full size of the container minus north+south height minus east+west width

621079
subtract	add
your best bet is to probably have a sorted dictionary of coin sizes and then loop through them checking if your change is greater than the value add that coin and subtract the value otherwise move along to the next row in the dictionary

621087
folder	directory
it s located in the root directory of a web application so for sharepoint it s usually located in the folder c inetpub wwwroot wss virtualdirectories sharepoint80 where sharepoint80 is the name of your web application

621144
serializable	deserialization
over the wire it is transfered as an array of objects this is the standard way of sending lists arrays etc but wcf does the serializable deserialization for you so as far as your client server are concerned the collections are generic

621168
suppressfinalize	finalizer
i don t see any need to call suppressfinalize if there s no finalizer defined

621230
jboss	glassfish
all you need is an ide like intellij eclipse or netbeans the jdk the java ee download and a servlet container like tomcat or a full-blown application server like glassfish or jboss

621293
integer	unsigned
wikipedia page on signed number representations explains the difference in the representation at the bit level and the integer computer science page provides a table of ranges for each signed unsigned integer type

621319
versioning	upgrade
these determine how the msi can be installed and if it upgrade overwrites or installs beside any other versioning of the same application

621319
versioning	upgrade
for instance if you have two versioning of your software and they have different upgrade codes then to windows they are completely different pieces of software regardless of what the name is

621343
globalization	localization
if instead you are asking whether or not you can use something like code pages in vb.net the answer is an indirect yes although i see no reason to jump through that hoop to support globalization localization as the paradigm has shifted

621344
post	get
i m also planning to add ways to get extra mojo like post of the day or favorite blog of the week contests with prizes of around 3-10 mojo

621392
hide	show
c don t hide anything and make the wordpress install show up with a different theme

621396
firefox	safari
i only tested it on firefox and safari

621396
firefox	safari
the web app runs fine on both safari and firefox but it gives a permission denied error on ie

621396
firefox	safari
this does not happen with either firefox or safari

621401
width	height
i specify the span s background color image width and height in css

621418
postgresql	mysql
i use sql server 2005 mysql and postgresql regularly

621418
postgresql	mysql
i m tired of using microsoft s sql tool for sql server phpmyadmin for mysql and pgadmin for postgresql

621423
postgresql	mysql
you could try a company called toad by toad soft they don t handle postgresql but there are tools for mysql and sql server

621434
cout	cin
you can then use infile as you would use cin and outfile as you would use cout

621447
getter	setter
the advantage to this is that you have a nice clean interface to how port_t objects must be used and lets you keep private things private non-private things need getter setter functions for the client to access them

621478
ironruby	rubinius	jruby	rubinius
a look at the different ruby virtual machines jruby maglev ironruby rubinius macruby and how to choose what fits best within the enterprise

621503
dbml	edmx
also dbml is used in linq to sql l2s - edmx is the mapping used in the ado entity framework

621519
datamapper	activerecord
i would suggest looking at the activerecord and datamapper patterns

621565
vb.net	vb6
i have upgraded my project from vb6 to vb.net

621661
16-bit	64bit	x86	64bit
and the exception of course is x86 where a word is 16 bit wide because x86 was originally a 16-bit cpu a dword is 32-bit because it became a 32-bit cpu and a qword is 64bit because it now has 64bit extensions bolted on

621671
x86	64bit
all you youngsters yappin on about 32 bit thiss and 64bit that you know there were and are other machine architectures than the x86 family

621716
ubuntu	linux
and i also get a completely different scan code on linux ubuntu from getrawkeycode

621739
button	checkbox
make the next button a submit button which goes to the next page read the checkbox values out of the post data and set them manually on the next page

621753
width	height
now the system loops all the child elements and gets their dimensions width height left right into array like this

621770
freebsd	linux
you likely want uuid4 which generates a random uuid and uses os support if available on linux mac freebsd and likely others

621844
telerik	radcombobox
i m using the telerik radcombobox control

621849
width	height
the getsubimage method will take the x y and the width and height of the desired subimage so the desired sprite can be obtained

621860
srp	principles
in particular this blog is a good place to read up on srp and the other keystone principles of good oo design

621869
width	height
you just have to specify the source image where you want to draw the sprite on your graphics object x y width height and in what frame of the image the sprite is located x y width height

621869
width	height
assuming the width and the height of the sprite are the same width and height that you want to draw on the drawing area you could define your own method to draw a sprite frame as follows

621869
width	height
you could draw them with tiles so you d be drawing four sprites for each of the big images in this case or you could manually figure out what x y width and height to use for those sprites

621869
width	height
here x and y are the position you want to draw the sprite on your graphics object 15 is the number of columns in your sprite sheet 19 is the frame numbering starts at 0 and 25 is the width and height of each sprite i approximated

621891
innodb	myisam
you ll find people who are using myisam or those that are using innodb but aren t using it anyway

621891
union	distinct
the difference between them is that union all is a simple concatenation and should be preferred wherever possible whereas a union will implicitly do a distinct to remove duplicate tuples

621891
union	distinct
union like distinct have their place

621893
many-to-many	one-to-many
i then will use many-to-many and one-to-many tables to display the info

621902
free	malloc
you will need to create special malloc and free wrappers in port.h as well

621909
post	get
now imagine that you just do exactly that but instead of taking your main thread to that action you fire an asynchronus thread that will work just as any other link for instance which will post get data and get an x response which you can handle through js later on thus giving you the ilusion of real time queryes

621947
implements	extends
in actionscript 3.0 i want to extends classa and implements interfaceb

621947
getter	setter
flex builder won t compile this and asks me to override the getter setter methods as they are defined in classa but overriding the data property in classa is not what i want

621964
put	get
the left and top values i ve put in may be a little off but you can tweak to get what you want

621964
width	height
i ve corrected the pixel values and added a width to your line div and a height since ie defaults all divs to one text line high

621964
width	text-align
also your title div should be full width with text-align right so that the title will expand to the left instead of the right

621967
children	parent
if you do you can have position absolute on the children and their position will be relative to the parent

621973
post	get
if possible you may want to get the profile from the request object itself rather than what s being submitted from the post values

621992
sorting	grouping
to avoid the overhead of sorting that grouping by produces add order by null

621992
children	parent
the answer above only gets children of a parent not all descendants

622000
subtraction	modulo
written this way to avoid an unneccesary extra modulo or subtraction

622003
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this will display consistently in firefox 3 ie 7 ie 8 opera 9 and google-chrome 1

622017
ready	each
i tried to find a place where i can find ready to copy list of all functions and classes available in each stl header file

622019
printf	fgets
i would like the output to reflect that it called fgets and printf at least 14 times and it did hit the disk after all - there should be some measured time surely

622032
profiler	shark
shark is the profiler that is included in the developer tools

622047
valgrind	callgrind
i think that you could try various valgrind tools especially callgrind used to get call counts and inclusive cost for each call happening in your program

622060
perl	tcl
does all your 4 points and also works for perl python ruby and tcl

622097
srp	principles
the trick here is to follow the single responsibility principles srp and separate those kinds of code that you have to fiddle with from those kinds that are deterministic

622097
ocp	principles
so if you are writing the kind of code that is hard to test first you should take care to follow the dependency inversion principles dip and the open closed principles ocp in order to keep the code decoupled enough to test after the fact

622134
client-side	server-side
but client-side javascript cannot access the filesystem from the web browser so you would need some other way server-side code to make changes to the css file itself

622140
width	height
i have the coordinates of the top left point of a rectangle as well as its width height and rotation from 0 to 180 and -0 to -180

622145
inherited	properties
a virtual inherited properties can be overridden in a derived class by

622153
ocp	principles
read more about the open closed principles here uncle bob s original ocp whitepaper

622266
inherited	properties
in the example above it s okay for gettypeid to query the typeid of attr because typeid is a properties of an attribute and because attr is a t it must be a type that inherited from attribute

622301
hide	show
then it s just a matter of wiring up events to show and hide the popup and you re all set

622303
post	get
you can pass information between pages using get or post methods

622308
dnf	yum
you can use sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb for debian based distros yum install mysql-python for rpm-based or dnf install python-mysql for modern fedora distro in command line to download.

622336
cassini	iis
i m using win xp and i was using cassini but i want to give a tray to iis instead of

622354
touchesmoved	touchesended
basically you have to remember the last position on each touch event and draw a line from the last to the current position in touchesmoved and touchesended

622366
post	get
you are looking for post and get variables it s done in the method parameter of your html form

622366
post	get
post and get were made for different purposes

622367
mouse	keyboard
by idle i mean the state when there s no user activity keyboard mouse or any other else

622374
min	max
just to make clear i understand that constants like ï need somewhere and functions that are applied on more than one number like min max

622374
pow	sin
the question was mainly concerning methods which only effect a single number such as round abs sin pow etc

622393
spaces	linefeed
what you can t see here is that there is a blank - either a spaces or cr linefeed after the closing

622394
disk	ram
if you ve got swap space enabled the system should be able to swap out any low priority processes such that they re not consuming and real resources but beware of a big hit on disk i o each time your folding home client swaps in and out of ram

622403
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i don t have a mac and really don t wanna incur the test cost of ie firefox opera safari google-chrome across all the myriad versions and platforms

622423
cpu	affinity
of course if you intend to set affinity to a single cpu only that cpu would be of interest its still the sixth field in units of user_hz or typically in 100 ths of a second

622423
jobs	cron
cron jobs tend to run

622442
src	attr
#buttonimage attr src data.imagesrc

622443
migrate	staging
having a reversible migration is fine for development and staging but assuming well tested code it should be extremely rare that you would ever want to migrate down in production

622450
folder	directory
however if you do find yourself with mergeinfo properties on individual files and folder there are two things you can do the first thing is simply to remove the svn mergeinfo property from the files and directory in question

622454
post	get
you can change method from post to get

622463
firefox	safari
i have some of my users what os and browsers they are using and they usually say a mac os and firefox or safari

622484
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
i regularly use ff3 and ie7 so my vm has in it ie6 ff2 google-chrome opera and safari

622491
post	get
since the ajax call in convertnow uses get instead of post it is possible that a browser is returning a cached result whenever parameters are identical to a previous call

622645
webkit	gecko
you need a html renderer gecko webkit et al

622707
qpainter	qimage
this is easily possible by opening a qpainter on a qimage

622729
direct3d	directx
the most important competitor to opengl is direct3d not the whole directx

622730
postgresql	mysql
db your obvious choices are mysql and postgresql

622763
easymock	jmock
i did not found a way to do this expectation in java using easymock or jmock and i think it is not possible

622773
nsmutablestring	nsstring
for instance objective-c and cocoa define both an nsstring class immutable and an nsmutablestring class

622784
post	get
back in your action you can create an instance of your form class and validate your post get vars against that form

622787
erlang	lisp
many functional programming languages such as lisp haskell erlang f# and clojure encourage immutable data structures by their very nature

622835
multiplication	modulo
short answer multiplication and modulo operations

622837
apache	lighttpd
rest offers two advantages here first the tcp ip time often does dominate the message transmission and that s pretty well optimized in production web servers like apache or lighttpd

622858
children	parent
clarification setting enabled to false for a parent control will also disable any children

622876
hide	show
hide all forms and only show the one main form

622934
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome both support the const keyword

622949
hash	md5
md5 is generally considered insecure if hash collisions are a major concern

622949
hash	md5
you can try to create your own hash â it would probably not be as good as md5 and security through obscurity is likewise not advisable

622949
hash	whirlpool
and in the light of comments let me make it clear i mean publish both the sha-256 and the whirlpool values for the file â not combining hash algorithms to create a single value but using separate algorithms to create separate values

622955
salt	md5
another good option is used salt md5

622955
hash	md5
for example the input to your md5 hash function is appended with string acidzom

622981
int	double
objects are passed by reference value where the value is the reference things that inherit from object primitive values int long double etc. are passed by value

623022
post	get
specifically talking about php the arrays are used very often the language itself uses them for example to grab the get and post parameters

623031
int	chars
the putchar function echoes to the screen whilst returning the int value of that chars

623040
vim	emacs
i am currently using nano and i ve heard of vim and emacs but don t know what the benefits of them are over eachother

623053
for-loop	arrays
these days when ever i see the boilerplate for-loop to iterate over an arrays one-by-one using an index variable it makes me want to scream

623053
for-loop	arrays
clearly the code has meaning to iterate over the collection rather than the old for-loop saying how to iterate over an arrays

623060
vim	emacs
i am currently using nano and i ve heard of vim and emacs but don t know what the benefits of them are over eachother

623060
vim	emacs
vim and emacs are very flexible editors that support a whole bunch of different usages

623068
vim	emacs
vim and emacs but don t know what the

623068
vim	emacs
emacs via a variety of lisp and vim via its own scripting language

623068
vim	emacs
i personally use emacs so i can t say much about vim but you should be able to find lots of information about both online

623068
atom-editor	sublimetext
i recommend looking at sublimetext or atom-editor

623075
vim	emacs
for editors you probably want either vim or emacs

623077
scons	autotools
gnu autotools cmake scons jam etc

623095
width	height
for the player and each ghost i can retrieve the x y image width and height attributes

623115
vim	emacs
i am currently using nano and i ve heard of vim and emacs but don t know what the benefits of them are over eachother

623115
kde	gnome
if you re using linux with a window manager kde gnome etc. you could also consider using the standard text editor for your window manager

623115
vim	emacs
the main benefit it would have over vim emacs nano is that it would seem more familiar to one coming from a windows environment - an editor written to run on the window manager has a menu bar file open save dialogs undo redo and plenty of other neat features that console editors probably can t match

623115
vim	emacs
though emacs and vim are pretty sophisticated these days so who knows

623116
put	get
once you build a database using one of the above providers you can then perform actions on the database using your programming language of choice in your case c# to get data out of and put data into it

623121
postgresql	mysql
ms sql and it s derivatives are database applications much like oracle mysql or postgresql

623159
hash	md5
my text file says the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog however when i try to get the hash from this file both the md5 and sha1 is different from the wikipedias result

623215
width	height
these provide the height and width of the image file itself rather than just the image element

623228
typedef	typename
typedef typename in ancestor types aren t inherited by template classes

623237
getter	setter
everything else inferred variables automatic getter setter collection initializers property initializers lambda are just compiler magics not dependent on 3.5

623241
post	get
silverlight only supports setting headers using the post method not the get method

623250
mouse	keyboard
the formclosingevent provides a formclosingeventargs with a closereason but the reason doesn t distinguish between using a mouse or the keyboard

623294
vim	emacs
editor vim and emacs are popular

623294
scons	autotools
i am quite familiar with both scons and autotools but i still use make for small couple of files projects

623322
super	implements
if i see that it or any of its super classes implements idisposable i make sure i call dispose on it

623397
hide	show
mind you i don t want to change which tab is active i want to completely hide one tab then show it and hide another tab

623417
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tend to agree with the use a table advocates but after messing around for a while in a not really knowing what i m doing kind of way i came up with this variation which fixes the vertical align problem in firefox safari google-chrome etc and doesn t make it any worse in ie

623503
yacc	bison
what is the difference between flex lex and yacc bison

623503
yacc	bison
can i install pure lex and yacc on ubuntu or i can install only flex and bison

623506
yacc	bison
bison is the gnu implementation extension of yacc flex is the successor of lex

623509
vim	emacs
before you turn into a bash shell vim emacs junkie try a few gui based tools first so you have some transition time.

623509
vim	emacs
i m sure the longhairs will scoff and claim that vim or emacs gives them the best and fastest development environment but different strokes for different folks

623520
getattr	setattr
from my python knowledge i would say that datetime overrides setattr getattr but i am not sure

623535
yacc	bison
yacc and bison are pretty closely compatible though bison has some extra tricks it can do

623535
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
lex and yacc are maintained by the unix svrx licencees - companies such as ibm aix hp hp-ux and sun solaris have modified versions of lex and yacc at their command

623564
folder	directory
with every different solution you have create folder foreign name foreign silverlight toolkit in this case in your root solution directory

623610
pop-up	dialog
once the user clicks ok the first dialog is dismissed you check the result in your application and if the expected file doesn t exist pop-up an error dialog informing them that the chosen directory was not correct

623610
pop-up	dialog
you could give them the option of retrying which would just pop-up the first dialog again

623614
disk	ram
this tells you the percentage of pages that were read from ram that didn t have to incur a read from disk a cache hit ratio lower then 85 will mean that the server will benefit from additional ram

623618
accessor	properties
i tend to think of accessor as implicitly being properties accessor -- that is the term implies that it s more or less there to provide direct access to the object s internal state

623626
getter	setter
so generally that applies just to getter and setter

623630
pop-up	dialog
when i run or debug my compiled program i d like the option of having a dialog pop-up which asks me for the command line parameters

623631
getter	setter
by accessors i tend to think of getter and setter

623631
getter	setter
it seems fairly straight forward that the add instance method is not a getter nor a setter

623661
button	checkbox
the problem with this method is when the usercontrol is visible i cannot click any controls button checkbox in the window behind the usercontrol

623696
width	height
testing this out shows that the width is updated correctly but the height can only expand.

623703
draggable	droppable
im using the standard ui draggable and droppable

623736
inherited	properties
i personally usually find control more useful to inherited from because i usually don t need a lot of the extra stuff you get from webcontrol such as the styling properties since i usually just style through a single cssclass properties

623751
awt	swing
in java awt or swing the reverse is really true

623809
fputcsv	fgetcsv
try searching php.net for fgetcsv and fputcsv

623824
accessor	properties
i am looking to extending an interface by providing set accessor to properties in that interface

623851
spaces	delimiter
i think for a programming site most of your tags will not be multi-word so it makes to use a spaces delimiter

623856
getter	setter
if you want getter and setter for a field you must do this

623930
ffmpeg	libavformat
and you do have the libavformat implementation in ffmpeg as a reference

623954
swt	swing
it works with swing and swt its syntax is very concise and clear and it has a debug mode that s unbelievably useful

623961
ati	nvidia
nvidia and ati both support exr data in their graphics cards

623976
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the problem i am having is that within a select box only firefox supports .hide on option values i can t figure out a snappy approach for ie safari opera and google-chrome

623996
getter	setter
chris answer is likely all you ll need for the scenario you ve outlined but consider a slightly more complex scenario where you need a getter setter on your class but the interface only defines the getter

624010
switching	screens
you can visualize the distinction by putting your computer into screens capture mode cmd-shift-4 and pressing the space bar to switching to capture whole window

624050
wxpython	pyqt
wx and wxpython has two events i miss in pyqt

624066
mouseleave	mouseenter
instead of the ismouseover property you can use mouseenter and mouseleave events

624082
min	max
this is more efficient as you only have a worst case of two if statements checking the angle whereas the other approach has a worst case of twelve 6 for each component when checking the other three corners to see if they are greater than the current max or less than the current min i think

624090
udp	mtu
packet encapsulation for vpns poorly-designed or implemented udp protocols and l1 l2 protocols that drop the end-to-end mtu below endpoint values can all cause ip fragmentation

624172
post	get
in other words i am going to make multiple get post requests and i want the cookies to be persisted to a storage so that consecutive request will be identified by the remote host

624322
ready	each
you could just wait several times for a single object each until you have collected as many ready objects as you want

624327
struts	stripes	codeigniter	cakephp
for php there is codeigniter kohanaphp and cakephp and in the java realm you might want to look at struts 2 stripes and spring

624333
min	max
i have been trying unsuccessfully to write a query which finds the first hole of n size between the min and max numbers

624333
min	max
if i want to find a hole of size 50 row 1 s max of 200 would be returned there is a hole of 50 between that and row 2 s min a hole of 20 would return row 2s max of 300 etc

624338
width	height
you can t change the stage width and height from actionscript those properties are read-only

624347
min	max
my solution if you re able would be to change your database schema and code so that each time a new row is inserted the previous row is updated with the difference between the max of that row and the min of the new row with that difference value stored in its own column

624365
width	height
but if the swf is embedded in a web page then changing its element width and height will change the stage size and scalemode will determine how that is handled

624444
post	get
don t expose user ids passwords in urls which might be cached login via form post rather than get url

624446
folder	directory
if you want to compress the entire directory you ll need to walk the entire directory and call deviceiocontrol on each file folder

624456
ubuntu	debian
the package is also available in debian ubuntu repositories

624457
button	checkbox
ultimately my goal is to build arrays of radio checkbox button dynamically server-side

624517
classname	inherited
the only problem with this method is that you will have to create your own class that inherited from the one you need to test for idispose and override the dispose method so you can set a flag saying that it has been called initialize the flag in a constructor and check it in the destructor which you implement with classname .

624554
int	chars
java arrays use a java signed int for access as per the languge spec so it s impossible to have an string which is backed by a chars array longer than integer.max_int

624580
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
it contains several checkbox radiobuttons and a dropdownlistfor

624612
memcached	apc
for read performance you can implement a caching system using apc memcached or others

624614
versioning	upgrade
background to facilitate auto-updates from within media center we may execute msiexec.exe qb i mediabrowser.msi if a user elect to upgrade an existing versioning

624616
rss	feed
if you have a simple rss reader with a database you might have a couple of tables for storing feed ignoring dealing with subscribers here

624616
rss	feed
this works in most cases but for many websites web based applications you might have a main feed from the frontpage and then category feed if you take both into the above sort of system there s going to be a lot of replicated data due to the same post appearing in several rss feed

624616
rss	feed
i had thoughts after reading the responses of linking content and removing duplicates only when the post is no longer in either rss feed to save on space but again as assaf has said the space savings could make this a waste of time

624673
imperative	declarative
i think that the gap between engineers and non-engineers customers marketing slave traders etc. is a little like the contrast between declarative and imperative programming

624677
post	get
there s a great new post series going on over at that actually is describing from the get go how to go about designing an application with ddd in mind

624680
minimum	max	min	max
i m not following your logic there - the gap between the maximum of row 2 300 and minimum of row 3 330 is 30 if you are including either the min or max values 29 if not

624704
pull	push
implement this using three stacks and constant additional memory so that the amortized time for any push pop or pull operation is constant

624721
rss	feed
..but what happens when bob decides to add adverts to his rss feed changing the content from hi

624721
post	get
there s possibly neater ways to do that but my point is that it can get very complicated and you will probably only save a few kilobytes assuming the database engine doesn t do any compression itself on a very limited subset of post

624723
rss	feed
i m attempting to load up an xml document specifically an rss feed via an ajax request parse it and insert some information based on said feed into my page

624723
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the code works fine in firefox opera google-chrome and safari but not ie7

624761
bazaar	git
this is the kind of problem that a centralized model will ultimately run into and one of the motivating factors behind systems like bitkeeper git bazaar and mercurial

624819
folder	directory
once compiled the directory is not included as part of the precompiled folder

624853
prepare	pdostatement	prepare	execute
give pdo prepare and pdostatement execute a read

624913
prepare	execute
i went the other way and made a class that extends pdo with a bunch of wrapper functions around prepare execute and it s much nicer than the built in functions though that s a bit subjective...

624914
hash	md5
then i have blobs of xyz bits required for my checksum md5 sha1 sha512 etc one blob for each in a checksum hash table looked up by fileid

624999
rss	feed
when following sites like this using an rss feed you don t have to read every article that comes through

625013
hide	show
my custom tab control is built dynamically with asp.net but the tabbing and the hide show functionality is all jquery

625025
google-chrome	firefox
the menu looks great in firefox google-chrome etc but in ie7 the menu drop downs don t break through the nested divs

625059
gridview	repeater
i have a gridview control nested within a repeater

625076
awt	swing
the app is pure java and i think it s all mostly swing and awt

625102
sorting	filtering
i can pass in delegates for filtering and sorting which works fine but being able to use linq expressions would be much more elegant

625123
ienumerable	iqueryable
update it works when i make query ienumerable instead of iqueryable

625132
versioning	upgrade
that environment was upgrade to versioning 4 before we did the export â import process for migrating it to the current environment

625201
post	get
you can also streamline the pages that you re sending to your mobile users so they don t get a big bloated page when they just wanted to read your blog post or whatever

625225
put	get
i m using sclistener to get the iphone s volume but i d like to put an observer on the volume

625256
folder	directory
is it simply a matter of copying my django project folder to another directory launching the server there and continuing my dev work in the original directory

625258
post	get
therefore you can use a post request when the size of the data exceeds the intrinsic size limitation for a get request

625270
free	malloc
doing free request_buffer will it free all the bytes allocated by malloc i.e sizeof ts_request_def + 2 1024 1024

625320
multi-query	mysql
for mysql you can use multi-query to execute multiple sql statements in a single call

625323
put	get
edit to store more than one piece of data in one node or list slot write a class that has your data as fields private and exposed via set and get methods if you want it to be particularly clean and put instances of that class into the list

625336
jquery	jqmodal
try one of the excellent jquery plugins for displaying modal windows such as jqmodal

625358
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
thus i have defined an abstract subclassing of usercontrol that defines these properties and updated the .xaml.cs and .g.cs files to inherited from this base class

625396
free	malloc
all it takes is to free the malloc ed block

625418
width	height
dockpanel - fixed to the height and width of the vb6 form

625430
free	malloc
malloc free doesn t know or care about the type of the object just the size

625442
pop-up	dialog
i have found the jquery dialog very easy to create pop-up s

625476

625522
fpdf	fpdi
you can do this with fpdi extension for fpdf

625530
vsto	add-in
okay weird situation i need to debug a vsto office add-in

625559
hash	salt
adding salt to your hash function doesn t really serve any purpose if the digest function has been compromised because the salt will have to be made public to be used and the attacker can adjust their file to factor this in too

625559
hash	md5
md5 has shown to be vulnerable to hash collision but i believe sha-1 has not so far

625562
hash	md5
as for collisions i don t think you need to worry about entire files having the same md5 or sha1 hash

625562
hash	salt
if you add salt to the file you need to send the salt so the user can verify the hash

625582
hash	md5
md5 and sha1 are cryptographic hash intended for the second kind of application

625582
hash	salt
as for salt it makes the computation of the cryptographic hash local by mixing in some random non-secret value this value is called the salt

625585
hash	md5
the attack against crc-32 is irrelevant if the hash you are using is not crc-32 - md5 and sha-1 are not vulnerable to that kind of attack yet

625585
hash	md5
the current attacks against md5 are where an attacker creates two documents with the same hash

625585
hash	salt
salt are used for password verification - they prevent an attacker performing an offline attack against the password database - each user s password has a salt attached to the plain-text before the hashing - then a pre-computed rainbow table of plaintext - hash text is useless

625640
hash	md5
i seen md5 and sha1 hash on the net to verify files

625687
folder	directory
in my c project src folder i have only the test.java file and the assets directory which contains pacman.png

625721
superclass	subclassing
i have a superclass with two subclassing

625994
tabcontrol	tabitem
in a prism v2 application i define two regions each a tabitem in a tabcontrol

626084

626096
width	height
basically i now have a field that indicates whether to swap height width which is only active for the time when the original jlabel does its painting

626123
realloc	malloc
in our c++ iam current using realloc method to resize the memory allocated by malloc

626143
free	realloc
once realloc successfully returns the previous block has been free and all pointers to it have become dangling â adjust them

626143
realloc	malloc
realloc as well as malloc don t care what is the pointer type - you can use void as well as anything

626175
put	get
but no mater where i put that declaration i get error syntax error

626205
gridview	objectdatasource
assuming you have a table with tasks and assigned dates create a dataset with a tableadapter for said table and use an objectdatasource on your page that takes the selected calendar day as a param and returns the rows to a gridview

626241
realloc	malloc
malloc and realloc are c functions

626241
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
actually realloc does malloc and free depending on the arguments you pass

626241
realloc	malloc
if you pass it a null pointer realloc does what malloc does

626241
free	realloc
if you pass it a zero size realloc does what free does

626243
rss	feed
one of the commenters suggested that with some web fora allow you to get an email notification when activity happens and another suggested rss feed

626246

626400
jboss	weblogic
i have a set of resources which include many weblogic instances jboss instances and tomcat instances running across many servers

626407
versioning	upgrade
the point isn t about justifying the upgrade but more planning where and when it is going to be sensible to do the update especially in a .net versioning upgrade where backwards compatability is mostly fine

626412
onchange	keyup	keydown	keyup
you will need to use a combination of the onchange keyup and keydown event to capture possible changes to the form so that you can re-select the please select option

626443
uilabel	uibutton
i keep thinking in interaction problems with the uilabel due to its touch events not getting through the uibutton s view

626443
uilabel	uibutton
on the other hand with a uilabel as subview of the uibutton i m pretty confortable knowing that the touch events will always be propagated to the uilabel s superview

626499
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
as javascript gets faster as jit compilers start showing up like in google-chrome firefox 3.1 and safari 4 and as html support gets better html5 the need for plugins to display fancy rendered widgets will diminish

626541
icmp	udp
the cases i am referring to are when an attempt to send to a udp socket results in an icmp destination unreachable packet being generated by the remote host

626541
icmp	udp
below is a wireshark trace showing the icmp responses coming into my pc from an attempt to send a udp packet from 10.0.0.100 my pc to 10.0.0.138 my router on a port i know it s not listening on

626593
globalization	localization
with this in mind slapping your globalization localization code in the presenter is not a great idea

626606
temp	tmp
also - fyi - my tmp and temp already pointed to a different disk - but the installer isn t smart enough to figure that out i guess.

626627
temp	tmp
re-setting tmp and or temp to a partition with more space seems to have worked

626635
rss	feed
basically i have a uisearchbar searching an nsmutablearray of stories that make up an rss feed and when you select a story it loads in my app s uiwebview

626643

punctuation	words
what if the words starts with punctuation like ...word

626822
int	chars
if you have those you can define an appropriate function pointer type int fphasher chars

626850
put	get
i haven t got time to verify this but off the top of my head if you put your event on the canvas and don t specify a background for it then you should only get the click event when the user clicks on any of the paths it contains

626867
hide	show
i have a jsp with a javascript tree control and i want the user to be able to hide or show this tree at the touch of a button and for this change of state to be carried through to other pages visited if on page a the user hide the tree then on page b the tree should remain hidden and so on until the user decides to show the tree

626867
hide	show
if i invoke the show hide button i get a java numberformatexception error because the query string is lost

626907
serializable	deserialization
the performance comparisons show that protocol buffers outperform the built-in serializable in terms of both size and serializable deserialization speed

626927
folder	directory
specifically you probably want allusersprofile to get the location of the common user profile folder which is where the application data directory resides

626952
punctuation	words
you want words capitalized even if there is punctuation before them try something more like this

626953

627000
stateless	stateful
i m not personally familiar with all of the design issues of stateful versus stateless but i do know that nfsv4 is stateful after 15 years worth of previous versions of nfs being stateless so apparently statelessness became a significant limitation for the nfs designers

627028
rtp	rtsp
you should have a look at the rtsp + rtp protcol

627036
for-loop	arrays
i need to retrieve data from several rows and then insert the results into an enumerated arrays so then i can use a for-loop to echo it.

627131
folder	directory
the above code shows how i get the number of free bytes on a particular drive which contains the folder manager.capdir it is the variable containing the full path name of the directory

627132
sctp	tcp
newer ip protocols such as sctp are designed to solve some of the shortcommings of tcp that could lead one to use multiple ports

627135
ienumerable	ilist
first off for usability i recommend switching your ilist to an ienumerable

627140
maple	sage
if there s any way you can get the analytical derivative of the function using pen and paper or a computer algebra system such as maple mathematica sage or sympy this is by far the best option

627153
for-loop	arrays
this isn t really an answer to the question but if you want to print out an arrays as a comma-separated list it s better to use the implode command than a for-loop

627225
free	malloc
you don t always have to use free on a pointer just ones declared with malloc

627232
post	get
in general you want to be using the post redirect get pattern to avoid postbacks and there is almost never a good reason to use â history.back â or â javascript â urls

627254
typedef	struct
typedef struct

627310
free	malloc
the need to free doesn t depend on whether or not you ve declared a pointer but rather whether or not you ve malloc ed memory

627310
free	malloc
so the pointer in your question temp doesn t go away when you call free -- rather whatever your code allocated when it called malloc goes away

627342
hash	hmac
in my case i discovered that the validation key is used to create the sha1 hmac keyed hash

627406
ubuntu	linux
to add to what ori has already said some linux distros still use initab but ubuntu and possibly others have switched to etc event.d

627440
accessor	properties
in addition we have made the whatami properties accessor abstract so that we can implement our own specific properties accessor logic in each derived class and have also defined a constructor that accepts a string argument and assigns the value to the _name private field

627440
accessor	properties
in addition each class implements it s own properties accessor for whatami returning a string of their type respectively

627440
accessor	properties
the static method describeanimal accepts an ianimal as an argument and writes out the values returned by the whatismyname and whatami properties accessor for the passed in ianimal

627511
post	get
i hear everyone recommends redirecting the user http get after he submits the form http post

627517
pop-up	dialog
i would even like to disable the incoming call dialog window that pop-up on incoming calls since we ll be presenting our own answer prompt

627536
for-loop	arrays
try initializing the arrays elements in your structure individually say with a for-loop

627547
subclass	abstract-class
abstract-class describes basic functionality and let specialized functionality to a subclass

627547
subclass	abstract-class
on the other hand you may have an abstract-class defining all common behavior the object may have and let the subclass define specialized versions

627547
inherited	subclassing
of course if the identification may be based on the common attributes the cars may have the getidentifiableid may be implemented by the base class and the subclassing will inherited that method

627566
client-side	server-side
although it seems you want to do this client-side to save yourself some headaches now on the server-side programming in the long run investing some time on this now to get it server-side will avoid these troubles

627576
free	malloc
and this is done by using the standard functions malloc or derivatives and free

627576
free	malloc
it is a trade-off where you don t have to worry about free ing objects which is not a minor thing as simple examples might make you think but where gc_malloc here is more complex than a simple malloc and there s invisible code executing at that where temp goes out of scope

627589
uiview	subviews
in addition to its own properties to control the text and overlays uitextview is a subclass of uiview so you can control the background colour and add your own subviews

627653
versioning	upgrade
my planned iphone application will work a remote https web service quite hard so until a user decides to upgrade from the free to pro versioning of my app i need to generate a trickle of click revenue per free user

627660
filtering	grouping
as soon as you ve done a report users want another one or change the colour or optional grouping or more filtering or.

627698
folder	directory
if you deploy the executable together with your project to the same folder you can use the environment class to get the working directory of your executable

627712
shadowbox	lightbox
i want to use a lightbox like shadowbox or similar inside a firefox extension

627715
post	get
when the post succeeds in your controller persist a transaction identifier for the user you can use the asp.net profile provider for this and redirect to a completed page get

627749
ubuntu	linux
apparently most of the sifr demos i found fail to work with ff3 on ubuntu linux

627783
client-side	server-side
once the post data received gather the same information size checksum server-side from the received file and compare it with the information generated client-side

627805
width	height
either with its textwidth textheight properties for its visible size or by its width height properties for the bounding box size

627835
getter	setter
you may have to make a setter which will inform the outside of some of your internal details but there s no need to make a getter

627846
versioning	upgrade
the deal was i had to dl the trial versioning and then do an upgrade

627846
installation	upgrade
the suggestion to use programs and features to amend the installation doesn t work as it does not give me the upgrade enter serial # option as described

627878
udp	tcp
i was planning to try several types of encoding with tcp udp connection and measure the traffic and data loss

627888
opensuse	linux
update i just tried this on linux 2.6.25.5-1.1-default #1 smp x86_64 gnu linux opensuse 11.0 x86-64

627896
chown	chmod
these mechanisms let users share files more easily by lessening the need to use chmod or chown to share new files

627896
chmod	mkdir
if commands like chmod and mkdir routinely cleared these bits on directories the mechanisms would be less convenient and it would be harder to share files

627922
freebsd	linux
please be aware that this is a security risk and know what you are doing when you enable it in freebsd but i believe linux as well it requires special mount flag to be enabled and will change the way files in that directory behave

627975
stdout	stderr
below sets stdout stdin stderr to use utf-8..

628006
ienumerable	ilist
you can set a variable of type ienumerable or ilist to a null reference and it will compile

628045
getter	setter
as noted by mauris javascript 1.5 does support getter and setter see also here - you can think of them as methods disguised as properties

628049
multiplying	add
part of the methods are add polynomial multiplying polynomial etc

628057
affinity	processors
so i tried to play with processors affinity via sysinternals process explorer and limit those pesky processes to 3 cores out of 4 and dedicate the 4th core to the third party web server and it seems to work quite well

628061
width	height
so that it can be given a width and a height

628061
width	height
the and must be the same height and width

628076
affinity	processors
and beware processors affinity is inherited

628081
affinity	processors
as processors affinity on windows is a bitmask you may need some experimentation but i d assume 1 being the first core therefore 7 being the first three cores and f being all four

628084
affinity	processors
you can use the single-proc affinity application shim to force one processors on the executable level which will force the process onto one core

628157
getter	setter
your object needs to create a copy of the string in both the getter and the setter

628204
getter	setter
there s no getter setter or operator overloading in js yet so you really do need to write a function to set the price and get those fun side-effects

628235
google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome and firefox i believe but i don t have it here

628270
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme	imperative	declarative
i think that functional declarative programming haskell scheme lisp etc is more powerful and more abstract than imperative programming and therefore is intrinsically harder to learn

628301
firefox	safari
i ve made a simple page to demonstrate the problem here firefox safari only

628334
vbscript	jscript
the ms scriptomatic tool can generate wmi scripts in python as well as vbscript jscript and perl

628360
concave	convex
that handles convex concave features etc

628385
kerberos	ntlm
this occurs only when using ntlm and not kerberos it s part of the ntlm authentication process

628428
children	parent
the fact that float ing a parent element will cause it to expand to contain all of its float ed children

628437
sorting	filtering
i then map the observablecollection to a collectionviewsource so that i can get filtering sorting etc. without having to return to the database

628447
innodb	myisam
it could be some write table locks issued by the myisam engine but converting to innodb doesn t seem to make it any faster the system is in test and so not easy to simulate the same sort of load that production would receive leading me to believe that it is not lock related

628472
content-length	content-type
what s very odd about this crash is this if i do not call sethttpbody with my nsdata object setvalue application json for content-type and setvalue requestdatalengthstring for content-length the crash does not happen

628500
width	margin
text boxes have margin borders padding by default which makes a 100 width text box larger than its container

628504
background-color	transparency
background-color transparency

628624
bash	zsh
the following works in at least bash and zsh

628652
rtp	rtsp
but for video audio i suggest looking here and i would guess rtsp and rtp can be used

628739
folder	dir
what i would like is to not only have all the binaries dropped in the bin dir but also have each executeable program have it s own deployed folder similar to what each website gets

628746
post	get
what you describe is the ultimate battle to get more information of the httpfileupload in html 2.0 specs as that the is html spec you are referencing for a form post

628746
httphandler	httpmodule
what these controls do us they install an httpmodule httphandler and special javascript

628756
folder	directory
let s say that i m in foo folder and here is how the directory are organized

628780
int	double
you would cast it to an int or float or double or what ever else you want to do with it and store it in anoter variable

628785
getter	setter
getter setter creation type â œgetâ ctrl-space choose a getter to create

628824
int	chars
if by some crazy coincidence you want to convert a string of chars to an int you can do that too

628838
temp	tmp
previously i tried to fix the temp directory problem by creating a symbolic link to tmp but if i understand correctly pear is trying to create its own temp directory for installation then it s going to delete it when it s finished

628873
vbulletin	phpbb
but if you need a way to capture user issues i d try using something like a dedicated forum topic in vbulletin or phpbb or similar

628894
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the menu works fine

628935
content-length	content-type
however if i post to the .asmx page setting the soapaction content-type content-length and httpbody i just keep getting didreceiveauthenticationchallenge messages

628937
dynamicmethod	reflection.emit
there is also the dynamicmethod stuff which allows you to define bits of il using reflection.emit and compile them as delegates

629009
post	get
sounds to me like your web-service has different read get and write post permissions

629068
hide	show
i simply hide the flash and show it again when dialog is dismissed

629126
nginx	lighttpd
servers i m interested in are apache2 nginx and lighttpd but was having trouble finding any on google

629127
hash	salt
salt should be initialized to some randomly chosen value before the hashtable is created to defend against hash table attacks

629141
x86	64bit
i am using vs 2005 64bit x86 machine

629149
int	chars
in your case chars int and bool are different sizes so it will go by that information rather than your bit field hints

629163
post	get
for example after a post you should probably redirect to a get page to avoid that the result page cannot be reloaded without re-posting

629166
inherited	properties
i would rather not have my class inherited any other classes because i want to keep it clean from supurfulous properties and or methods

629171
pylons	turbogears
the pylons admin interface is very similar to turbogears

629189
int	double
that is if it s a double i don t want to return an int

629198
getter	setter
it s not a performance issue either as the getter or setter will be inlined by the compiler if it s simple enough

629216
public	protected
when providing only static factory methods classes without public or protected constructors cannot be subclassed

629236
boost	stl
i used a queue from the stl and threads condition variables and mutexes from the boost library

629247
int	boolean	int	double
i have also seen implementations where a value class was used to store results of calculations results that could represent either a string double int or boolean

629247
int	boolean	int	double
but the problem was that client code had to check a value.type property of an enum string int double boolean and then either cast the value.value property which was exposed externally by the value class as an object type or use the specific valuestring valuedouble valueint valueboolean getters

629256
daemons	systemd
in this case i would write a daemons run by a systemd user that accepted socket connections and relayed them to the appropriate device then use sockets within the web application to talk to the daemons

629290
freebsd	linux
an example of setting up user authentication with ldap on linux and freebsd is on my blog in french comptes unix stockã s sur ldap

629352
srp	principles
the biggest problem seems to be design breaking at least srp single responsibility principles

629375
filtering	grouping
it is just obvious that having to fetch filtering sort and grouping large amounts of data is slower than doing the same with small amounts

629378
width	height
an iframe will not resize to it s content you have to specify a fixed width and height

629382
rss	feed
i have rss feed that i want to modify on fly all i need is the text and linefeeds so everything else must be removed all images styles links

629411
ienumerable	iqueryable
or is the author just jumping on a hype trying to get more downloads for his ienumerable extension library and i was right in expecting iqueryable and expressions when seeing linq in the name of the library

629411
ienumerable	iqueryable
i think linq provider libraries may choose if they expose iqueryable or ienumerable in their results - linq extensions do not have that choice

629444
joomla	smarty	wordpress	joomla
it has also drupal joomla wordpress and smarty plug-ins

629445
postgresql	mysql
i know that oracle is the safe bet but am more interested if anyone have experience with postgresql or mysql with similar setup

629526
keydown	keyup
a common way of implementing shortcut keys is to detect them in a keyboard event such as keydown or keyup

629546
redmine	trac
we re using redmine an alternative to trac which was a breeze to set-up and use

629546
cvs	svn
quite flexible with configuration allows multiple projects source code management integration for svn git cvs all the common ones integrated wiki forums files etc

629637
rss	feed
many many features such as rss feed galleries forums can be configured

629668
int	double
but one returns as an int one returns as a double and one returns it as a string

629697
getter	setter
this looks extremely cumbersome to me and i feel like every class is bloated by extra three getter setter that all almost all the classes would use

629707
profiling	debugging
look to off-the-shelf profiling tools that may detect this leak even debugging mode in vc has an option of tracing leaked allocations

629719
post	get
i thought it was my class so i tried to use a different method from this blog post however i still get the same issues

629736
versioning	upgrade
having multiple copies of the library doesn t sound like a good thing but it really is it means you can upgrade one copy to a different versioning without breaking everything else

629774
post	get
use post rather than get

629777
post	get
oh and yes make sure you always pass a confirmation value through post to validate not just a get parameter it s best practice even with authorized users

629795
width	height
use thumbnails of a fixed width height

629795
width	height
the actual images width height as stored in the database would vary

629797
ienumerable	icollection
edit forgot to update the cast from ienumerable to icollection

629800
backtracking	greedy
this regex will try to match fail due to the lookahead as we hope and then backtracking the greedy qualifier to have on the end and match instead which doesn t have a after it

629855
children	parent
one of the primary purposes of init is to reap dead orphaned children so the problem is not that its parent died before it was reaped

629883
mate	puremvc
i ve used puremvc on a number of projects but also played with swiz mate and mvcs quite a bit

629917
implements	modifiers
the only time it isn t the most restrictive is for the explicit part of an automatically implements property where you can make it more restrictive by adding a modifiers

629938
firefox	safari
silverlight codenamed wpf e is a cross-platform cross-browser browser plugin which contains wpf-based technology including xaml 17 that provides features such as video vector graphics and animations to multiple operating systems including windows vista windows xp and mac os x with microsoft sanctioned 3rd party developers working ports for linux distributions. 18 specifically it is currently provided as an add-on for mozilla firefox internet explorer 6 and above and apple safari

629996
asterisk	freeswitch
asterisk and probably other softswitches like freeswitch could do that for you

629996
asterisk	voicemail
the asterisk voicemail config file voicemail.conf allows you to specify a command to run whenever a new voicemail is left in a user s mailbox

629996
asterisk	voicemail
asterisk supports voicemail to email by default so there wouldn t be any special configuration provided

629996
asterisk	voicemail
and you could probably also avoid setting up asterisk by finding a voip provider that supports voicemail to email which most of the asterisk based ones do and forwarding the voicemails to your own email alias address

630006
mouseleave	mouseenter
i m using the mouseenter and mouseleave events to trigger an animation on the scaletransform.scalex and scaletransform.scaley so they grow when hovered

630040
disk	ram
it depends on the amount of ram on the server maybe it can keep the whole database in ram disk speed raid array with lots of disk that can work in parallel versus a slow pc with little ram and a single disk

630050
put	get
i ve been working with soap4r and trying to use the soap header simplehandler i m trying to get it to put a custom header on the outgoing message but i can t work out how to get it to include attributes rather than as subelements

630068
vmware	virtualbox
vmware comes with this functionality out of the box but i don t use it anymore after finding virtualbox

630084
getter	setter
getter and setter are called when hibernate creates the entitites and fills in the data from the database

630101
put	get
sql server has encryptbykey and decryptbykey functions that make it quite easy to get put encrypted data

630124
textblock	itemscontrol
the container isn t added to the itemscontrol until i scroll down to view it and at that time only the container itself listboxitem is created - its children are not created there should be a few controls added here one of which should be the textblock that will display the text of the item

630144
awt	swing
in swing awt you can check to see if there are more than one monitors

630179
vmware	virtualbox
i tested virtualbox 2.1.4 and vmware workstation 6.5.1 for later use as a development vm

630179
disk	ram
guest windows xp home 1gb ram 8gb virtual disk

630233
vmware	virtualbox
in my experience i ve found that vmware seems to be faster than virtualbox although i don t have any hard data to back it up

630233
vmware	virtualbox
even though vmware has been faster for me i still use virtualbox because it s good enough and is free and im cheap

630301
stateless	stateful
as the name suggests the viewstate encodes information about the state of the view to try to make a stateless http connection feel stateful to the programmers who created the form

630329
dreamweaver	aptana
for something like that stick with homesite dreamweaver or aptana

630347
accessor	properties
i ve always considered properties to be the equivalent to get set accessor methods

630373
accessor	properties
one thing that you can do is create an accessor properties

630379
width	height
you have to take the width and height properties off of the usercontrol element in your views otherwise they cover each other up

630442
width	height
i ve used the window width and height methods as described above

630442
width	height
note that i m clamping the maximum width and height

630458
implements	extends
they would need to all implements an interface or all derive from a base class which i m assuming you re doing extends control in order to be dealt with without having to handle each individual class differently

630471
post	put
use post to create and put to update

630475
post	put
both put and post can be used for creating

630475
post	put
you do not need to support both put and post

630510
versioning	upgrade
if a user has auto updates set to on for java or if he she decides to upgrade to a higher versioning that will break my other application that only works with java 1.6u11

630532
firefox	safari
in my case i don t need to use anything other than safari and firefox so i have not tested this on ie

630563
maven	pom.xml
maven has a section for this - configure your plugins in pluginmanagement but bind them to a phase just when you needed it omit the phase tag in pluginmanagement but specify it under in you inherited pom.xml

630587
cpu	processors
system processors queue length counter will tell you how many threads are waiting for cpu resources

630670
jobs	cron
on windows machines schtasks is a utility similar to cron for scheduling jobs to run on a regular basis

630739
opera	firefox
opera has issues similar to the ones in firefox but the originating element seems to additionally depend on the placement of the mouse cursor

630770
uiview	catransition
the uiview class methods are convenience methods for common animations but are more limited than catransition

630770
uiview	catransition
if you wanted to do a fade in you d have to either dig down to catransition s fade transition or set up an explicit animation of your uiview s alpha

630785
post	put
if you can represent your application as a nested collection of resources then you can just use atompub and not worry about whether to use put or post what http status codes to return and all those details

630907
charindex	substr
i have tried using combinations of substr and charindex but haven t been able to get it quite right each part of the field could be any length so using hardcoded offsets doesn t work

630947
width	height
to draw a circle you need to know the top left coordinate and the width and height of the circle

630966
put	get
another method is to export full but you ll have to flush all writes and put the db into restricted mode so no user can make changes while you export to get a full consistent backup

630979
getter	setter
this could also be a property with a getter and setter and get and set the specific object type

630982
concave	convex
one solution is to split the concave polygon into convex segments then use cobbal s link

631022
ready	each
we want to be sure that the master branch is always ready for release at the end of each sprint even if it potentially means that we might not have increased the value of the master branch after the sprint

631048
maven	cargo
cargo s documentation shows that it is possible to deploy to jetty via maven 2

631085
margin	height
it s not perfect since you need to know the height of each container and apply that height value to the negative top margin of the last element and the bottom margin of the first element

631115
maven	pom.xml
maven has some non-written implicit assumptions like - always inherit submodules from the pom.xml in the parent directory the inheritance tree must match your directory tree otherwise some plugins won t work release plugin or some report plugins

631115
maven	pom.xml
there are a lot of wrong ways in maven therefore one must stick to something that is known to work - like pom.xml hierarchy directory structure

631116
bitconverter	binaryreader
you may want to use binaryreader binarywriter and or bitconverter to help with the tobytearray and frombytearray methods

631149
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
the foreach loops over arrays is equivalent to that standard for-loop over arrays

631154
implements	extends
i guess you know a instanceof b returns true if the a is inherited from b or some of the interfaces a implements or classes a extends are instanceof b

631291
width	height
make sure your swf is inside a div and set to 100 of the div s height and width

631299
public	protected
however the standard makes no guarantees about the layout of structs -- even pod structs -- other than that the address of a later member will be greater than the address of an earlier member provided there are no access specifiers private protected or public between them

631343
qsort	bsearch
in a sense you can think of the comparison function passed to the qsort or bsearch functions as a callback

631355
vim	emacs
there are various ides if that s your poison available on unix starting with the ubiquitous eclipse to things like sunstudio if you re on sun and of course all the integration tools that allow you to use the more powerful unix editors like emacs or vim

631360
width	height
try setting the width and height of the grid element to a percentage value

631360
width	height
i m using a grid on one of my main applications and i ve set the width height to 100 and it resizes just fine

631360
width	height
you ll likely need to set the width and height of the rows and items gridrow and griditem as well depending on how you want the rows columns to resize

631387
multiplying	add
take a guess of how many hours you think it will take you add 20 and then multiplying this by some reasonable hourly rate

631407
outputstream	inputstream
i am working on a mobile communicator and after establishing connection to the server using following method to illustrate that i am using streamconnection inputstream and outputstream i distribute inputstream and outputstream between two separate threads lets call them sender and receiver

631407
outputstream	inputstream
whenever one thread calls available or read on inputthread object while the other thread calls write on the outputstream object the inputstream finishes

631411
gridview	objectdatasource
if you use an objectdatasource control as the datasourceid of the gridview then it works pretty seamlessly

631427
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
essentially the touchesbegan and touchesmoved should be passed on to the main view when touching the uibuttons but also should send the button press action

631427
touchesmoved	touchesended
however at this point the touchesmoved and touchesended are obviously not being called because the touches originated on the uibutton

631431
vmware	esx
also vmware esx implements cdp

631486
hide	show
at the gwt level the javascript is changing the style.display attribute to hide and show the contents of the tabs

631496
profiling	benchmarking
if speed is an issue you may want to benchmarking the various methods but i suspect they would all have quite similar performance profiling

631510
photoshop	fireworks
photoshop illustrator fireworks expression design skills

631532
int	chars
they are only the same when you are dealing with primitives int chars etc.

631568
folder	directory
the output folder can be changed by going into project properties but by default they are bin debug and bin release under the project root directory containing the .csproj or .vbproj file

631569
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

631589
width	height
what i want to do next is to save this new image much smaller so i used the bitmap constructor that takes a source image object and a height and width then saved that

g++	gcc
but actually looking in math.h it isn t there and gcc cannot compile the following test program while g++ can

631632
int	double
the problem boils down to the following simplification i have an image only 1d were the pixel values may be int float or double

631657
int	double
to use void as a container for int float double you must allocate it array is genericarray of your old type - with void storage

631706
opera	firefox
it is specific to firefox and opera 9.0+

631729
int	chars
would allow me to add the first three chars of the string test to an int attribute assuming that it would be added to sphinx as an int even though it is a string in mysql

631730
put	get
go and put this in a .html file on your pc and open it in a browser if its ie7 you ll get security warning just allow it this won t happen when launched from a url

631773
installation	upgrade
i m running intellij idea 8.0.1 and would like to upgrade my grails installation to grails 1.1 which was released today march 10 2009

631818
webclient	networkcredentials
i don t know how you re doing your downloading or what type of authentication they re using on their end but you can use the networkcredentials class with webclient if it s basic http like twitter for example

631820
put	get
i d like to be able to get all of the files in the group at once and put them in a directory

631827
g++	gcc
according to my tests g++ does include libm automatically but gcc doesn t

631914
public	protected
they are a sleight of hand of making static methods look like they are defined within a class -- as long as they don t access private protected stuff they only can access public methods like any other method you can get away with them

631920
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
you can actually see the image works fine in safari firefox google-chrome and opera

631941
client-side	server-side
ensure both enable client-side debugging and enable server-side debugging are set to false

631972
folder	directory
from the directory containing the two new folder i ran

631975
folder	directory
i d look up a little higher in the directory structure the one that the solution is in and see if your debug release folder with the dll are there

631975
folder	directory
i think the default is to put the actual dlls in folder in the solution directory not the project directory i think the assumption is that you want all the dlls that you build for a solution to go to the same place

631990
post	get
to solve this problem i considered the following switch the buttons to links and when filtering and searching use get instead of post requests

632037
public	protected
public protected

632151
folder	directory
as above and noldrin says the default directory is the bin directory under the project folder but it can also be set by right clicking on the project in the vs explorer selecting properties and then when the project properties panel appears under compile you should have bin release which defaults to the bin directory under the project saved directory you can change it to c bin and the output will be stored in the bin directory in the root

632213
hash	salt
trim truncate change case salt hash whatever - just do it consistently

632235
pop-up	dialog
the compiler seems to just crash and windows pop-up its un helpful this program has stopped working dialog

632240
gif	png	tiff	png	png	tga
well the bufferedimage doesn t know that it s being written as a jpeg - as far as it s concerned it could be png or gif or tga or tiff or bmp.

632271
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
we tested the site fairly rigorously in ie6 7 8 firefox safari opera and google-chrome

632336
versioning	upgrade
you may well have to upgrade vs versioning

632369
int	double
defining the inputs and outputs as double lets you take advantage of type promotion so this function will also work for int

632414
des	aes
agreed -- des is largely outdated so unless there is a good reason to use it go with aes

632421
ienumerable	ilist
while in the case of ilist and ienumerable things would work out ok the compiler has no way of really knowing that when you see it as collection and collection

632436
globalization	localization
if you want to research msdn has some good articles on globalization localization

632445
width	height
specifically i d like to determine the display height of each string given uniform formatting same font size weight etc. and the maximum width the string may occupy

632471
firefox	safari
ie and firefox safari seem to deal differently with base href and javascript window.location type requests

632473
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
generally speaking i target the top 4 browsers ie-7 ie-8 firefox google-chrome safari

632481
getter	setter
a good parallel would be having a public variable instead of setter getter

632481
getter	setter
the setter getter allows you to change your underlying implementation without effecting the outside world

632574
post	get
basically it has no ui but still processes get post requests just like an aspx page does

632577
urllib	cookielib
i m importing cookielib to handle cookies poster to encode the pdf and urllib and urllib2 to build the request and send it to the url

632583
getter	setter
so the question is should you use getter setter or directly send the object as an argument to the method - in order for the method to work properly

632613
post	get
i m at home now but when i get to work i ll post my hack of this code to make it work up to 3.5 sp1

632616
ienumerable	ilist
i face exactly the same situation in some bits of protocol buffers and i ve found that casting to ienumerable or ilist to access it like a list works very well

632657
firefox	safari
ie and firefox safari seem to deal differently with base href and javascript window.location type requests

632700
hash	md5
take all params of the call a timestamp + - 5 min wiggle a shared secret and hash it using sha-1 or md5 sha-1 better

632708
width	height
my guess is a dodgy filter that doesn t support odd values for width height and is removing it but i m not sure of an easy way to check this

632769
margin	height
edit 2 also worth noting that after jquery gathers the height it adds allowances for padding margin and border sizes so you may need to as well

632781
put	get
on my content pages i use different usercontrols that require the use of many of the functions within the validation.js file however if i dont put the tag and the javascript functions within a contentholder on the contentpage the usercontrols do not see these functions and i get errors like onnamevalidation is not defined

632831
inline	inlining
edit 2 so i created another struct that used explicit getx methods o how i don t miss my java days at all and that performed the same whether i disabled inlining on it through or not so conclusion non-static methods are apparently never inline not even on structs

632831
getter	setter
i also could ve sworn that i ve read plenty of times that simple getter setter properties will get in-lined despite being callvirt in the il

632838
width	height
you can use the desiredsize property on a rendered textbox to get the height and width

632838
width	height
if you have a large number of strings it may be quicker to first pre-calualte the height and width of every indiviudal letter and symbol in a given font and then do a calculation based on the string chars

632854
getter	setter
using automatic fields allows you to get the typically getter setter behavior but builds in the ability to change this without a subsequent need for the changes to propagate to other parts of the code

632876
uiview	uiwindow
since in uikit the uiwindow is a uiview unlike nswindow vs

632906
next	except
well except to save the data to a temporary file then automatically restoring them the next time the program is run

632945
prng	random	mouse	keyboard
although it should be noted that computers can gather entropy from the environment connected to it like keyboard and mouse actions what aids in generating random numbers either directly or by seeding a prng

632979
uitouch	uibutton
your uibutton has a responder controller that receives the uitouch events my guess is that once it has preformed its interpretation of the message it returns - the touch has been handled and disposed of

633010
udp	tcp
if not you can use cfnetwork framework to use sockets tcp udp to allow your app and server to communicate

633056
put	get
trying to get the user to put 3 numbers in 3 text boxes and get the average

633057
abstract-class	superclass
in procedural programming a unit may be an individual program function procedure etc. while in object-oriented programming the smallest unit is a method which may belong to a base superclass abstract-class or derived child class

633067
int	double
try changing the type of average from int to double

633128
prng	random
a random number generator in our case a pseudo-random number generator or prng is simply a device to produce a quasi-random sequence of numbers that we can only estimate based on the given probability inherent within the sequence to be random

633129
width	height
also each different link needs to have its own height width and hover image

633139
width	height
an a tag can have it s height width set through css just like everything else

633146
width	height
just do style display block and set the width height background image etc

633252
content-length	content-type
often this can be something as simple as not setting the content-type correctly or failing to include content-length

633259
processors	hyperthreading
in fact multithreading increased the performance not only on multicore processors but also on my intel atom n270-based system which only has a single core but offers two logical cores through simultaneous multithreading hyperthreading

633293
apache	lighttpd
make sure the user your web server is running as httpd apache lighttpd or similar has write access to the uploadpath

633300
pecl	pear
i m running php 5.1.6 pear date 1.5.0a1 and the latest pecl timezonedb

633315
boost	blitz++	gsl	blitz++
if you re looking to do more advanced analysis there are some nice libraries out there like gsl tnt blitz++ vxl and various boost libraries

633327
postgresql	mysql
disclaimer i have no direct experience with sql server but i have a lot of experience on other rdbmss oracle mysql postgresql etc. and architecture in general

633363
margin	height
if the bar is position fixed one way to prevent it overlapping content is to set a static height and then set a top margin on the main container with the same height

633363
margin	height
if you don t know the height of the fixed div in advance you d have to use js to discover its height and set the container margin accordingly

633366
sharepoint	spsite
you can connect to sharepoint using the typical constructor you use for spsite and find the appropriate spuser object

633374
int	chars
finally it returns an int which represents how many chars are in the result

633394
ubuntu	debian
i just tried on ubuntu 8.10 and debian 5 installations where i havent touched the apache configuration

633485
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
safari firefox opera and other standards-compliant browsers use xmlhttprequest

633489
verilog	vhdl
if you really want to shine learn vhdl or verilog vhdl seems to be more common where i ve worked but that is only a small smattering of places and code the design rather than enter it through the gui

633489
subtraction	addition
move on to building an alu to handle addition subtraction and or xor etc and then a sequencer to read opcodes from ram and supply them to the execution unit

633518
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout or setinterval

633520
inherited	properties
no dependency properties inherited

633656
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
i have a default escape with an invalidoperationexception i do not use argumentexception or one of its derivals because the coding is against a private instance field an not an incoming parameter

633703
put	get	post	put	post	get
it is suitable for performing basic http requests and interacting with rest-based services get post put delete

633724
svg	vml
i ve searched the internet but everywhere people say i should use svg vml to save the data but they never mention how

633785
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i use firebug to debug js in firefox google-chrome and safari have their own debuggers and vs 2008 handles ie for me

633925
ienumerable	ilist
since you are binding this to a ui element your best bet is probably to make the return value an ienumerable or ilist

633966
ant	maven
this works as i can still override them or specify them from ant or maven but can also right click - run as - junit test the individual test files

634001
hash	salt
store the username in a database in the same row a randomly generated salt value in the same row a hash checksum of the password including the salt

634001
hash	salt
next time the user logs in you get the password add to it the salt for the user geterate the hash compare it to the one you have

634001
salt	md5
for example concatenate username timestamp salt another random salt and make an md5 or sha checksum out of it

634034
getter	setter
instead of writing code for a private variable and a setter and getter to access it this creates that automatically

634082
setinterval	settimeout
please note you can pass a string to settimeout same with setinterval with the name of the function to be called

634089
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
update1 this problem exists in safari 4 beta firefox 3.0.3 and google-chrome but the page works perfectly in ie6

634098
xargs	zcat
pass the -t option to xargs causing it to print the command it is running the zcat command including the filename before running it

634102
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux server dual quad core machine

634114
hide	show
what i have at the moment is a preview window that when clicked on hide to show a div containing an image gallery

634116
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
eventually out of desperation i removed the clientaccesspolicy.xml file and tried the alternative crossdomain.xml file which is meant to be for silverlight to work with flash targetted web sites and that worked straight away

634123
margin	font-size
every browser has potentially different margin padding font-size defaults

634127
subtract	add
this will let you use complex datetime arithmetics like adding months or finding week days on datetime s and you can just add or subtract the milliseconds and concatenate the result as .xxxxxx+hh mm to get valid xml representation

634140
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
depending on what properties you need you could cast the sender as a textboxbase as both the textbox and richtextbox both inherited from that subclassing

634160
getter	setter
use getter setter

634167
subtraction	addition
addition subtraction and

634171
hide	show
the button triggers an ajax event which sets a variable on the server to show or hide the tree so that the state is persisted

634171
hide	show
the show hide button sees to things

634196
union	distinct
because union removes duplicates it does a distinct sort

634271
width	height
1 - create your own component with vars for the original x y z and width and height

634271
width	height
as pointed out you do not need to move the calls into separate function but you will need to use the above so that you can get at the original width height x y providing your not hard coding all the values

634275
updatepanel	scriptmanager
try using scriptmanager this should provide better support esp for scripts added in an updatepanel

634290
for-loop	arrays
usually you won t have large number of functions in class rather than using map you can create simple struct arrays and use a for-loop

634299
imperative	declarative
in that sense it is declarative not imperative style as stated in mr novatchev s article

634299
haskell	scheme	erlang	scheme
functional programming languages like scheme or erlang enable you to declare variables as well and in haskell you can also do that

634333
pull	push
then just pull from the source repository and push to the target.

634406
emacs	aquamacs
also you ll find that a lot of the recent ports of emacs to other platforms like carbon emacs aquamacs or emacsw32 are all based on gnu emacs

634451
g++	gcc
it s no problem using gcc or g++ from os x

634451
fink	macports
it s just another nix style system so all the tools you are familiar with will already exist and if they don t just use fink or macports to get them yourself

634513
int	chars
so you have a pointer to a memory block which contains an int and an array of unicode chars and this pointer points to a string but there is an int 4 bytes left storing an int

634522
ssl	https
now on top of the http https problem we have an issue as the wsdl contains the port number in all the urls where bigip works on port 443 for the ssl

634528
ubuntu	debian
for debian systems ubuntu included the correct way is to make an init script in etc init.d based on the skeleton file in that directory

634536
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if you had said you could checkout but not commit add modify delete and verified that authorization is ok then i d say check your working copy url server name there is a tricky issue with path-based authorization where checkout is case-insensitive for server name but commit is case-sensitive

634579
post	get
once you ask for and are granted offline access the session key you get in the http post parameters from facebook fb_sig_session_key will have no expiry

634652
public	protected
for example if you use reflection to discover the signatures of all the public and protected methods in an assembly that wouldn t mean reverse engineering

634728
decimal	ieee
and the other bit of information compared with drjokepu s answer is that because it is ieee 754 double precision you can get about 16 some will claim 17 decimal digits

634745
portrait	landscape
while it might be useful to know that the device is flat this doesn t tell us whether it s flat displaying an interface oriented in portrait or landscape mode

634745
width	height	portrait	landscape
i suppose i could track orientation change events to remember the last portrait landscape orientation or check the main uiview s bounds height and width but that seems kludgey

634754
implements	extends
this is a clear disadvantage we encounter we ve slightly changed the way we code to make it interact smoother with autowiring a customer repository no longer implements the generic interface but we make an interface customerrepository that extends

634797
ubuntu	debian
in debian or ubuntu copy etc init.d skeleton an example script for starting stopping daemons and edit it to your liking and make it executable

634801
int	double
the pointunitconversions calls do the obvious math to take a decimal degrees and convert to corresponding int or double values for the component parts

634824
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
development of this skin was primarily done using safari and as expected it all renders fine using firefox and opera

634835
portrait	landscape
at this point any orientation checks i ve seen return an invalid orientation of 5 so it s not directly possible to determine if a landscape or portrait layout should be used

634837
equals	gethashcode
the dictionary will call gethashcode to calculate a hash bucket for each value and equals to compare whether two foo s are identical

634837
equals	gethashcode
you might want to start with the equals-method and then in gethashcode xor the hash code of every member you compare in equals

634841
equals	gethashcode
by default the two important methods are gethashcode and equals

634911
formview	checkboxlist	objectdatasource	formview
i have a formview bound to an objectdatasource that contains a checkboxlist that i d like to bind to a single property of the underlying object that is an enum with the flagsattribute applied to it

634949
firefox	safari
this doesn t happen in firefox or safari

634976
jar	war
you could use an overlay although that requires that the sibling be of type war rather than jar

634988
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
one of the best ways to learn recursion is to get some experience in a functional programming language such as haskell or lisp or scheme

634988
lisp	scheme
it really only takes 5 minutes to learn scheme or lisp so you can get started with examples right away for the test tomorrow you mentioned

635043
equals	gethashcode
if you would use the foo object as key you would just implement the gethashcode and equals method to only consider the fooid property

635069
nswindow	nsbutton
the nswindow has various controls for settings properties of an object an nstextfield a nsdatepicker etc and two nsbutton s add and cancel which are used to confirm or cancel the action

635103
fadein	fadeout
fadein and fadeout are the frame names inside cover_mc

635121
min	max
if you need the textboxes to make this decision based on each other you can have a static callback at the page level that you call from within the convert method that will make a determination if you re still in resizing mode and keep track of any other information min or max fontsize already calculated etc

635195
post	get
the only thing i can think of to get the build number without executing some code within the assembly or checking the file properties is to make some sort of post build event that checks the properties of the assembly and pops up a message box displaying it or better yet write a comment to the top of the assemblyinfo.cs file with the build number

635198
floor	exp
not sure but the identity n m exp10 m log10 n exp q m log n q where q log 10 comes to mind along with the fact that the first k digits of exp10 x the first k digits of exp10 frac x where frac x the fractional part of x x - floor x

635218
apache	nginx
when you are ready for real deployment then you ll need mysql apache nginx etc.

635224
teamcity	nant
i m using teamcity to manage one of my projects however it doesn t seem to be working well with nant on windows server 2008

635231
hide	show
on my submit button what i d like to do is onclick show a please wait panel and hide the button unless the validators say something s invalid - then i need the buttons still showing obviously

635256
children	parent
my problem is that i have multiple parallel views of some of the data eg the 1st tab is a summary view of open jobs other tabs show parent and children views of this data as well as lookup drop downs

635421
put	get
i tap the switch to turn it on and then put my hand over the sensor for a second then move it away and get

635424
postgresql	informix	postgresql	mysql	teradata	informix
informix postgresql teradata mysql

635434
getter	setter
but the generated usermanagement object does not have any accessible object securitycontext nor getter or setter for such a private object

635460
xargs	zcat
in addition to the fine answers about using xargs or find you can also get rid of an extra process by eliminating zcat and piping to zgrep or grep -z instead

635552
client-side	server-side
for example you want to add client-side validation in addition to server-side

635574
post	get
if for example there are some post or get requests on domainb this should keep working

635624
post	get
with php you need to use get or post supervars

635710
getter	setter
then you have a getter setter for each value that converts xml- whatever and whatever- xml

635710
getter	setter
you still have to write the getter setter though but you can have a macro snippit handle that work for you

635723
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox google-chrome and opera just change the parent window

635795
shadowing	named
if that works try using another variable named entirely it s possible that you are getting some scope shadowing where you have declared more than one count variable

635803
kerberos	ntlm
in this case you can use kerberos ntlm authentication if your ad is setup to handle the authentication correctly you should be able to pass the token along farther

635819
int	chars
name gets set to 3234 since the int value of is 32 and 32 chars past the begining of foo is four chars before the end of the string

635844
rss	feed
let s say i have a big rss feed full of twitter posts and they are all plain text

the header does get sent if using http post

636004
subtract	add
it handles leap years leap seconds invalid dates times it can output dates in any format it can compare add subtract etc.

636022
int	chars
both promote chars to int

636101
xmltype	clob
if the client doesn t support xmltype it can easily be cast to clob values

636119
xna	slimdx
the method calls are very similar in xna and the theory behind it all should apply to you even with slimdx

636131
serializable	deserialization
i already have a lot of custom serializable and deserialization code for the needed objects

636151
treemap	linkedhashmap
maps contains similar factory methods for instantiating other types of maps as well such as treemap or linkedhashmap

636165
put	get
with the consumer calling get when empty or at the end of each loop and the consumer calling put after adding so many items or time or .

636170
int	chars
substitute 2-4 randomly chosen chars in password with a randomly chosen int 0-9

636204
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended

636214
degrafa	flex
in flex there is degrafa now too - but the rendering engine is the same

636223
pull	push
so what is the proper way to push or pull data into a partial from the masterpageview

636235
entity-relationship	diagram
i ve used it for requirements use case activity sequence domain and even class modeling and sometimes some reverse-engineered entity-relationship diagram

636245
width	height
it works fine if it contains anything besides a border or a grid stackpanel etc that does not have an explicitly defined height and width

636245
width	height
if i specify a height and width on the contained grid stackpanel etc it works fine

636245
width	height
i set a few breakpoints in the code and it seems that the sizechanged event is getting called a lot during rendering and each time the height width increments by 10

636245
width	height
i m assuming that setting a default height width causes it to skip this incrementing of the number but i have no idea why this error is happening

636253
mergetool	winmerge
mergetool winmerge

636261
minimum	max
on sun s windows jvm version 1.6.0_06 i believe the minimum max heap size is approximately 6mb -xmx6m

636272
profiling	debugging
i suggest that you check the appropriate issue tracker before doing more debugging and profiling

636328
post	get
i have a problem with an async call using jquery ajax load get post

636342
kde	gnome
many modern x applications are written to use a desktop enviroment such as gnome or kde

636366

i use entity-relationship and class diagram on paper and whiteboard for any project that s bigger than a shell script

636371
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
gnome kde xfce and lxde are desktop environments

636378
width	height
you could use the screen object to obtain the width and height of the screen or the available viewport

636401
strstr	substr
if you only want to search for plain substr you are much better off using the standard c string.h function strstr

636425
redmine	trac
we used trac before with a burndown plugin then went to redmine

636433
accessor	properties
first take a look at this colorcodes properties accessor

636474
children	parent
that code includes the div in question it s sibling parent grandparent and children

636518
invalidoperationexception	argumentnullexception
the obvious answer is to use the standard exceptions that come packaged in the .net base-class libraries argumentnullexception invalidoperationexception notimplementedexception etc or invent your own specific exception if you feel that a consumer of your class might need to know a bit more detail about why they re receiving an exception

636523
nfa	dfa
it gives information on how to identify the back-end engines dfa vs nfa vs hybrid that a regex flavour uses

636542
width	height
the exception is the first image because you ve given it â display blockâ which makes it amenable to the explicit sizing provided by width height

if the config settings is going to be modified by the user to determine the way the application is going to run then it might be better to keep it in some ini file

637549
cpython	ironpython
firstly to my knowledge only cpython has raii - you have to close your own resources in jython ironpython etc

637571

637675
affinity	processors
if you want to set processors affinity you need to explicitly configure this.

637676
affinity	processors
processors affinity is switched off in iis6 which means the load will be distributed across all available cpus

637676
affinity	processors
if you want to restrict it you can use processors affinity to stop this default behaviour

637679
affinity	processors
any multi-threaded program will be distributed over all available cores by the windows scheduler by default though processors affinity can be tuned in the task manager for example

637715
boost	allocator
check out boost multiarray it does exactly what you want except more efficiently by only doing a single heap allocator

637742

i know with wspbuilder you cloud definitely deploy files into the bin and resource folder within an application s directory ... inetpub wwwroot wss virtualdirectories 80

637824
g++	gcc
using gcc instead of g++ and adding -fno-exception compiler option did the trick

637827
stdout	stderr
i want to redirect both stdout and stderr of a process to a single file

637830
post	get
by default iis will limit verbs to asp.net pages to get head post and debug

637834
stdout	stderr
this is going to redirect stderr to stdout and stdout to some_file and print it to stdout

637837
stdout	stderr
1 file.log instructs the shell to send stdout to the file file.log and tells it to redirect stderr file descriptor 2 to stdout file descriptor 1

637838
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stderr to stdout and the stdout into a file

637839
stdout	stderr
redirects both stdout and stderr to filename

637883
ant	maven
it provides the logic described above and can be used from java ant or maven

637905
redhat	fedora
must be something similar under redhat fedora

637933
serializable	deserialization
one suggested approach was to ignore the timespan for serializable and instead serializable the result of timespan.ticks and use new timespan ticks for deserialization

637937
plot	heatmap
this is also called thematic mapping or contour plot or heatmap or 2.5d plot in other gis packages

637951
children	parent
i can define it any way i want and it must behave like a balanced binary tree though values of parent and children dont matter

637965
getter	setter
you could do the same as in your example but using timespan.tostring in the getter and timespan.parse value in the setter

637992
ubuntu	debian
change the configuration etc network interfaces in ubuntu and debian to assign static ip address to the interface

638016
serializable	deserialization
you use the xml serializable deserialization to export import data to xml

638031
put	get
and if you put a hashtable in there to cache the functions for each encountered codesnippet you could get close to your original example

638050
range	median
or if they re continuous values you could distribute them into bins - that wouldn t tell you the exact median but it would give you a range and if you need to know more precisely you could iterate over the list again examining only the elements in the central bin

638074
folder	directory
smart client software factory â april 2008 - this creates the folder scsf-apr2008 with a lib directory that has lots of microsoft.practices.enterpriselibrary

638095
int	double
seems to solve the problem for both double and int fields

638158

638284
jstl	taglib
jetty includes their own jstl library and there is no need to include jakrta taglib s standard and core jars

638292
put	get
if so the only way i could think of to do this would be to put your first build in the tasks and the others in the publishers section yes you can do this this is the only way to ensure the following tasks get exectued no matter if the main build pases or fails

638306
icmp	udp
on an unconnected udp socket the kernel doesn t know what application to deliver icmp errors to and so they just get discarded

638341
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
you could read the inputstream into a bytearrayoutputstream using one of the read methods and extract the from there

638388
http.sys	httplistener
i m using the .net class httplistener which is the iis web server engine http.sys without the iis admin tools

638444
redmine	trac
trac and redmine in particular are very good at this

638446
udp	tcp
in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp

638446
udp	tcp	udp	mtu
for example i read an experiment in which a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp

638446
udp	tcp
especially since you can give tcp the same sort of latency as udp by disabling the nagle algorithm for example if you re transmitting real-time sensor data and you re not worried about congesting the network with lot s of small packets

638455
cruisecontrol	teamcity
given that you could get both teamcity and hudson up and running in a few hours it might be worth grabbing both and running them side-by-side along with any others such as cruisecontrol that you can think of

638484
implements	extends
exactly which class you re getting back depends on your configuration but they all implements the principal interface by way of spring s own org.springframework.security.authentication interface which extends it

638503

to get more complicated than that you could put a hidden one time use key in each form and once the form with that key has been submitted display an error when they try to submit a form with the same key

638523
haskell	agda
epigram and agda do a bit of this and haskell does to some extent though i disagree that monoid is correct mzero and mappend okay mconcat bad

638702
button	checkbox
i have a more general answer for you and anyone else having the problem and ending up reading this not just for checkbox button but for all controls

638708
valgrind	callgrind
i ll put in another answer for valgrind especially the callgrind portion with the ui

638709
post	get
to state the obvious i have not seen it here yet... never use get to post data always use post that way the user at least gets a warning if he or she tries to refresh re-post the page at least in firefox but i suppose in other browsers as well

638713
min	max
find min and max of the list containing n items through linear search and name them as highvalue and lowvalue

638728
google-chrome	safari
webkit safari google-chrome picks it up

638761
equals	gethashcode
when having override equals i must also override gethashcode of course

638763
int	double
what happens if you specifically cast it as a int double when you set

638857
concave	convex
ideally i l like to be able to deal with both convex and concave polygons else the graphic will have to be up of many convex polygons manually

638907
post	get
you might want to check out the post redirect get pattern most modern web apps implement see

638950
hash	md5
if the random sequence should be repeatable you can sort by a hash of the user id using md5 or a custom one you create yourself order by md5 secondary_sort_column

638965
vb.net	vb6
i have started reworking one of my company s apps written in vb6 to vb.net

638981
accessor	properties
i m pretty sure that the problem is that when you do this you re effectively making the person.name properties get accessor change the value and act like a set accessor as far as the ui is concerned

638989
cvs	svn
i realise it s not a very descriptive comment in the first place but that sort of thing in svn cvs etc

638994
vb.net	vb6
apparently the tool converts your vb6 to a dsl and then to vb.net winforms c# wpf java.

638997
median	percentile
the algorithm also allows you to query any percentile not just median since you have a complete distribution estimate

639074
jboss	glassfish
application server platforms like jboss and glassfish are free and fairly easy to learn

639102
x86	64bit
in addition you need to create separate assemblies in c++ cli for x86 and x64 targets if you re going to be targetting 64bit systems

639211
listview	gridview
you can nest listview or gridview if that makes sense for the scenario

639242
svg	vml
whilst you could conceivably write some shapes to a canvas svg or vml elementâ â â or even on non-ie browsers create an image with a â data â url created from pixel valuesâ â â there is no point

639265
google-chrome	firefox
ie7 firefox and i think google-chrome use these

639265
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome s implementation integrates with the address box whereas firefox and ie have a specific search dialogue in the top corner

639279
width	height
you need to pass the context to this method or better yet rather than pass in width and height pass in the size object itself

639288
affinity	processors
so maybe processors affinity can only be queried on processes

639409
django	turbogears
a long-running process using tools such as django or turbogears for python

639412
getattr	setattr
also the way it tries to replicate the java behaviour of making outer class variables available on the inner class with getattr setattr is very dodgy and unnecessary really since the more pythonic way would be to call i.__outer__.attr explicitly

639452
ubuntu	debian
the problem you will face as an ubuntu user is that there s always been a slight tension between debian packagers users and the main exim user base because debian chose to heavily customize their configuration

639452
ubuntu	debian
unfortunately this ends up causing you a problem because ubuntu adopted all these packages from debian but doesn t support them in the same way as debian does and debian packagers seem to feel put upon to be asked to support these ubuntu users

639452
ubuntu	debian
now to answer your original question there are a ton of ways to do what you ask and probably the best way for you is going to be specific to the debian ubuntu configurations

639489
memcached	apc
with apc data store or memcached you can have persistent objects in ram instead of for example always creating them all anew by fetching data from db

639493
try-catch	exception-handling
here is an example of an exception-handling happening inside a lock with a try-catch block

639607
subclass	abstract-class
when you use abstract-class you create a coupling between the subclass and the base class

639616
maven	pom.xml
each of the webapps refers to the parent pom.xml and they both currently have a jetty maven plugin that works

639621
implements	extends
also as you mention you can only extends one class at a time but you can implements as many interfaces as you wish

639633
subclass	abstract-class
6.deriving from an abstract-class uses up a subclass s one and only base class option

639650
pylons	turbogears	django	turbogears
ruby gets more attention than python simply because ruby has one clear favourite when it comes to web apps while python has traditionally had a very splintered approach zope plone django pylons turbogears

639682
getter	setter
when you need to extend the getter setter behavior of a class it is useful have encapsulated fields getter setter instead of direct member access

639682
inherited	subclassing
yet in inherited it is conceptualy interesting to preserve the inners of your class if its subclassing shouldn t be aware of its private stuff

639689
move	drag
the drag copy move cursors aren t part of the standard library - your application will need it s own

639696
spweb	spsite
spsite and spweb objects from spcontext are automatically disposed when the http request has completed

639714
groupbox	panel
1 perhaps the easiest is to place both your picture and groupbox within a panel you set the panel s backgroundimage property

639714
groupbox	panel
then the groupbox and panel aren t technically overlapping but the gruopbox is a child to the panel

639725
width	height
use a binding expression on the height and width properties of the image and enclose it inside the scrollviewer

639731
implements	extends
an existing class that already extends something can implements the interface assuming you have control over the code for the existing class

639747
implements	extends
so someone can extends an existing class to implements an interface without affecting the previously existing behavior of that class

639798
globalization	localization
second jquery being a great javascript library does not allow any integration with and does not leverage server side asp.net functionality as opposed to asp.net ajax framework that comes standard with the asp.net 3.5+ and fully utilizes asp.net features such as server side mark-up scriptmanager control server-side script combining localization and globalization etc

639827
portrait	landscape
i need the page to be landscape instead of portrait

639855
jruby	mri

640064
wxpython	pyqt
for something like a card game however i d go with wxpython or rather pyqt

640123
hex	binary
this is a 32 character hex value which you should store in a hex binary column format but if the table isn t going to be heavily used than char 32 will work

640135
libxml2	hpricot
nokogiri uses libxml2 and is a drop in replacement for hpricot

640135
hpricot	libxml-ruby
edit there s a new benchmark comparing nokogiri libxml-ruby hpricot and rexml here

640140
kerberos	ntlm
the networkcredential class is really for controlling regular windows credentials ntlm kerberos etc

640140

cruisecontrol supports several different build options include ant maven nant phing php rake xcode and then the generic exec which you can use to invoke any command-line script tool you want

640163
put	get
the script when receives the httppost i need to somehow get the data from the xml and put it into my data-base

640182
profiling	debugging
and then set up a remote debugging profiling in your ide using the port you specified in this case 5001

640187
profiling	debugging
by that i mean you can start and stop tomcat deploy profiling and debugging your app running in tomcat from the ide

640190
width	height
on the other hand few would argue that image src should not be specified as an attribute and the height width seem as tied to the binary image data as the src is

640197
mp3	wav
frankly i don t know why you d want to work with mp3 internally as opposed to wav files

640209
submit	submission
you need to submit post data with data that mimics the submission of a form then captrue the session cookie set in the response ans use that cookie for future requests

640219
mvp	presenter
additionally consider using mvp architecture pattern with dependency injection to organize your classes and make your presenter and other components more test friendly

640225
firefox	safari
i tested my page with ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox safari opera.

640273
testdriven.net	xunit.net
i have lots of tests that all run fine on development boxes with testdriven.net and on the server with the xunit.net gui app

640303
google-chrome	firefox
using the same data google-chrome does in less than 5 seconds what took ie and firefox 10 to 15 seconds to accomplish

640338
cpu	processors
if you lower your priority and there are other cpu hungry processes you may give up more processors time than you want

640346
firefox	safari
everything usually works fine in firefox safari ie6 or ie7

640346
firefox	safari
in that scenario it still works great in firefox and safari but in ie 6 and 7 there are a few annoying quirks

640362
put	get
i don t put set spell in my .vimrc because when i m coding there are just too many variable names in my comments that get flagged

640428
min	max
then you can write a method to calculate the min and max latitude and longitudes based on a radius and query for all cities between those min and max

640456
mouseup	mousedown
then capture user actions with the mousedown and mouseup events

640463
iprincipal	iidentity
i need to store the user s email address and have done so for forms authentication using a custom iidentity iprincipal pair that i added to the context.currentuser during the authenticaterequest event

boost	stl
is there anything in stl boost that already does something like this

640651
invalidoperationexception	argumentnullexception	invalidoperationexception	argumentexception	argumentnullexception	argumentexception
we have a few custom exceptions and are throwing some exceptions whose classes are defined in the .net framework s standard class libraries argumentexception invalidoperationexception argumentnullexception etc.

640651
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
today our team lead decided that he didn t want us to use the latter since the .net framework would throw those types of exceptions and in order to facilitate filtering with the application block s policies we should use only custom exceptions going so far as to practically duplicate .net standard class library exceptions with custom versions as in custom argumentexception custom invalidoperationexception etc

640684
int	double
int double and so on

640685
equals	gethashcode
the equals and gethashcode methods should be overriden for better performance

640703
put	get
the tooling is getting better and better and if you can get a true designer on your team there are very few things that you canâ t put together

640721
boost	stl
but i am wondering how people use stl no fancy boost .

640745
opera	firefox
this all works fine in ie firefox and opera

640784
int	double
the data termed as a map essentially consists of int double floats and a single enum

640784
fseek	fread
since there are a few million maps parsing of this binary file is quite slow with fseek and fread being the major bottlenecks

640787
spweb	spsite
if you do need to use rwep all spsite and spweb objects and their children created within that context should be used and disposed in the codetorunelevated

640788
implements	modifiers
edit looking at the code for gdiplus image getwidth in gdiplusbitmap.h it would have been easy for ms to implements many of the functions with the const modifiers

640804
fseek	fread
this way you are not using fseek fread instead you are using pointer arithmetic

640815
children	parent
the problem is that it adds them to the bottom of the parent node s list of children

640833
implements	extends
he shows an example of how to implements paging by extends the content query web part

640857
post	get
i attempted what i found in this post but couldn t get it to work

640874
width	height
also a trick i use in java is to render it to a 1 x height texture then scale that to width x height to increase the performance and lower memory usage

640877
pylons	web2py
i ve tried out others like pylons web2py nevow and others

640893
appendto	ready
the when the document ready event fires use the appendto method

640949
dictionary	map
the link you are referring to spells out one of my favorite approaches - populating a dictionary and using it as a map from your xml attributes to the values you re setting etc

640964
mako	genshi
tg2 takes pylons and changes some defaults - object dispatching instead of routes and genshi instead of mako

640964
django	turbogears
tg2 and django both distinguish between websites and components so you ll eventually see reusable building blocks for turbogears too

640972
mbunit	mstest
i am not sure that this feature is possible in mstest out of box like in other test frameworks mbunit

641020
procmail	qmail
then your mta such as postfix or qmail will deliver mail to that address to procmail instead of an actual mailbox

641022
cfstring	nsstring
i ll add that not only can you go from cfstring to nsstring with only a type-cast but it works the other way as well

641033
turbogears	toscawidgets
turbogears now uses toscawidgets which can use jquery extjs dojo etc

641033
django	turbogears
this strikes me as a pro for turbogears if you don t have any javascript experience and a pro for django if you are writing a lot of specialized javascript

641055
ubuntu	debian
i ve googled for it of course but apart from some scripts i ve found there s no real project no package in debian ubuntu

641074
jxtable	jtable
i think this was on jxtable which supports sorting or in jtable in java 6

641117
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i find it very easy to just instantiate my uitabbarcontroller in my app delegate instantiate a uinavigationcontroller then push and pop view controllers as i go

641145
post	get
more information may be needed however i thought i would post to get advice on anything obvious that might be wrong here

641148
put	get
i put a breakpoint on a line in my application_start method and am expecting that when i attempt to debug the application that the breakpoint should get hit.

641153
pascal	delphi
if your code compiles in delphi 2007 into .net assemblies you may have a much easier option than trying to port from delphi s object pascal to c++

641168
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i just hope google-chrome firefox and safari can be temporary friends so they can overthrow ie

641174
pascal	delphi
free pascal claims to support delphi on os x though not being a pascal coder i haven t tried it

641215
pascal	delphi
if you want to port a delphi project to the mac free pascal is your best solution

641330
inherited	properties
determining whether an iiswebdirectory or an iiswebvirtualdir iis admin object is configured to be an application using system.directoryservices alone can sometimes be a non-obvious business because of metabase properties inherited

641330
inherited	properties
because of metabase properties inherited checking for any of the three properties listed above doesn t guarantee the object you re examining is actually an application - whether it be by using the adsi wmi or directoryservices api s

641358
filtering	grouping
is it possible to filtering the list of available grouping that i can see based on some criteria

641404
kde	gnome
if users are going to be shutting down via gnome kde just inhibit them from doing so

641417
boost	stl
if you want to learn how to interact with windows through c++ the vc++ main site is here and the how-do-i videos here also download the feature pack if you haven t installed sp1 yet is here besides ribbonizing mfc they ve included boost in the stl which is awesome

641435
typedef	struct
typedef struct _some_tag_

641494
portrait	landscape
i want my main content view to be autorotatable but i want my navigation hierarchy and settings screens to always display in portrait even if the content view was rotated to landscape

641544
notepad++	textpad	notepad	textpad
personally and i know this probably won t be popular but i tend to use excel and something like textpad or notepad++ or even vanilla notepad for once-off database inserts and table creations like this

641562
richtextbox	maskedtextbox
to provide more customization such as multiple email address you can also use maskedtextbox combined with richtextbox since there s no native windows forms implementation of the exact functionality of outlook email address input control

641562
richtextbox	maskedtextbox
i also have done this by capturing user s current cursor when the richtextbox control got focus and then directly masking the input using additional maskedtextbox generated on the fly at runtime displayed on top of the richtextbox

641631
getter	setter
properties are more maintainable than fields you can encapsulate logic in your setter getter allowing you to hide the implementation

641633
getter	setter
seems like the getter setter will be defined twice

641644
getter	setter
seen examples on this and seems straighforward enough although somewhat duplicated in terms of writing setter getter

641658
min	max	min	median	median	max
name median mean stddev min max samples

641720
min	max
if we number the vectors from 0 to 2n-2 element k of vector n will be at row max n-1-n+k k and column max n+k-n+1 k or in reverse the matrix element at row i column j will be element min i j of vector n-1+j-i

641794
emacs	textmate
i would like to do something like this textmate tip so that trailing whitespace are always highlighted in some way when i code something in python - it makes it easier to correct it immediately and other editors such as emacs can do it

641813
vb.net	vb6
i agree with franci - vb6 is no longer sold or supported so vb.net would be the way to go for compiled code

641842
cassini	iis
i can also add that everything works as expected on cassini but we need to get it up on iis to prove that it s worth investing time in doing the switch

641874
firefox	safari
jquery may do some work to ensure that the resize event gets fired consistently in all browsers but i m not sure if any of the browsers differ but i d encourage you to test in firefox safari and ie

641900
getter	setter
for .net framework from 2.0 up you can set the accessor for the getter setter

641900
getter	setter	public	protected
say you only want the user to only have read access to the field then you make the getter public but the setter private or protected

641947
ubuntu	debian
jsvc is bundled with at least debian and ubuntu

641965
fossil	git	perforce	cvs
i have only tried fossil and git though but i have used perforce cvs and subversion and it looks like dvcs all have really cheap branching and tagging

642008
autofac	castle-windsor
or alternatively try any of the ioc containers like castle-windsor autofac unity etc

642147
cvs	svn
if you can use svn or cvs for maintaining your code

642155
post	get
it took a while but with the help of the post that andy white sent i was able to get it up and running just the way i wanted

642160
webkit	gecko
gecko and webkit support setting rgba as a border-color property so you could potentially set

642160
width	height
to accomplish the bleeding however you ll probably need to overlay a transparent div on the image and give it a width and height equal to the width and height of the image minus the width of the border

642160
width	height
so if the image is 200x200 and you want a 2px border you ll probably have to make the div 196x196 since the box model dictates that the border width is added to the width height dimensions

642201
width	height
on the other hand there s no real need to specify width or height in either html or css though it might help your page render faster

642229
typedef	typename
but i ve never understood why gcc requires typedef typename within templates while vs and i guess icc don t

642257
typedef	typename
well gcc doesn t actually require the typedef -- typename is sufficient

642377
lisp	scheme
lucky in scheme code and data looks the same but thats about it you can never accidentally mix code with data as is very possible in lisp with unhygienic macros

642524
jar	war
we also take a copy of the deployable jar or war and place it in the version directory under binaries along with any dependencies and config files

642532
superclass	subclassing
as scott below guessed i want a superclass to call a specific set of methods defined in a subclassing

642533
multiplying	modulo
can t you just multiplying modulo n in a loop

642555
sin	sqrt
sin a abs l2-l1 sqrt sqr l2-l1 + sqr b2-b1

642555
sin	sqrt
sin a abs l2 f-l1 f sqrt sqr l2 f-l1 f + sqr b2-b1

642631
debian	linux
if the latter if you just want to backup some data you may use a utility like rsync available on most linux distributions like debian

642686
bazaar	git
sourceforge.net just added mercurial bazaar and git support

642703
superclass	subclassing
if you want a superclass to call a specific set of methods defined in a subclassing you can do a few things

642726
unix	solaris
use windows services for unix to create an nfs share on the windows xp system which you mount as normal on the solaris system

642749
post	get
you can use an nsurlrequest to post the image data and use nsxmlparser to get the resulting url

642764
client-side	server-side
i have made groups work server-side with page.validate group but i wasn t aware this could be done client-side

642925
hide	show
the jfilechooser component already handles the esc key by itself when the file chooser is show embedded in my dialog and i press esc the file chooser hide itself

642925
hide	show
mind you when the embedded file chooser is show the esc key should only hide it

642991
firefox	safari
i just read codes of a web product that is supposed to support multiple modern browser including firefox 3.x safari 3.x and ie7+ but not including ie6-

643018
loops	if-statement
in an if-statement there is only a forward jump to the point after the if-body if the condition evaluates to false remember the cpu anyways assumes to not take a branch jump but in a loops there is maybe a forward branch to the position after loops not to be taken and a backward branch upon repetetion to be taken

643064
gprof	shark
it can be used to visualize several different formats this is a python script to convert the output from prof gprof oprofile shark aqtime and python profilers into a dot graph. this is what the output look like

643077
exslt	libxslt
if you are using an xslt 1.0 processor which supports the exslt date functions i ve just tested this with libxslt in php you can use date add and date duration

643078
getter	setter
i understand the difference between class and interface thankyou my point is that my marking it with the interface i shouldn t have to have this property inside every implementing class unless i want to change the default behaviour of the getter or setter

643101
gridview	rowdatabound
you can also do this in the rowdatabound event of the gridview

643110
getter	setter
lack of separate getter setter access for properties

643115
mouse	keyboard
it is very fast to provide useful control names...very little keyboard mouse jockeying to do this...so high productivity with intuitive results

643161
inherited	subclassing
i have 7 subclassing that inherited the super base class

643161
superclass	subclassing
i would like to populate the common values for the superclass and then use those for each of the subclassing but i can t come up with a good way to do this

643230
filtering	grouping
please note when using the memberof in an ldap filtering the search value must be a complete string to a grouping and so you can t use a wildcard such as memberof cn students grouping

643230
post	get
i did see this post which says what your trying to do is possible without having to do anything extra by matching components of distinguished names but i have never seen this before and i could not get it to work

643274
gridview	repeater
i have a gridview nested within a repeater and i m trying to enable paging on the gridview without much success

643355
hash	md5
so we re intending to pass a token like a 40 characters combination of letters and digit or a md5 hash in the url and to use ssl

643387
hash	md5
from what i understand of your idea in theory someone could type in a random 40 character string or md5 hash and get someone elses details

643393
wordpress	joomla
this also means projects like drupal joomla wordpress etc

643405
gridview	repeater
your sample has the gridview directly within the repeater

643434
cvs	svn
use text-based version control cvs svn etc.

643435
uniq	grep
using only uniq and grep

643471
hash	salt
it is hard if the guids are set up sensibly using salt secure hash and you have plenty of bits

643476
children	parent
inside the parent class i can access but that returns a resultset of children and i d have to iterate over them to get each one s grandchildren

643563
width	height
if you know either the height or width you can set only that

643598
emacs	jedit
jedit is fairly light-weight and so is emacs and i know they both have java modes

643598
ant	maven
for builds just use ant or maybe maven building in the ide is nice but overrated

643627
sorting	grouping
at a more mature stage where user deliverables are a priority use traditional tools where you don t have to spend dev time writing sorting grouping or pagination logic

643713
int	chars
its most correct use imo is as a coded chars set - a set of chars and a mapping between the chars and int code points representing them

643762
overlapping	insets
the itemscontrol is bound to data that is displayed as an insets on a map for various cities so the goal is to keep the insets as close to their cities without overlapping any other insets

643762
width	height
1. the first issue i ran into is that despite msdn saying that measureoverride should return a height and width of positive infinity if it wants to take up the full space available i get an error when i try to do so

643762
overlapping	insets
2. i tried using visualtreehelper.findelementinhostcoordinates using the canvas.left and canvas.top properties of each itemscontrol a few levels underneath the contentpresenter of each insets to find other overlapping items within the overlappanel subtree

643762
width	height
3. since i m using the overlappanel as an itemspanel for an itemscontrol i have to drill down into the visual tree a couple levels to get an actual left top value and width height to calculate positioning but this wouldn t allow the panel to be used as a generic panel

643795
superclass	subclassing
but a scenario where the subclassing is instantiating the superclass in a method other than it s constructor may still want the current behaviour

643808
unicode	ucs
unicode is just a standard that defines a character set ucs and encodings utf to encode this character set

643810
multibyte	substr
multibyte encodings i should say multi-unit after the above explanation have the advantage that they are relatively space-efficient but the downside that operations such as finding substr comparisons etc

643810
unicode	ucs
both the ucs standards and the utf standards encode the code points as defined in unicode

643836
ubuntu	linux
it s not supported for ubuntu but there are linux editions available here

643869
bazaar	git
but distributed version control systems like git mercurial and bazaar are much better suited for your type of environment than subversion

643901
inline	inlining
making a property or method private can enhance execution speed because the compiler may be more likely to inline the code but i don t know of any instances where this reduces the memory footprint inlining may actually increase footprint at the benefit of speed

643932
postgresql	mysql
for a database i generally use mysql though postgresql might be more suitable if you do lots of really complex queries

643936
int	chars
chars for example has int integral type but is not the int type obviously

643936
int	chars
so if it wants an int and you pass a chars it automatically promotes the chars to the int

643995
width	height
all shapes in the drawing are rectangles with same width and height

644009
hex	binary
if you re building what amounts to a hex editor then you re working with binary data

644020
filtering	grouping
put your objects in a container and filtering grouping so each one only appears once

644069
free	malloc
you snipped out the code that actually uses buf but if you use malloc or similar to make a buffer it won t be free unless you also free it

644083
int	chars
currently i m seeing when the defaultmodelbinder errors because the input is invalid for the type chars in int invalid date etc. i get ui default error summary â œsomething has gone wrongâ â but no specific error message regarding the specific property that failed conversion

644177
internationalization	translation
also remember that internationalization and translation are two very different things manage them separately

644213
currentculture	uiculture
windows has settings for currentculture uiculture and invariantculture

644275
filtering	grouping
to filtering the grouping by domain and user try

644306
width	height
it is not obvious from how you pose the question whether it is the dimensions of the picture or the size of the png file which you want to optimize as picture histograms do not affect their dimensions width and height

644315
rss	feed
example say if was a doing a rss feed to contains weather temperature info i might have several item tags with one for each city

644323
rss	feed
if you want an example of weather rss feed you should definitely take a look at the rss feed that are produced by the weather channel at

644323
rss	feed
we would parse out the rss feed to get the temperature and cloud coverage of our specific zip code s weather

644332
post	get
apple s key signing is hard enough to get working with the real thing it took me a couple of hours and i m not alone - there s a great many post out there on development forums from people having difficulties managing it

644334
width	height
the problem you ve discovered is that plain uicomponent does not report a width or height value to its parent because it simply doesn t know what that value should be

644358
hide	show
what i have is some javascript jquery adding a click event to a link that will show or hide a div

644378
width	height
i have a rectangle center at x y with a defined width and height

644403
subtract	add
if the rotation point isn t at the origin subtract the center of rotation from your original coordinates perform the rotation as shown above and then add the center of rotation back in again

644411
cos	sin
x x cos theta - y sin theta

644411
cos	sin
y y cos theta + x sin theta

644439
x86	64bit
- if you didn t specify a specific model then your app will run as a 32-bit on x86 and a 64bit on x64

644461
int	chars
i would think that since c chars x is private only the c float ctor is visible from outside and that should be called by converting int to float

644490
viewdidload	viewwillappear
instead of viewdidload try putting that code in viewwillappear which gets called every time the view will show on the screen

644498
put	get
you might get better results if you put your custom stuff in a separate view or layer and let the os deal with compositing the result over the background

644526
width	height
313x240 pixels which if i could positiont the ruler perfectly would probably be equal to the width and height that the imagesource is reporting.

644543
gif	png
png and gif are the two file formats that support transparency

644543
width	height
one last note i create the bitmap object with width and height only i don t specify the pixel format or whatever that s called bitmap new bitmap width height

644625
width	height
here weâ ve set stretch to uniform and bound the width and height to the pixelwidth and pixelheight of the source effectively ignoring dpi

644678
range	max	range	min	min	max
i am trying to write a function which generates a random floating point value in the range min max

644707
jboss	weblogic	jboss	oc4j	weblogic	oc4j
i ve worked with jboss and weblogic before but at my current job we re using oc4j which is a first for me

644735
x86	64bit
64bit shifts cannot be done in one instruction on x86

644741
cpu	processors
this is because some compilers or processors will use more bits of precision in a cpu register than in memory msvc has 3 different floating-point behavior options for example

644742
post	get
as far as i understand this can be done implementing the post redirect get pattern but i don t know how to do it in asp.net 3.5

644771
autofac	castle-windsor
the example is for castle-windsor but it can probably be adapted for autofac

644773
getter	setter
three-line classes with constructors getter setter and type validation

644791
folder	directory
the question has already been answered so i m just gonna make a brief remark in your question you use the terms folder and directory interchangeably

644791
folder	directory
remember unix has directory not folder

644791
folder	directory
that s why i believe the folder metaphor for unix directory is wrong and even dangerous

644813
folder	directory
if you place the swf file in your application s src directory it will give you the option to include in the installer previously i tried putting it in the application s root folder

vmware	virtualbox
in either scenario you could use a virtual machine in either windows or linux unix for basically nothing using virtualbox or vmware

645031
cvs	rcs
once you understand how that s done and clearcase does it very well to the point where we do even small changes as a branch and re-merge not something i would have ever done with rcs or cvs you ll find your life is made a lot easier

645032
postgresql	mysql

but all i can find using google are httplib and urllib - and i am unable to find a shortcut in those libraries

645424
cvs	rcs
so i still use rcs not even cvs for most of my personal work

645424
manual	rcs
of course you can use a trigger for rcs keyword substitution clearcase manual checkin trigger example provided you use an appropriate merge manager

645433
children	parent
you should also consider alternate ways to store your tree--ways that eliminate explicit links to parent or children

645437
jobs	cron
you may need to run db scripts both upgrade and downgrade scripts restart cron jobs or move files around

645480
unix	solaris
the picture you provided is a typical large datacenter but each individual machine you see there is a single server probably running linux unix windows or possibly solaris or something

645505
width	height
simply you can use a absolute positioned image with both width height set to 100 wrapped with the body tagk if you could use a whole background

645700
freebsd	linux
i have tested this on freebsd not sure if this will work on linux or windows so you may need to modify it a little

645742
wav	ogg
it may seem quite basic but once you start sacrificing small children to the unholy gods of sdl stuff like sdl_image perfect for reading numerous image file formats - to the extent i sometimes use sdl solely to read jpeg or sdl_mixer sole solution you need for reading and playing basic audio - ogg wav ...

if you need to completely override one of serializable or deserialization and thus implement ixmlserializable then you have to do both yourself

646005
filtering	grouping
you should be able to use that to filtering the grouping choices

646078
versioning	upgrade
but if you want a compile time error while building your app you might as well upgrade your schema to the latest versioning as part of your build process avoiding the possibility of schema changes in the first place

646086
rsa	aes
from what i could gather so far people either recommend aes or rsa for this

646193
rsa	aes
yes rsa and aes are two very different things

646260
chown	sudo	chown	chmod
for instance i ll often chmod chown dev devices serial ports etc under sudo root so i can use them from my software without being root

646288
put	get
as you can above i put a system.out.print statement in and every time i click on something in the list i get two ouputs for that item eg

646340
interbase	firebird
as far as i can tell you will not be able to do this neither against ms sql server nor against interbase firebird

646356
integer	unsigned
when the right hand side is evaluated all arguments are promoted to the highest type of the operands of the expression which if phnumrow is unsigned will be unsigned integer

646388
disk	ram
disk io is the weakest link with vmware server and nothing is worse than paging virtualized ram to a virtualized disk file

646388
vmware	virtualbox
i ve found that better disk io performance gives me a better overall experience so i traded the better cpu performance and overall stability unfortunately of vmware server for the better io performance of virtualbox

646395
tcpclient	sslstream	tcplistener	tcpclient	tcplistener	sslstream
i ve got a simple client-server application based on tcpclient tcplistener and sslstream

646395
x509certificate	sslstream
clients can authenticate themselves to the server using a x509certificate or by sending a user name and password after the sslstream has been established

646438
vim	emacs
i keep hearing i should learn vim or emacs but the thing is there is absolutely no way i ll need to use them in work so i feel a bit guilty pouring time into mastering one of them

646438
vim	emacs
worse than that i m wondering if learning vim or emacs could make me slower with visual studio as i d confusing short cut keys

646438
notepad++	scite
currently i m doing my editing in linux using scite i think this became notepad++ on windows

646452
folder	directory
you add the mime types to the httpd.conf like the link jaredpar provided and you set the publishing folder to the directory of the webfolder and then the installation folder to it s equivalent uri

646458
vim	emacs
vim and emacs are great if you re willing to learn the keyboard shortcuts

646461
vim	emacs
i d recommend vim if you are going to learn one or the other but i know emacs users will strongly disagree

646536
hash	md5
you make a 128-bit md5 hash of this information

646536
hash	md5
the client software converts it back to a 128-bit number 16 bytes decrypts that using the public key of your ec crypto and compares the result to an md5 hash of the user s personal information which must match what was used for registration

646610
trac	mantis
i d recommend mantis or trac

646643
shim	polyfills
you ll want to use a shim polyfills to add it on browsers that don t support it

646660
int	chars
text is initialized outside of the for-loop as a string and i get the same error when i make temp 1 into a chars or an int

646686
putty	winscp
putty and winscp are all you need

646691
put	get
it could be said that perhaps you should have spent more time designing but a key element in an agile process is that coding is part of the design process and in most cases having put some reasonable effort into design it s better to just get on with it

646717
hex	binary
a less detailed and simpler approach would be to open .ppt file in hex editor and look for information you are interesed in you should be able to see text within the binary data and what surrounds it

646743
maven	pom.xml
if you are using the maven tomcat plugin you can specify a context.xml by adding a plugin configuration block to the pom.xml

646772
width	height
set the width and height for the image

646780
inline	inlining
it s up to the jit the c# compiler doesn t do any inlining as far as i m aware but i believe the jit will inline trivial properties in most cases

646828
post	get
i get the same set for line 50 but didn t post it for the sake of brevity

646830
serializable	deserialization
serializing usernamesecuritytoken s and x509securitytoken s works like a charm haven t tried deserialization but windowssecuritytoken s are apparently not supported by the serializable

646832
filesystems	fat
this is because fat directories are as on many unix filesystems simply a packed array of fixed-size directory entry structs along with an ugly hack to fit long file names written in unicode into a directory structure designed for 8.3 names written in ascii

646832
folder	dir
on a fat32 volume dir shows the files in a different order than it will if that same folder is copied to an ntfs volume

646833
decoder	encoder
i implemented this behavior in my amf3 encoder decoder i developed in erlang but being not very experienced with flash api i can hardly find how can i easily force flash to use these reference tables when serializing objects to amf3

646874
stdout	stderr
on nix type os if you are process is outputting to stdout or stderr you can obviously use pipes

646934
daemon	cron
i would be inclined to perform this task with a cron job rather than polling the database in a daemon

646937
daemons	systemd
you might want to consider making a mysql trigger that executes a systemd command ffmpeg instead of a daemons

646979
hash	salt
you really should have a unique random salt for each hash

647017
subclass	abstract-class
now in the subclass i call the run method of the abstract-class because this should be common to all clients

647020
hash	salt
also there is no need to append the bytes of the salt to the string before calling update simply call update twice with the salt in the first call and the password to be hash in the second

647039
equals	gethashcode
i am seeing in some domain object models that an abstract base class is created that implement equals and gethashcode for all domain entity objects to inherit from to gain their identity

647059
hash	salt
note however that once your user table is compromised if the attacker knows the salt and hash scheme what you re hashing and the hash alg itself then he can get passwords by starting with popular passwords and comparing the hash salt version against each user record

647139
addition	twos-complement
i like bit operations because the code says chopping off the extra bits rather than relying on the effect of addition on numbers expressed in twos-complement notation

647144
move	drag
when you hold down the mouse button on something you don t start a drag operation until the mouse move outside a small region around the mouse-down location

647180
jobs	cron
how would you distinguish between idling a forgotten shell hanging in tmp overnight long-running scripts nightly cron jobs and actual activity

647203
gridview	objectdatasource
try moving the objectdatasource outside of the gridview

647213
public	protected
if you declare a method public protected then it can be overridden by children outside of the package

647213
public	protected
i use package because there is no keyword for it so in the absence of public protected private you get package access

647240
rss	feed
twitter s rss feed displays names as

647240
rss	feed
other details i m parsing an rss feed into a page using simplepie

647256
rss	feed
i would suggest parsing the rss feed as usual then getting the value of the element from your parsed structure finding the index of the opening parenthesis and trimming off everything from the previous index the space onwards

647365
redmine	trac
i use or have used trac mediawiki and redmine

647365
redmine	trac
trac and redmine are more than just wiki s

647366
nsstring	nsobject
cocoa is a framework that includes things like nsobject and nsstring

647420
tcpclient	networkstream
we create a wrapper around stream a superclass of networkstream which is a superclass of tcpclient or whatever

647437
icmp	udp
what i mean by using winpcap is the you could capture icmp traffic and then see if the captured packet is about your udp packet being undeliverable or not

647443
min	max
i currently have code that calls matplotlib.pylab.plot multiple times to display multiple sets of data on the same screen and matplotlib scales each to the global min and max considering all plots

647446
super	abstract
however using interfaces all this innards that are hanging out when looking at the abstract super class or the concrete class are safely tucked away

647450
hide	show
that method should just check to see if the dialogue is visible and if so hide it and maybe show an error message

647456
post	get
if it works for the application you could switch to use post instead the problem form is surely using get if not take a look at jon s answer

647479
post	get
as stated in previous post this is a very different list to the one you get by right click and selecting properties

647519
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the uiviewcontroller has been designed to work hand in hand with uinavigationcontroller

647519
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationitem
when pushing a new view a uinavigationcontroller will inject references to itself and to a uinavigationitem containing metadata about the navigation back button with the title of the view behind it etc...

647557
folder	directory
if your application files are not in a subfolder of wwwroot you can create a virtual directory pointing to your project folder

647558
consistency	acid
rdbms are much easier to use for consistency of data acid

647604
mouse	keyboard
i ll assume it s not a keyboard mouse or windows event since that s what gui frameworks are for

647642
jruby	mri
i have heard that mri only supports green threads and jruby supports native threads via jvm

647651
hash	salt
you should store passwords hash and properly salt

647669
getter	setter
in general all your data should be private and accessed via getter and setter

647692
post	get
edit you edited your post to get resource for inner workings of server components

647708
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
if you want more experience in another language and have not tried it yet i would recommend to learn a functional programming language such as scheme lisp or haskell

647731
posix	getcwd
as others have already pointed out getcwd is not included in iso c++ but is part of posix ieee std 1003.1

647737
put	get
while you can read about things like memory management data structures and their implementations algorithms etc. you won t really get it until you ve had a chance to put it in to practice

647777
daemons	systemd
i m just about to put live a systemd i ve built based on the queueing daemons beanstalkd

647779
serializable	deserialization
now i ve previously written custom serializable and deserialization externalizable for various reasons in years past

647783
vxworks	rtos
this has been tested on the exact same hardware running vxworks this logic also works nicely in nucleus rtos and os20 on different platforms fwiw

647822
spaces	linefeed
all characters except whitespace characters spaces tab carriage return linefeed vertical tab and formfeed that is

647840
serializable	deserialization
i haven t seen many benchmarks for serializable deserialization but few support less that 200 micro-seconds for serializable deserialization

647849
int	double
map money to decimal or double as you wish map bool to bit or equivalent map datetime to datetime map byte to binary map long to number x 0 and map int to int

647979
firefox	safari
and here s what firefox and safari 4 beta report on my macbook pro

648013
strcpy	strncpy
if you want to copy a string into a buffer then use strcpy or strncpy

648089
aggregate-functions	sum
when using an aggregate-functions sum count .

648097
strdup	malloc
there#s a function strdup to make a copy of a string...it makes sure you don t forget the +1 in your malloc

648112
post	get
if i get around to making a patch to expose this functionality on menuitemfont assuming it s not already in the pre-.7.1 sources i ll update my post

648159
disk	ram
i apologize for the newb question but i found your question interesting and am curious if ram disk could be used in such a way

648206
width	height
width 90 height 4000 frameborder 0 scrolling no

648280
hide	show
then everything is pretty standard you are doing pushviewcontroller and popviewcontrolleranimated to show and hide details controller

648321
margin	height
the vertical centering is done by placing the top of the div 50 down the page then use a negative top margin that is half the height of the div to move it up to the center

648321
opera	firefox
the code is tested in firefox 3 ie 7 ie 8 beta and opera 9

648330
disk	ram
buffer is temporary placeholder variables in many programming languages in memory ram disk on which data can be dumped and then processing can be done

648363
post	get
it s slightly different as the schema i m using was simplified for the above post but you get the idea

648403
hash	salt
the hash password doesn t stay the same because it is being salt on each time it is used it s ok because the hash contains the salt where it can be found later to compare

648403
hash	salt
salt are just random characters numbers symbols to add more variance to the hash to make it difficult to crack

648412
inline-functions	inlining
the speed benefits in using inlining decrease significantly as the size of the inline-functions increases

648492
hide	show
slide the other items up or down to show the new item or hide the deleted item

648545
int	double
the situation is there is a file with 14 294 508 unsigned int and 13 994 397 floating-point numbers need to read double s

648624
ironruby	ironpython
this is goes for ruby ironruby python ironpython and dynamic vb

648660
salt	md5
what you could do is use a unique salt keyword and generate against md5 sha-1 or sha-2 if you are really concerned with security

648678
int	chars
foo should add 10 bytes 2 int + 2 chars

648711
rss	feed
maybe have a look at yahoo pipes - it can be used to modify rss feed into a post-processed rss feed that can do anything including regex search replace

648735
post	get
this post should get your started or here

648743
integer	unsigned
these should work fine on java which does not support unsigned integer primitives

648747
integer	unsigned
arc4random returns a 32-bit unsigned integer 0 to 2 32 -1

648756
joomla	elgg	elgg	moodle
integrating moodle with other solutions is the way to go - joomla as you ve suggested and also take a look at elgg version 1.5 just released

648767
accessor	properties
is required in the properties accessor

648767
accessor	properties
since you have additional logic in you accessor the use of auto-implemented properties is not appropriate in your scenario

648780
ironruby	ironpython
this may mean embedding ironruby or ironpython in your .net application

648783
sharepoint	splist
if you need to get the list of available fields for a sharepoint list check the parent splist object s fields property which is a collection of the fields in this list

648821
short	base
are costing the business a lot more in the medium and possibly even short term than it would to launch a whole hearted effort to re-write refactor replace the whole thing the code base is about 300k lines

648831
folder	dir
any even better solution in so far as using the latest binaries for openssl is to rename both libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll in both the ruby bin folder and also the posgresql lib folder and install the latest openssl from at the time of writing it was win32 openssl v0.9.8j light put the dir in the path and away you go it worked for me

648856
rational-numbers	fractions
the best thing to do is to implement a fractions class or rational-numbers class

648885
firefox	safari
i am developing lamp but oriented to a windows base majority so i really must run windows native and test heavy for ie all projects work smooth on firefox and safari ie s really the bottleneck

onfocus	onblur
i believe what you want to do is sink the htmltextcontainerevents2 dispinterface and respond to onfocus and potentially onblur

648907
memcpy	realloc	memcpy	malloc	realloc	malloc	strlen	realloc	free	memcpy	free	realloc	free	malloc
as far as the function internals my make is a call to strlen and two calls to malloc and a call to memcpy my adds is a call to strlen a call to realloc and a call to memcpy and my free is two calls to the standard library free

vim	emacs
or do vim or emacs have auto-completion as good as xcode

649022
vim	emacs
what you are missing is that emacs and vim are actually ides

649024
vim	emacs
well before the days of xcode there was vim and emacs

649024
vim	emacs
many people got accustomed to vim emacs and thus continue to use it

649024
vim	emacs
vim has incredible regex engine emacs does as well and is very handy because vi comes with pretty much every unix os and works fantastically if you don t have arrow keys yeah yeah real old school

649024
vim	emacs
the same is true with emacs as well but for me i find cursor motion much easier on vim

649024
vim	emacs
personally i use emacs to code vim to manipulate text and firefox to look at lolcats

649045
vim	emacs
some people like to work with lightweight texteditors like g vim emacs pico etc

649105
vim	emacs
but it s good to mention that you could also figure that out by yourself by reading these kinda posts a lot of users uses vim emacs .

649111
atof	strtod	strtol	atof	strtol	strtod
you are not clear if you mean floating point literal as part of the source code for the compiler to parse into architecture-dependent binary representation or scanned by library functions such as scanf atof strtol strtod and strtold at run-time to convert to in-memory float double or long double value

649192
tripledes	aes	des	aes
rijndael is what became aes the general replacement to des so it s definitely preferred over des and tripledes unless you need to be compatible with some old des-based system

649218
svg	vml
i believe svg is a successor to vml

649268
3des	aes	des	aes
weakest fastest rc2 des 3des aes rijndael strongest slowest

649277
des	aes
aes is the successor of des as standard symmetric encryption algorithm for us federal organizations and as standard for pretty much everybody else too

649277
3des	aes
using a block cipher properly is not easy and it is more important than selecting between aes or 3des

649288

i tried a combination of getline and strtok inside a while loop which did not work

649410
try-catch	exception-handling
to control what happens during an exception-handling you use a try-catch block

649421
vim	emacs
vim and emacs both have great communities where people are willing to code up features for just about any language

649421
vim	emacs
so many ides also feature emacs and vim compatibilty modes or extensions

649421
vim	emacs
sooner or later you will choose which suits you vim emacs ide and then stick to improving your skills with it

649462
ubuntu	linux
i tested it on ubuntu linux with gnu bash 3.2.13

649605
folder	directory
depending on your folder structure and where the css is located relative to the images it is using you will have to go up to the root level of the image directory and access it from there so you could maybe try something like

649707
post	get
and if you get in trouble may be post another question about mmaping

649726
typedef	struct
you cannot use a templated typedef but you can use a convenience class struct with an inner type

649736
vim	emacs
i have only used emacs briefly and while i prefer vim i am jealous of some of its features

649736
vim	emacs
but i ultimately went with vim because i find the chord-input model that emacs uses to put unnecessary strain on my fingers

649827
facade	mediator
i just catched myself on writing a mediator object that connects 4 other objects to facade them and create new functionality

649886
stdout	stderr
before launching a child i create stdout and stderr handles to a log file for example if i am about to launch proca i create handles to loga.log

649904
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can capture the mouseenter and mouseleave events on both your forms and controls in order to do whatever you need to when the mouse is moved on or off your form

650031
firefox	safari
examples tested in safari + firefox

650034
inherited	properties
i like to use it when assigning to inherited properties

650036
metaphone	soundex
as far as approximations go though for single terms you could use a modification of an algorithm like soundex or metaphone to pick a color

650036
metaphone	soundex
for multiple terms you could for example apply soundex or metaphone to each word individually then sum them up with overflow

650045
put	get
having dynamic css across the site will cause you issues as the style sheet will get cached so it s better to put all of the style into the file and allow local caching to speed up the page than try to make lots of small css files

650092
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox opera google-chrome and safari for windows all work properly

650167
int	chars
in c++ you can only use a switch statement on int and chars

650176
chunked	transfer-encoding
one header that i see running a quick test is transfer-encoding chunked and i also see that they re not sending content-length

650208
int	chars
you can t use string in switch case.only int chars are allowed

650217
int	chars
you can only use switch on primitive such as int chars and enum

650243
g++	gcc
dmitry is correct you should use -lstdc++ if you use gcc but even better is to use g++ instead

650252
mouse	keyboard
i did find that subscribing to the windows keypressevent did give me keyboard events but not mouse click events

650299
integer	unsigned
c++ ulong is a 32-bit unsigned integer type

650299
integer	unsigned
in this case your constants don t need to be unsigned so just use int in c# or integer in vb.net

650319
disk	ram
on the assumption that you don t have 2.4 pb of disk space to hold 3 off 10 8 square non-sparse matrices of doubles let alone that much ram for an in-memory database - blue gene q only has 1.6 pb .

650391
chunked	transfer-encoding
you can use chunked transfer-encoding

650391
chunked	transfer-encoding
basically you send a transfer-encoding chunked header and then the data is sent in chunked mode meaning that you send the length of a chunk followed by the chunk

ienumerable	iqueryable
any linq provider needs to return iqueryable or better an ienumerable as that s how linq works

650667
hash	md5
create an md5 or similar hash using the file s contents

650683
getter	setter
icart specifies a getter and setter for cartitems but your implementation only has a get

650717
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
and no it won t get free when it goes out of scope - when you use malloc or realloc it s all up to you

650717
free	realloc
after realloc ptr might be pointing to an entirely different place in memory and continuing to use the original value of ptr could leave you using memory that s been free and which isn t as big as you think it is

650721
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
yes you need to free everything you allocate with malloc and realloc and the other related c style memory allocation functions

650723
realloc	malloc
realloc should only be used to reallocate memory allocated by malloc what you are doing works only by accident and will eventually crash horribly

650741
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
realloc is illegal here the address has to be null or an address returned by an earlier call to realloc malloc or calloc

650752
free	realloc
trying to free or realloc a stack variable can lead to undefined behaviour including but not limited to corrupted stack leading to unpredictable flow of control corrupted heap service structures corrupted user memory

650756
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
therefore you provide either a null pointer or a pointer to something allocated by malloc or realloc or calloc and store the pointer returned

650826
globalization	localization
globalization and localization in .net

650827
hide	show
i think the best way to accomplish it however is to create the item normally as part of the page and just hide it using a css style until you want to show it via javascript rather than creating it from scratch dynamically

650837
folder	directory
otherwise ghost should be able to just pick some folder and files and not only complete os s so that might be a better choice not sure if you can deploy the software in other directory than the one on the master machine though

650846
client-side	server-side
keep in mind that asp.net ajax is comprised of both the client-side javascript library microsoftajax.js and the server-side components in system.web.extensions

650862
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
mystring is not allocated with malloc or calloc so it can t be reallocated with realloc or free with free

650864
post	get	puts	gets
gets puts do as well but when i try to do a post to an action in my service i get the following error returned

650869

i suppose that you can did this calculation listing for the rowdatabound event of the ms gridview however more straight-forward means i use during my development is to take advantage of the calculated column of the telerik web grid

651076
actionscript	haxe
you might also want to try haxe a relatively new language with similar syntax with actionscript ecmascript that can output to several different formats such as swf javascript php and c++

651097
unix	aix	irix	linux
i did some work about 5 years ago porting code to many flavours of unix aix irix hpux linux

651179
ant	cruisecontrol
although the a compile task works directly from ant when run from cruisecontrol it seems to be trying to find it s own internal libraries based on paths from the b jar settings

651183
firefox	safari
works fine in firefox and safari

651200
rapidsvn	tortoisesvn
with a gui interface along with a command line one subversion has tortoisesvn rapidsvn which is more of a traditional ui or ankhsvn for visual studio integration

651262
onmouseover	onclick
however it probably would be possible to use javascript + html + css to make your own select list using just div and span elements and that correct onclick and onmouseover javascript

651268
ant	cruisecontrol
in your cruisecontrol configuration you can specify the anthome or antscript attributes so that you use your version of ant so you should be able to get the same behavior from cc that you get at the command-line

651273
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
similar to what svcutil.exe does for wcf services or what wsdl.exe did for web services but for wcf rest services

651278
rss	feed
just grab your rss feed and put it here

651293
gridview	objectdatasource
i m using an objectdatasource with a gridview with an onobjectcreated handler on the code-behind

651321
put	get	post	put	post	get
all rest services can use http verbs like get post put delete

651336
width	margin
in some contexts you can leverage margin settings to effectively specify 100 width minus n pixels

651370
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
before this project i just built reused a couple of classes to handle the nsurlconnection and nsxmlparser work but instead of type introspection i used the delegation pattern

651413
hide	show
you can then show or hide the sets depending on what is currently showing on the map you can find the boundary of the map using gmap2.getbounds

651429
profiling	debugging
though simics is non-free i highly recommend it and its built in debugging profiling tools while making your kernel

651449
sorting	filtering
searching sorting filtering which all implies the internal upercassing engine of tdxmemdataset it s a repeated action

651449
sorting	filtering
otoh users are very demanding with the speed of data retreival operations searching sorting filtering etc.

651543
folder	directory
visual studio save the reference location as relative paths so put in the a folder in your project and make sure the it proprieties copy local is true it will make the vs to copy the file to the output directory

651562
cvs	svn
i have been coding since a long time but i have never ever used the code management systems like cvs or svn

651632
try-catch	exception-handling
in general try-catch blocks are great because they will break move to the catch statement whenever the exception-handling occurs

651636
hex	binary
in computer engineering it s easier to deal with hexadecimal addresses than decimal numbers since addresses and data inside the computer s memory is binary and can be directly represented as a hex number

651637
innodb	myisam
all the tables support it innodb tables support it but myisam tables don t

651664
many-to-many	many-to-one
so i m stuck with left joins for many-to-one relationships and n r+1 queries due to the many-to-many relationships

651683
hide	show
the goal is to let the user to hide show move resize columns to save this layout and to be able to restore it when the app re-starts

651698
int	chars
int length chars data

651700
gif	png
i would like to have jquery limit a file upload field to only jpg jpeg png and gif

651708
mouse	keyboard
these machines all currently run windows xp and we have a windows service that is used to lock a machine by blocking any keyboard or mouse input

651708
mouse	keyboard
ctrl+alt+del is blocked via a keyboard filter driver and the rest of the keys and mouse are currently blocked using the blockinput function from user32.dll

651746
int	chars
int length chars data

651761
filesystems	xfs
according to wikipedia any character except nul is legal in an xfs filesystems file name

651774
children	parent
so inside the filter we get all the children of the tr get the 2nd and return whether or not its text is equal to open - if it is it would return true and we could keep the parent in the selector

651788
filesystems	xfs
posix filesystems including xfs allow every character in file names with the exception of nul 0x00 and forward-slash

651843
folder	directory
i know the user i m authenticating with has a backup folder in his directory

651855
sorting	grouping
i am attempting to export a query from ms access into ms excel in a way that does not carry over the sorting and grouping

651888
children	parent
if the parent is associated with the children then there should be a parent property in every child which i don t see and you ll have to update the children anyway so you ll have to load all the children from the database

651888
children	parent
if it s not just save the parent with the name property and don t even bother with the children

651913
realloc	malloc
i hope this example makes it clear - the variables are the same size and the amount of additional memory allocated by malloc realloc is the same as well

651934
subclass	abstract-class
it still makes sense in a code-organizational context to put public int getcalories in abstract-class food as it d be silly for the person eating it the code using a subclass of food to define how many calories it has

651947
spaces	delimiter
in keeping with my complete lack of efficiency i was planning just to do a string.replace on the html tags after i broke them up and then just finding the index of the opening brackets and grabbing the spaces delimiter strings that are remaining

651971
postgresql	mysql
for example gis extensions for mysql and for postgresql both follow opengis simple features specification for sql standard

652004
webkit	gecko
edit the fop faq suggests that the correct syntax is fill url grad.svg#purpletowhite but that doesn t work in gecko or webkit

652006
accessor	properties	public	protected
if you can t change the schema you might want to make the designer generated accessor private protected and create a public accessor to front-end the properties in a partial class implementation

652077
accessor	properties
if they are being assigned to the properties probably from the example change the set accessor so that it does the trim there

652164
mouseleave	mouseenter
i think it is impossible to do without handling the mouseenter and mouseleave events of all the children but you do not have to wire them manually

652165
free	malloc
hello world is a constant string literal you need to allocate memory using malloc in c or new in c++ if you want memory you are free to modify

652193
typedef	struct
typedef struct

652193
unsigned	short
unsigned short m_short1

652193
unsigned	short
unsigned short m_short2

652197
public	protected
i m about to sub-class accordion just to make protected function get contentheight number a public function

652232
getter	setter
as an example map nhib onto private fields or private property setter and only expose property getter publicly

652265
width	height
mywindow window.open mp3 mp3player.html mp3player width 130 height 120 left 0 left 100 top 100 location no

652286
firefox	safari
take a look at either in safari or firefox then in ie7 and you ll see what i mean

652286
hide	show
i m currently using the built-in effect fadeto for fading the content but i ve also tried creating custom effects as well as using both show hide animate and fadeup fadedown

652300
hash	md5
i need to hash a string using the md5 technique in cocoa

652311
sortedmap	sortedset
i need to iterate through sortedmap s entry set which is a sortedset backwards

652314
ssid	wlan
the available wlan network ssid s

652317
hash	md5
but if you just want to hash something using md5 on an iphone this should give you the information you need

652324
mbunit	nunit
in the .net world you would run these small bits of code using something like nunit or mbunit or even the built in testing tools in visual studio

652325
ostream	istream
thus any oarchive can use any ostream and any iarchive can use any istream

652329
hash	md5
md5 is not encryption it is a cryptographic hash function

652329
hash	md5
the fact that it is cryptographic means that it is a computationally hard problem that given an md5 hash output compute a string whose md5 is that value

652390
post	get
the double post will get solved

652433
width	height
your user control has width and height predefined and your grid is stretching to fill that without regard to the object tag size

652436
width	height
you will suffer to get the iframe full width and full height especially in ie

652440
inherited	properties
also make sure that the inherited properties in that global.asax is pointing to your custom class namespace and all in your global.asax.cs file

652475
hide	show
in response to your comment i have put a number of the show hide sections on this example and all appears to work fine for me in ie6 and firefox 3

652503
children	parent
i acknowledge that the parent program can wait for the children to complete using one of the wait functions or using the select function

652511
children	parent
just earlier today someone told me that they always use a pipe by which the children can send notification to the parent process that all is going well

652511
stdout	stderr
this seems a decent solution and is especially useful in places where you would want to print an error but no longer have access to stdout stderr etc

652512
getter	setter
the insert magic refers to handling each call to the generic property getter or setter that has a different type for the type parameter

652512
getter	setter
i would envisage that for each type t if the getter is called before the setter is called then default t is returned

652512
getter	setter
when the setter is called the value is stored per type t so that when the getter is subsequently called the previous value that was set for that type is returned

652564
inherited	subclassing
if a class inherited from another the memory used by the subclassing is packed by hind the memory of the parent class but a flexible array needs to be at the end the structure class

652617
multiplying	subtract
this creates 4 buttons one for adding subtract dividing and multiplying

652617
multiplying	subtract
multiplying and adding works perfectly no problems at all but when the user tries to subtract it always returns 0

652645
addition	multiplication
i m surprised your addition and multiplication are working.

652669
getter	setter
but many developers tend to put computationally intensive or relatively long-running code in the getter and setter where they would be much more appropriate as methods

652704
median	percentile
median and percentile estimation are more difficult but possible

652706
inherited	properties
extension properties are available today via inherited

652719
put	get
to get a count of the number of calls to date you can use the file size environment variable modifier as in the following script i expect this will be done less often than running the script so it s better to put the grunt work here in fact it s not a lot of grunt work since it s not counting the characters rather it gets the information directly from the directory entry

652792
dlsym	dlopen
i ve used the older-style dll-functions but if you re at a high-enough level there are also the newer dlopen dlsym c helper functions

652792
put	get
this page seems to offer up another option where you can put the dll program into the same load module as the calling program and use static calls to get to it

652804
ienumerable	ilist
for example i had never realized how often i was exposing ilist instead of ienumerable when it wasn t absolutely necessary until i started using linq to objects frequently

652804
ienumerable	ilist
when i d have methods that took ilist passing through the ienumerable results from a linq query requires .tolist or a reworking of the method s api

652817
sctp	tcp
i am considering using sctp instead of tcp for a p2p app written in c

652817
sctp	tcp
also how does the speed of sctp compare to the speed of tcp

652817
sctp	udp
i found that sctp can be tunneled over udp with the only problem being tunneled sctp is not interoperable with untunneled sctp

652890
ubuntu	linux
andlinux is a complete ubuntu linux

652894
installation	upgrade
the organization has compiled an ubuntu installation gutsy i think but i upgrade to intrepid pretty easily

652916
pem	pkcs#12
instead of converting the keystore directly into pem i tried to create a pkcs#12 file first and then convert into relevant pem file and keystore

652937
ssl	https
i know the ssl is working because the https call displays a ton of ssl variables

653018
post	get
usually a design idea change is presented on a post it note i usually start with out with an estimate of about year and the more refined the post it notes get i get the better my estimate gets

653025
classname	inherited
that generated classes at compile time that would inherited from a predefined monitor class and classname and that would autoregister with a singleton class that was used to monitor each component

653064
hash	md5
the key could basically represent an md5 hash or sha-1 or sha-2 if you really concerned with high security of the installed machine mac address the first and last name so and so forth

653084
rss	feed
i would like to avoid relying on an rss feed but it may come down to that

653090
post	get
i was thinking i could get the browser to post back to the server with the data but this isn t what it s meant to do

653147
range	max	range	min	min	max
each link then gets generated using something like where min and max specify the range of page links to create .

653197
jdom	dom4j
dom4j i think was forked from the earlier jdom

653218
hide	show
i ve successfully made the show hide fadeto fadeup and fadedown all work in ie6 and above

653235
loki	header-only
you may also want to have a look at smart pointers from loki libraries again header-only implementation

653258
union	distinct
this looks like a union of two distinct queries to me

653259
punctuation	words
i m writing a python function to split text into words ignoring specified punctuation

653308
integer	unsigned
a right shift of an unsigned integer shifts a 0 into the high bit and is usually known as a logical shift

653308
integer	unsigned
in those rare use cases where bcd is the right answer then storing them in an unsigned long 8 digits ten s complement or an unsigned 64-bit integer room for 16 digits ten s complement or 15 digits plus sign and flags and using a carefully crafted arithmetic library to manipulate them makes sense

653334
rar	zip
you can use a compression algorithm like zip or rar to compress the protected files and assign a password that is required in order to uncompress them

653338
x86	mips
however in practice every single x86 ppc and mips compiler i have ever worked with has followed this rule for shifting right

653338
integer	unsigned
an unsigned integer the vacant bit

653367
post	get
just make sure you read up on how to pass a session to flash using get post parameters

653384
rtl	verilog
i am assigned with the task of verifying some verilog based rtl code

653384
rtl	verilog
now coding the rtl testbench using verilog seems to be very difficult for me

653407
16-bit	64bit
it can be saved via notepad for example in a file with the extension .com and it can be run on msdos most clones of msdos and even in the msdos compatibility mode of the windows command prompt including on vista but not on any 64bit windows since they decided that compatibility with 16-bit real mode was no longer a priority.

653416
jar	war
what artifacts jar war ... are required

653428
hide	show
also changing the setting for that systray icon to always show or always hide is not remembered as soon as the icon is removed and put back to the systray

653440
inherited	properties
you cannot inherited properties well you can - see comments so your call

653457
bids	ssis
debugging ssis packages within the bids environment is not the same ball game as working with visual studio

653457
bids	ssis
you are not able to debug the internal .net code that makes up any of the other built in ssis components the ftp task within bids so i doubt a custom component will be any different

653495
folder	directory
you can even ignore a folder content git update-index --assume-unchanged on directory

653514
put	get
the correct number of shoppingbasketitem s also get put into however both the itemid and itemquantity of each are zero

653531
post	get
the most cross-browser way to do this would be to simply fetch the image url as the response of the post request and then make a get call to the image using img src ...

653536
getter	setter
i will not use validation code in the getter setter

653542
getter	setter
in the second instance you ve just defined a variable in the first there is a getter setter around the variable

653546
accessor	properties
a properties can have accessor keywords

653567
width	height
window.open login.jsp etims toolbar 0 location 0 directories 0 status 0 menubar 0 scrollbars 1 resizable 0 width 1014 height 714 left 0 top 0 inside the same page

653630
accessor	properties
you can make a properties read-only or write-only by making it s accessor private

653668
filtering	grouping
just grab the data from the database and according to the user provided parameters filtering it grouping it and send as a collection of beans to the jasper report which will do the rendering

653685
getter	setter
properties can have different accessibility for the getter and setter

653686
min	max
msvc has macros in minmax.h called max and min which cause a compiler error every time i intend to use the standard function

653697
free	malloc
my idea is to pass two function pointers - for common allocation and deallocation functions - to every dll in some initialization initialize malloc free and then do all memory management using these common and thus always compatible functions

653762
free	malloc
why are you not simply using malloc free directly

653765
put	get
from mysql query i get data which i put into a dictionary d

653799
getter	setter
properties support different accessibility for getter setter - fields do not but fields can be made readonly

653802
skydrive	rapidshare
so far i have tried rapidshare and skydrive and have been unable to get either working at all

653877
for-loop	arrays
both asd and def are string arrays whose scope is limited to the for-loop

653903
atoi	atof
parsing input by yourself atoi atof usually boosts speed at least twice compared to universal read methods

653911
button	checkbox
basically the result should be the same as if the user checked the switch primary and secondary button checkbox in the mouse properties through the control panel

653912
int	chars
if the value of an object of type chars is treated as a signed int when used in an

653922
submit	submission
so per brief a member can only submit a single submission and a submission can have many members collaborators

653937
loops	while-loop
i have created a while-loop in which temporary strings are created string is updated everytime that loops performs

653985
swt	swing
i ve used both swing and swt although never in the same application project before

653985
swt	swing
however trying to mix swt and swing within a single window would likely never work or at the very least cause lots of problems since both widget sets rely on completely different means of drawing layout - swing s components are all handled directly within java and are completely separated from the underlying os while swt explicitly relies on the underlying os to do all or most of the gui rendering

653985
swt	swing
swing and swt have two completely different philosophies and underlying architectures

653985
swt	swing
in fact swt was born from the fact that ibm oti did not like the approach that was taken with swing and so chose to implement their own widgets

654035
inline	inlining
but it can t simply inline g without inlining f because f might be called from other places as well where it is passed a different function pointer

654049
int	double
my reason for that is that this call does not explicitly contain the type of the argument so if later on you decide to change it from int to double there is no need to modify this call

654072
int	double
my reason for that is that this call explicitly contains the type of the argument so if later on you decide to change it from int to double it is clear that this call has changed

654099
httpresponse	request
request httpresponse response

654107
post	get
since http get and http post are disabled by default try adding the following to your config file

654112

i m writing a bit of javascript and need to choose between svg or vml or both or something else it s a weird world

654115
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m using version 436 and from all my testing it appears to be a problem associated with ie6 and ie7 as i cannot replicate the issue in firefox google-chrome safari for windows or even ie8

654134
width	margin
in my case i ve been more keen on using the approach of margin width careful floating adjustments and sometimes the occasional table

654176
stdout	stderr
anything going to stdout and stderr your screen display will be piped to no where and no appear

654179
vb.net	vb6
i am porting a vb6 application to vb.net

solaris	aix
platforms of interest include but not limited to aix hp-ux solaris windows

654662
int	chars
nothing worse then tracing a bunch of super classes for an int or chars

654666
put	get
i m no fan at all of absolute positioning but i have seen web developers use it to get better search result because they can easily put the most important text part at the start of the html and use absolute positioning to position it where it actually belongs

654682
redmine	trac
take a look at redmine or trac

654687
folder	directory
be sure to check that the plugins directory is correct -- in drupal the plugins folder is different than a default fck install

654754
free	malloc
in some obvious cases like when malloc is called inside a loop or part of a thread execution it s very important to free so there are no memory leaks

654754
free	malloc
for this kind of program it doesn t make sense to ever free after calling malloc because these variables must be present at all times during the program s execution and there s no good way that i can see to implement this with statically allocated space

654773
free	malloc
malloc allocates the memory from the memory area called the heap and the complete heap of a process is free when the process exits

654782
verilog	vhdl
you could start programming fpgas in vhdl verilog system c .

654783
free	malloc
if you re writing anything else though -- a server long-running application or a library to be used by someone else you should expect to call free on everything you malloc

654783
free	malloc
ignoring the pragmatic side for a second it s much safer to follow the stricter approach and force yourself to free everything you malloc

654799
postgresql	mysql
weblocks can use cl-sql as a backend store which can connect to many different rdbms mysql postgresql oracle odbc sqlite

654837
google-chrome	firefox
rendering on both google-chrome and firefox

654848
hide	show
php tags hide the whole tag-enclosed php source output in the browser but view source show them

654862
ienumerable	ienumerator
it definitely doesn t seem as straight forward as say c# where you just implement ienumerable and ienumerator or just using the generic collection

654872
cpu	affinity
we limited the cpu affinity so we can actually use the server when the high load hits

654883
listboxitem	textbox
it s not a simple property but you can handle the gotfocus event on your textbox then use visualtreehelper to find the listboxitem and select it

654927
versioning	upgrade
to manually run the sql portion of the upgrade you ll need to run each upgrade script between your versioning and 4.9.2

654947
post	put
besides what i have said before that do not add to what others already answered i wanted to put some focus on other types of functions that you comment in your post as comparison operators and the like

654947
serializable	deserialization
the same goes for transformations to from network serializable and deserialization

654968
cakephp	yii	codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	yii
as for the server side php part i would certainly try to taylor it to my needs but if i had to choose a framework i would go for yii codeigniter or cakephp depending of your scalability needs

655137
hash	salt
to clarify i can t store hash of the password or salt them or anything

655149
jobs	cron
i know how to set up cron jobs i just don t know how to make scripting conditional like that

655176
filtering	grouping
i can t think of a slick way to do this but you could index on branch_id add an fkinternalcalc boolean field to your dataset then initialize that field to true on the first row of each branch using grouping state or manually and then filtering the clone on the value of the field

655300
subtract	add
the kewl part of two s complement is that the machine language add and subtract instructions can ignore all that and just do binary arithmetic and it just works.

655316
singleton	facade
now i get xml string from domain via facade domain entities implement ixmlserializable loading and caching a static collection of xslcompiledtransforms from disc as a singleton and a controller as a httphandler who rules the logic of request processing and has an access to the previous classes and cached pages

655338
int	double
you can convert a double to a long so if you converted your double values to long int in a separate program and output the constant values you could then use them in your program

655341
spyware	antivirus
setup - advanced firewall setup - antivirus anti spyware - web access protection - http - webbrowsers

655375
accessor	properties
the accessor are designed so that you can add properties specific logic

655375
getter	setter
so you would always want to access that field through the getter and setter and that way you can always be certain that the value will never get greater than 360

655423
int	chars
casting to int will make it print as an int value instead of as a chars

655427
children	parent
a parent node can have many children

655516
children	parent
the second is to make it a parent class and implement the different lines in a method of your children

when there is a textfield that is focused whenever the page loads or refreshes safari tries to keep the textfield inside the display area unlike firefox or ie

655564
multiplying	multiplication
if you re dividing or multiplying by a variable then it s likely that multiplication is slightly faster because the logic is generally more simple

655572
post	get
see an example here this one uses get so you can use either get or post just make sure you pass in your parameters

655581
division	multiplication
division algorithms are slower than multiplication algorithms in most cases

655581
cpu	processors
the reason for that is that a multiplication can be blindly converted to shift and add operations on the processors which are the most optimized operations on a cpu

655581
multiplying	division
you d get a substantial non-negligible improvement if you compute all your inverses in advance and use them to multiplying in a division intensive program

655584
division	multiplication
which one is faster is indeed a cpu-specific issue or at least how much faster is cpu specific yes division is typically seen as slower than multiplication

655590
put	get
and i know the xsl basically works because if i intentionally put an invalid attribute in i get a parser error

655596
free	malloc
1 use std vector instead of malloc free and new delete

655610
range	minimum
for that you will probably want to store either just the minimum or the maximum item depending on how your range works

655610
division	modulo
you may also need to write a function to reduce any given integer to it s corresponding stored key value hint use integer division or the modulo

655621
mvp	presenter
i don t usually do it like this since i use mvp and this view would only have code to get the user info in the controls with a class defined elsewhere and forward of the events to the presenter

655798
stdout	stderr
here is a script that saves redirects and restores stdout and stderr using various methods

655811
disk	ram
this however doesn t seem to be straightforward in the case of flightgear the flightgear hardware recommendations read opengl-based hardware acceleration 256 mb dedicated graphics memory 1-2 ghz cpu 512-1024 mb ram 400-500 mb disk space

655811
joystick	keyboard	mouse	joystick	mouse	keyboard
in addition just being able to technically compile and run with acceptable performance framerates the code would still not be enough from a usability point of view flightgear is a flight simulator designed for use on personal computers with certain peripherals present - in other words it basically relies on a keyboard and mouse as well as other input hardware joystick pedals

655811
playstation	wii
in fact most of the re-engineering required would not be specific to just one device but would generally be useful for all efforts related to porting flightgear to non-pc platforms no matter if it s nintendo wii sony playstation apple iphone .

655831
profiling	debugging
the debugging consists of turning on sql profiling and running the application

655926
put	get	for-loop	arrays
actually if you re filling a webpage with php it s easier to just get the mysql table put the data into an arrays and use a for-loop to go throught the data like this

655943
gridview	sqldatasource
the gridview does this in conjunction with data source controls like the sqldatasource control

655958
post	get
3 imho using method get would be more restful for a method called getclientjson than method post

655986
cvs	svn
structure should not interfere with normal usage of cvs svn and other version

655994
textview	imageview
in the mean-time i ve worked around this by dropping the imageview inside another linearlayout and dropping an empty textview to its right that takes up the rest of the horizontal space

656001
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
much easier to use flash as it works with all modern browsers safari ie firefox and opera

656028
getter	setter
all you need to do is once you have the type is to create little stacks for the getter and setter of properties and those you can collect via walking the property tree of the type and its properties breadth first limiting the depths to a specified number of levels and removing circular references depending on your data structures

656036
satellite	altitude
similarly you can t launch an object into orbit from the surface you have to have something like a last rocket burn once the satellite reaches the desired altitude

656040
postgresql	mysql
ms sql server mysql oracle postgresql

656055
x86	mips
i know x86 assembly and have worked with fpga etc never wrote for a risc i have the opportunity to take a course in mips

656060
vmware	esx
i have an older server retired database box in fact that doesn t fit the requirements for vmware esx esxi or microsoft s hyper-v but runs vmware server 2 just fine

656063
cos	sin
this probably won t affect you since you re just taking the sin cos of the resulting angle

656063
cos	sin
times when the result is the same very time and taking 4 sin s and 4 cos s

656118
hide	show
it s very easy to use javascript to detect when the form was submitted and then hide the elements you need to hide and show the success message

656137
post	get
person clicks submit and form data gets sent server side via get or post

656137
submit	submission
person clicks submit and javascript submit form data to server side via ajax and removes the form elements to then add thanks for submission

656214
mouse	keyboard
when recording you can t use your mouse to select anything so you have to use you keyboard to select the picture and then use the menu options to manipulate it

656279
mouse	keyboard
if you minimize a window which was in the background and in full screen then you can see the contour of our ghost app - you can move it around it will respond to keyboard mouse input just fine

656281
x86	mips
however if it is just mips programming and you already have a handle on x86 assembly and the concepts of low level programming i would say pass on the class

656315
put	get
if you made method.m a subfunction in the larger code calling it or if it s possible to put it in a private directory where it can be called by every function that needs to call it then it may get called instead of the java method when you use the method object ... syntax

656377
entity-relationship	diagram
it s the only conceptual modeling tool available for relational data the others - erwin and its ilk - being at best logical modeling tools with nothing much better than entity-relationship diagram and ddl synchrnoization which are also provided by object role modeling tools

656393
mockups	prototyping
you can use paper to do this or more sophisticated mockups using xhtml css and javascript or a dedicated prototyping program

656463
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox google-chrome opera etc

656501
getter	setter
jython automagically translates getter setter into public properties so that

656510
button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
make sure you include validation capabilities for non-textbox related fields such as dropdownlistfor radio button checkbox etc

656518
stdout	fflush
use fflush stdout

656559
keystore	jks
command summary - to create jks keystore

656559
keystore	jks	pem	pkcs#12
command summary - to convert jks keystore into pkcs#12 keystore then into pem file

656559
keystore	jks
if you have more than one certificate in your jks keystore and you want to only export the certificate and key associated with one of the aliases you can use the following variation

656559
keystore	jks
command summary - to compare jks keystore to pem file

656586
distance	altitude
maybe i m wrong about this but if i remember my physics right and if the distance between the two points is relatively small compared to the earth s radius aside from altitude the path will just follow a great circle

656586
projectile	angle
where gamma the angle along the great circle arc followed by the projectile

656597
inherited	properties
and classes which implement that interface will inherited its properties without having to re-declare them

656597
getter	setter
the interface simply says implementor will have a string name with getter and setter

656602
postgresql	mysql
if you are thinking of some sort of web app i d say either mysql or postgresql as these will provide better performance and be able to handle a large data set more naturally

656616
public	protected
you couldn t declare scope constraints on interfaces public private protected internal as that is an implementation detail

656616
inherited	properties
first problem that we need to tackle is the fact that interfaces don t allow access delimiters in its implementation what would happen is that the properties would inherited the default access delimiter which is private

656616
getter	setter
in an interface the property definition will indicate that the method signatures for the getter and or setter methods will be available for all classes implementing that interface

656620
put	get
so far my experience has been similar to the resume effect if someone doesn t put the effort into spell checking their resume they probably won t get the job.

656631
bitblt	gdi
the lowlevel bitblt gdi calls are likely to be way more efficient that anything you can do

656706
range	minimum
because this can potentially be run on a wide range of computers with varying levels of patches and updates i m steering well clear of .net and anything that isn t native - the tool should just run without the user having to install anything extra well i will say windows xp no service packs is the bare minimum required version of windows

656712
nsapplication	nsrunloop
you need to invoke - nsapplication run instead of - nsrunloop currentrunloop run

656716
minimum	max	min	max
if the user enters a maximum and a minimum for example don t just check the two values independently against their legal max and min but also check them against each other to ensure that the values entered are logically consistent

656882
unix	aix
i will be using this on an aix unix box

656883
hide	show
the vs dsls have bad visual performance large diagrams you need fold the model elements away hide show

656914
exploratory	metrics
the reason for this is that the exploratory nature of drill-down across etc can lead to users not understanding how a metrics can change when they have merely asked for more information on it

656919
hide	show
has a navigation that works fine on the main page but due to me making a mistake does not work on the sub pages as it relies on images being loaded and then switching their hide show properties

656933
werkzeug	pyro
i think i ll look at both pyro and the web.py werkzeug approaches since twisted is a little more than i want to bite off at this point

656983
multiplying	multiplication
there are lots of well-known ways to parallelise matrix multiplication essentially multiplying various-sized sub-matrices and then combining the results and shift layout so that the access patterns have reasonable cache locality by organizing the data around space-filling curves instead of row column arrangements

656987
sproutcore	cappuccino
cappuccino or sproutcore

657007
innodb	myisam
berkeley db is going away very soon in mysql so if you re using it i d recommend you shift to innodb or at the very least myisam

657010
integer	fractions
start by splitting the number into an integer and fractions part

657010
integer	fractions
for the fractions part repeatedly multiply by 60 and take the integer part to get the result digits

657026
lisp	smalltalk
hip counts when you want to get future colleagues excited about what you ve done when they haven t done it. i d venture that it s at least as eye-opening as something based on lisp or smalltalk or haskell but probably more practical because you may actually end up using it at a job or for contract work

657064
gridview	detailsview
i am using gridview and detailsview for insert update edit a truckmaster table

657070
bids	ssis
but when i run the ssis package in bids it executed successfully..

to try a new versioning we upgrade our own versioning of a module before doing that upgrade on the production server

657211
post	get
as for the cleanup code i will post that when i get to work tomorrow i don t have the code with me but it s very boilerplate

657211
post	get
i will post an example when i get back from my meeting.

657215
range	max
you have a constraint on the max value of y and a general idea of what you want the curve to look like somewhat bell-shaped y 0 at the edges of the x range y 5 when x 5

657221
folder	directory
if i correctly understand your question the only working setup that i could imagine is to take the approach you mention host headers to point but c inetpub wwwroot myapp mysubapp without using a redirect and include the main app s dlls in your sub folder s bin directory

657232
postgresql	mysql
currently i think a lot of providers are available for ado.net entity framework provider for postgresql mysql esql oracle and many other check

657352
tapestry	stripes	tapestry	wicket	wicket	stripes
wicket and apache tapestry are both component oriented web framework s - contrary to action based frameworks like stripes - by the apache foundation

657358
int	chars
the way you have written the chars is totally wrong you are writing the chars representation of the int

657400
width	height
i have set this up so the side columns are fixed width the header footer are fixed height

657479
yacc	bison
lex and yacc or rather flex and bison are powerful tools that will help you generate parsers for regular languages with ease

657497
superclass	subclassing
subclassing person twice once for receiver and once for sender and only put the xmlrootelement on these subclassses leaving the superclass person without an xmlrootelement

657502

i want to select or highlight a block in emacs without mouse but from the keyboard

657702
post	get
your client simply uses urllib2 to make post or get requests to localhost someport

657792
internationalization	localization
i realize that the method to do these conversions is quite simple however when you factor in internationalization and localization support this becomes less trivial

657815
google-chrome	firefox
here is the bug report for google-chrome which has the same problem as firefox

657834
post	get
make a head rather than get or post request to just get the response headers this should include the content-length header with the information you need

657923
put	get
you can put garbage inside to see if the default execution get executed and if it does make one of the executions a default

657955
rtp	rtsp
jmf 2.1.1 provides rtp rtsp

657966
hide	show	opera	safari
in ie safari opera on a windows machine the images on this page are only loaded once monitored with freemeter when the show and hide buttons are toggled

657966
hide	show
looking into about cache most of the images loaded appear to be listed there although inspecting the cache between hide show clicks there appears to be missing images

657987
inherited	subclassing
however joshua bloch in his famous book effective java gives the following advice design and document for inherited or else prohibit it and encourages programmers to use the final modifier to prohibit subclassing

657997
tabcontrol	tabitem
so the behavior is sort of like the tabcontrol but without the tabstrip the chrome and the tabitem instances

658020
button	checkbox
in swing you have ridiculous inheritance where iirc button extends checkbox or the other way around giving one of them behaviour that isn t used i think it s its the setdisabled call on checkbox

658034
mouse	keyboard
you could hook the changed event and set the value back to your desired value if different -- this way you ll cover any cause for change via mouse or keyboard

658059
width	height
it may or may not be related to the width and height i have a very very large width and height defined something like 5000 by 2500

658094
disk	ram
if one computer has more ram than another that can make a huge difference in speed because it won t have to swap to disk as often

658170
accessor	properties
the properties flagthingy.ismodified cannot be set because it does not have an accessible set accessor

658177
tapestry	wicket
wicket forces markup code separation tapestry 5 just give you this ability

658177
tapestry	wicket
wicket s core is easier to debug user components are based on inheritance while tapestry 5 user components are based on annotations

658177
tapestry	wicket
from the other side that could make transitions to the future versions easier for tapestry then for wicket

658182
hash	md5
tip if you are going to store the hash in the database a md5 hash is always 16 bytes so can be saved in a uniqueidentifier column and system.guid in .net

658234
many-to-many	one-to-many
has_many through on the other hand is meant for indirect one-to-many relationships or many-to-many relationships with properties

658252
put	get
i think it s easy to get heated about something like this but when you put emotion aside i don t believe it is a complicated issue

658322
put	get
get another server of identical specs 1x quadcore 4gig and put the new vms on there

658347
vmware	esx
that said it may be worth your time to upgrade from vmware server to vmware esx or the more competitively priced vmware esxi free

658350
uielement	adorner
but i ve been reading about uielement classes and adorner and want to make sure i m doing things the right way

658384
put	get
perhaps this has improved since sql server 2000 and someone with more familiarity with the newer versions can tell you whether it is now safe to get in the water but until i had confirmation of this and had checked it out myself with a test i wouldn t put it on my production system

658388
inherited	properties
if i understand correctly you want to expose serviceobject to clients including all its properties that are marked as a datamember including properties inherited from enterpriseobject

edit employee number should be stored at the very least as varchar 10 assuming that it can accept non numeric chars or as an int if it is an actual number as it is assumed to be

658630
scons	qmake
there are better build systems out there - cmake scons for c c++ qmake for qt ant for java nant and msbuild for .net and so on

658631
trie	dawg
a dawg has roughly the same performance as a trie but will be more space efficient

658672
udp	tcp
many applications end up re-implementing parts of tcp on udp to get the particular mixture of latency order independence error handling and bandwidth that they need

658684
vb.net	vb6
copy and paste and fix the compiler errors works fairly well between vb6 and vb.net

658702
mouse	keyboard
so this is a cryptographically secure random source based on unpredictable input from such things as the arbitrary timings of ethernet packets keyboard and mouse input etc

658773
ant	maven
ivy for example has an ant task that will import artifacts from a maven repository and publish them to you own ivy repository

take off as much work in the priority order the business pm has put them in as you think you can for sure get done

658952
xargs	zcat
this says to find files that end in .gz and write their names with a nul terminator the 0 in -print0 pipe that output through xargs which will pick the list apart based on nul chacracters the -0 arg and run zcat on the files

659028
pop-up	dialog
now i thought i could kinda stream this contents to the user first by opening a standard dialog box the box that pop-up when you attempt download something from internet with options like open save cancel and then asking the user to save it somewhere

659064
for-loop	arrays
i can print the contents using a for-loop and using an arrays

firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the pages look fine in firefox opera safari and ie 8 but my client who is using ie7 is complaining of layout problems in ie 7

659141
icmp	udp
since you are using udp which uses ports it is possible the network stack is routing the icmp message back to the original socket

659141
icmp	udp
i imagine udp eats the icmp message

659141
icmp	udp
if i am correct one solution to this is to open a raw socket and manually create your udp packets listen for the anything coming back and handle udp and icmp messages as appropriate

659158
post	get
if i m reading the mvp s post correctly on a 32-bit system you re limited to 1.5gb heap size no matter what of which you get all as soon as the process starts

i know of three main languages used commonly in the greater programming and tech community textile markdown and restructuredtext

659278
free	malloc
with malloc and free you have a more simple situation

659278
int	chars
type such as chars or int can be

659281
stdout	fflush
what it looks like you re doing is sleeping for the sake of something being fflush to stdout so that some other thread won t write to stdout before you

659337
for-loop	loops
it is created dynamically which is accessible within a loops block much like c# for-loop

659358
free	malloc
new and delete are different from malloc and free in that malloc and free only allocate and free memory

659364
feedback	review
ideally you would do a code review when it is being built so you can provide feedback and reduce issues significantly

659382
google-chrome	firefox
in mozilla firefox and google-chrome it looks all right

659382
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome look

659400
pop-up	dialog
if they do i think windows pop-up a low disk space dialog that gives them the option to clear their temp directory which would solve the problem

659473
int	chars
there was a desire that for built-in types chars int float etc the following would be valid for c++

659473
free	malloc
the reason malloc free do not have this problem is that they simply deal with blocks of memory and do not have to worry about calling constructors destructors

659482
vbscript	jscript

please note that she is currently amusing herself with some silverlight stuff but just scroll past that to get to the windbg post

659707
versioning	upgrade
the production and test servers were upgrade and run a newer versioning of iis 6.0

659725
min	max
create 5 aggregation tables that calculate max min and average for each of the facts

659725
min	max
now calculate the percent deviation from mean percent deviation of min and percent deviation from max for each row and add it to the original table

659735
int	boolean
like boolean don t convert to int

659737
pycrypto	m2crypto
i ve been looking at most python crypto libraries i ve decided to use either pycrypto or m2crypto

659737
pycrypto	m2crypto
neither pycrypto or m2crypto mention anything about this and google didn t find anything relevant

659842
gif	png
i m trying to use a .net fileupload control along with a regex validator to limit filename to jpg gif or png extensions

659888
children	parent
in this case you have a parent with multiple children

659888
children	parent
parent forks a number of children

659888
children	parent
the parent has a little bit of fancy footwork in spawning all the children and retaining the pipes properly but it s not too bad

659889
free	malloc
allocate a buffer with malloc and remember to free it afterward in the caller

659914
valgrind	gprof
gdb valgrind gprof

659937
junit	mockito
junit and mockito are probably used most in my daily work though not limited to debugging

659938
free	malloc
malloc is an option but forcing the caller to free the memory that a callee allocated can leave open issues of ownership and removes the possibility of using anything but heap memory for the buffer

post	get
i ve found some other post and blogs out there with people who feel the same way i do but the developers of zend made this choice for a reason and other people seem to use it without issue so i wanted to get some feedback from the community here

659953
switching	screens
the only thing they mention is that if you do try to switching to full screens mode and it is disallowed then you ll get an exception which you can catch

659953
hide	show
this won t easily allow you to hide or show a full screen mode button

659967
peer	p2p
i would like to do this because it would make peer location much more effective in my p2p network as i would know that all the addresses would be part of this network

660014
octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
for clarification what i was looking for which does not appear to be possible was how to assign a literal binary number to a variable in a similar manner in which you can assign a hex or octal number

660036
disk	ram
2 boxes 2 times the cpu 2 times the ram and 2 times the spindles for disk access

maybe refresh a panels linked to a backing bean so it always shows the last x lines or pull in some javascript that when executed appends new lines of text to scrollable div on your page

660044
16-bit	64bit
there is enough address space that you can create up to 2 40 unique unicast ranges each with 16-bit of subnet and 64bit of host id

but none of this is relevant to validate the data for database insertion because you aren t going to store plain-text passwords - you re going to store a hash of them in some way md5 md5 + salt whatever

660080
hash	md5
instead you might make sure that you have a 32 character hexadecimal string so that it is very likely to be a properly created md5 hash

660131
freebsd	linux
i imagine that a tool like this must exist for linux or freebsd too

660167
httpwebrequest	ftpwebrequest
here request is of type ftpwebrequest but it s confusing because it looks like it was created from an httpwebrequest a sibling class even though the create method is actually defined on webrequest the base class

660174
post	get
i want to develop a program that uses an online api with get and post requests and i want to know how to make the requests within the program without the user seeing a web page and then download the results into the program so i can parse them

filtering	grouping
most operations that you call on u.group will affect the entire grouping table with the possibility that it first filtering down to objects related to u

660285
int	chars
you could just as well say foo 0 98 but you re using an int when you really mean a chars

660304
photoshop	paint.net
any code that can run on windows c# vb.net preferably even help how to use scriptable programs like paint.net or photoshop would be accepted

660317
public	protected
my best guess is that you have to map your subclasses to the data they need and make public protected setter s on your baseclass to map these too

660329
post	get
i have an application that supplies long list of parameters to a web page so i have to use post instead of get

660367
post	get
one way round it is to redirect the post to a page which redirects to a get - see post redirect get on wikipedia

660367
post	get
redirect the post to get the representation of the data

660401
ssms	sqlcmd
so if ssms tries to connect via named pipes it may not be able to resolve the server name whereas if sqlcmd uses tcp ip it will be able to

660416
getter	setter
trivial getter and setter sometimes don t have unit tests written for them

660425
fpdf	fpdi
i am trying to add an existing pdf created otherwise to a pdf created with fpdf using fpdi

660452
rpm	yum
regerding your question you could try to override dependency checking by downloading rpm of the required package an doing rpm -i --force file.rpm since yum does not have any option for forced installations

660464
next	except
i am fairly new at this stuff but i seem to be having a problem googling a solution - i could use the except function but the records for the individuals members are not necessarily the same from one table to next - just the memberid may be the same

660474
rsa	dsa
the other will give an error with the text expecting an rsa key or expecting a dsa key

660487
implements	extends
the createresponse method is implements in a subclass that extends request

660561
post	get
i have an application that supplies long list of parameters to a web page so i have to use post instead of get

660584
equals	gethashcode
the reason being is that the implementation uses both gethashcode and equals to properly find a value in the table

660584
equals	gethashcode
failing to keep gethashcode and equals in sync will completely break this algorithm and numerous others

660587
equals	gethashcode
as it is documented that gethashcode must return the same value if two instances are equals then it is the prerogative of any code which wishes to test them for equality to use gethashcode as a first pass to group objects which may be equals as it knows that objects with different hash codes cannot be equals

660587
equals	gethashcode
if your gethashcode method returns different values for equals objects then they may get into different groups in the first pass and never be compared using their equals method

660587
equals	gethashcode
in short always override gethashcode when you override equals and ensure their implementations are consistent

660591
equals	gethashcode
if you always put things in the bucket corresponding to their gethashcode then you only have to search one bucket using equals to see if something is there

660591
equals	gethashcode
so the rule is if equals says two objects are equals they must have the same gethashcode

660596
put	get
if we would put everything into one clause that clear semantic could be broken - not to mention that when we put the definition into the class again all of a sudden the template would get its own clause

660613
glut	sdl
i would like to use the built in libraries in order to do this and not something like sdl sdl_showcursor 0 or glut glutsetcursor glut_cursor_none

660629

however no matter what i try putting wrap _ content instead of absolute numbers on layout _ height and layout _ width the icon remains in the top left corner of the button

660644
folder	directory
i m trying to find all the files and folder under a specified directory

660650

fseek	ftell
you don t have to worry about the 2gb limit as long as you don t need attempt to fseek or ftell you just read from or write to the stream.

660762
put	get
it was very easy to get people to want to help but very hard to get them to actually put the effort required into the project in order to be useful

660780
profiling	debugging
i believe the only time you need this file is for debugging or profiling

660783
rss	feed
take it off yahoo as an rss feed

660798
profiling	debugging
what we re hoping to be able to do is that i can log in with my profiling and developer debugging etc my iphone application and her do the same under her own profiling not seeing mine and vice-versa

660836
rss	feed
dobrych s solution is not quite applicable here because i was asking specifically about rss not atom feed

660846
post	get	rss	feed
write a server side script performs an http request on the rss feed when that script itself is request via get or post

660864
integer	unsigned
when you convert a signed type to an unsigned type if the number is negative the result of the conversion must be the 2 s complement representation of the integer

660883
twitter	myspace
having a standard api to send updates and post pictures to myspace facebook flickr picassa blogger twitter and other services would be very useful

661036
int	double
cast the int to double

661073
folder	directory
so if your files are in the directory c mylib src main java org syntax jedit then you need to point the compiler folder at c mylib src main java

661104
opera	safari
my specific browser requirements are ff3+ ie7+ safari 3+ and opera 9+

661115
folder	directory
a .class file in the appropriate folder depending on its package under the bin directory should do it

661143
folder	directory
therefore if you wish to have the compiler access com.stackoverflow.example.class present in the classes directory under project a but not in the build path of project a then you should add classes as a class folder and not classes com stackoverflow as a class folder

661145
for-loop	loops
however i have noticed that the results being written to the table seem to overlap or get mixed up i.e say i call the api at loops counter 10 the result for-loop counter 10 may appear in the table beside the value for-loop counter 15

661155
post	get
i will post the bug link when i get it from them

661177

mouseover	mouseout
in my case some jquery code makes a tooltip appear and disappear with an animation on mouseover and mouseout

661226
pthreads	fork
i have come across so much code lately that uses threads which really should not its obvious that someone just wanted to profess their undying love of pthreads when a single yes just one fork would have done the job

661254
min	max
the simple way to do this is to compute the heuristic value for each leaf and then sweep up and compute the min max

661254
min	max
my first â œsolutionâ to that was to push the min max up after each leaf is computed

661288
folder	directory
i am doing a file transfer application so as soon as a new file folder is added to the monitored directory i will execute my c# code to other some other operations

661289
int	chars
the method that i thought was to convert the string to int using parsing and splitting each chars using modulus or something and performing operations on them

661298
int	chars
try converting the string to a chars array and then subtract 0 from the chars values to retrieve an int value

661382
pop-up	dialog
when you click on a product in the carousel a dialog modal needs to pop-up

661389
cvs	svn
i am more used to svn with tortoise client cvs and vss

661432
wcf	openrasta
i m involved in a project that uses wcf rest on iis but of course i d recommend having a look at the framework i built openrasta is a .net open-source stack that makes implementing rest much easier

661459
jar	manifest.mf
the dlls must be in the root of the jar the jar must be signed and the dll must appear with checksum in the meta-inf manifest.mf for the vm to pick them up

661493
interbase	firebird
this is different to databases like interbase and firebird and threw me when i first started using sql server

661534
kerberos	ntlm
this makes me think it may be an ntlm kerberos issue

661556
collabnet	svn
servers either collabnet subversion on windows or apache 2.2 with ssl + svn through dav on linux

661568
lisp	scheme
emacs lisp uses dynamic binding and languages like scheme and common lisp are using lexical binding

661591
getter	setter
the preferred thing to do is often to add methods called getter and setter to the class owning the array or make it available by some other more structural means which depend on the exact semantics and usage of the array

661652
ssl	https
you mentioned using https http over ssl - that prevents others from being able to read information in transit or impersonate the server so it s very handy for preventing plain text transmission of the password or other important information

661656
x86	64bit
i got the same error when trying to run a 64bit dll with nunit that was set to work as an x86 assembly using corflags

661661
children	parent
when clicking a node the parent and children are updated

661663
post	put
as anonymous types are usually used to replace classes that are to be used to store temporary as put forward in this so answer i would like to avoid creating and using a class for anonymous collections as this post suggests

661688
switching	screens
and when i switching to another resolution which is 1280 1024 ideally the listbox should fit to the screens resolution

there are few jsf implementations apache myfaces sun reference implementation and some jsf component libraries icefaces richfaces woodstock etc.

661844
textarea	textbox
i think textarea is only displayed after it gets a textbox there to append.

661874
accessor	properties	getter	setter
the login controller s properties should have at least a getter and setter which you can synthesize but you can implement more specific accessor methods for efficiency

661904
ienumerable	ilist
1 i have a class that takes an ienumerable and uses a tolist to construct an ilist

661945

rss	feed
i have the following javascript code where feed is a valid url to an rss feed

662125
cvs	svn
i know that s not the answer you know but you can setup an svn or cvs server which would be so much easier

662269
sorting	grouping
you could perform a sphinx search sorting by your grouping by attribute and then loop over those items in php summing as you go

662271
dmz	was
i mis-spoke when i said it was a dmz i should have said it was just a separate domain

662280
rss	feed
my main concern here is that i want to create an rss feed to use with the live bookmarks feature in many browsers but be able to maintain the directory feel

662295
dmz	was
so you would have the child company calling functions on an appropriately configured web service see above which was in the dmz for your core domain

662312
rss	feed
the best thing you could do is let the link elements point to other rss feed

662324
put	get
put value annotations on your .net types add a couple of simple things to your aspx and you get jquery validation for free

662341

margin	text-align
margin 0 auto only centers an element in ie if the parent element has a text-align center

662445
bash	tcsh
if you re already within a graphical environment try export display 0 for bash like shells bash sh etc or setenv display 0 for c shell based shells csh tcsh etc

it says if you have a public protected method which is not abstract nor final nor empty it is not designed for extension

662602
portrait	landscape
the function getpagedimensions of cam pdf returns same values for both portrait and landscape pages

662605
children	parent
this said funfx doesn t appear to contain functions which allow users to access children via their parent objects or parent.children for iteration

662605
children	parent
i see methods which return the number of children beneath a parent but i don t see any iteration functionality which would allow me to parse the hierarchical structure

662639
pull	push
i don t necessarily need to do any form of validation on the messages themselves i just need to pull push data

662674
mouseleave	mouseenter
if the radius is anything less than 100 when mouseleave happens the from property will make it jump up to 100 and likely cause a mouseenter

662684
tinymce	freetextbox
we have also used tinymce freetextbox and fckeditor - and whilst those are free they don t come close to offering the polished features of cuteeditor

662764
profiling	benchmarking
the obvious answer is of course to first write it in the most readable plain understandable way then compile it with as much optimization as you can get and then benchmarking and profiling that

662783
alloca	malloc
for instance you have functions like alloca assuming you can get past the copious warnings concerning its use which is a form of malloc that specifically uses the stack not the heap for memory

662806
trie	tree
usually with huffman tree the trie will be unbalanced

662838
getter	setter
they re simply generated getter and setter

662904
g++	gcc
i m currently trying to compile a multiple-language program c c++ and fortran using gnu compilers in unix g++ gcc f77 respectively

662977
prepare	execute
i d rather have a web service prepare to execute longer than needed than throw an exception

663010
kerberos	ntlm
i wonder if this is the double-hop issue and that your code is trying to access the resource as the impersonated user but that fails because ntlm will not impersonate to another server kerberos would

663038
width	height
sounds like you want 2 more fields in your database height and width

663045
xslt	xquery
if storing your data in xml format is important for you since you work with xml maybe it has more sense to use a xml native database such as exist which lets you access and transform your xml data in a xml-friendly way xslt xquery xpath

663046
width	height
i would save the height and width of the image in separate columns when you save the image to the database intially

663046
width	height
then when you do your select statement to read the image out of the database you can also access the height and width fields from the database

663046
width	height
alternatively you can access the height and width information when you load the image out of the database and then set the height and width properties before assigning the image to the picture box

663054
stdout	stderr
close_fds is supported on windows search for close_fds after that link starting with python 2.6 if stdin stdout stderr are not redirected

663054
stdout	stderr
redirect the standard handles by setting stdin stdout or stderr

663054
stdout	stderr
so you can either subprocess.call with and not setting stdin stdout or stderr the default or setting them to none

663062
free	malloc
i think that using a separate thread is probably not the best safest or fastest way -- my guess is you d be better off using a type of incremental copying allocator where on each malloc or free you compact copy forwards or backwards in memory some number of allocated blocks with the number of bytes that you copy depleting a budget that is periodically reset to its initial value on each screen refresh

663062
free	malloc
if there s enough time in the budget a call to malloc or free will completely defragment memory otherwise it will defragment it as much as possible in the given the time constraints

663062
free	malloc
the important thing is to avoid oscillations the same block being moved forwards then backwards on successive calls to malloc or free

663086
width	height
you can get the height and width but you are going to have to load the whole image into memory using the system.drawing.image library each time you need that info

663125
listview	gridview
the previous data option only works with a listview and only if you don t have a gridview associated with it

663147
public	protected
you can avoid having the compiler generate the method my declaring the methods as package the absence of public private and protected

663186
rss	feed
my first hook was one to send check in notices to a rss feed subversionrss i m currently working on one post-commit hook to send check in notices to a twitter feed

i m using firefox 3.0.1 google-chrome 1.0.154.48 internet explorer 7 and safari 3

663305
mouseleave	mouseenter
try to call stoppropagation on your events or use an alternative event that stops propagation by default like mouseenter mouseleave or hover over out

663344
mouseover	mouseout
finally just for simplicity use hover rather than mouseover mouseout

663344
mouseover	mouseout
the first function you pass to hover gets applied on mouseover the second gets applied on mouseout

663356
tabcontrol	tabitem
i want to get all the objects that should be displayed on a particular tabitem inside a tabcontrol ones that have a category matching the tabitem s name or header - this is done in the method

663372
turbogears	cherrypy
some of the most popular frameworks for web python are plone zope cherrypy and turbogears only to name a few

663386
oncreate	onstart
note that there won t be any flicker or anything either android handles the case of calling finish in oncreate i believe onstart and onresume as well so that the user never knows it happened

663439
children	parent
canvas control and its children will not resize to fit thier parent

663526
children	parent
another java-ish way to do this is probably to have the parent class to define an abstract getter and have the children implement it

663529
superclass	subclassing
declare a constructor in the superclass that s called by the subclassing

663574
rss	feed
then whenever a user selects a story in your rss feed create an instance of a new view controller that has a webview as it s view

udp	tcp
tcp sockets or udp messages

663633
google-chrome	firefox
this worked fine on firefox and google-chrome but not ie

663692
versioning	upgrade
a simple way to do this is to have the java home exist as a softlink so that if you want to upgrade or switch versioning you only have to change the directory that this points to -

663743
pop-up	dialog
if the user s membership is going to expire within 30 days and the button is clicked i want the jquery dialog to pop-up

663743
pop-up	dialog
what should happen is that when the user clicks the sign-in button it should pop-up up the dialog only if the days they have left to expire is 30 and if they do they have the option of clicking the link in the dialog and going to a renew page where i want to pass it a session variable with a profile but that is not being called so i guess i would like to know is how can i add the event handler of the button to the dialog and is there a way to set it so that it only comes up once for example adding a cookie to the users browser and only showing it if they don t have a cookie set

663770
kerberos	ntlm
iis can map incoming requests to an ad user ntlm certificates kerberos etc.

663794

it may be auto sizing and have a height width of double.nan

663859
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
try binding the child height width to the actualheight and actualwidth of canvas like so

663869
uiview	subviews
you can do this by having a regular uiview that contains a uitextfield and a uibutton as subviews

663875
post	put
from the blog post the technique is extensible to pretty much any style cell you need - i use the same thing in tweetie and draw the chat bubble text and avatar all together into a single view. you can use to create a stretchable chat bubble to put behind each cell in your table view

663883
springsource	grails
however springsource is a major player in eclipse and they now own gone the main developers of groovy grails

663886
children	parent
event delegation refers to the use of a single event listener on a parent object to listen for events happening on its children or deeper descendants

663887
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

663896
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
a new program that microsoft is releasing is called microsoft expression superpreview and will allow you to test websites in ie 6 7 8 and when complete will allow you to test in firefox google-chrome opera and safari

663910
hash	salt
the current process uses a salt and roughly 40 character unique hash which is then encrypted and base64 encoded so that it can be safely be transported via email and in theory come back safely through the url

663945
commandbinding	routedevent
the key difference is that routedcommand is an icommand implementation that uses a routedevent to route through the tree until a commandbinding for the command is found while relaycommand does no routing and instead directly executes some delegate

663945
mvvm	delegatecommand
in a mvvm scenario a relaycommand delegatecommand in prism is probably the better choice all around

663971
stdout	stderr
i have set up pipes to redirect stderr and stdout

663972
sms	tropo
both of them offer low cost sms messaging and tropo is free for development

rss	feed
i ve run the generated rss feed through a validator from home and it validates fine

664097
ia-32	x86
the nitty gritty details of multiprocessing on x86 can be found in the intel 64 and ia-32 architectures software developer s manuals

664102
updatepanel	scriptmanager
update 1 you seem to be using an updatepanel in that case you need to use scriptmanager

664144
hide	show
you re just giving yourself more work if you were to keep references to forms and show hide them instead of opening closing them

664144
hide	show
also you ll find it hard to implement any sort of modal dialogs if you were to show hide

664151
dataoutputstream	bufferedoutputstream
to answer the question in your title i would wrap the socketoutputstream in a bufferedoutputstream in a dataoutputstream and use the latter s writeint method repeatedly

664185
unsigned	short
s unsigned short unsigned int

664235
super	implements
as for simplexml itself i m not sure if it actually implements the arrayaccess interface or if there s something else going on behind the scenes in the php source that gives it these super powers

664258
width	height
if you re asking for the text to be centered in the rect you might also need to make sure the width and or height of the rect is an even number

664259
int	boolean	int	double
all primitive types boolean int double etc

664259
int	boolean
the class based versions of the these boolean int etc

set width height for ul elements hidden stuff

664444
rss	feed
i am using rss2email for converting a number of rss feed into mail for easier consumption

664466
dictionary	map
you might use a dictionary to map from the drop downs to your data

664471
pascal	delphi
maybe codegear didn t see much demand for it since delphi and turbo pascal had already gone for so long without it

664480
union	distinct
both queries use a temporary table to store results but the difference is that union applies distinct to the result set which incurs an additional un-indexed sort

664485
int	boolean
gm_setvalue normally only stores 32-bit int strings and boolean but you can take advantage of the uneval method and a later eval on retrieval to store any object

664490
cells	tablecell
unfortunately that still doesn t fire the event i need which is the gotfocus on a tablecell although it is possible to get the event to fire by putting a button in the cells and clicking on it

typeerror	traceback
post an error traceback for to determine what class defines the attribute that can t be called the one that leads to the typeerror

664679
rss	feed
for your feed itself i d recommend sticking to a public specification such as atom or maybe an rss variant if you want

664709
post	get
you won t be able to do a post but a get will work fine

664709
submit	submission
alternatively your bookmarklet could create an iframe on the page and that could do you work of submission the data you could use post then if you weren t looking to communicate between the iframe and the page itself but instead just use user input to submit

664756
post	get
you can hack this using the cross join statement or some slef joins but it will get slow with any large data sets so probably best done in a post query processor

664832
subclass	abstract-class
i m leaning towards the bag as i think it may just be treating the collection as a bunch of the abstract-class instead of the subclass userinrole

664858

i want to be able to distribute by executable jar without having to make the user upgrade to the latest versioning of the jre

664873
post	put
i m using asp.net mvc to build a restful web application and i plan to tunnel put and delete requests through post as it seems like the most pragmatic workaround

664883
getter	setter
but as soon as i want to do anything in the getter or setter i have to change it to this

664905
getter	setter
in your case directly in the monthlyrent getter and setter property

664905
getter	setter
you first setup your getter and setter like described above to get the functionality

664905
getter	setter
then during your refactoring look for making the model cleaner by abstracting the long getter setter code into specification classes

664919
getter	setter
a custom getter setter requires that you manually create a backing field to work with

664919
getter	setter
the ability to specify a custom getter setter on an automatic property would essentially make it act just like a method since there s nothing to get or set

664988
put	get	post	put	post	get
open laszlo only supports calls to get and post so you won t be able to easily use the delete and put methods in your rest api

664995
post	put
then just start thinking about post and put as reading from standard input and your application s responses as writing to standard output

664996
inherited	properties
contentpresenter inherited directly from frameworkelement and does not have a template properties

665023
postgresql	mysql

tapestry	struts	jsf	tapestry
i was wondering if i could maybe take it one step further and instead of porting to jsps port directly to a framework like struts jsf tapestry whatever

665033
postgresql	mysql
this question should probably be considered a duplicate though the topic has been covered many times here on so google search for postgresql mysql on stackoverflow.com

665035
qsort	strcmp
not to mention that what s happening inside qsort would be the opposite that is a void would be cast to a char in numcmp and const char in strcmp

i know that cout have buffer several days ago and when i google it it is said that the buffer is some like a stack and get the output of cout and printf from right to left then put them out to the console or file from top to bottem

665117
hide	show
it would probably be simplest to hide all the rows then show a range of them every second with something like

665135
for-loop	arrays
in java it s very easy to detect the last element of an arrays from inside the for-loop by just checking the current arrays position with the arrays length

665150
post	get
this post here goes into detail about how to use windbg to get the size of an object graph

665191
spaces	delimiter
setting the delimiter to nothing is required to capture an entire input line with spaces otherwise you just get the first word

665209
cpu	processors
the power of the mainframe lies not in it s cpu grunt the individual processors aren t that powerful but they come in books of 54 cpus with hot backups and you can run many books in a single system z box but in the fact that all the cpu does is process instructions

665216
width	height
so rather than indent the text from the link off the page i cover it by absolutely positioning the to the full width and height of the and using z-index to place it above the link text in the stacking order

665246
awt	swing
the main difference between the jsomename classes and their previous version is that the j-ones where designed to be used with swing or any other graphical toolkit while the others are from this time where only awt was available

665248
stdout	fflush
the one for std cout is written such that when it overflows it is fflush into stdout

665252
awt	swing
the j was first put out by the kl group now quest.com whose revolutionary bwt forms the basis of today s improved awt called swing jfc

665252
awt	swing
the swing graphical user interface library was created to address the problems with the awt

665252
awt	swing
almost all swing components are derived from a single parent called jcomponent which extends the awt container class

665252
awt	swing
thus swing is best described as a layer on top of awt rather than a replacement for it

665252
awt	swing
if you compare it with the awt component hierarchy you will notice that for each awt component there is a swing equivalent with prefix â œ j â

665252
awt	swing
many swing classes have no awt counterparts

onmousemove	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmousemove
whenever i write mouse handling code the onmousedown onmouseup onmousemove model always seemed to force me to produce unnecessarily complex code that would still end up causing all sorts of ui bugs

665339
mouseup	mousedown
ordinarily one captures the mouse events on mousedown so the mouse move and mouseup go through your code regardless of the caret moving out of you application window

665342
vim	gedit
i recommend you spend at least some of your time with a simple editor like gedit or vim and the command line javac compiler

tapestry	wicket	jsf	tapestry	jsf	wicket
component-oriented jsf tapestry wicket etc

665383
mousemove	mousedown
i had it working with it automatically changing on selection by binding mousemove after mousedown fired but it ended up being very slow so i decided it was best to focus on my goal of changing what was copied

665384
swt	swing	awt	swing
from awt swing swt and jface a comparison of java gui libraries

665437
onclick	onfocus
make certain that the user cannot exit the field and then re-enter in a loation other than the end onfocus and onclick attributes cover this

665438
onmousedown	onmouseup
i m not sure what environment you re attempting to track mouse buttons in but the best way to handle this is to have a mouse listener that tracks onmouseup 100 of the time after you ve detected onmousedown

665448

i think what you really want to do is a mix of 1 and 3 you can override equals and gethashcode to use the string s that uniquely identify the object just make sure they are immutable

666810
int	double
at a quick guess perhaps you have a formatting problem with printf -- you re passing a double when it expects a short int or something like that

666844
equals	gethashcode
you could use option 3 if you can override gethashcode and equals appropriately something like this

666911

you can work with drupal joomla wordpress and many more

666941
mbunit	nunit
according to professional asp.net mvc 1.0 page 8 if you are using vs 2008 standard edition or visual web developer 2008 express you will need to download and install the nunit mbunit or xunit extensions for asp.net mvc in order for the create unit test project dialog to be shown.

667634
int	double
the most important is the memory cost on the instances especially if the instances are small for example if they are just meant to contain an int in this case having a virtual pointer in every instance might double the size of the instances

667683
public	protected
if all functions are virtual everything can be replaced by base classes - public protected private - everything becomes fair game

nsurlcache	nsurlconnection
for anyone interested in seeing an example of this the apple sample application nsurlcache implements a simple delegate around an nsurlconnection in nsurlcacheconnection.m

668497

668553
innodb	myisam
this may not be such a hardship since fulltext only works on myisam tables and you don t typically want your canonical data in myisam tables you can keep the definitive copy of your data in properly normalised innodb tables with an additional myisam table containing only stripped and stemmed search-bait

668572

668851
rss	feed
i m creating an rss and or atom feed for my website

668851
rss	feed
use the same templating system i use to generate the html clearsilver if anyone s wondering basically just treating the rss feed like any other web page that happens to be in rss+xml instead of xhtml

668851
rss	feed
use an xml library or an rss library specifically in my programming language of choice python to create the feed programmatically and then write it out

668851
rss	feed
but in this particular case all the values for the fields of the rss feed are already formatted as well-formed properly escaped xhtml.

668865

you could get a post install script for pretty much any package manager to run the click-through program if needed but i think it s better to run it as a per-user thing

668916
ftp	telnet
i m not sure i understand your comment on using ftp to log in and monitor log files - surely you d be logging in with telnet and its brethren rather than using ftp for that purpose

salt causes the same password to yield different hash and thwarts dictionary attacks where a hacker has pre-computed hash values for common passwords and built a reverse-lookup index so that they can quickly discover a password for a given hash

669888
des	aes
an initialization vector is used with block ciphers like des and aes in a feedback mode like cbc

669899
haskell	scheme
ask the long line of people who have tried to compile haskell ml modula-3 scheme and more using this technique

669910
maven	m2e
you can effectively run any maven command including ones with profiles through the m2e plugin

669924
jquery	scriptaculous
it has noconflict method that allows you to easy migrate having both prototype scriptaculous and jquery library included

669924
jquery	scriptaculous
jquery is light weight especially in compare with scriptaculous

670068
addition	multiplication
one possible implementation of f would be similar to that given in the last example under the addition section any constant number of bit shifts left followed by a multiplication by a prime - you could even use successive primes on each iteration at no extra cost since they only need be generated once

670186
pull	push
publish your pu feature_name either ask people to pull or just push to a public server like github.

670190
twitter	myspace
it could be used to enable data access against hundreds of oauth-enabled data apis all over the web including those of google myspace twitter yahoo flickr etc

670193
queue	fifo
a real-world example would be a fifo queue

670250

670278
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your framework versioning to .net 3.5 sp1

670304
post	get
you know how to use post and get aka html forms to pass data between pages

670304
post	get
now the thing to understand is that post get are ways to send data around between webpages -- between the browser and the server

670333
post	get
note the web service is all xml over http though i expect to have to use http get post and head eventually

670412
int	chars
use something chars int etc with same size as bool instead bool

670433
width	height
webkit browsers set the height and width property after the image is loaded

670472
postgresql	mysql
for both mysql and postgresql try toad data modeler

670472
postgresql	mysql
if you use the open-source diagram app dia there are several tools to generate dia diagrams from sql databases including mysql and postgresql

670477
jtextpane	jeditorpane
note jtextpane inherits its settext method from jeditorpane and its setcaretposition method from jtextcomponent which explains the links in the previous paragraph not going to the jtextpane javadoc page

670484
post	get
one of the answers there pointed to a blog post which describes how to get code like this

670511
rss	feed
craigslist has an rss feed and i wish to convert the feed to json format so that i can parse it

670528
installation	upgrade
installation directory or upgrade

670584
hide	show
although if you are doing the hide show with client side scripting they will not be persisted through the viewstate anyways

670599
int	chars
all the way down int and chars are objects and all the way up classes methods the browsers the ide itself are all objects

670663
wmv	asf
i have tried to play wmv asf file in html page but always windows media player is embedded in browser but flash media player is not embedded

670663
wmv	asf
i suspect it is because flash media player does not support wmv asf format so even if i explicitly assign application x-shockwave-flash value flash media player is not displayed

670663
wmv	asf
does flash media player support wmv asf file

670692
ruby-gnome2	shoes
i heard that ruby-gnome2 and shoes are the top most used desktop libraries for ruby

670713
translation	localization
so to answer your question generate the meta tags .resx files using visual studio and do the translation using some localization tool

670716
wmv	asf
it s not so much that flash doesn t support wmv asf

670716
wmv	asf
it s more the fact that wmv asf is not a flash movie so you can t pretend that it s one by putting it in the src attribute when you re using the application x-shockwave-flash type

670721
wmv	flv
flash doesn t accept wmv but uses flv mpeg-4

670727
squeak	visualworks
i m a smalltalk newbie and i m using cincom s visualworks at the moment but i d like to give squeak a try

670733
int	chars	int	boolean
this is i believe the main reason that boolean are implemented using int instead of chars

670738
put	get
there is a lot of discussion on this topic related to microsoft silverlight but as i understand it voice and camera inputs from the client side are not supported as of silverlight 2 though it may get put into silverlight 3

670770
apache	lighttpd
also running services like web servers apache lighttpd or mail servers exim sendmail ... could end up in different needs

670897
pthreads	fork
under linux or pthreads type os using fork will cause the forked child to have copies of all the parent s file descriptors

670943
stdout	stderr
i suspect you would want to send the stdout stderr to a file and edit it there in which case you need

670943
stdout	stderr
the redirects stderr file handle 2 to go to the same place as stdout file handle 1 so that both of them end up in a single stream

670973
post	get
when i want to print all users with associated post count i get no surprise here a n+1 select problem as for each line it will create a select to get the post for the users

670975
boost	stl
more common usage would be binding std pair first and second when using in stl algorithms and boost on a map

670986
awt	swing
my language of preference for gui graphics programming is java so i tried making a prototype with awt because it s synchronous unlike swing

670988
lift	wicket
wicket s designer-friendly templating style see lift view

670993
getter	setter
the whole reason to have accessors getter and modifiers setter is to provide yourself with an extra level of indirection

670993
getter	setter
the extra level of indirection for getter setter also allow you to be able to change the data member that they encapsulate

670993
getter	setter
this is not the reason to use them but a nice side effect of using getter and setter is that you can set a breakpoint inside your modifier for example to see exactly when it is changed

670993
getter	setter
you could even provide getter setter for an object for the whole struct at once

671031
post	get
if you post the two plans or email em to me you ll get better answers about what s going on

671045
voip	rtp
voip protocols are good for streaming applications rtp and h.323

671062
g++	gcc
once i realised i was using sun rather than gcc i switched to compiling with cc gcc cc g++ and f95 f77

671078
pull	push
you would need to run a sql server database on the web server and then push the data from access to sql server or pull it from sql server

671119
google-chrome	firefox
also two browsers google-chrome ie firefox etc might work well too

671129
put	get
i would rather not put it in the application_start method since it does not always get called when debugging

671132
post	get
the two verbs in mainstream usage are get and post which i think everyone will recognize

671132
put	get	post	put	post	get
notice that we are using different http verbs get put post delete etc. to manipulate these resources and that the only knowledge we presume on the clients part is our media definition

671142
folder	directory
immediately i observed that a random directory was generated inside that folder

671144
folder	directory
your binary files will be on project folder build there you will have one directory for each of the possible options release debug and iphoneos iphonesimulator

671159
put	get
rest is using the various http methods mainly get put delete to manipulate data

671187
notepad	textpad
you could use the logging information to help debug using something like textpad to view the log file s while debugging since textpad unlike notepad detects and allows you to view the contents of any updates done while the file is open

671188
960.gs	fluid
emastic is only 4kb fixed and fluid columns and em based malo is very very small 8 lines of code and the golden grid is 1kb is similar to blueprint or 960.gs

671198
google-chrome	firefox
say google-chrome for your email and firefox for dev

671223
mouseleave	mouseenter
to do so i handle the mouseenter and mouseleave events of the usercontrol hiding and displaying the picturebox

671250
post	get
so it really uses only get and post and on server it reads this hidden field and reacts on it

671260
folder	directory
so my question is what are some tips or best practice methods in creating folder for these static files or if i shouldn t go the virtual directory route at all

671268
post	get
the html 4.01 specification describes only get and post as valid values for the method attribute

671284
put	get
the best way to learn about this and also get put and delete is to use a rest client to make your http requests and see the responses

671301
post	get
c moran is right if you want to be truly restful a browser isn t an ideal client due in part to the lack http methods beyond get and post

671372
lxml	beautifulsoup
another alternative to beautifulsoup is lxml

671378
put	get
now to get the files from section1 to extend section1 base.html you just have to put at the top of them

671446
post	put
so i was able to fake a put request by making a post request using redirect_post and then assigning put to a _method param

671446
post	put
if you look at a normal put request all it is a post from a form with a _method param

671451
config	ini
config options could be stored in the registry ini file or anyother storage option

671508
put	get	post	put	post	get
resources being manipulated using a common set of verbs http methods are the commonly seen case - the venerable create retrieve update delete becomes post get put and delete

671512
post	get
let s say i m writing a grails web-app where user input is taken from form fields reading post get params and database tables using gorm

671512
post	get
let s assume that an attacker controls both what s sent as post get requests to the server and what s in the database

671512
client-side	server-side
update #1 to keep the discussion focused please disregard any html-xss problems in the code since this question is about code-execution on the server-side not on the client-side

671552
gridview	objectdatasource
say we data bind gridview to an objectdatasource control and then perform a query

671599
jedit	textpad
for non-unicode editing on windows i m a textpad user--my staff and i have probably spent about 200 000 hours in textpad with only occasional forays into notepad2 madedit jedit xml copy editor and epcedit

671612
rsa	aes
the code basically uses aes for encryption of binary data and then rsa encrypts the key and the iv using an x509certificate

671731
clang	llvm
so you may have to run clang llvm with scan-build xcodebuild -configuration debug

671747
width	height
jquery has two function that should be of use to you width and height

671767
post	get
this blog post explains a possible solution for this type of problem the author uses his own version of irepository but you use the same ideas in your repository or check out his ncommon project to get some inspiration

671770
post	get
i just tried and played with it a little and it seems marc s hunch is right the cache is dependent on the method get post

671838
cvs	svn	perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
xcode has built-in support for svn cvs and perforce

671849
wxpython	pythoncard
boa constructor apparently has a wxpython gui builder in it and there is also pythoncard though development on these two projects seems to have stalled

671851
opera	firefox
i actually know how the browsers tend to render the following examples results based on opera 9.5 and firefox 3.0 but i don t understand the reason behind them

671852
udp	tcp
sql doesn t listen on tcp 1434 it listens on udp 1434

671881

671892
inherited	properties
while color is an inherited properties the inner selector targets the span itself so it takes precedence

671895
vb.net	vb6
some years ago i used to program in vb6 i really liked it because it was very simply and fast when vb.net came out i abandoned it because they changed a lot of things

671895
vb.net	vb6
well i must admit that i didn t try vb.net too much i was a little disappointed because i would had to learn a lot of new things and i ve had learned vb6 not so long before in that moment

671901
vb.net	vb6
vb.net is the natural progression of vb6 and has a lot of free tools and resources online to get started

671952
pascal	delphi
my first language was pascal and i think it s also one of the easiest languages and with delphi getting popular again i think it s a very good alternative to vb6

671953
width	height
the height and width are huge and in addition there are funny and large values for the compression flags and a few others

671988
inherited	properties
color is an inherited properties so we need to look at the span s parent elements for the most specific rule

672003
hide	show
first in your viewwillappear subscribe to the keyboard notifications so you know when the keyboard will show and hide and the system will tell you the size of the keyboard but dont forget to unregister in your viewwilldisappear

672049
apache	nginx
if it were at all possible i would recommend that they setup apache on a nonstandard port accessible only from the nginx box and have nginx proxy to apache

672068
width	height
middle column store a huge articles however when left and right column is fixed width it set the height of the whole page

672074
width	height
it seems odd that you re creating a bitmap of the same width and height as your input yet the generated bmp is much larger

672087
listbox	icollectionview
if you are not binding to a datagrid icollectionview will not give you much because it is not used by the basic controls such as listbox as far as i can tell since it is defined in the data controls assembly and not in the core

672149
put	get
i always get a classnotfoundexception for the domain classes regardless in which package i put them in

672171
width	height
inspecting the generated 24bpp file with a hex editor and comparing against the 8bpp file shows no difference in height and width in the two files

672177
put	get
you put values you want into tempdata immediately redirect and get them out

672257
awt	swing
this also explains why awt was pretty limited compared to swing

672257
swt	swing	awt	swing
take a look at this page from ibm for an in-depth comparison of awt swing and swt

i work for a team of asp.net mvc and they are using cruisecontrol nunit and nant for the automated testing and build

672367
width	height
please see the code below and tell me where should i define properties to tag like width height bgcolor etc

672441
udp	tcp
for basic client server application with tcp udp winsock should be sufficient

672456
multiplying	add
other functions to add or multiplying should be written to assume the input is already valid since it will have been created by one of the functions in this library

672487
min	max
if a b and c are all set at max value or to the min value they each get 1 3

672553
rss	feed

inherited	subclassing
make all testcase subclassing for your package inherited from a phony subclassing so that you can say on gst-sunit s command line when you add more tests

672608
.nettiers	codesmith
looking at the architecture that is used i recommended to introduce a code generator like codesmith in combination with .nettiers

672648
ienumerable	iqueryable
basically most of the linq extension methods are defined only for not ienumerable iqueryable

672704
vcard	vcf
i need a java library to read vcard files vcf

672733
singleton	facade
i do believe that some things should not be used in the name such as singleton however flyweight factory or facade are examples of design names i think fit well in the name of a class that implements those patterns

672735
stdout	stderr
if you start eclipse through eclipse.app from the desktop its console stdout stderr will be redirected to the syslog so any output by eclipse itself or plugins using printf will end up there

672770
put	get
you have to put more effort to get it working but code blocks take advantage here

672787
user-controls	tabcontrol
next place on your window tabcontrol nad on one of it s tabpages put this newly created user-controls

672799
vim	emacs
if you are going to be doing serious work on linux you need to learn one of vim or emacs

672803
vim	emacs
vim and emacs on the other hand have been present for much longer

672814
vim	emacs
with vim or emacs you can do it remotely and fill ok

672883
vim	emacs
lots of developers use emacs and vim because they re excellent and powerful editing tools that once learned can make everyday editing tasks much simpler

672883
vim	emacs
emacs and vim are just editors but because of their usefulness and their longevity they ve accumulated a number of plugins and extensions to simulate many of the tasks of an ide

672883
vim	emacs
if you just want an ide that lets you jump right in you re probably not looking for emacs and vim but if you want a very powerful editor that while taking a while to learn will make your life easier in the end go for emacs or vim

672894
rss	feed
im looking at writing a application for a web 2.0 start up site which will essential monitor specific rss feed

672914
sorting	filtering
you can then use this view to perform your queries there could be a performance hit for filtering and sorting based on the age and if you regularly sort filtering based upon the age field then you may want to create an indexed view

672917
post	get
you can get almost anything you like without using allowtrasparency take a look at this post for examples

672924
vim	emacs
code blocks is less used because it isn t extensible as emacs vim

672993
width	height
there is a way to get top left x top left y width and height of this

673030

the canvas s width and height are in its offsetwidth and offsetheight

673032
folder	directory
when im naming a variable for a directory should i end the variable name with path folder or directory

673036
pop-up	dialog
what currently happens is windows pop-up a dialog telling me that the program has crashed and only once i ve dismissed that manually does the process exit

673046
folder	directory	folder	dir
i d recommend folder directory or even dir

673053
folder	directory
the only caveat i d say is that path could be a web location or a file where folder and directory won t be if that helps your decision

fgetc	fread
using fgetc will show you that the file actually does contain what you think it does and that your problems are not due to the somewhat uncommon use of fread for a single byte

673142
vb.net	vb6
today for new projects i feel that everything that made vb6 so easy to use is available with vb.net plus you get new language constructs and the .net framework

673142
vb.net	vb6
if you have to maintain or transfer an older project then the differences between vb6 and vb.net are much more serious

673183
width	height

i m currently using pypdf to read write and combine existing pdf s and reportlab to generate new content

673521
activemq	rabbitmq
having an mom instance whether activemq rabbitmq or any other mom broker on a one-per-consumer case doesn t really make sense conceptually

673547
integer	unsigned
in your system you have many units error is amps the command is volts which turns into amps then the current use is amps which is reported as volts which gets turned into either a signed or unsigned integer which has to be scaled back into amperes to make the error proper

673611
inherited	properties
put the control properties modifiers on public and recompile the project and then you can change properties of the inherited control

673625
try-catch	exception-handling
your try-catch blocks should only be around pieces of code that are capable of throwing exception-handling anything involving user-input anything involving an external datasource

673639
getter	setter
i have seen this in framework or macro generated getter and setter before

673654
folder	directory
this application installs a default user-config file to it s home directory and the first time each user starts the application it copies this file to that user s application data folder

673809
stdout	stderr
you might also want to use ipc run and it s callbacks for data on stdout stderr

673823
shadowing	named
this is called shadowing when we have a method with the same named but a different behavior when called from the base class

673833
width	height
you should specify the height and width attributes for the img tag see below for the w3c schools explanation of why you should do this

673833
width	height
both the height and width attributes

673833

sorting	grouping
set sorting in the grouping and sorting properties to sort by this expression

674037
hash	salt
hashid salt hash password

674037
hash	salt
as others have mentioned you want to be careful with your hash since it s easy to do something that s not really secure h salt password is far weaker than h password salt but at the same time you want to balance the effort put into this with the value of the site content

674110
debian	linux
and i already disabled all time consuming stuff i anyways don t use frequently like code completion that is on my debian gnu linux installation

notepad++	scite
to get a glimpse on it look at notepad++ win or scite linux

674114
portrait	landscape
i understand you can specify a landscape for the entire application but what if its partially in landscape and partially in portrait

674114
portrait	landscape
just to clarify i do not need auto rotation functionality the way that it is being implemented now is captures all the functionality i want to include in the app but i just wanted to know if there is a less cumbersome way of handling landscape portrait views within the same application

674147
vb.net	vb6
this is in vb6 may also apply to vb.net

674151
disk	ram
pretty similar to ram hard disk

674158
actionscript	mxml
i want to do this inside my mxml not actionscript

674180
actionscript	mxml
you can write it like actionscript but include it inside the mxml file with the script tag

674214
profiler	visualvm
the visualvm profiler that now comes with the jdk can be attached to running processes and may at least give an initial overview of the performance

674252
disk	ram
the only way to get that much memory is with a 64 bit jvm on a machine with at least 8 gb of ram or use some disk backed cache

674314
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
these styles work in ff3 google-chrome safari and i think opera 9

674342
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome don t have this problem so that s an additional symptom

674355
firefox	safari
everything works find in firefox but in safari i noticed immediately that when i click on an html button the annotation button the current user text selection goes away as if clicking on the button repositioned the text caret

674355
firefox	safari
this google docs solution works for both firefox and safari the two browsers that i m interested in

674390
width	margin
first we add a margin to the parent element of the size â sum wc â the total width of all child elements

674390
width	margin	children	parent
set that as the parent margin then the children can have one-third of that width as padding between them

674401
des	aes
i have experience in cryptography as i have taken several courses and written my own implementation of some algorithms des aes schnorr but i have never used any complete library for it

674414
mouse	keyboard
so you will need a client application that runs in the user s desktop and hooks into the keyboard and mouse activity

674414
mouse	keyboard
you would do that via two calls to the windows api setwindowshookex for low level keyboard and mouse hooks using jni

674414
mouse	keyboard
to monitor activity the application would then need to process the keyboard and mouse hooks for messages

674423
equals	compareto
pojos may also contain other functions such as equals hashcode compareto and various other functions

674425
getter	setter
i don t think there s a point to testing simple property getter and setter

674425
getter	setter
however as soon as you add a conditional null-check or other non-trivial behavior to your getter and setter or other methods i think it s appropriate to add unit tests

674436
getter	setter
i think if the getter and setter have been created using an ide then it should be fine

674436
serializable	deserialization
obviously you would test the pojo s for serializable deserialization

674437
getter	setter
my answer is that trivial getter and setter do not merit their own tests

674437
getter	setter
of course this is all boilerplate so you could easily write a script that generates unit tests for your getter and setter if you think there s any value there

674440
getter	setter
in my experience creating unit tests for pojos with only getter and setter is just overkill

674440
getter	setter
there are some exceptions of course if there is additional logic in the getter setter like checking for null and doing something special than i would create a unit test for that

674456
atoi	atof
i have a c++ application where i m replacing a number of sscanf functions with atoi atof etc.

674476
getter	setter
if these are data entity objects then the setter getter pattern may be correct

674478
yacc	bison
the standard tools are bison or yacc for the grammar and flex for the syntax

674481
yacc	bison
if you can stretch to other languages then lex yacc or flex bison is the standard for c although i wouldn t particularly recommend either of those combinations steep learning curve showing their age a little now

674493
yacc	sablecc
javacc yacc are sablecc are more traditional lexer parser generators and you ll find that they re a little more primitive and have steeper learning curves

674526
yacc	bison
bison c lr gnu version of the venerable yacc

674568
int	double
the only other thing i could think of would be that you re multiplying distance an int by the result of math.sin double but that shouldn t really be an issue

674643
google-chrome	firefox
however this doesn t work in firefox or google-chrome

674717
implements	modifiers
there is standard functionality for shortcuts which are modifiers + key which is quite easy to implements but is there a way to easely using standard libraries implements shortcuts like ctrl + k c holding ctrl press k and then c

674769
for-loop	loops
you can re-write the for-loop as a while loops to get some idea of what it is doing

674848
free	malloc
you also need to make it clear if the caller or the library is responsible for calling malloc and free

674849
lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml	html5lib	html5lib	beautifulsoup
i strongly recommend using html5lib + lxml instead of beautifulsoup

674897
spaces	delimiter
input a given text file containing email addresses delimiter by a spaces tab

674904
hash	salt
to explain we all hopefully know by now that we should salt a password before we hash it for storage in the database edit so you can avoid things like what happened to jeff atwood recently

674921
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
it looks as if it works fine in firefox safari opera and ie 6 and 7 but not in 8

674923
hash	salt
the hash will be no more easily guessable wherever you put the salt

674946
listview	gridview	itemscontrol	gridviewcolumn
i would suggest maybe a listview gridview with a gridviewcolumn with a custom celltemplate containing an itemscontrol with its own datatemplate...simple really

674955
daemons	launchd
here s a bare-bones example of an init script for launchd an rsync daemons

674964
min	max
i used min in the example below but you could just as easily use max

674976
post	get
check out my post which contains instructions and sample code on how to get started

674980
dictionary	map
assuming you have to have support for unicode the hash map dictionary lookup is probably your best bet as a 64k entry array in each node won t really work very well

674980
trie	tree
about the only hack up i could think of on this is to store entire strings suffixes or possibly in-fixes on branches that do not yet split depending on how sparse the tree er trie is

675003
put	get
you may need to clear out your session store to get rid of the token that you already put in there

675005
qpushbutton	qobject
when i am writing code intellisense seems to die - it does not show any methods or data members in qt objects such as qpushbutton does not see the qobject connect static method etc

675034
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a multiview in the module that i m developing and in one of the views have a gridview that is bound to an objectdatasource

675061
submit	submission
when accessing the login.action the menu is rendered fine but if i enter data in the form the submit the form and submission has validation errors i return to the page the form is rendered ok but the menu is missing

675070
innodb	myisam
if you have enough memory allocated for mysql s use - in the innodb buffer pool or for use by myisam you can read the database into memory just a select from tablename and if there s no reason to remove it it stays there

675098
bellman-ford	dijkstra
dijkstra s and bellman-ford reduces to a breadth-first search when the weights are 1 so this isn t too useful

675102
bellman-ford	dijkstra
there are lots of solutions including dijkstra s algorithm and bellman-ford

675128
folder	directory
i am trying to first list all the iis websites and the folder virtual web directory in each in a tree view

675128
folder	directory
i can create a virtual web directory if i know the path i plan to use but i cannot get a list of the folder virtual web directory in a website i can get the website list

675144
vmware	virtualbox
personally and i have no hard data to back this up virtualbox seems to be faster and a lot more responsive to me than vmware workstation

675175
accessor	properties
it is possible to create field get set accessor methods in pretty much any language which simulate properties

675192
inherited	properties
i don t know what type your service1 object inherited so i can t say what properties or methods you have associated with it but whenever i know you can make calls to you web service with using

675193
free	strdup
the macros strdup and free are error-checking versions of strdup and free declared in emalloc.h and implemented in emalloc.c and estrdup.c

675197
getter	setter
delphi has a property pattern with setter and getter methods which also can be used in interfaces

675197
getter	setter
or without setter getter

675203
hash	salt
storing the per-user salt in your database is not a security issue using a site-wide hash is

675233
postgis	ltree
i am using ltree and postgis a lot in my current project and i can t think of any other way to run unit tests for the model logic that depends on the db other than to include it in my tests

675248
int	chars
i said this was an but let me access it as if it were a pointing to sizeof int chars s or i said this data was read-only and now i need to pass it to a function that won t modify it but doesn t take the parameter as a const reference.

675257
getter	setter
will make a getter and a setter for length_inches

675257
getter	setter
if you later on want to put some logic in the getter setter you can simply manually implement the same methods

675293
for-loop	loops
the generalized format of a for-loop not a for-in loops is

675294
hide	show
it works in firefox too - except - when we toggle ie show hide from one div to the other the page moves in firefox

675307
hide	show
one thing that you could try is to hide before you show this may have less flicker

675318
haskell	ocaml
many languages like ocaml python haskell f# and so on have a special concise syntax for defining tuples

675327
pop-up	dialog
once that dialog pop-up it s difficult to dismiss which can be irritating

675337
folder	directory
use 7-zip to extract it to a folder directory outside your windows python installation folder

675385
hide	show
in the end what worked was that i would hide show the datagridview control after i inserted a row

675461
portrait	landscape
my current application is primarily landscape but has a few portrait views

675472
firefox	safari
i have tested my code in firefox 3.0.7 and in safari 3.2.1

675477
google-chrome	firefox
this is true for all browsers i ve tried it in ie firefox google-chrome

675478
int	chars
if fubar is a chars field but contains only numbers then you can cast the field to int and still use the between clause

675568
atoi	atof
if the data you want to convert is guaranteed to be only in the ascii charset you can always transform it to ascii and cat atof atol atoi friends

675614
stdout	fflush
it indeed seems to be blocking at connect forgot to fflush stdout

675635
getter	setter
of course the setter and getter are often methods themselves

675636
imagemagick	magick++
you could duplicate the functionality of imagemagick s import command using magickwand c api or magick++ c++ api but calling import directly via system as suggested by justinhj is likely the simplest approach if you don t mind distributing import with your software

675644
accessor	properties
this is a read-only properties a get but no set accessor

675644
public	protected
public values should always be accessed as properties rather than variables in classes a private protected backing variable to a property but that is slightly unrelated to your question

675656
httphandler	pagemethods
the way you worded your question i believe you re considering the difference between an asmx scriptservice an ashx httphandler and an asp.net ajax pagemethods not an actual aspx page

675708
hash	salt
it could then be cheaper to brute-force a password file entry with postfix salt than prefix salt for each dictionary word in turn you would load the state add the salt bytes into the hash and then finalise it

675708
hash	salt
but a cryptographically secure hash function is deliberately designed to have multiple rounds each of which uses all the bits of the input string so that computing the internal state just prior to the addition of the salt is not meaningful after the first round

675708
pbkdf2	hash
moreover password hashing algorithms like pbkdf compose their hash function multiple times it is recommended to iterate pbkdf2 a minimum of 1000 times each iteration applying sha-1 twice making this attack doubly impractical

675719
width	height
width or height you can drop two div s ie

675719
gif	png	width	height
with either technique you can optimise your image by creating a gif or png with enough transparency between the segments to exceed the maximum bounds of width and height your button will experience

675741
spaces	delimiter
i manually extracted them by the or spaces delimiter

675772
children	parent
i have a one to many relationship parent to children for sake of this question and for some reason l2s was wanting to create a new parent instead of using the one is already had

675887
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uitabbarcontroller where the default view controller is a uinavigationcontroller

675887
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i want to be able to hide the uitabbar of the uitabbarcontroller when i push a certain view in the uinavigationcontroller

675912
children	parent
the orm sqlmetal or via a dbml models a parent object and you ll also notice a collection of children on the parent entity also

675920
post	get
to get started with wcf it might be easiest to just use the default soap format and http post rather than get for the web-service bindings

675920
post	get
wcf can be a little picky when inter-operating with non-wcf clients so you ll have to mess with the post headers a little to get it to work

675920
post	get
once you get this running you can then start to investigate security for the login might need to use a different binding to get better security or possibly using wcf rest to allow for logins with a get rather than soap post

676008
integer	unsigned
unsigned integers declared unsigned shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer

676008
integer	unsigned
2 if the destination type is unsigned the resulting value is the least unsigned integer congruent to the source integer modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits used to represent the unsigned type

676023
smallcheck	quickcheck
a good way to debug haskell code is to write and test algebraic laws using quickcheck and smallcheck

676055
udp	tcp
from the old version of our engine to our new one we switched from udp to tcp

676153
put	get
that means among other things that it does not take advantage of certain aspects of http mostly restful usage of urls and methods put customers 1234 or get customers 1234

676159
gif	png
i d like to create a graphic image on the fly based on user input and then present that image as a png file or jpg or gif if necessary but png is preferred

676164
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
look at ruby-gd2 or an imagemagick or graphicsmagick binding

676282
int	double	min	max
i am doing this generating values for functional testing i am actually passing this values to nunit partner max amd min are applicable to int float double etc. these values are test data

676282
int	double
initially i generated for basic data types like int float double string etc

676346
user-controls	tabcontrol
the problem was when i bind a user-controls to a tabcontrol itâ s only the contentpaneâ s datacontext that is set to the user-controls and the datacontext for the headerpane is still null

676351
width	height
the table height is 955px width is 701px

676357
width	height
use height and width in percentage instead of px

676384
int	double	min	max
i am generating these values for functional testing i am actually passing these values to nunit partner max and min are applicable to int float double etc

676384
int	double
initially i generated them for basic data types like int float double string etc

676401
width	height
you can specify width height and if you want it to look like a part of the original page include

676408
folder	directory
most probably the swf is not at the right path or is not getting copied to an assets folder in the debug-build release-build directory

676415
move	drag
now i want to remove some items from this sort list and move them back to the drag list

676415
move	drag
suppose the user move some 5 items to sort list and decides he she wants only 4 items and decides to just drag the unwanted item from the sortlist to the drag list

676417
formview	detailsview
in this case i would suggest a formview instead of a detailsview which will allow you greater control over the details display since it requires user defined templates instead of preconfigured row based display

676437
sorting	filtering
i think in general if you have a database it s always best to do as much filtering and sorting in the db as possible and use linq to objects sparingly especially on large collections of data

676437
sorting	filtering
linq-to-objects is useful for doing database-like sorting and filtering on in-memory collections

676459
git-stage	git-add
also git-stage is an alias for git-add

676475
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
ie even the brand new version 8 is years behind the other 3 firefox safari opera ..

676500
ilist	iqueryable
ilist t to iqueryable t

676534
int	double
casting down big type - smaller type like double - float - int - byte will cut off information which can t be represented so double- float will lose precision - int will lose all decimal places + no rounding

676551
gif	png	tiff	png
not ony will it render your pdf to a variety of formats eg jpeg gif png tiff jpeg 2000

676596
free	malloc
as a result there are now two classes that believe they own the memory from the original malloc call and when the second is deleted it will try to free memory deleted by the first

676602
free	malloc
apart from the fixes given you should avoid using malloc free in c++

676650
switching	screens
if i switching to 800 by 600 pixels i want my html windows changed automatically to fix the screens

676659
google-chrome	firefox
i have verified in both google-chrome and firefox firebug that the actual contents of the div are nowhere near 633 pixels high

676698
rss	feed
this is the bbc s rss feed

676698
rss	feed
if you view it in firefox or ie7 the browser s default rss feed styling is used

676698
rss	feed
i tried to do something similar myself with this rss feed

676698
rss	feed
however once i put it live onto our production server the ie6 stylesheet is appearing when you view the rss feed in firefox

676700
width	height
also note that the width and height properties don t take any note of where toolbars sit so the window could disappear behind there

676750
amr	aac
i just cannot figure out how to tweak the sample code to be used with for example aac mp3 or amr instead

676767
int	chars
a couple notes to the best of my knowledge the int type is always 4 bytes also any of the var types are by definition not fixed length and only store up to their max length if a nvarchar 10 holds a 2 chars string it only stores 2 chars

676773
trojan	virus
jeez not even my virus trojan scanner will complain when i start a python program which hooks into the keyboard events.

676779
int	chars
you are trying to assign a chars array index_buff to an unsigned int data_t.un32index

676790
integer	unsigned
i agree with the previous answers but i thought i d share code that actually converts a hex string to an unsigned integer just to show how it s done

676791
spweb	spsite
so you need to first create the lookup column inside the root spweb of the spsite

676817
free	malloc
if you can free it why are you malloc ing it in a loop in the first place

676821
post	get
so initially i started to make the services return a result the result would be uniquely identifiable so the caller would know if the comment was indeed made and additionally i would return the comment entity in the result the results would also identify things like could not post as user is not authenticated or could not post as specified cool-down period has not been respected i don t actually return strings but you get the idea

676825
rss	feed
when i changed this to the full url for your feed the default firefox rss feed styling was applied as you expected to see

676910
width	height
if this is the case you ll need to relook at the assumptions you ve made with your hard coded values for width height and pixel format

676961
ienumerable	ilist
note that it has to be an extension on ilist instead of ienumerable so we can perform the updates which makes it less widely applicable

676991
gif	png
seriously though the two main lossless formats are gif and png both in browser and out of and the biggest by far lossy format is jpg

676991
gif	png
png tends to be better compression ratios than gif

677015
gridview	repeater
i have a repeater inside the templatefield for a gridview

677015
gridview	repeater
gridview is bound to datasource1 and the repeater to datasource2

677032
cos	sin
sin cos tan functions allow you to convert from triangle edge ratio to degrees

677043
gridview	rowdatabound
the gridview exposes the rowdatabound event which you can handle in the same way

677066
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
this could be events in windows in c# i don t know in python the manualresetevent autoresetevent or a mutex if you want to sacrifice a waiter-thread in each process or signals in linux

677076
inherited	subclassing
it is not inherited by subclassing

677157
inherited	subclassing
personally i would look at allowing extensibility through inherited allowing third parties to subclassing your code without giving them the source and very carefully specified access modifiers

677230
folder	directory
recreate folder and copy all the files from original directory to the new one

677257
submit	submission
for example when trying to submit a files original path without submission the file itself when trying to do it for multiple dynamicly created components

677259
kate	scite
personally i use a variety of editors from good old vi to scite kate eclipse and even just the python console for testing snippets quickly

677274
stdio	fflush
there is basic_ostream fflush however i suspect that this does not in fact call fsync -- i expect that like fflush in stdio it only makes sure that the user-space runtime library buffers are fflush meaning that the os could still be buffering the data

677292
implements	extends
it was a cms for a university completely implements by extends django admin

677324
width	height
flash to 100 width and 100 height

677328
hash	salt
as sam152 said the passwords are likely sha1 hash so if the passwords are not stored with salt you can build a rainbow table to find the original password

677362
keydown	keyup
you want to handle the keyup or keydown event and check the pressed key for delete

677393
versioning	upgrade
that i now want to upgrade my versioning in trunk to v1.3

677437
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this solution in google-chrome build 1.0.154.53 firefox 3.0.7 and internext explorer 8.0.6001

677447
gif	png
i prefer png for any internet image work i m doing as gif has a limited palette and jpg doesn t handle transparency

677459
config	ini
ini is really a much simpler format than xml if you have less than fifty config options and they are not nested

677463
updatepanel	formview
it s a simple aspx page with a table formview to show data all within an updatepanel

677523
hide	show
on a number of pages i use a multiview to show and hide the content based on different view modes view edit add

677557
easyhook	detours
apart from detours library you might also take a look at easyhook library

677561
capitalize	uppercase
what i needed this method for was to capitalize names of hotels that sometimes came in all uppercase

677561
capitalize	uppercase
i only wanted to capitalize them if they were all lower or uppercase

677602
put	get
you can use bit shift to put together a 64 bit random number from 31 bit random numbers but you have to use three 31 bit numbers to get enough bits

677603
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
otherwise you run the risk of catching any runtimeexception including nullpointerexception arrayindexoutofboundsexception etc. which your client code probably can t handle

677613
integer	unsigned
this would work the same for integer long and their unsigned relatives

677633
int	chars
for each chars convert it to an int and add it to your total until you reach the end of the number

677715
free	malloc
nsapi supplies a malloc macro that gets memory from a pool that will be free for you when the request ends but it doesn t say what happens if you call this malloc function in an initialization function when there is no request

677737
fflush	gets
the readline gets stuck because you forgot to fflush the output stream of the sender the other process

677746
gridview	repeater	gridview	sqldatasource
in the asp.net page i use a repeater to loop over the sqldatasource stored procedure that returns a course s prerequisite sets and a gridview inside that repeater that reads the individual prerequisite information from a second sqldatasource stored procedure

677795
puts	gets
after this little client gets a result or callback then it puts the server into an accessible by the outside world state

677801
iprincipal	iidentity
my mockidentity and mockprincipal classes are mocks conforming to iidentity and iprincipal respectively

677801
getter	setter
i understand that the httpcontextbase has a getter and setter that aren t implemented but i thought that rhino would handle this when mocking

677839
int	chars
second int simply take up less room than almost any chars key except chars 1 assuming the use of unicode

677839
int	chars
however if you have a choice between int and chars and both are essentially arbitrary go with the int over the chars

677872
multiplication	modulo	addition	multiplication	addition	modulo
calculating the product of 2 8 32 64 128 256 512 using repeated squaring 2 8 2 2 2 2 which requires more space and a multiplication method but is far fewer operations - is closer to normal big integer use so you may find it more useful in later problems if you try to calculate the last ten digits of 28433ã 2 7830457 +1 using the digit-per int method and repeated addition it may take some time though in that case you could use modulo arthimetic rather than adding strings of millions of digits

677950
put	get
the documentation i ve found says to get a devmode structure change a couple of fields and put it back in

677951
children	parent
i tried to map the children as a collection by using many-to-one and get the number of children from the collection size but then hibernate has to load all child entities for each parent separately

677958
ubuntu	debian
they are packaged with the easy name smstools in ubuntu debian and other distros

677968
pull	push
the command-line is git s primary interface and if you aren t comfortable with the different concepts such as index push pull rebase etc. then using git from eclipse will probably confuse you even more

678002
versioning	upgrade
for the case where the user has already installed an older versioning of our application we do a major upgrade with the majorupgrade xml element

678002
versioning	upgrade
this is all working as desired if an older versioning is installed it is upgrade transparently

678013
mersenne-twister	prng	integer	unsigned
i am looking for a hashing algorithm that produces a 31 32 bit signed unsigned integer as a digest for a utf8 string with the purpose of using the output for seeding a prng such as a park-miller-carta lcg or a mersenne-twister

678055
put	get
i set the console app as startup project and put a break point in the workflow designer for the workflow being invoked this way but i get the dreaded breakpoint won t be hit symbol and indeed it s not hit

678061
cvs	svn
i have seen hundreds of developers use cvs for hundreds of projects so svn should do it fine

678063
width	height
if you don t specify a width or height of the ellipse the default values will be auto

678063
width	height
combined with the default horizontalalignment verticalaligment values of stretch this should cause the ellipse to stretch to the width and height of its container with constant stroke thickness

678063
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
i suggest you bind the width and height properties of the ellipse to a multibinding of the parent container s actualwidth and actualheight properties

678079
filesystems	fat
since perl runs just fine on multiple platforms let me warn you that fat and fat32 etc filesystems will ignore renames that only change the case of the file name

678079
filesystems	fat
this is true under windows and linux and is probably true for other platforms that support the fat filesystems

678079
filesystems	ntfs
if you will only rename files on ntfs filesystems or only on ext2 3 4 filesystems or other unix linux filesystems then you probably don t need to worry about this

678081
min	max
where min and max are the min and max sizes and a log maxcount -b

678157
cvs	svn
just add it to svn cvs or whatever you are using

678216
hash	md5
i presume cryptographic strength is not an actual requirement so that flawed but widely used hash schemes like md5 would be adequate - and readily available in many libraries

678218
rss	feed
we developed simple python cgi-scripts to manage users permissions and svn-hook scripts for email notifications and rss feed

678223
internationalization	localization
check out the localization internationalization samples here

678238
post	get
here is a post that shows it s not too difficult to get a simple workflow engine going

678239
internationalization	localization
the process of making a program ready for new languages is normally called internationalization or i18n and the process of taking that and actually making it run is localization or l10n

678289
serializable	deserialization
i m building a distributed c++ application that needs to do lots of serializable and deserialization of data stored in std containers

678309
dlsym	dlopen
i didn t try but a solution may be with dlopen dlsym and dlclose which allow you to programmatically handle dynamic libraries

678315
post	get
then when the delegate methods get called you would post notifications to the nsnotificationcenter

678326
dlsym	dlopen
i ve never used dlsym dlopen dlerror dlclose dlvsym etc. but i m looking at the man page and it gives an example of opening libm.so and extracting the cos function

678414
nsdata	nsoutputstream
you can do something similar with an nsoutputstream writing to an nsdata

678416
verilog	vhdl
i m surprised no one s mentioned register transfer language or any of the hardware description languages such as verilog or vhdl

678416
verilog	vhdl
vhdl and verilog are most commonly used for programmable logic which i think qualifies as talking straight to the hardware

678543
decoder	encoder
assuming you have a image editor you will want to be sure that people don t exploit buffer overruns due to bugs in the image encoder decoder libraries

678565
queue	fifo
consider a system where jobs are queue and processed in fifo order

678588
cvs	svn
if you used to cvs some workflows in svn are very different for example vendor branches which are non-existent in cvs because you just deleted all files in the vendor folder and copy the new version inside

678589
.htaccess	httpd.conf
in apache i can do that in httpd.conf or in .htaccess using mod_env

678664
cpu	processors
though i have high capacity servers since squid is able to use only processors core the cpu usage seems to be really high

678682
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
built in encoders on my machine vista ultimate x64 are bmp jpeg gif tiff and png. if i save an image using the imageformat.exif property i simply get the default png format

678734
queue	fifo
a fifo buffer queue

678734
queue	fifo
first of all you should have an instance of a thread-safe queue a fifo buffer for each instance of your class

678734
queue	fifo
fifo queue would enable you to simultaneously process the data in the worker thread while filling it from the communication thread

678760
rss	feed
it is a real challenge to know these blogs indivdually and i usually grab the rss feed the first time i visit and then susbcribe from within outlook

678784
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
while probably unrelated to the issue at hand note that uinavigationcontroller doesn t support pushing a uitabbarcontroller

678829
int	chars
i understand this is done to convert a chars into an int however i don t understand the logic behind it

678869
icomparable	gethashcode
ok yeah i know we have here different reference this class doesn t implement icomparable and even gethashcode is returning the different results

678870
int	chars
you had a typo here notice the s around the 3 this assigns the ascii value of the chars 3 to the chars variable then the next line takes 3 - 0 and assigns it to x because of the way ascii values work x will then be equal to 3 int value

678881
int	chars
so this will turn a digit chars code into the int value of the digit

678884
int	chars
1 a chars is really just a 8-bit int

678886
width	height
given that you re using javascript you could get the width and height of the form input you re removing create a new div with those dimensions inject it after the form element then hide the form element

678886
width	height
surround your input with a div in your html and give it an explicit width and or height in your css

678891
typemock	nmock
other mocking frameworks for .net include typemock rhinomocks nmock .etc

678909
idictionary	iequalitycomparer
if this is for use in something like an idictionary then you ll need to just create a concrete class that implements the iequalitycomparer interface

678920
int	chars
i undertand this is done to convert a chars into an int however i don t understand the logic behind it

678923
jaxp	stax
note that many java xml solutions including jaxb 2.0 stax and jdom iirc integrate nicely with jaxp and can easily be passed to and from jaxp processors

678927
post	get
so if my blog started in september 2007 but there were no post in april 2008 i could get something like this

678931
jdom	xom
also try xom which is a modern alternative to jdom

679009
put	get
this would get triggered every time i do a build because i d put it into the msbuild file for the vs.net solution

679017
skip-lists	tree
depending on the implementation array list binary tree skip-lists of the child node collection you might be able to identify the required child node with as few as 5 search steps assuming case insensitive latin letters only

679020
implements	extends	put	get
then you can simply extends cookiehandler implements put get and make it work pretty much automatically

679042
post	get
you should also ensure that once you have accepted the data from the post request instead of returning a new page in response to that request you should redirect the user to a page accessed by a get request

679044
post	get
have a read at architecture of the world wide web volume one and uris addressability and the use of http get and post by w3c

679048
post	get
if you re going to link to a get for deletion you should return a confirmation page with that get that actually does a post upon confirmation

679100
children	parent
coming from a desktop client background with no real data-driven web design experience i am studying asp.net ui design to determine the best ui pattern for parent children data

679100
children	parent
thinking i should use asp.net 2.0 i am studying the various ways of architecting a ui form which contains a master list of parent records and then showing the related children records in a second grid on the page when you click on a parent

679100
children	parent
eventually even the child records are parent to other children so i ll need to deal with that also

679100
children	parent
some of techniques i ve seen simply creates a plain old-shcool table of href links for the parent with some method call to query the children based on the selected parent while some techniques i ve seen use the asp.net 2.0 data controls to work all this out

679109
queue	fifo
they don t have to actually use a queue or other fifo structure

679196
width	height
you would have to make sure the outer div was the same width height as the inner input though perhaps by floating it left to activate the â shrink-to-fitâ behaviour that comes with floats

679206
public	protected
it is also a compile-time error if any method declared in an annotation type has a signature that is override-equivalent to that of any public or protected method declared in class object or in the interface annotation.annotation

679226
comparator	icomparer
once you ve figured that out you can go about writing your comparison in hashcode or comparator icomparer equals equatable and so on

679243
pop-up	dialog
but tree-like control flow is very useful in such cases like confirmation dialog or for pop-up like those very frequent on facebook these days

679246
put	get
when i put it outside i get the following warning

679339
width	height
however you still need to specify the width and height to opengl in glteximage2d call

679349
lisp	smalltalk	algol	smalltalk
for example on the burroughs b5000 the cpu was programmed in a variant of algol on the lisp machine the cpu executed lisp code directly on the early smalltalk workstations the cpu executed smalltalk bytecode directly

679378
jquery	scriptaculous
a very nice canvas api for programatically generating html jquery scriptaculous

679389
width	height
when measureoverride gets called the availablesize-struct is initialized with the bounds of the control but in my application it comes with inf for both width and height

679395
post	put
if you have integer ratings you put them back into the post ratings table

679395
post	get
if you associate a rating with a user and allow only one rating for a given post per user you get a natural primary key again

679406
accessor	properties
you can use guid.tobytearray to get the values as bytes but there are no accessor methods properties for the grouped bytes

679408
onchange	onblur
some browsers let you focus and select readonly fields and some even let you paste into a readonly field though they revert to the original value onblur and onchange

679442
udp	tcp
not a direct howto but i have been using an open source library called ace adaptive communication environment for all my tcp and udp socket programming and found it very useful and powerful

679485
gif	png
funny thing they re now all png images instead of gif

679491
children	parent
as for getting the number of children for each parent separately try to remove any lob fields in the child model as they will bottleneck your application speed

679511
uninstall	upgrade
if it won t uninstall properly it won t upgrade properly

679768
scheme	prolog
i only caught that because i created a prolog color scheme for notepad++ if anyone is interested i can post it online

679792
postgresql	mysql
they have created an open system for others to plug-in providers - postgresql and sqlite have it - mysql is just laggin.

679818
set	bag
instead of the set mapping you can use the bag mapping to give you an ilist

679820
inherited	properties
additionally includes properties inherited via an object s prototype chain

679847
rss	feed
i am looking to develop a webpage in html in which i need to publish the rss feed

679847
rss	feed
users will submit the rss url at one page the feed need to be displayed in a different page

679853
yacc	bison
programming language grammars are commonly represented in bnf form which can be used by tools like yacc or bison to parse source code

679859
vim	emacs
although you use emacs instead of vim so i guess you re into overkill.

679864
rss	feed
you will need to release a file to your _layouts directory coding it to spit an rss feed to the user

679864
rss	feed
maybe use a query string to decide which rss feed to read from

679875
post	get
malicious users can still create links that contain javascript to do the post and cause the same cross-site scripting problems as with get

679875
post	get
that said all the other reasons for using post over get apply crawlers and the like

679888
realloc	malloc
it is very tedious to realloc malloc the array and insert strings

679894
boost	stl
sounds like you want to use something like an stl list or boost array of char

679956
getter	setter
using inotifypropertychanged will give you the ability to have getter setter logic if you need to

679963
postgresql	mysql
any orm like sqlalchemy sqlobject or the django orm are implemented on top of db-api and i recommend using any of these over direct db-api because it can give gramps the flexibility to run sqlite in embedded mode for local desktop users and then also share sometime down the road a postgresql mysql database connection with a web based version of gramps

680022
range	max
for n in range 1 max

680030
spaces	delimiter
the following should do the necessary but it s inefficient doing two full table selects and it also relies on your exact match being delimiter by spaces

680034
versioning	upgrade
we ve recently jumped from vc++ 6 to visual studio 2005 and have since upgrade to 2008 for the latest versioning of the project that we re working on

680081
sorting	grouping
it looks like you re doing unnecessary casts for grouping and sorting

680131
int	chars
so a note to all developers using the dicom image format you need to convert the int array to a chars array before passing it to glteximage2d or just set the 7th argument to gl_rgba the later is probably not recommended

680146
rss	feed
if you view the feed in firefox it ll read like an rss reader but if you view the source code you ve got it in xml format

680183
virtualbox	parallels	vmware	virtualbox
besides wine you can get virtualbox free parallels or vmware

680185
min	max
it had a really useful feature where variables had three values a min max and current

680254
button	checkbox
of course if you have checkbox radio button you ll need to modify this to include them as well and set

680289
put	get	post	put	post	get
rest and roi treats the urls as series of nouns and it uses http methods like get post put and delete as the verbs

680293
post	get
any future get or post will look at the new state but not the message that created it

680305
post	get
to get around this limitation some sharp coders created a library called multipartposthandler which creates an openerdirector you can use with urllib2 to mostly automatically post with multipart form-data

680335
integer	fractions
you don t need the fractions part of the real number so we can convert straight to integer using only bitwise operations

680335
exponent	addition
in addition to the restriction of no negative numbers this version might have problems when the exponent goes over 19 but this should keep you good until the year 3335

680367
cpython	ironpython
the script console in that qt application doubtlessly uses plain ol cpython instead of ironpython

680382
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i ve checked the site on two machines vista with firefox ie6 ie7 ie8 safari win opera win

680473
implements	extends
you can extends distutils with your own cmd_class es which can implements new features

680526
profiling	benchmarking
i wouldn t think about doing something like this unless you ve got benchmarking profiling runs showing that there s a problem

680597
entity-relationship	diagram
proposed entity-relationship diagram

680612
post	put
you put asp.net in the question title this blog post is a good summary of the problems when using the threadstatic keyword in asp.net

680613
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort is also more complicated than mergesort especially if you want to write a really solid implementation and so if you re aiming for simplicity and maintainability merge sort becomes a promising alternative with very little performance loss

680700
cpu	hyperthreading
hyperthreading keeps track of two contexts at once in a single core exposing more parallelism to the out-of-order cpu core

680706
processors	hyperthreading
in hyperthreading multiple threads can run on the same processors that is the context-switch time between these multiple threads is very small

680706
processors	hyperthreading
server processors nowadays implement hyperthreading along with multi-processors

680709
put	get
but once i put it on a server and in production mode i get this error

680713
ant	maven
run tests from command line can be integrated into ant maven

680713
jasmine	qunit	jasmine	mocha	mocha	qunit

680713
ant	maven
run tests from command line can be integrated into ant maven

680713
emacs	textmate
textmate and emacs integration

680713
hudson	bamboo
it does however output xunit xml reports so it should be easy to integrate with hudson bamboo or other ci servers

680717
mapserver	mapxtreme
we have done mapserver php-mapscript postgis projects but we are moving towards dotnet solutions using mapxtreme mapinfo ms sql 2008

680718
cpu	hyperthreading
you can find some interesting articles about dual cpu multi-core and hyperthreading on intel s website or in a short article from yale university

680741
ironruby	ironpython
for example there are silverlight applications using ironpython ironruby

680766
put	get
since experienced programmers tend to get a gut feel for a project s size even if they wouldn t put it in writing i thought i d pose the question to so

680773
getter	setter
the getter setter is calling itself

680774
pull	push
it is possible to use filemaker s instant web publishing as a web service that your app can then push and pull data through

680776
getter	setter
the setter is calling itself when it should be setting some private field - by the looks of it the getter will do the same since your example doesn t contain any fields

680828
multicastdelegate	delegation
they are not part of the delegation or multicastdelegate type definition

680846
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
the cpan toolchain only ever cares about the latest versioning of a module and may upgrade your installation when it sees you have an earlier versioning

680907
dictionary	map
when i say i prefer a library without a dictionary i mean those full blown dictionary which map each and every word

681011
packets	pcap
i need a program which prints the number of packets in a capture file which uses the pcap format

681029
background-color	transparency
i did find the method document.defaultview.getcomputedstyle element pseudoelt but on a 1 pixel div with no background-color it returned transparency

681041
put	get
now you have to get the contents of the result and put them in a string

681059
folder	directory
i ve made an additional sources folder in the project directory the file in question is in both it and the bin file for the project and it still can t find it

681079
expander	grid
i m using expanders a lot in my project and if you drop them into a grid dockpanel then the expander will fill all available space assuming it s vertical horizontal orientations are set to stretch

681122
lemmatization	stemming
if you re looking for the corresponding stemming of a word as you would find it in a dictionary along with information on the part of speech you should google for lemmatization

681143
qmainwindow	qwidget
mainwindow mainwindow qwidget parent qmainwindow parent

681183
webrat	cucumber
i m writing cucumber tests for a sinatra based application using webrat

681191
post	get
may be more work but if you get it to work post it to the community i m sure they could use it too if somebody has not done anything for it yet

681199
hide	show
since you have not mentioned the conditions in which you wish to show hide particular columns the below code is an example of the possible way

681223
translation	localization
catalyst is a standalone translation memory and localization engine that can be used in your build process and is used by many large software companies

681244
dlsym	dlopen
in linux i don t know about windows you can use dlopen to open the library dlsym to obtain the symbol and call it

681336
mouse	keyboard
as i recall there were also issues with getting mouse and keyboard events in a timely manner

681336
mouse	keyboard
we used direct keyboard and mouse access rather than depending on the message loop because the message loop was often too slow and sometimes would cause us to lose information

681364
jobs	cron
i don t remember all the details but i do recall reading people who used cron jobs to keep at least one process alive to avoid this lag that can occur with passenger needed to reload the environment

681368
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
my problem is ie6 7 renders it differently than firefox safari ie8 and google-chrome that all render it correctly

681425
folder	directory
- allow physical access to the folder structure of the reportserver virtual directory to everyone

681461
integer	fractions
note that allowing fractions values will give you a higher objective value than only allowing 0 or 100 so no integer solution will do any better than 14.25 or 14 for that matter since the objective value has to be an integer

681461
subtract	add
note that when you create the subproblem where you must pick an item just subtract its price from the budget and add the value to the profit now you have a smaller problem to solve

681503
firefox	safari
many people including myself would argue having even a moderately decent browser ie7 onwards firefox or safari is would be a worthwhile thing for any business

681504
firefox	safari
we actually have a bunch of legacy applications on our intranet some written in house others that we quite a lot of money for which don t work well on ie7 or ie8 or firefox or safari or ...

681564
opml	feed
i would consolidate these top feed into an opml file

681564
opml	feed
you could also write a quick web part to parse the opml file and download the top n posts from each feed

681595
width	height
a uniformgrid is a panel that layouts its children in a regular grid every item has the same width every item has the same height

681682
put	get
2 all those web.config files can get tough to maintain if you re not careful about what values you put in each

681684
width	height
ie6 and ie7 don t scale images nicely in web pages when the images are scaled with css width height or attribute width height

681754
post	get
consider wrapping each row in it s own ajaxform or using jquery to do the update via ajax then passing the data required for the action via the route values or form values in the ajax get post

681760
trie	dawg
it is a structure similar to but twice as space-efficient as the dawg that is more efficient than the trie which only compresses prefixes

681766
ssl	https
the way to go is enabling ssl on your domain and doing the xmlhttprequest to the https of the remote service

681772
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
in java if an input argument to a method is invalid we can throw an illegalargumentexception which is of type runtimeexception

681807
ucfirst	capitalize
i m looking for a groovy equivalent of perl s ucfirst .. or apache commons stringutils.capitalize str the latter capitalize the first letter of all words in the input string

681825
getter	setter
and it generates the persongen class for you containing getter setter etc

681836
happy	alex
it s a python parser implemented in haskell using the happy parser generator and alex lexer generator

681853
cpython	ironpython
both of these seem to have downsides in that python for .net is not under active development as far as i can tell and you lose some features available in cpython if you use ironpython

681865
cpython	ironpython
there is a project called ironclad that is helping to open access to cpython extensions from ironpython it may be helpful

681872
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
furthermore all thread synchronization locks monitor readerwriterlock mutex semaphone autoresetevent manualresetevent etc. call interlocked methods internally

681875
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython is currently one of the .net 5 being developed by the language team c# vb.net f# ironpython and ironruby so i doubt that there s another open source .net python project that s gone anywhere near as far

681944
merb	ruby-on-rails
ruby had ruby-on-rails merb

681984
ienumerable	ilist
usually for me the choice between ienumerable or ilist usually ends up being whichever is easier to implement in the standard case

682018
ienumerable	ilist
you can still use linq to query against an ilist or ienumerable

682018
ienumerable	iqueryable
if lazy loading is a requirement then go with ienumerable or iqueryable

682033
rss	feed
it uses parsexml to load the rss feed

682033
rss	feed
for the following rss feed example i am having trouble getting it to load the feed

682042
post	get
my controller action accepts both get and post so that wasn t it

682083
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
when a command that takes 30 seconds or 4 minutes in svn instead takes 1 or 2 seconds in git or mercurial or bazaar it is a huge difference to a developer

682088
floor	sqrt
a simple modification also lets you quickly calculate floor sqrt x instead of the closest integer

682131
stateless	stateful
you must implement your ejb stateless in that it doesn t hold any instance variable which itself holds a stateful value like persistence context

682177
ienumerable	ilist
ilist t implements ienumerable t so all of the linq-related use cases still work but you lose the lazy evaluation

682215
queue	fifo
it appears that what you have here is a fifo queue implemented in a file and you re depending on the consumer s ability to process data faster than the producer can create it

682216
mvp	presenter
presenter first is a software development approach that combines the ideas of the model view presenter mvp design pattern and test-driven development

682251
width	height
according to the swf documentation from adobe you should be able to read the individual bytes of a swf to calculate the files size file dimensions width and height version and file type swf or swc

682256
mp3	m3u
if all else fails you could create m3u files mp3 playlists from your song sources and start winamp via process.start passing the newly created playlist

682257
hide	show
you ll have to control the tooltip yourself using the show and hide methods if you want any control over how and where it is positioned using the 2.0 framework unless you want to get into window s api calls

682257
hide	show
and the msdn documentation on using the tooltip s show and hide methods is actually fairly decent

682274
ssl	https
i have a wss 3.0 system using ssl where every page is supposed to be served as https

682274
put	get
in those cases i have to put the s in by hand to get the page to load

682321
put	get
couple this knowledge with the get and put principle in section 2.4 from java generics and collections

682321
put	get
the get and put principle use an

prepare	execute
basically i use a prepare statement and create and execute some dynamic sql in this search sp

682351
equals	gethashcode
to circumvent this override equals and gethashcode in your mixed in type

682416
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
keep in mind that on case-remembering filesystems fat ntfs you ll need to rename the file to something else first then to the case change

682443
hash	salt
on the other hand i m not really sure why you would want to restrict the length of passwords unless there s a hard database limit which there shouldn t be since you shouldn t be storing passwords in plain text in the database but instead hashing them down to something fixed size using a secure hash algorithm with a salt

682458
ienumerable	ienumerator
i can reach both ienumerable and ienumerator interfaces in delphi 6

682468
ubuntu	linux
on linux ubuntu operating system controls the maximum size

682484
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in all browsers that i ve checked it in google-chrome firefox safari but ie8 adds a bunch of extra white space after the image which causes a horizontal scroll bar

682493
allocator	stl
note that the vector performs heap allocator to hold the actual data so it is likely to only contain a few pointers or a pointer and couple of lengths but it may contain whatever your compiler s stl implementation needs it to

682508
post	get
assuming you re using the net http library you can do a postback by just replacing your get with a post my_http.post my_url instead of my_http.get my_url

682572
hash	md5
hash is an md5 hash that is static for each rule

682591
hide	show
it s faster and more readable if you just do this again after you show hide the inner table

682602
hide	show
why don t you just always include the review comment form and use client side code to show or hide it

682611
dictionary	map
i have written a erlang code to find the timings for inserting fetching date into various data structures like list dictionary queue set and parallel map of the data structures

682617
hash	salt
but for a real world int32 hash rather than a mapping of pairs of integers to integers you re probably better off with a bit manipulation such as bob jenkin s mix and calling that with x y and a salt

682621
hide	show
the easiest way to do this i think is to create a simple html file and use javascript to show hide different bits of it

682641
rss	feed
treat php as a templating engine and have all the main pages pull the html marked up or xml articles from an rss feed from one site

682691
puts	gets
obviously git gets confused and puts invalid from linux s perspective filenames

682739
apache	lighttpd
finally comparing apache to other popular open-source servers such as lighttpd would show you what tasks are approached in a similar way by different programs and where there are trade-offs speed vs

682799
folder	directory
i tried changing the directory with os.chdir to reduce the folder trail lengths but when i try using os.system with .. folder filename it apparently can t handle relative path names

682801
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
further interlocked methods force cache coherency and all of the synchronization concepts monitor readerwriterlock mutex semaphore autoresetevent manualresetevent etc. call interlocked methods internally and thus ensure cache coherency

682816
trie	tree
if you are trying to optimize looking up a list of strings with a given prefix you might want to take a look at implementing a trie not to be mistaken with a regular tree data structure in c#

682829
gtk	gdk	gtk	cairo	gdk	cairo
the simplest combination would be cairo + pango + gdk the windowing part of gtk

682863
nofollow	noindex
currently i use the html meta tag robots - noindex nofollow to solve the problem

682878
udp	tcp
that function reinitializes all the sub-modules tcp udp smtp etc.

682878
udp	tcp
it will also clobber all of the tcp and udp socket you have open so you will have to re-open the sockets you want to use

682933
post	get
i still don t get the viewstate saved across post backs - thinking it s a bug in asp.net

682938
ant	maven
the build process is based on ant scripts and not maven

682959
gridview	objectdatasource
i use a gridview to bind using a objectdatasource using the datasource property

683028
joomla	typo3
i didn t work with these applications yet but afaik typo3 and ezpublish both php are considered much more professional than joomla

683045
hide	show
just remember that cells are reused if you call tableview dequeuereusablecellwithidentifier which you should do so you ll have to explicitly show hide control whose visibility may have been changed

683061
profiler	vtune
i believe this is what vtune a phenomenal profiler for this level uses

683081
for-loop	loops
another thing i d like to point out in c# you can delcare your int variable use in a for-loop right inside loops

683084
ant	cruisecontrol
describes a setup for integrating qtp with ant and cruisecontrol

683095
versioning	upgrade
this file contains one or more xsl transformations that upgrade documents targeting earlier schema versioning

683150
public	protected
well now foo can t be protected so it s public

683158
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
autoresetevent manualresetevent

683162
folder	directory
if this doesn t work you have to install iis and set a virtual directory directly on your development folder

683164
accessor	properties
i don t have any definitive answers creating a method properties accessor that isn t mapped and that returns a default null-object if the actual address is null

683204
stringbuilder	stringwriter
if you really want to write into memory pass in a stringwriter or a stringbuilder like this

683294
margin	text-align
wrap it all in a div with margin auto and make body have text-align center

683362
getter	setter
setter and getter are forbidden

683397
width	height
if you re using an embedded asset the width height properties are available immediately on the source object

683440
hide	show
setting the class to twocolumn hide the middle column and setting the class to threecolumn show the middle column

683444
inherited	properties
i would say that the standard approach here is to wrap the class you want to inherited as a protected instance variable and then emulate all the non-private members method properties events etc. of the wrapped class in your container class

683485
children	parent
also i would really rather the object s parent be bound before the children are constructed

683507
width	height
modifying this string you can get to print on any paper size and any orientation switching height and width for landscape but the report itself must be configured in the same page layout

683524
treemap	linkedhashmap
i suggest a linkedhashmap or a treemap

683524
treemap	linkedhashmap	comparator	comparable
a linkedhashmap keeps the keys in the order they were inserted while a treemap is kept sorted via a comparator or the natural comparable ordering of the elements

683524
treemap	linkedhashmap	put	get
treemap has o log n performance for containskey get put and remove according to the javadocs while linkedhashmap is o 1 for each

683582
stdout	stderr
you are accumulating open file handles see ulimit -n setrlimit rlimit_nofile rlimit_ofile and you ultimately hit a 2048 open file descriptors limit 2045 + stdin + stdout + stderr .

683610
stdout	stderr
this will increase the number of files each process can have open to 10003 remember that you always start with three open stdin stdout and stderr

683642
wxpython	pyqt
check pyqt gtk or wxpython libraries

683642
notepad++	gedit	kate	gedit
notepad++ idle kate gedit ..

683642
post	get
urllib and urllib2 httpâ scripting like downloading post get resquests etc

683693
inherited	properties
another option is to use an inherited attached properties

683711
move	drag
example user resizes it to a smaller chunk by mouse weal then move it by using drag n drop

683723
range	max	range	min	min	max
use a double slider with a min and max display range

683740
stdout	stderr
also the allocconsole attachconsole methods are funny in that if you run your program from the command line or a batch file and try to redirect the output stdout and or stderr to a file it wil not work - it will not go to the file

683854
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
c implementations discussed in the context of character arrays as c dynamic string length used malloc realloc and free but these should be avoided in c++ code

683866
put	get
- when the user click on the bookmarklet it will send to my server the url then my server will get back to the client page with the scrapping javascript files which will load with the iframe load the java script will scrap the data on the current page and put on the iframe

683867
for-loop	loops
you can use msdn as a reference on how to use a for-loop or a for each loops if you haven t learned for loops yet you can also use a do loops

683908
required	placeholder
the .net built-in serialization is an option but it does required you to add placeholder on the specific pieces that you want to extend in the future

683909
client-side	server-side
bottom line is it s a measure of your client-side server-side skills against the bandwidth and server load considerations

683921
classname	inherited
first of all you can write everything including c# code in a single .ascx file and inherited from whatever class you want to that ultimately inherited from usercontrol by specifying inherited attribute or you might want to omit it and without a classname attribute

683923
hide	show
anyhow you probably don t want to do a show hide widget like this

683930
free	realloc
if the address of a local variable is passed to realloc it may attempt to free its memory and allocate it elsewhere

683944
int	double
i created a subroutine one using a double float it returns 2 int values

683966
inherited	properties
even if you don t use code behind class you can still inherited properties from base control

683970
put	get
if you put the point on the first line and hit m-q you get this

684011
inherited	properties
you can create a class that inherited from system.windows.forms.nativewindow which provides basic message loop capability and reference the handle properties in its constructor to create its handle and hook it into the message loop

684088
width	height
i got this idea from php image where the construct either receives one argument a path or 2 arguments a width and height

684115
webkit	gecko
the only practical difference to browsers between strict and transitional is that strict triggers standards mode and transitional triggers almost standards mode in gecko presto webkit etc

684168
width	height
i d suggest you use smaller width and height values

684170
maven	pom.xml
but to use any super pom.xml you need to have your flex maven project declare the super pom.xml as the parent with a block similar to this

684202
getter	setter
you can automate the generation of javadoc comments for getter setter from eclipse via the code templates to save on the amount of documentation you have to write

684220
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
tested on safari firefox and opera osx

684331
awt	swing
jfc swing architecture is different from awt architecture

684331
swt	swing	awt	swing
there are several differences but the most significant is awt uses native code to render widgets so does swt while swing is light weight because all the is painted using java

684333
width	height
the control is of a particular width and will be up to 2 lines in height

684342
accessor	properties
if you picked this up from the msdn docs on the function take another look - the text properties example that they give is retrieving the text value from one of its child controls which means that the properties accessor needs to make sure the child controls exist

684350
serializable	deserialization
but its serializable deserialization works quite well like

684378
min	max
it will probably work strangely if your min max values are not the same as your min max values for the slider i would suggest just using min values 0 max values values.length - 1 as your min max options on the slider then you should always be safe

684425
put	get
the problem is that the list doesn t get ordered and the distance method doesn t get fired i put a breakpoint in there but doesn t get hit

684456
vim	emacs
i was using vim so there may be other dependencies gotchas that are emacs specific but i m pretty sure a terminal that supports 256 colours is important

684474
disk	ram
writing solaris device drivers in java covers a a ram disk device written in java

684483
g++	gcc
gcc g++ is indeed the compiler of choice

684497
button	checkbox
if the user clicks the button i must recolect the checkbox selected inside the checklistbox and do some processing

684518
rss	feed
.net has a class to parse atom and rss feed

684537
put	get
put the grid and a get string rowname string colname method in a class if you want a cleaner api

684544
awt	swing
i suggest looking at swingtimer set a swing timer to notify you every few ms and that notification will come in on the awt thread so that you can use it to click your button then just exit and wait for the next timer event

684625
pull	push
i added logging into the functions used for push pull operations during transfer - they are not ever called for any of the calls that fail this way

684656
hex	binary
it is actually stored as 0x000f in hex which is the same as 0000 0000 0000 1111 in binary

684687
floyd-warshall	dijkstra
as j _ random _ hacker mentions floyd-warshall is o n 3 time and o n 2 storage no matter if you are only calculating transitive closure or not and using dijkstra s algorithm requires an o nlog n calculation for each query

684694
freebsd	linux
get your code to compile on linux on freebsd and on windows

684735
hash	md5
in other words there is a technique for constructing multiple byte sequences with the same md5 hash without having to use the brute force method of trial and error where on average you d expect to have to try about 2 64 or 16 billion billion files before hitting on a collision

684735
hash	md5
if you re not concerned about the case where somebody might deliberately try to fool your duplicate identification and you re just worried about the chances of a duplicate hash by chance then md5 is absolutely fine

684760
pull	push
ssh+ease of pull push in windows

684816
unix	bsd
also the bsd platform is not easiest of the unix family to begin from zero

684838
int	chars
the first parameter is of type chars for the data to be written and the second is of type int asking for the size of data to be written to the binary file

684923
cpu	processors
in some processors the hardware team might only have connected a chip select from the cpu to a device and leave it up to you to decide what address triggers that select pin

684923
hex	binary
but you still need a raw binary image often in a hex format suitable for a prom programmer of some form so you will need to use the objcopy utility from binutil to transform the linker output to a suitable format

684932
versioning	upgrade
artinsoft wrote the built in vb.net upgrade wizard this is their improved versioning

684932
vb.net	vb6
and codearchitects was founded by francesco balena who wrote some of the classic books on vb6 and vb.net

684948
post	get
i won t go into huge detail on an old post but if you want to know more add a comment and i ll get back to you

684965
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
everything seems to work for most of the popular browsers opera firefox safari all work fine

684972
google-chrome	firefox
from what i saw in firefox and google-chrome the color of the text cursor in an input field changes to the value of the color css property

684983
keydown	keyup
i m using keyboard events keydown and keyup to detect exactly when the user presses or releases the shift key

685025
ethernet	wireless
suppose i am using three ethernet connections and one wireless also

685066
width	height
viewport sizes width and height of buffer image texture etc.

685078
ironruby	ironpython
for example there are silverlight applications using ironpython ironruby

685140
jar	war
make sure you program project is divided into modules under a common umbrella module so that each module produces a single binary artifact jar war ... possibly accompanied by the javadoc of the source code behind that artifact a zip with the source code etc

685140
maven	pom.xml
now you can create the parent maven module pom.xml with artifact type pom.xml consisting of one of the modules below

685158
ready	each
for each frame i check its ready state

685195
profiling	debugging
user memory profiling to debugging and optimize your web application

685210
tapestry	appfuse	jsf	tapestry	appfuse	spring
take a look at appfuse it s a quick-starter for java web application provided with different frameworks tapestry spring mvc struts2 jsf + hibernate hibatis

685240
put	get
if you re trying to do normal c++ development put as little as you can get away with in the header as it means client code doesn t depend on too many implementation details

685253
children	parent
children in the hierarchy need to have just one parent

685271
websphere	ibm
i am using ibm websphere application server v6 and java 1.4 and am trying to write large csv files to the servletoutputstream for a user to download

685319
pull	push
thus i have one branch and i commit push once i leave a computer pull once i sit down at the next

685340
hide	show
and just in case you insist on an answer show a window with the image in it then hide the window when you feel the user has waited long enough.

685402
int	chars
the size of int datatypes chars hellip

685421
fink	macports
build your own python or use fink or macports if you want completion

685432
firefox	safari
all is well in firefox pc mac but safari pc mac and 3 versions of ie 6 7 8 are not playing ball - please read on.

685432
hide	show
i m using simple jquery show and hide and the first content is set to show as default

685442
int	boolean
in c# like in java i think boolean and numbers are two different things you can only use boolean in if statements there is not implicit conversion if you use an int it won t compile

685526
inline	inlining
but if draw_line et al are defined in a header file rather than in a source cpp file you may have methods which are supposedly declared as inline in the header file which aren t actually properly inlining

685591
datarow	dataview
use dataview and .select wherever you find yourself looping through datarow objects

685596
curb	libcurl
- curb libcurl for ruby

685598
komodo	scite
if you still need a ruby editor on windows use komodo edit or scite

685614
free	malloc
no stack allocation does not call malloc free

685616
free	malloc
stack allocation doesn t use anything like malloc free

685624
free	alloca
a well-done alloca will only require a scant few instructions and there is no cost or even a need to free it when you re done

685633
aptana	radrails
but it is actively developed as part of aptana radrails though

685653
free	malloc
so stack allocation doesn t malloc free

685658
stdout	stderr
likely that you just need to read the stdout and stderr of the process or it will hang since its output buffer is full

685658
stdout	stderr
this is easiest if you redirect stderr to stdout just to be safe

685680
getter	setter
keywords are in english naming conventions like for example getter setter are also english same for standard names for design patterns

685794
dictionary	map
dictionary map a unique key to a value

685798
switching	screens
it applies only when applications go to full screens and then switching back to window or terminate

685798
switching	screens
so it does not seem to be related to resolution switching because i ve seen application games that even when they are not in the same resolution as desktop when they switching back windows on desktop are restored as they once were before the full screens application was run

685800
free	malloc
and it would make sense for those whole-stack blocks to be allocated using the same heap management as is exposed through malloc free

685800
free	malloc
a whole stack is malloc -ed all in one go when a thread starts up and then it gets suballocated from and then it gets free -d in one go

685801
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome safari if your stylesheet link is busted all of your links might end up red

685850
ora-00911	oracle
when i try to execute them against oracle it gives me this error ora-00911 invalid character

685862
rss	feed
what is the best way to develop a widget from a rss feed

685926
hash	md5
one way hash with md5 or sha1 are a way of adding a layer of security at the db level

685934
free	malloc
i would think it would be difficult for .net to free considering in c++ you need to know if it was allocated with new malloc mm_malloc before you can correctly free it

685980
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
whether it is options i can add onto the sqldatasource things i can do to the sql query or use an alternative such as an objectdatasource

685990
put	get
it is only going to work with the data that you get from it meaning you should optimize your sql or the data put into it before sending it off to sql meaning you should optimize your application code

685997
rss	feed
there s tons of free libraries for php that consume rss feed

685997
rss	feed
1 i m wishing to aggregate some top items from up to 3 different rss feed into one stream for consumption

686003
tcplistener	tcpclient
the use of tcpclient and tcplistener just means a few less lines of code

686015
width	margin
the resulting margin width is the maximum of the adjoining margin widths

686053
google-chrome	firefox
i ve searched and found methods to focus and position my caret at the end of the updated input content and google-chrome and ie behave themselves and auto scroll to show the cursor in the visible area of the input box but when the text input is full and overflows firefox 3.0.7 leaves the correctly positioned caret out of view to the right though if you press right arrow on keyboard you can get to it without disturbing the position

686093
public	protected
if it s protected or public both work

686138
innodb	myisam
for instance myisam is widely held to be faster at selects than innodb

686138
innodb	myisam
it s better on writes than myisam and also innodb never needs to be repaired.

686213
pop-up	dialog
i have an application which has an asynchronous operation built into it that loops over a large number of items and performs lengthy calculations on each item as this occurs certain conditions will cause the application to pop-up a modal dialog for user input

686257
button	checkbox
alternatively you would have to create a button or checkbox that the user selects

686273
fileinputstream	filechannel
using filereader or fileinputstream won t work - you ll have to use either filechannel or randomaccessfile to loop through the file backwards from the end

686290
inherited	properties
now borrowing constructor is only another pattern to make a sort of inherited so i could not use prototype and so all the chain superclass properties are

686296
integer	unsigned
for example it looks for an unsigned byte that denotes a type of message being sent followed by an unsigned integer that denotes the length of message then another unsigned byte which is really a bit field with some flags set or unset and etc.

686296
integer	unsigned
i m just wondering how to reliably generate this data and make sure i m sending it correctly that i m really sending an unsigned byte rather than say a signed integer or worse a string

686303
int	chars
you couldn t even have a pointer to it because i recently got told some platforms use pointers of different size for chars than for int or long

686332
folder	directory
to make it accessible on the network all you have to do is go to iisâ create new virtual directoryâ point to the above folder and remove anonymous access from directory settings page

686379
inherited	properties
by calling .call you don t inherited in the classical sense of the word instead you tell child to apply parents prototype onto itself and thus child.prototype has cloned properties and methods from parent

686410
hash	md5
just take the first 8 digits of the md5 hash

686410
hash	md5
this works because md5 is uniformly distributed over its hash address space

686410
hash	md5
this means that any consecutive sequence of md5 hash digits will itself be a uniformly distributed hash

686454
floating-point	fractions
a binary floating-point number is actually represented by three integers a sign bit s a significand or coefficient fractions b and an exponent e

686458
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu fix this by defining the normal actions the average user would expect in the global etc zsh zshrc file

686458
ubuntu	debian
following the relevant code it is the same on debian and ubuntu

686458
ubuntu	debian
so if you are connecting to a debian or ubuntu box you don t have to do anything

686458
ubuntu	debian
the solution is of course to add the lines from the debian ubuntu zshrc to your own .zshrc

686458
freebsd	linux
i can set my terminal type to linux in putty and connect to freebsd servers without problems

686482
public	protected
i have succeeded in accessing all private fields excluding those which are inherited as well as all of the public and protected inherited fields

686510
allocator	stl
use stl if leads to performance problems exchange with homebrew container or allocator didn t come to it yet but i m not doing a high-end 3d game

686550
inherited	properties
i haven t tried it but you should be able to access the base type private members through the type.basetype properties and recursively accumulate all the private fields through the inherited hierarchy

686560
actualheight	actualwidth
try using the actualheight and actualwidth properties

686622
button	checkbox
i m designing a website for the high end mobile phones and i want to know how the different ui elements button checkbox list boxes textfields etc look like on different mobile browsers eg safari webkit ie etc on different devices nokia iphone etc

686667
switching	screens
when switching back to desktop resolution i would enumwindows again but with a different callback which sets each of the running application windows position and size with setwindowpos using the list of rects i ve saved before switching to full screens

686695
allocator	stl
you can also swap the allocator in stl containers for a custom one

686717
rss	feed
i am parsing rss feed with the format as specified here

686793
gtk	motif
this also explains why swing needs all those ui components that do the actual painting to mimic a specific look and feel windows gtk motif etc.

686882
width	height
i want to set the height width of only that frame and i do not want to try and pixelify its children

686882
width	height
i want both of them to take 100 height and let the tree take 30 and textarea take 70 width if the tree is expanded to 10 levels then i am ok with scrollpane

686882
width	height
just say height 100 and width to be 30 etc and we are done

686894
width	height
clearly the div s marked v.div must expand to fill variable height and width

686906
filtering	grouping
according the analysis in the article even if you separate out an interface by which you can communicate with gpl d software on the command line you should do that as a clean room implementation with one grouping that works with the gpl d code one grouping that implements the other software and all specs passing between them being filtering by lawyers

686982
width	height
the padding on the #variablesize would have to be equal to or greater than the width height of the images

686997
listview	gridview
return that list to the gridview or listview to display

686997
listview	gridview
this way your listview or gridview won t be tightly coupled to the method that you are retrieving your data

687007
mvp	presenter
consider implementing mvp model view presenter pattern

687007
getter	setter
your codebehind of aspx page is then just connector of events and getter setter of properties

687028
temp	tmp
and it looks like more cross platform way to create temp files then explicitly put them into tmp

687102
put	get
if i could put them in a temp table i could use the results effectively but i can t figure out how to get them in a temp table

687110
accessor	properties
it would be better to make a properties or accessor to retrieve it than directly provide public access to the by default private button field member

687154
jqmodal	thickbox
also check out jqmodal for a little newer plugin with some features thickbox lacks like callbacks

687183
fancybox	simplemodal
we ve used both simplemodal and fancybox and had good results

687212
wxruby	wxformbuilder
then wxwidgets wxruby has the wxformbuilder

687300
width	height
animate height and width to auto

687323
udp	tcp
quartz composer however supports opensoundcontrol which allows you to send named parameters floats ints and strings over a udp or tcp connection

687344
getter	setter
automatic getter and setter

687349
accessor	properties
in c# 3.0 and later auto-implemented properties make property-declaration more concise when no additional logic is required in the properties accessor

687349
accessor	properties
they also enable client code to create objects when you declare a properties as shown in the following example the compiler creates a private anonymous backing field that can only be accessed through the properties s get and set accessor

687354
pop-up	dialog
excel 2007 will pop-up a dialog informing you that the file extension does not match the file content

687507
post	get
if you post an example of your code i think you ll get a better answer

687548
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfect on ie and google-chrome from the web server and when debugging locally but firefox just works when debugging locally and not from the web server in the web server clat and clong return nan

687576
rss	feed
if you have a small enough team using adequately svn commit comments and exploit them a tool that generates an rss feed like trac for instance can be an easy and efficient way to promote communication

687576
rss	feed
- ensure everybody actually reads better even keeps posted to through an rss reader the feed

687602
mouseover	mouseout
on my website each menu button has it s corners rounded using the dd_roundies library and has mouseover mouseout and onclick handlers assigned via jquery

687602
mouseover	mouseout
the most obvious problem is that the background that is applied on mouseover is square not round and on some occasions the background doesn t disappear after you click on on a menu item and then mouseout

687604
rss	feed
it is very good at reading rss feed

687633
hide	show
i m working with course management system moodle and in the admin the folder tree which uses folder icons displays for about a second the alt attribute given in this case open folder then it hide and show the image when the image is ready

687675
pop-up	dialog
i know how to open a webpage in a new window and add javascript so the print dialog pop-up

687676
hash	md5
another option would be to compute a fixed-length hash from the file path using an inexpensive hash function such as md5 though md5 is not strong enough to use for passwords it s strong enough to ensure uniqueness given the input data in this case

687696
pascal	delphi
i compile and test most of my delphi components and libraries also with free pascal

687704
hide	show
i think you may need to call a dialog show and hide to get it to appear and disappear

687766
viewdidload	viewwillappear
when i add the viewcontroller from the nib the viewdidload gets hit the images load from the nib but then the controller code stops there no viewwillappear etc

687767
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried in google-chrome and firefox

687785
children	parent
one of my csla object let s say parent has many children let s call them children - a list of child

687785
children	parent
parent is a editable root businessbase and children is an editable child list businesslistbase and child is editable child

687786
ironruby	ironpython
the dlr is not script specific so over time more script languages will be built on top of it but at the moment the ones i know about are ironruby ironpython and jscript

687788
udp	tcp
it is mostly tcp but it does include a section on how to alter the code to use udp instead

687790
rdfstore	allegrograph
allegrograph rdfstore

687813
g++	gcc
i use gcc g++

687831
subtraction	addition
it looks like combinations of addition subtraction and testing at least are possible on the hardware

687879
vbscript	jscript
the way to do this used to be the windows script host which permitted you to host either jscript or vbscript

687881
folder	directory
you could launch the packages each with a different configuration or configurations pointing to different working directory input folder etc

687895
hide	show
if you want a lazier answer you could use javascript and hide the div when you click on the map and show it when you close the map

687902
ia-32	x86
at present both should both work for ia-32 x86 x86-32 and x86-64 amd64 environments correctly

687918
min	max
also orderby.first is the same as min and orderbydescending.first is the same as max

687948
terminate	timeout
will terminate at the earlier of the two tlrbsf program termination or timeout elapsed

687953
equals	gethashcode
if you want to use a custom key type then you should consider implementing iequatable and overriding equals object and gethashcode unless the default reference or struct equality is sufficient for determining equality of keys

687992
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome but fails miserably in ie6

687995
post	get
if i do a left join to get the parent post on all rows and then sort by that date first all the original post group together as they d have a value of null

687995
post	get
if two people create a post at the same time comments on the two post would get munged together as they d have the same timestamp

getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
see getelementbyid getelementsbytagname for targeting

688038
aptana	radrails
aptana ide with the radrails plugin would have to be the best choice

688045
put	get
how much memory can i put into my machine until i get to the point where the os hits its limit

688053
boost	stl
can i put stl and boost headers there even though they have templates

688091
boost	stl
the quick answer the stl and boost headers do indeed belong in the precompiled header file even though these header files define template classes

688091
boost	stl
the reason is this - the generation of the precompiled header can take a long time because the boost stl and windows libraries are very large

688127
subtract	add
of course you ll have to add subtract one --- or just put undefined as the first element

688135
disk	ram
+1 trick you should use a ram disk download to accelerate i o

688135
disk	ram
vs.net makes tons of i o calls and ram disk are much faster than real disk

688135
disk	ram
if you turn off your computer ram disk disappers

688136
rss	feed
the hashtags are in the content title nodes within the rss feed

688136
rss	feed
if you look at the rss feed and then view the html source my struggle might be clearer

688249
addclass	removeclass
your best bet would be to addclass and removeclass on the row

688265
switching	screens
note if you only see half a screens worth you re character encoding is not unicode unicode characters cover several screens type set encoding utf-8 to switching to utf-8

688274
docx	.doc	apache-poi	docx4j
you could use docx4j or indeed just apache-poi to read the docx and apache-poi to write it out as a .doc

688302
vim	emacs
i have gotten to know my way around a few programming languages and i d like to try my hand at making a command-line text editor -- something that runs in the terminal like vim emacs nano but is pure text no guis please

688333
apache-poi	docx4j
if you must work with .doc docx4j has rudimentary conversion using apache-poi hwpf

688343
daemons	systemd
on unix operating systemd it is common practice to â œlockâ a program often a daemons by use of a special lock file the pid file

688348
urwid	ncurses
i would recommend the excellent urwid toolkit - it s much easier to use than straight ncurses

688359
user-controls	tabcontrol
i am trying to get zindexing working on a custom user-controls but it clips the bottom of the control when it pops up inside a tabcontrol as shown

688368
apache-poi	docx4j
docx4j or apache-poi both of which are asl v2

688387
post	get
the situation is that you have to work with an image api and you have to make a post request to get an image stream that you want to display in the rest of your web page

688391
doc	rtf	itext	docx4j
if you can go from doc to docx then you could use docx4j to generate rtf using itext or fop i haven t tested the rtf output of either itext or fop so i m not sure how they ll handle tables

688391
apache-poi	docx4j
as to going from doc to docx docx4j has a basic proof of concept of this using apache-poi s hwpf

688393
udp	tcp
if that s the case and you need synchronous communication you can definitely use tcp sockets or just udp

688409
int	chars
the extracts can be obtained in cpu-endianness-independent way by using the right shift operation against the int values and casting the result by the byte type such as unsigned chars

688421
post	get
you ll need something else like what vrish88 suggests so that you can make a get request to the destroy action to get a form then post that form to actually delete the phone number

688448
stdout	stderr
redirect the standard streams stdin stdout stderr since a daemon process no longer has a controlling terminal

688479
disk	ram
ram disk were useful when operating systems were built with limitations such as stupid caches win 3.x win 95 dos

688479
disk	ram
the ram disk advantage is near zero and if you assign a lot of ram it will suck memory available to the system cache manager hurting overall system performance

688507
int	chars
the data array is an array of unsigned chars not unsigned int

688509
free	malloc
if you never add a constructor destructor assignment operators or virtual functions to your structure using malloc free for allocation is safe

688509
free	malloc
unfortunately c++ does not provide a good mechanism to do this so you often end up with such malloc free hacks in real world applications

688510
disk	ram
while i didn t do this for compiling i did do it for similar processes and i ended up using a ram disk with scripts that automated the synchronization

688510
disk	ram
to start development start the ram disk and pull the current base line

688516
vb.net	vb6
or you could go with vb.net vb6 or what have you

688522
int	chars
i was bored enough to try doing it with a chars array and using convert.touint32 string int to convert to a uint from base 2

688567
disk	ram
you might want to investigate more than creating ram disk

688567
disk	ram
something which looks like it will have very little gain since the os is doing disk caching with ram

688567
disk	ram
if you chew up ram for ram disk the os has less working ram to cache data and to run your code - you ll end up with more swapping and worse disk performance than otherwise note you should profile this option before completely discarding it

688624
bazaar	git
you can use a distribute version control system like bazaar git mercurial

688630
free	malloc
instead of malloc and free you could use and operator delete p since struct packet is a pod type and does not currently benefit from having its default constructor and its destructor called

688636
disk	ram
i ve moved my temp to a ram disk and that gives me minor speedups in general

688636
disk	ram
get a ram disk that supports automatically loading saving disk images so you don t have to use boot scripts to do this

688636
disk	ram
place your often-used large header files on the ram disk and override your compiler standard paths to use the ram drive copies

688636
disk	ram
keep your source files on your harddrive and sync to the ram disk - not the other way around

688762
post	get
to answer how do you get a form to post to different actions depending on the button that is clicked you could change the action attribute of the form using javascript depending on the link button clicked

688769
codeblocks	anjuta
codeblocks and anjuta are pretty fair enough as pointed out by brian campbell

688779
setinterval	settimeout
here is some reading comparing setinterval and settimeout

688787
switching	screens
you can switching between screens windows with

688804
rsa	aes
for many reasons you should normally only use rsa to encrypt a key and then use aes or a similar symmetric cipher algorithm to encrypt your actual text

688824
internationalization	localization
you also gain the advantage of much easier localization internationalization of your resources

688865
button	checkbox
the checkbox are exactly the same as the radio button with the exception that they are not a group

688865
put	get
when i put an alert in the js code above i do get the alert so i know i m good there but because i don t know js i m not able to troubleshoot this any further

688887
nunit	mstest
unlike nunit testdriven.net etc - mstest copied things around into a different folder for each test

688902
logarithm	modulo
by exploiting modulo and the logarithm it is trivial and no recursion necessary

688918
rss	feed
to put the image into your rss feed you would save it to a file and put the url into your feed

688926
gif	png
i want to make sure that during file upload time only the file of the format jpeg png and gif are allowed

688926
gif	png
so the file of type below in the screenshot must show jpeg png and gif

689004
rss	feed
i really suggest adding eclipsezone to your rss feed reading list

689015
puts	gets
your forgot something in the update.php every in place editor does an ajax request to the update file and then puts in the edited element the things it gets in the update.php with that request

689042
getter	setter
i need to know which is the language used in the template code used for generating getter setter methods in myeclipse

689042
getter	setter
1 i want to use my static utility method in the getter setter method template code of myeclipse

689106
put	get
none of the complicated solutions which i know i can get to work if i put some effort in it talks how to detect this particular file just pias for word excel and then some

689132
hex	binary
use a command line hex dumper or much more useful write a small program which understands what the binary data means so you can compare meaningful data instead of bit wastes

689204
feedback	review
write some python code and post it on so for review and feedback whether it is pythonic

689213
ubuntu	linux
both of the answers from devsolar work tested on linux ubuntu but the xargs version is preferable if there may be many files since it will avoid running into command line length limits

689214
unix	bsd
the person should also be comfortable with using linux or bsd on the desktop since that means they have to interact with the unix system on two different levels both the server side and the desktop side

689274
x86	64bit
each subkey contains information on the core including the identifier which contains either x86 or some 64bit in text including processor family and model

689292
websphere	ibm
it already exists if you want to try it ibm websphere application server 6.1 componentization overview

689344
freebsd	linux
from freebsd to amd64 linux

689353
integer	fractions
since a year is always 52 and a fractions weeks long just rounding up to the next full integer will always give you enough elements

689552
post	get
use post ignore get

689564
free	malloc
1 malloc the memory in the driver free it in the app

689564
free	malloc
if you have access to malloc free and there are no real time concerns or memory fragmentation issues your heap is large enough then this is a fairly easy approach

689576
google-chrome	safari
and also i assumed that since it didnt work in google-chrome that safari would be the same but you know what they say about assuming it works in safari but not google-chrome

689591
int	boolean
an int zero a float zero boolean false or datetime.minvalue

689599
pull	push
in iphone os 3.0 apple has introduced push services - where you can simply push your data instead of doing a pull however this is not available in the current iphone os 2.x.x

689628
subtract	add
i mean every example i see illustrates how to add or subtract to parameters

689705
implements	extends
i m extends the class microsoft.mappoint.plugin.plugin and it has two abstract methods that the tutorial doesn t talk about which i have implements

689724
jquery	scriptaculous
i have been using jquery and i need to use scriptaculous and protoype

689853
profiling	debugging
so i go back to debugging mode and i try to run it and it tells me that half of my projects need to be recompiled with the profiling switch on

689857
getter	setter
not allowing properties to be declared in an interface would only force developers to create getter and setter manually

689871
sorting	filtering
event1 and event2 fire and basically will change things about the serverside controls rendering sorting filtering etc so when they fire i need to call populatecontrols for sure

689893
prng	random
math random auto is a cpan module implementing the well-known mersenne twister prng

689894
profiling	debugging
if you re finding it difficult to use there s a really great .net profiling called nprof and if you re debugging non-clr projects amd has a really spectacular statistical profiling called code analyst

689949
min	max
edit sorry change max to min

689955
sorting	filtering
covers domain services connecting server data to silverlight client the data grid paging sorting filtering the data form control validation and more

689964
equals	gethashcode
i would suggest that you create a small custom class exposing the bool and int properties and override its gethashcode and equals methods then use this as the key

689987
equals	gethashcode
also consider overriding gethashcode and equals methods

689991
width	height
i have an image inside a span tag the span has a set width and height and is set to overflow hidden

689998
equals	gethashcode
to make this more robust encapsulate the composite key as a type a class that contains the two fields ensuring you override the equals and gethashcode methods correctly

690002
stdout	stderr
then the java process has to read handle the process stdout stderr usually you do this in a thread per stream to prevent blocking - if you have 2 000 processes using this mechanism then you re looking at 4000 threads

690005
min	max
dbname is the catagory field min dbstart and max dbend fields are the high low values for the series.the values are always for one day only

690035
width	height
if the width and height of the image varies i think the only way to do this is with javascript

690045
macbook	isight
i use opencv under mac os x and it works very well with the built-in isight of my macbook and i believe it works equally well under the other platforms

690048
for-loop	loops
i would convert your while loops into a for-loop like so

690108
debian	linux
im working on linux environment debian

690125
postgresql	mysql
since you get pretty much the same quality and advanced technology with free database servers like mysql or postgresql and since i use python django and .net they integrate pretty well

690125
postgresql	mysql
both have advantages and both are cool we ve reach the point that it doesn t matter which dbms you pick the 4 big ones mysql postgresql mssql or oracle

690133
pull	push
xmltextreader parses xml using pull parsing the java equivalent of this is stax which is basically the inverse of sax push parsing

690160
vbscript	vba
i ve done mild vba but not a vbscript master

690196
ant	maven
edit3 in java you would define a java model with all your favoured documentation then run java2wsdl preferably as an ant maven task to create your wsdl however i have found you need to hand-reorder the fields in it

690220
width	height
when the document is fully loaded take the first input element with type text and apply it s height and width to all input elements with type password

690308
gridview	radgrid
i don t know about radgrid but you can bind that datareader to the built-in grid controls like gridview

690327
aptana	radrails
i am currently using aptana radrails for ruby on rails development on my local system

690380
firebird	dbisam
something like textolution s proprietary add-on for firebird looks like it could accommodate constructing single complex nested query that would apply both regular and fulltext criteria but dbisam does it more elegantly

690400
profiling	instrumentation
a tracing profiling adds code to your program a process known as instrumentation to essentially log what is going on

690400
profiling	instrumentation
tracing profiling are slower but more accurate they also require that the program be changed the instrumentation process which could potentially introduce bugs not that i have heard of it happening.

690412
width	height
here s what i m trying to accomplish there is a div with a fixed width and height and inside it there is a gridview

690412
width	height
if the gridview s width or height exceeds the fixed size of the div i d like the scroll bars to appear on the div

690419
cvs	svn
there are quite a number of tools available and ant the build system we re using has a task that will maintain a build number but it s not clear how to manage this with multiple concurrent developers using cvs svn or similar

690419
ant	maven
ant and maven and hudson and cruise control provide easy means for getting build numbers into a .properties file or into a .txt .html file

690419
cvs	svn
i ll mark as the answer anyone who can give a soup-to-nuts description for this particular case including cvs tagging scheme relevant ci config items and release procedure that folds the build number into the release such that it s programmatically accessible. if you want to ask answer for another particular configuration say svn maven cruise control i ll link to the question from here

690457
gmail	hotmail
mail hotmail or gmail

690473
cassini	iis
due to security aspects that i have to write cassini can t serve as a test server anymore - i have to use iis we have security card readers here

690473
sqlconnection	sqltransaction
i looked at impersonation but i get the impression it s not compatible with our system - the business rules make a call to a common routine to create a sqlconnection object and open it maybe even a sqltransaction object to go with it and this object is used for the rest of the business rules and data-access layer until it s done

690491
sudo	passwd
that works everywhere but does not cache the passwd and asks for the root and not the user passwd as sudo does

690499
kde	gnome
now in kde based distros you ll have kdesu while in gnome based it ll be gksu and gksudo

690524
interbase	firebird	postgresql	mysql
in case you need other db engine support zeosdb is the answer again it supports mysql postgresql interbase firebird ms sql sybase oracle and sqlite

690628
webclient	webrequest
what you could do is derive a class from the webclient class and then override the getwebrequest and the getwebresponse methods to alter the webrequest webresponse instances that the base implementation returns

690632
postgresql	mysql
the sql must run unmodified on sqlite postgresql and mysql if possible

690643
postgresql	mysql
most of my experience is with mysql but i ve also used oracle which is case-sensitive like postgresql

690651
width	height
the map displays with a width of 800px and a height around 480px on a computer screen

690670
mvp	presenter
i forgot to tell about a library we re using in our winforms mvp model presenter to validate the views fluentvalidation

690722
mouseleave	mouseenter
note that live events do not work with the following events change blur focus mouseenter mouseleave and submit

690724
post	get
the other answers came in as i wrote this i d say if we get a mashup of brian fisher s post and jimmie r

690730
firefox	safari
i m using as3 exporting for flash player 10 and testing on firefox 3 safari 4 on a mac

690748
inherited	properties
however i am getting a compiler error since the list properties exists in the selectionlistviewcontroller class but not on the fieldeditviewcontroller even though selectionlistviewcontroller inherited from fieldeditviewcontroller

690764
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a tabcontrol who s tabitem are supplied by an observablecollection - i can design the observablecollection items anyway that i choose

690771
filesystems	ntfs
vss requires that all users have nearly full control at the filesystems level ntfs permissions of the files that make up the repository

690802
jar	war
as an alternative since you are only using the ear to wrap the war and not actually sharing the jar file

690802
jar	war
put the jar in the lib directory of the war

690806
cvs	svn
if the other developers haven t used svn or cvs then it could be costly although all you need is one person who really gets to know the system and then coach the rest

690809
slideup	slidedown
i want to slideup some divs then slidedown 1 div

690824
hide	show
if you want to momentarily show the hidden one and then slideup it you can just switch my original answer from hide to show and then do the slideup

690860
jar	war
the ant build script puts the build number in the manifest file of jar war files that are created during the build

690860
jar	war
for a dev version of a jar war the developer can find the svn revision from the jar war and look up the corresponding code in svn

690865
client-side	server-side
see xhost xhost.c for the client-side and xserver os access.c for the server-side

690876
implements	sealed
several years ago as a school project i implements in c a write-once read-many mapping and other collections which took an existing collection and then sealed it by creating a much more memory and cache-efficient representation a graph was stored as an optimized array

690944
width	height
so you move the rectangle left and up half of the change in width and height

691041
stdout	stderr
mod_wsgi can be coerced into sending stdout and stderr to a log file

691048
mockups	balsamiq
as for best practices starting using wireframes on blank paper or a service like balsamiq mockups

691073
getter	setter
what i have is a property that has a public getter and an internal setter

691085
networkstream	sslstream
i am migrating c# code from using a networkstream to sslstream however where i use stream.dataavailable i get the error

691111
post	put
handling post and put methods with lullaby

691125
peer	p2p
you re p2p so every peer must have at least one socket open to every other peer

691125
peer	p2p
however on a normal p2p network of any size you will almost never have multiple files being transferred concurrently between two peer

691157
bash	zsh
this should work in bash 4.0 available now on most major distros though not on os x unless you install it yourself ksh and zsh

691182
hide	show
displays for about a second the alt attribute given in this case open folder then it hide and show the image when the image is ready

691231
pylons	turbogears	django	turbogears
the growth in popularity of django turbogears and pylons is driving demand for better deployment solutions

691299
throttling	throttle
if i throttle the maxconcurrentcalls down to 20 15 10 or anything lower the instances performance counter show that wcf is respecting the throttling

691317
client-side	server-side
therefore server-side code is relatively expensive compared to client-side code on any site big enough to need to run more than one server

691325
min	max
what you have is that you have tags whose counts are from min to max

691325
min	max
after this you just apply for any count x between min and max

691343
submit	submission
you should add an onclick event to the submit button which calls a javascript function that tests for your condition and uses a javascript alert to let the user know that they need to enter something worthy of submission

691373
geshi	mediawiki
also you ll probably need an extension for mediawiki to show code something like syntaxhighlight geshi

691383
serializable	deserialization
if your unit test covers serializaiton deserialization for example by making sure failure to add members to the serializable function would fail during unit testing

691470
textblock	itemscontrol
that container an instance of contentpresenter for a plain old itemscontrol wraps the textblock and is a direct child of the grid

691515
tar	gunzip
or you can read the man page for tar 1 since it probably has the ability to gunzip and extract together.

691618
hbase	hypertable
if you want something like bigtable you can t go past hbase or hypertable - they re both open-source bigtable clones

691633
config	ini
those i put in a config file ini format for simple stuff xml if it gets more complex

691642
post	get
i need to post some data to 3dgate and get the returned result from it

691652
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu hardy linux 2.6

691661
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i have tested this in firefox opera safari and ie 8

691675
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
if you have ever used sql reporting services there are some dropdownlistfor that pop down with a checkbox list in it

691737
postgresql	mysql
i have just started working on a project and i am using zend framework and postgresql normally use mysql however i am hitting a problem when i am trying to get the last inserted id when using the zend_db insert command

691739
put	get
adding this to the system.web in web.config will enable http get and put

691752
codeigniter	cakephp
if you like to go and strip off pieces of code from different sources you might also want to try to import some of the modules from other frameworks like codeigniter or cakephp into zend framework and that probably would be a fun and useful thing for you and if you d like to share maybe for all the community based around zf

691778
int	double
i think bytes int and decimals will be fairly straightforward but i m a little unsure on the best way to handle singles and double since they can be very small or large and would appreciate any suggestions from those more clever than i

691801
rss	feed
i stumbled across this today from one of my rss feed

691819
hide	show
what i m finding is that with the show hide code sat in the appdelegate i have to create a reference of the appdelegate in the loaded controller in order to target the hide code

691828
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a gridview that s tied to an objectdatasource

691837
hide	show
show hide code sat in the appdelegate

691895
ienumerable	ilist
obviously your iec object does not implement ilist and only implements ienumerable so it is impossible to do a random read without of course an extension method or something which uses the enumerator to reach the random index

691900
post	get
eval is more dangerous than get post because the submitted content can run functions like include which can access any file apache has read privileges for or shell_exec which can do anything in the shell the apache user can do etc

persistent	transient
for example database access in php using mysql mysqli pdo etc is transient persistent connections notwithstanding whereas .net java will nearly always use persistent connection pools and build on top of this to create orm frameworks and the like the caches for which are beyond any particular request

691989
classname	inherited
if not how difficult would it be to write an app that at bare minimum builds a self-referencing classname table so i could at least throw it into a database treeview component to easily view inherited ancestry etc.

to redirect stderr to a file display stdout to screen and also save stdout to a file

692009
stdout	stderr
edit to display both stderr and stdout to screen and also save both to a file you can use bash s i o redirection

692026
accessor	properties
because you can construct your properties editor in the same thread as the binding it will be threadsafe if you simply override the properties editor default behavior - you need to find the hook it uses to do binding and override it - do the same properties editor registration you re doing now except in the same method so that you can keep the reference to your editor and then at the end of the binding you can register errors by retrieving the list from your editor if you provide a public accessor

692062
pull	push
i got a permission denied error which led me to chown the entire repo recursively to the user i expected it to be and i could then commit push pull with no problem

i m assuming you want to still see stderr and stdout on the terminal

692407
stdout	stderr
only instead of just using it for your stdout have a tee for stdout and one for stderr

692407
stdout	stderr
tee outputs its input back on stdout but since its input is our stderr we want to redirect tee s stdout to our stderr again

692476
outputstream	inputstream
second question the adc s reference tells us that the method getstreamstohost port inputstream outputstream returns the object representing an output stream to the remote host

692639
factors	mean
it could mean updating the balance factors but not balancing

692667

given pipelining out of order processing microcode multi-core processors etc there s no guarantee that a particular section of assembly code will take exactly x cpu cycles clock cycle whatever cycles

692763
git-rebase	undo
however the reset git-rebase and merge all save your original head pointer into orig_head so if you ve done any of those commands since the git-rebase you re trying to undo then you ll have to use the reflog

rss	feed
here they re binding to xml that s being pulled from an rss feed

692857
disk	ram
the number of files in each subdirectory can get quite large so i think a big performance penalty comes from a context switch to where it can t keep all the different file arrays in ram at the same time such that it s going to disk nearly every time

692893
debian	linux	debian-based	linux
i m not tied to a linux distro so this can be for anything although debian or a debian-based distro would be nice

693068
button	checkbox	int	double
it s funier to manipulate windows button checkbox than int float double and not so much difficult

693099
width	height
alternatively we could specify padding 1 but then we must manually set height 21 and width 22 to ensure the button isn t resized to fit the image

693099
width	height
on the image tab the height and width are needed to ensure that the image isn t stretched

693165

stdout	stderr
my goal is to launch a child process wait for it to finish and then use its stdout in my parent process by referring to p.stdout while letting stderr just print to wherever it would otherwise

694029
getter	setter
since the main differences in java and c# are object definitions i would get those by reflecting the c# dlls and then reconstruct the constructs then it would be easy to have an interpreter run through and implement the function bodies and convert properties to getter setter already knowing the structure of the files

694032
vim	emacs
i keep hearing about how many people use emacs vim on a daily basis

694032
vim	emacs
i know how to use vim and emacs but for day-to-day programming i just use an ide as i find myself being more productive

694032
vim	emacs
this is not a vim vs emacs question so please don t argue one against the other please instead argue graphical ide against console ide

694032
vim	emacs
however to someone who uses a standard gui text editor i d probably say that they should use emacs vim

694041
vim	emacs
i know people who swear by vim and people who swear by emacs

694045

694147
hash	salt
i m using salt hash and am storing that in the db -- thanks scotty for pointing this out

694151
hash	salt
you should use a salt hash

694152
hash	salt
salt your password hash

694160
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
most people encrypt their passwords using a one-way hash function of some sort md5 and sha256 are popular along with a salt

694160
hash	salt
the salt is a secret that only your application knows sort of like an encryption key which is added to whatever you are encrypting before it is run through the one-way hash

694164
vim	emacs
since vi vim and emacs are pretty close in terms of what they can or cannot do productivity with these two editors comes from experience in using it

694168

you can also comment out min only and leave max with 10 0 1 .

694175
ant	maven
just because some people tend to think that ant and maven are in opposition they are not

694195
hash	salt
if you salt hash the username you d leave yourself with a bit of a chicken egg problem

694195
hash	salt
you d need to look up the user s record to find the salt you used to hash the username.

694220
required	placeholder
the closest method would be using placeholder and printf but that required an explicit call to a function not an implicit substitution

694232
min	max
as max is 2147483647 and min is -2147483648 for 32 bit signed integer

hash	salt
a simple solution here is to salt the hash string add the same secret string to every value that is hash

694314
firefox	safari
validating your javascript with a good parts + browser on jslint.com makes it less likely to have javascripts behaving differently in firefox safari etc

694365
xen	openvz
the virtualbox support is bleeding-edge not in any release may not even be in source control yet but is available as a set of patches on the mailing list -- but this single api available for c python and several other languages lets you control virtual machines and images running in qemu kvm xen lxc linux containers uml user-mode linux openvz and others

694374
persistent	transient
rich domain objects require references to many components but these objects get persistent or serialized so any references they hold to outside components spring beans in this case services repositories anything are transient and get wiped out

694374
persistent	transient
when object is loaded from repository or other responsible entity since the component references are transient and obviously don t get persistent

694377
width	height
binding the actual height and width properties to calculate the offsets

694418
set	bag
if you want to use ilist use first rule i.e change your hbm.xml to use bag instead of set also your phonenumbers class should inherit from ilist not list if you want to use list you will need to change your mapping file to use list instead of set

i know i can put the other assemblies in my project and set them to embedded resource but how do you get them back out again meaning how do you get it to a place where i can instantiate classes defined in that embedded assembly

694721
getter	setter
in particular having seen java code with several getter and setter being called in the same statement i know that the equivalent c# code would be a lot simpler to read

694745
firefox	safari
this mechanism works fine in firefox and safari but does not work in ie7

694746
getter	setter
there s no time-consuming operation going on inside the property getter setter

694751
width	height
the columns are fixed width in the first gridview - meaning that the row height is variable depending on the amount of text

694758
getter	setter
when using and writing them i just think of properties as setter and getter which a much nicer syntax

694808
getter	setter
most of the protestations could be said for java s getter and setter too --and we had them for quite a while without such problems in practice

awt	swing
it s a iteration of swing awt

695018
config	ini
in general it is faster than most config files and more reliable individual operations on the registry are transacted so if your app crashes during a write the registry isn t corrupted - in general that isn t the case with ini files

695081
modifiers	sealed
static classes are implicitly sealed they re compiled to il which describes an sealed class but you can t add the sealed modifiers yourself

i ve been quite impressed by bnfc which is able to generate parsers in java as well as in c c++ c# f# haskell and ocaml

696357
folder	directory
i prefer the following code snippet as it creates a folder inheriting default rights - which seems the right thing to do - other software the user might have setup specific inheritable rights on a directory for a legitimate reason - then adds a full control explicit access entry for the built in users group

696414
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
add subtract multiplying logical operations to calculate values

696471
awt	swing
on linux awt swing on java etc.

696496
tunnel	packets
tunnel is when instead of sending a packets directly through the network you send in inside another often encrypted connection by means of encapsulation

696496
tunnel	packets
in case of ssh tunnel tcp ip packets are sent inside an ssh connection to another host which then decides how to treat those packets usually forward to internal network

696545
exponent	modulo
the public key consists of the modulo n and the public or encryption exponent e

696545
exponent	modulo
private key consists of the modulo n and the private or decryption exponent d which

696548
subtraction	addition
with that you can perform addition subtraction and many other operations on your two binary inputs

696559
pull	push
another approach is to adopt a push model rather than a pull model

696632
glassfish	weblogic	jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish
glassfish jboss weblogic websphere tomcat spring dm are all app server choices for deploying your spring app

696650
gmail	hotmail
so if you obtain a database of usernames and unsalted passwords chances are good they might work elsewhere like hotmail gmail etc

696652
accessor	properties
id is accessed with the token accessor i think that s what it s called as it is not a native properties of the movieclip class i m guessing videobutton is made out of a movieclip

696666
hash	salt
this means that any readily available dictionary is useless since the likelyhood of it containing the hash for that text is a lot less than the likelihood of it containing the hash for dog this likelihood becomes even lower if the salt is a random alphanumeric string

696704
temp	tmp
if 10 requests come to the pdf_controller the number of the temp files in the tmp directory will double and it will eat up the space

696712
hash	md5
it s simply more expensive to compute a sha-512 hash than to compute a md5 hash

696718
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works in ie firefox apple safari google-chrome - i don t have any others available right now

696740
jboss	glassfish
j2ee containers such as jboss glassfish embed a servlet container such as tomcat and provide a j2ee container and sometimes other tools to deploy java enterprise applications

696740
django	turbogears
some people will tell you that django sucks while turbogears rocks etc

696776
versioning	upgrade
so essentially any action on the checkout using tortoisesvn upgrade the internal structure of the checkout and thus it can t be used on server side anymore since the client versioning is too old

696806
umask	sudo
to achieve that you would need to write wrapper scripts for the svn commands that set the proper umask or give all involved users the ability to act as one specific user through sudo

696879
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
one that works in ie8 safari opera firefox

696912
ssl	https
i am writing a web service in perl that will run under ssl https with client certificates

696937
mouse	keyboard
also douglas engelbart the inventor thought people would use both mouse and a short form of keyboard at the same time

696943
hide	show
i conditionally hide show panels in a detailsview..

696943
hide	show
i want to also hide show the detailsview row field that the panel is contained in

696966
accessor	properties
i m not sure if you just picked a bad example for your struct name since nullable is a framework struct but if not the error is due to the fact that you have no set accessor in your properties

696982
mouse	keyboard
vis is the idea of an ui which actually adapts to the needs of the particular user or his environment including vision impairment tactile preferences mouse or keyboard preferred language to better suit right-to-left languages preferred visual presentation button order mac-style or windows-style better use of available space corporate identity etc

696997
range	minimum
for example if you have a value in the range 1.0 2.0 and subtract from it a value in the range 0.0 1.0 then the result must lie in the range below 0.0 above 2.0 as the minimum result is 1.0-1.0 and the maximum is 2.0-0.0

697024
getter	setter
do funny things with your apart getter and setter

697053
getter	setter
for an automatic property you always need both a getter and setter

697063
width	height
wx asks how big is your min width height and portions out the screen qt has option to say how wide do you want how high do you need to be if your x wide

697064
init.d	pid
etc init.d foo start start foo write foo s pid to var run foo.pid

697146
hmac	md5
you have to use the hmac module together with md5 or sha

697153
cvs	svn
then in order to put changes in production you could make php script on production site that accesses the online service and downloads the newest version via http http should be generally available with cvs and svn uses it natively rather than using specific vcs protocols

697182
gridview	repeater	gridview	datalist	datalist	repeater
you can always use asp.net s data controls such as repeater gridview datalist to display collections of item

697203
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox and the webkit-based browsers notably safari and google-chrome

697220
put	get
what you could do is get a virtual machine appliance for source code control and issue management like vmtrac and either run it directly or pick it apart and figure out how it was put together

697266
int	chars	int	double
convert.tostring expands on that and provides some specific overloads for primitive types chars byte int double etc. that allow for some more type-specific functionality like base conversion for example

697351
ienumerable	icollection
extension methods -- i would use very sparingly but they are very useful for extending the .net types with convenience methods especially ienumerable icollection and string

697388
stdout	stdio
well you could start a new cmd.exe process and use stdio and stdout to send and recieve data

697401
hash	md5
if the md5 implementation is dependent on machine word size i haven t checked the code this can cause the hash to be different

697437
post	get
for every page request post get create a new random value

697544
crossover	mutation
the problem is that every variable i have is a matrix and the crossover fitness and mutation codes get pretty complicated

697557
width	height
you should just be able to simply set the height and the width parameters - since these are both valid attributes of the iframe dom element

697559
width	height
after rotation your newrow and newcolumn may be larger than the original width height of the image

697575
db4o	starcounter
linq to sql is just one of many linq providers out there there is linq to db4o linq to starcounter linq to objects linq to ado and many many more

697583
rss	feed
let s say i have 500 rss feed that need updating very constantly but do not want to check all 500 every minute

697593
post	get
i asked the following question on the subsonic forum but only seemed to get one response so i thought i d post up here as well to see if anyone could shed some more light on the problem.

697617
put	get
for example if you put non-numeric characters in a number field you can get a parsing error

697617
put	get
if you put a zero in where it isn t anticipated you can get a divide by zero error

697617
put	get
if you put a much larger value in than is expected or a negative when not expected or any number of other things you can get an error of some sort

697618
integer	unsigned
uint8_t - 8 bit unsigned integer

697618
integer	unsigned
uint16_t - 16 bit unsigned integer

697618
integer	unsigned
uint32_t - 32 bit unsigned integer

697618
16-bit	64bit
for instance one might declare a variable using int_fast16_t but it would actually be implemented as an int32_t on a 32 bit processor or int64_t on a 64bit processor as those would be the fastest types of at least 16-bit on those platforms

697638
inline	inlining
inlining the whole thing is not really neccesary you can inline the dynamic part and leave the other part hardcoded

697647
opera	firefox
this works like a charm in firefox 3.0.x ie7 and opera 9.6.x

697668
pop-up	dialog
i m not really sure i totally understand your problem but what i think you are trying to say is that when you drag a portlet it s supposed to be binding a click event listener to the setup wrench button on your portlet so that when it s clicked a dialog pop-up

697668
pop-up	dialog
and you are saying that when you click on that wrench a dialog pop-up for all your portlets and not just the one you clicked the button inside of

697694
hide	show
after i do the .post thing i want to hide the first div with a left slide then show the second with a right slide

697719
realloc	calloc
there could be other ways of storing this for instance as you are using double you could use calloc and realloc to maintain one piece of memory the right size

697726
int	chars
the ord function converts a single byte to its int value 0 â i â 255 and not just the 128 chars of the ascii chars set

697733
pull	push
your laptop will have the whole history so you only need to touch the server if you want to push or pull not just to do a diff or check the history

697753
serializable	deserialization
i would say that if you want to have a full control over the format you should use custom serializable and if you want responding the deserialization flow the attributes is the best option

697756
width	height
maybe you need to add height 2 and width 2 to your row and column values before you plug them in

697769
subtract	addition	subtract	add	multiplying	addition	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
i would say that if you can add you can then use it to subtract multiplying and divide using addition

697799
width	height
as far as i know using percentage for width height should work fine

697809
getter	setter
the updaterecordcommand should be defined with the following fields and setter getter

697819
des	aes
des is slow and now considered obsolete aes is the replacement for it

697836
width	height
i m guessing that there is a way to do this with css using width height or javascript

697852
margin	height
the idea is to have the 30px on an element other than the height 100 element since the margin and the 100 add together to create the final element height and 100 + 30px 100

697862
awt	swing
you can embed a browser in a swing awt gui using the jdic api

697871
return-value-optimization	nrvo
this is a special case where the compiler is allowed to optimize out the copy this is called named return-value-optimization nrvo

697877
width	height
with the width and height lost

697895
margin	height
as joel said margin + height add together so you should use a container

697896
srp	principles
oop favors the single responsibility principles or srp

697952
pascal	delphi
is a typical method of concatinating strings and has been used in pascal delphi for the past few decades without any significant problems

697966
spaces	delimiter
if you want to split the input you can use string.split using comma as a delimiter or even better for taking into account the spaces after comma

698012
vsto	add-in
one to go for shared add-in com based and other to build vsto based add-in

698021
int	chars
for a int as small as an unsigned chars you get best performance using a small lookup-table

698024
int	chars
an unsigned chars is a number in just the same way that a 32-bit float or int is a number what the compiler deems them to represent is what changes

698027
button	checkbox
they re usually used with checkbox and radio button and when the user clicks on the label it toggles the button

698028
width	height
the container s scrollbars appear when its height width is too small for all the combined height width of all its children

698048
post	get
an initial get request to a page usually costs less than subsequent post anyway so there s not much reason to avoid it

698066
min	max
see for min and max

698067
gtk	fltk
using lgpl you have many other options including gtk qt as of 4.5 fltk etc

698076
folder	directory
i ve found using the findfirstflashcard findnextflashcard apis to be more reliable than enumerating directory and checking the temporary flag which will return bluetooth shared folder for example

698079
mouse	keyboard
that way it won t be able to access stage mouse and keyboard events and certain others and there won t be any class definition conflicts

698119
fortran	ada
i haven t come across use of java in real-time systems but i haven t been looking at the sorts of systems where i d expect to find it i work in aerospace simulation where it s c++ fortran and occasionally ada for real-time in-the-loop systems

698119
matlab	simulink
matlab simulink is in effect a dsl for linear programming state machines and algorithms

698132
post	get
thanks to this post i ve been able to successfully get this to work properly in my app

698148
int	boolean
overload resolution failed because no public can be called with these arguments public shared operator left as system.drawing.color right as system.drawing.color as boolean argument matching parameter right cannot convert from int to color

698356
int	chars
the standard requires that certain types have minimum sizes short is at least 16 bits int is at least 16 bits etc and that some groups of type are ordered sizeof int sizeof short sizeof chars

698372
rss	feed
select a probabilistic model for the rss feed for example that the time between updates follows a continuous probability distribution for example the exponential distribution

698372
rss	feed
for every rss feed use the maximum likelihood method for estimating the parameters of the individual distributions based on the history of updates on that feed

698372
rss	feed
now you have a probabilistic model which you can use the calculate the probability that any particular rss feed has an update available at any specific time

698460
int	chars
also wchar_t is used to store chars that can have any size determined by the implementation - but must use one of the int types as its underlying type

698460
int	chars
all of bool chars short int long and their unsinged counterparts are int

698460
int	chars
for signed chars the range is from -127 - 127 for short and int it is the same and is -2 15+1 - 2 15-1 and for long it is -2 31+1 - 2 31-1

698460
int	chars
for chars that is 8 for short int that is 16 and for long that is 32

698465
int	chars
sizeof int sizeof chars

698475
bonjour	avahi
the entire point of mono.zeroconf is to provide cross platform multiple mdns provider support avahi and bonjour

698509
min	max
when i use the sql query above with the min and max functions nothing prints out for min and max

698509
min	max
also i tested the problem query string in an sqlite database browser on the same database and it works displaying the two - min and max values

698604
accessor	properties
also i wouldn t recommend setting the private member directly - it would be a good idea to have a single object inside of the returned class instance used just for locking and use some form of accessor method or properties that locks on that synchronization object and then sets the field

698619
munin	cacti
you should have some sort of monitoring solution in place like cacti or munin giving you visibility into what s going on on your server s

698619
nginx	lighttpd
you should be using a lighter-weight reverse proxy like squid or webserver lighttpd or nginx to serve static content and to take over the job of spoon-feeding bytes to slow clients

698621
kohana	yii	codeigniter	yii	codeigniter	kohana	symfony	kohana
for instance codeigniter yii symfony and kohana are all excellent choices and i know at least that codenigniter and kohana both support the use of zend components for instance using zend with codeigniter

698682
memcached	apc
1 st level cache in memory kv-store apc store or memcached

698725
keydown	mousedown
note how i ve moved the keydown and mousedown event handlers to the textblock control instead

698740
post	get
when i attempt to post this code back to the server i get a popup window that says sys.webforms.pagerequestmanagerservererrorexception an unknown error occured while processing the request on the server

698780
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
addition subtraction for the rectangular bound calculation is cheaper than multiplication

698784
salt	md5
any guid generator or even md5 concat salt current_timestamp is sufficient where salt is something on the user record like timestamp account was created

698807
innodb	myisam
i m renaming tables changing indexes and generally altering most of the table in some way part of that is that i m changing from myisam to innodb tables

698810
ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest
just use the built-in ftpwebrequest and ftpwebresponse classes

698812
ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest
take a look at ftpwebrequest and ftpwebresponse classes

698887
put	get
if you put these two lines together as in the first example you still get a temporary constructed on the stack followed by an assignment

698909
getter	setter
this is most probably because you annotated the id field and not the setter or getter

698957
accessor	properties
now i have no problem defining a cpvect inside my object but when i try to make the accessor using properties synthesize i keep getting errors so

698968
profiling	debugging
go to run debugging settings add a new profiling

698986
rss	feed
i have a core model for an item and a script to populate it from a custom source think rss feed

699013
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it opens and renders fine in all browsers and works perfectly in ie7 firefox google-chrome and safari

699022
srp	principles
in my opinion the srp single responsibility principles is applicable for methods functions as well and not only for objects

699054
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu 8.10 linux 2.6.24-16-generic

699120
submit	submission
don t know if it will help but you can try simulating a submit button click instead of directly submission the form

699126
ant	maven
in maven the definitive guide i wrote about the differences between maven and ant in the introduction the section title is the differences between ant and maven

699126
ant	maven
contrast the previous ant example with a maven example

699126
maven	pom.xml
in maven to create a jar file from some java source all you need to do is create a simple pom.xml place your source code in basedir src main java and then run mvn install from the command line

699126
maven	pom.xml
the example maven pom.xml that achieves the same results

699126
maven	pom.xml
if we wanted to start customizing the behavior our pom.xml is going to grow in size and in the largest of projects you can see collections of very complex maven poms which contain a great deal of plugin customization and dependency declarations

699126
ant	pom.xml
but even when your project s pom.xml files become more substantial they hold an entirely different kind of information from the build file of a similarly sized project using ant

699126
ant	maven
where ant had to be explicit about the process there was something built-in to maven that just knew where the source code was and how it should be processed

699126
ant	maven
even though i m very much convinced that maven makes sense i d happily use ant + ivy with a project team that had a very sharp build engineer

699214
gridview	detailsview
i use a detailsview to insert data into the database and the gridview to edit and delete the data

699227
colorbox	thickbox
colorbox is one that i found recently and seems similar in capability to thickbox

699239
entity-relationship	diagram
this entity-relationship diagram illustrates this

699250
boost	stl
ofcourse i m understend that when stl was designed boost does not exists but designers could be create something similar on boost function

699253
spaces	delimiter
after the file has been uploaded i want to determine whether the file is either spaces or tab delimiter and all the values are integers

699253
int	chars
i was thinking of reading every chars of the file and checking if it s an int

699258
spaces	delimiter
sounds like it doesn t matter wether it s delimiter by spaces or tabs

699301
int	chars
the final bit-pattern is given type int and is therefore signed regardless of whether single chars are signed or not a slight change from versions 3.1 and earlier of gcc

699301
int	chars
if there are more chars in the constant than would fit in the target int the compiler issues a warning and the excess leading chars are ignored

699301
int	chars
for example ab for a target with an 8-bit chars would be interpreted as int unsigned chars 234 256 + unsigned chars a

699319
min	max
however looking at the java character class its min value is u0000 and its max value is uffff

699332
coalesce	isnull
alternatively if you don t have coalesce available but you do have an isnull function available you can chain isnulls

699342
stdout	stderr
as the os.system docs mention use the subprocess module and if you like set stdout open os.devnull w and perhaps the same for stderr when you open the subprocess

699357
int	chars
an int chars constant has type int

699357
int	chars
the value of an int chars constant

699357
int	chars
numerical value of the representation of the mapped chars interpreted as an int

699357
int	chars
the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars

699357
int	chars
if an int chars constant contains

699408
spaces	delimiter
spaces or tab delimiter and all the

699408
spaces	delimiter	int	chars
if it matches - it will mean that you will have set of int delimiter by spaces or tabs it s not really relevant which chars was used to delimit the int

699436
versioning	upgrade
by contrast with informix esql c an upgrade to the current versioning informix clientsdk 3.50 containing esql c 3.50 which is more recent than the esql c 6.00 which you currently use should be painless unless you ve gone out of your way to write bad code

699438
post	get
the problem could be that by default ajax requests are usually post requests not get

699484
cpu	processors
cpu usage cannot be directly measured because unlike an x86 the arm processors doesn t have a register for it

699497
super	implements
you can always implements file uploads yourself it s really not that super difficult if the .net utility has some limit coded in to it though it really shouldn t

699528
typedef	struct
one other good reason to always typedef enums and struct results from this problem

699528
typedef	struct
i would advocate always typedef ing struct and enumerations

699551
disk	ram
if you have a tree that s 4 high then to reach any random node requires loading 4 index pages in to ram and that s 4 disk hits

699567
erlang	lisp
you might want to look at distel an integration of emacs with erlang s message system and slime an interface between emacs and common lisp

699630
gridview	radgrid
i am new to jquery trying to populate a gridview or telerik radgrid using jquery

699653
firefox	safari
the text on my web page looks fine in firefox safari but in ie7 certain portions are cut off

699755
floating-point	integer
in sml arithmetic operators are overloaded to apply to both floating-point and integer data

699766
direct3d	directx
i ve seriously tried almost ten different methods and even my search results in google for directx direct3d c# desktop hooks and others have brought me to no avail

699766
direct3d	gdi
direct3d dx gdi or otherwise

699801
text-align	text-indent	margin	text-align	margin	text-indent
i have set padding to 0 margin to 0 though it shouldn t be this as clearly the border goes around the element containing the gap text-indent to 0 and text-align left

699807
octal	decimal
a leading zero makes the constant octal rather than decimal

699829
spaces	delimiter
accepts either tabs or spaces as a delimiter allowing them to be mixed freely

699881
hide	show
the way i currently tackle this is that i hide the listbox if the result set count 0 and show a label with the no results found message

699915
ssd	sata
i have not enough money to buy a ssd and have 2 sata drivers

699931
icmp	udp
when we send a packet from a udp port we receive an exception if the network returns an icmp host unreachable

699931
icmp	udp
no problem we ll just listen for icmp and that will give us the info we need while ignoring the exception on the udp port

699942
post	put
and also assuming that you have put has_many post in user.rb

699961
post	get
i found a blog post with some code written in java that will do exactly what i need and my very basic knowledge let me compile it but i get errors every time

699977
octal	decimal	octal	hex
only decimal hex and octal numbers are supported with format specifiers

700008
button	checkbox
the widget library would let you make parts of your buffer into button also radio boxes checkbox lists which will execute elisp when you click them

700011
feedback	review
please take time to review and give ur feedback

700017
division	modulo
solution str dec base + solution - get the modulo of the number to the base and add it to the beginning of our string we must add numbers right to left using division and remainder method

700036
slideup	slidedown
you will need to include the jquery library and then use the slidedown and slideup functions to show your form

700045
hide	show
on the usercontrol s page_load event i call the toggle function which show or hide the appropriate control and sets its text based on a boolean editable property and string text property respectively

700085
jms	jta
while you can do jta and jms outside of an application server like jboss i ve had very mixed experiences trying to get jta to span jms and jdbc under tomcat

700099
setinterval	settimeout
there are native javascript functions setinterval and settimeout for doing stuff on set intervals

700137
inherited	subclassing
indeed being able to subclassing class a and call the same method on class b and have it do something else is the entire point of inherited in languages

700163
post	get
it should not be economical for a spammer to post links because most users could not successfully get to the page

700302
min	max
it used intervals with the notation min max and implemented range-based arithmetic

700304
strncpy	malloc	strdup	strncpy	strdup	malloc
instead of using malloc and strncpy just use strdup - it allocates the buffer bin enough to hold the content and copies the content to the new string all in one shot

700305
strcpy	strncpy	printf	strncpy	printf	strcpy
the printf line is functionally correct but for what you re doing strcpy as opposed to strncpy is from what i can see and know of the code the correct choice

700309
swt	swing
glazedlists was created to support mostly swing or swt based uis

700309
swt	swing
in this url you can see that the documentation mentions that it can be used with swing or swt out of the box but no html mentioned

700310
pull	push
i don t want to keep the data objects around i pull them out and convert them to business objects and then don t touch them again until i want to push back to the database and i convert the business objects to data objects

ok it might sounds dumb but i couldn t figure out a way to pass int chars into this system call

700555
subtract	add
take a look here add subtract using bitwise operators

700601
vsto	add-in
you can do this with vsto i m not so sure if it works exactly the same way with the shared add-in technology but maybe it does help

700607
rss	feed
using feedparser or some other python library to download and parse rss feed

700623
firefox	safari
this works in ie firefox safari and so on so no need for the messy browser detection too

700669
put	get
the advantage of using generics is that it increases the type safety - you can only put in the correct type of thing and you get out the correct type without requiring a cast

700688
ienumerable	ilist
i have used ienumerable and ilist when i ve been converting an object reference and didn t know the type to cast it to at compile-time - so non-generic interfaces are useful sometimes.

700702
cos	math.h
math.h or cos pi

700774
post	get
you didn t post any information on mytype so i ll assume you ll need to alter my code to get the calculator instance

gridview	onclientclick
this function just gets the row by giving it the id of the row in a gridview used for the onclientclick event to change the color of the row

700856
mouseup	mousedown
hook your event handler up to the button s mousedown event instead of the click or mouseup event

700877
put	get
the comma syntax forces you to put the join condition in the where clause which may not get executed until after left right joins depending on how it s parsed

700918
client-side	server-side
they are very separate things jquery is a javascript framework that has the ability to do some rudimentary ajax functionality while asp.net ajax is a more fully-featured ajax framework that encompasses .net controls and server-side aspects as well as client-side aspects

700939
pop-up	dialog
the reason we re using an iframe is to alow us to host the pdf in a page that also runs some scripts and has some more controls on if a certain condition is met we pop-up a modal dialog using the modal dialog extender but we ve switched that behaviour off and the problem is still occuring

700967
folder	directory
there is one such directory in every folder under source control

debian	linux
i m using perl 5.10.0 on debian linux testing and trying to install the perl module net amazon mechanicalturk version 1.01

701321
post	put
so in a sense tomcat will already do rest for you if you put your server pages as resources could be the resource for your car to which you could use http post or put to change the details of it

701322
int	chars
the method i came up with is to turn the int into a string find the 1st chars of the string then turn it back to an int

701331
post	put
that way you can post or put to that resource without affecting other related resources and without having to parrot them back to the server

701331
put	get
if you had to manipulate everything from the parent think about what happens if one person does a get modifies one sub-item and then does a put of the whole thing with that sub-item changed

701332
width	height	opera	firefox
in firefox 3 and opera the table is 112 x 100 px so for some reason the border is added to the table width but not to the table height

701558
division	modulo
random in bash is a special variable that returns a random number then use modulo division to get a valid index then index into the array

701657
decoder	encoder
note however that utf-8 words are always 8-bits one byte in length though characters can be multiple points therefore there is no problem with endianness. if the encoder of a stream of bytes representing unicode text and the decoder aren t agreed on which convention is being used the wrong character code can be interpreted

701711
children	parent
the problem is that if you lose reference to the topmost node then the topmost node still holds strong references to its children and all its children also hold a strong reference to their parent

701711
children	parent
thus if the topmost node goes out of scope as in the previous example then while it holds strong references to its children its children don t hold strong references to their parent

701744
postgresql	mysql
i d like to migrate an existing mysql database around 40tables 400mb data to postgresql before it gets bigger

701778
qtkit	quicktime
qtkit the objective-c api for quicktime is new with leopard os x 10.5 and is very good

701814
postgresql	mysql
the translation from mysql to postgresql is not simple unless your schema is trivial

701814
postgresql	mysql
but doing it yourself you have the chance to take advantage of features in postgresql that aren t present in mysql as well as the chance to make the kinds of improvements that only come from having the chance to do something a second time

701825
inherited	properties
also i know that someone will suggest composition over inherited in this case but that s truly not feasible because i m relying on the ability to extend parent functionality and member properties are populated so that all properties are accessed in the exact same manner

701847
inherited	properties
the fontsize properties of the container should be inherited by child controls unless they explicitly override the properties

701847
inherited	properties
the listbox and the button do not inherited their background setting from the parent although they do inherited font properties

701870
integer	fractions
the compiler interprets the operands to 5 10 as integers and integer division can t result in a fractions result by definition

702166
ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest	webclient	httpwebrequest	webclient	ftpwebresponse	webclient	ftpwebrequest	httpwebrequest	ftpwebrequest
for http and ftp resources the httpwebrequest ftpwebrequest and httpwebresponse ftpwebresponse classes will work fine as will webclient but if you have other schemes that you have to support you will have to find specific providers for that scheme

702179
django	turbogears
but with turbogears 2 coming out which brings wsgi support and after reading up on the religious debates between the django and wsgi camps i m really torn between doing it the right way learning wsgi spending valuable time writing functionality that already exists in django and other full-stack frameworks as opposed to using django or some high-level framework that does everything for me

702188
addition	multiplication
the loop currently takes 11ms which i assume is mostly due to accessing the byte arrays values as the calculation is pretty simple 2 multiplication and 1 addition

702218

perforce	svn
in perforce you can issue a sync to none command to remove files from the client but leave them untouched in the depot or repository in svn lingo

702242
post	put
it s not enough to have one generic command like post put revisions for all cases starts a new revision resume the previous one

702343
gridview	repeater
repeater gridview etc i always implement the ondatabinding method for field level controls if i need to do anything that isn t built in out of the box eg

702343
gridview	repeater
edit note i am not talking about assigning a value to a control that is just on the page but one that is being databound to because it exists in a repeater template or gridview item template etc.

702441
gridview	repeater	listview	gridview
actually i prefer to use the aspx for controls that you would expect to bind like listview gridview repeater and other similar controls

702460
implements	extends
and then each of your threads will extends notifyingthread and instead of implements run it will implements dorun

702460
implements	extends
note that better would be to implements runnable rather than extends thread for notifyingthread as extends thread is usually discouraged in new code

702461
put	get
put all of the spawned threads into a separate threadgroup and poll the activecount on the threadgroup and wait for it to get to 0

702488
subtract	add
well if you can guarantee that the character set is ascii then you can just subtract the char from a and then add 1 only add one if you want to start counting at 1 instead of 0

702571
children	parent
is the only solution to ensure children cannot be more restrictive than their parent using generics ie myset child

that means you are completely free to implements your own membership provider or even inherit from and extends an existing provider as long as you follow the provider contract

702720
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
point is being changed between mousedown mousemove and mouseup so it has to be a parameter of a abstract tool

702728
inherited	subclassing
say the thing uses single table inherited so there are fancything and scarything subclassing

702762
post	get
you should use that will ensure that zend_form_element won t try to populate the element from post get and i d double check that also

702791
post	get
.asmx files can be called directly they are webmethods though you usually have to make post request unless you specify to allow get s in the web.config

702821

issue with setting focus within a wpf user-controls hosted within an elementhost in a windowsforms child mdi form

702850
vb6	vba
you might be interested in this piece on vb6 vba null nothing empty

702980
daemon	cron
more importantly i m frightened by the fact that my daily runs of git-cvsimport which i intended to put into cron or even write a daemon to run every five minutes or so might miss commits in the future

703017
getter	setter
i would have a private int field for the nhibernate persistence and a public getter setter property for the flag enum that read and write to the int field

703063
iboutlet	ibaction
in my controller i would use one ibaction connected to both controls and two iboutlet one for each control

703063
min	max
as said by peter hosey a formatter may be useful on your text field at least to take min and max values of stepper into account

703158
merb	ruby-on-rails
however especially larger ruby projects often have their own infrastructure merb datamapper and of course ruby-on-rails

703173
jfreechart	piccolo
if piccolo doesn t perform the plotting for you i would perhaps use jfreechart for the actual plotting since it s widely supported and very capable

703189
width	height
you give it an array of x points normalized of course you can convert your x pixels to these by dividing each pixel position by the width of your image and it will return the height of the distribution curve again multiply by your normalization factor

703204
bazaar	git
i d go for git or bazaar bzr-pqm is an agent that does just that integrate incoming merges

703271
django	turbogears
but for custom setups that need to be both fast and aren t particularly suited to the defaults provided by django or turbogears it s a great solution

703271
pylons	cherrypy
pylons pylons like cherrypy is a great minimalistic web-framework

703275
post	put
i started to put together a small prototype blog system to try out asp.net mvc a little while ago still a wip sadly and one design decision i ended up making was to subsume the comment controller into the post controller

which framework you use cherrypy django turbogears etc is basically personal preference

703396
int	double
an 64-bit double can represent int + - 2 53 exactly

703396
int	double
given this fact i choose to use a double type as a single type for all my types since my largest int is unsigned 32-bit

703396
int	double
but now i have to print these pseudo int but the problem is they are also mixed in with actual double

703404
firefox	safari
these errors are not occurring in firefox safari or previous versions of ie

703412
onmousedown	onmouseup
in the window.onload you ll see that i assign the onmouseup and onmousedown events to functions that just call the increment or decrement functions with your initial timeout or the cleartimeout function to stop the counter

703414
udp	tcp
we re doing exactly what jason says except using a direct tcp udp socket listener with a custom payload for higher performance

703419
width	height
height 480 width 360

703419
width	height
no combination of width and height works

703493
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
using uitabbarcontroller inside uinavigationcontroller is not supported

703501
integer	unsigned
all signed integer types have unsigned counterparts with the same size alignment requirements

703574
quicksort	mergesort
however because it s not random access it ll use mergesort instead of quicksort which will probably mean that the algorithm itself is a little slower

703577
width	height
what i m hoping to do is provide a star value for the height and width of the column and row definitions

703583
floating-point	integer
as to the other part of your question d as a format specifier wants an integer and you re giving it a floating-point number

703612
firefox	safari
this happens in firefox camino and safari

703626
notepad++	gedit
lastly i like colourful code so i like using basic text editors such as notepad++ or notepad2 or gedit to do my web coding

703645
firefox	safari
this works for me in firefox 3 safari 3

703693
rss	feed
feedparser provides an .id attribute for feed items -- this attribute should be unique for both rss and atom sources

703705
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this works in firefox opera and even safari and the resulting markup looks like this

703711
free	malloc
it s up to the runtime which is responsible for the memory allocation in the same way that you can delete an array created with malloc in standard c using free

703713
udp	tcp
so there is no tcp udp ip at all

703746
cvs	svn
i m only familiar with svn and cvs which have a set list of keywords but there would be applications for something like lineno or mylicencetext

703748
filtering	grouping
i m not sure this is necessarily database related since you could have a complex and expensive procedure more than a flag for applying a filtering for a grouping

703753
virtualbox	parallels
however you can get what you want by installing a virtual machine like parallels or sun s virtualbox installing suse on it and compiling there

703820

703829
lisp	smalltalk
done in smalltalk and in lisp

703885
width	height
first and foremost you re not grabbing the current height and width of the image

703885
width	height
in order to resize proportionately you ll need to grab the current height width of the image and resize based on that

703890
width	height
i think your code is fine but taking in the width and the height as parameters is where you re going wrong in my opinion

703903
domcontentloaded	onload
they ll then activate as soon as possible rather than waiting until the page is â readyâ which can take a long time especially on ie which doesn t support the domcontentloaded event so jquery has to wait for onload which only fires after all the images and everything are loaded

703922
width	height
note that the grid will dynamically fill the available area as your code stands and you will only need to apply star values if you define a fixed height and width to the grid and want proportional allocation of remaining space

703922
width	height
star value for the height and width of

703924
range	max	range	min	min	max
re-scaling variables to the range 0 1 by subtracting min variable and dividing by max variable

703944
imperative	declarative
anders hejlsberg also talks about imperative vs declarative programming which is a similar concept

703945
onmousedown	onmouseup
if you display a picture in a timage control that s the obvious first choice after all you can detect mouse clicks with the onmousedown and onmouseup events

703983
post	put
this click event will post some data to an external php script and then it should unbind the click events on all of the links so people cannot rate twice in quick succession. then it should put the data recieved from the php script into a span tag called #status

704017
profiling	benchmarking
profiling and or benchmarking algorithms and implementations in code

704035
ucfirst	capitalize
as i know strtolower makes the string all lowercase and ucfirst makes the string s first letter capitalize

use chr and ord

704167
linqdatasource	objectdatasource
i want to use a linqdatasource or objectdatasource with viewdata.model where viewdata.model is an string array

704198
salt	md5
i will say though that md5 isn t a very good level of encryption and you should consider something stronger such as encrypt with a custom salt

704209
spweb	spsite
the technical answer to your original question is a qualified no all spweb objects opened from an spsite are automatically disposed when the spsite is disposed

704209
spweb	splist
this means that it is not safe to use that spweb reference or any sp object created from it splist etc outside of your foreach loop

704303
cairngorm	flex
stack flex - cairngorm - blazeds - java ejb3 + pojo - oracle db

704321

704491
vsto	add-in
i ve developed an excel 2003 add-in in c# using vsto and vs 2008

int	double
now in form a there are two fields required that allow data input one is for quantity int and the other is price double

704523
int	double
you can t cast a string to an int or a double you need to use int.parse or double.parse

704528
int	double
it s a string and you can t cast from string to int or double

704548
put	get
it provides an eventually consistent guarantee so if you put something there is no guarantee that you will see the item on your next get

704569
hash	md5
there are a lot more hash functions than md5 to use for storing passwords in you mysql database

704602
put	get
i m trying to take user input store it into the string get a character array from the string dont ask why i just have to put this into a character array then get the reversed order of the phrase that the user entered

sorry for the cross post with this but i need to get this solved asap

704679
put	get
i would like to get some attributes from an object image in this string before i put the html into the document

704690
int	boolean
otherwise having a single boolean isadmin field or an int enum in a role field is probably ok

704748
jlabel	jseparator
in your case you can have separate methods for adding jlabel jseparator etc. so that you don t have to repeat the information and can have differing arguments

704847
post	get
the way to get around it is as suggested in the post and to use an ivalueconverter

704888
post	get
i would like to just tell the browser that while the request you just sent was post some_url the actuall resource that i m now returning is actually called get hello 1 but without preforming a roundtrip

704897
bmp	tga
i am thinking about package that weight something like 10 giga with a lot of bmp and tga files

704899
width	height
this is easiest to visualise in 2d -- if your current nearest neighbour is at distance x from the query point p then any closer neighbour behind a different hyperplane must intersect a diamond shape that has width and height 2x and is centred on p

704906
for-loop	loops
after that use a for-loop with -1 and increment inside loops

704969
serializable	deserialization
exposing a new user type to the framework requires a single line of code which creates an xml parser for the type as well as associated network serializable deserialization code

705003
rdf	owl
once that is done you can use rowlex to deal with rdf and owl

705032
jobs	cron
you need three separate cron jobs for that range all running the same code x in this case

705043
post	get
get requests are commonly regarded as safe whereas post requests are not

705051
implements	extends
you d have a class that extends thread or implements runnable and a constructor with the parameters you d like to pass

you have to download that put it where your build tool can get to it and then before the msbuild task use the loadtask

705120
int	double
just make sure that your parameters are somehow contracted #1 will be int #2 will be a double etc

705128

string.format is to format strings returned as a result of invocation of the tostring method over the object passed

705134
gridview	sqldatasource
i have a sqldatasource that is supplying data to my gridview

705143
cassini	iis
this way it doesn t matter where your page is in your site structure whether you re using cassini a web site in iis or a virtual directory in iis - the url will always resolve to the correct address

705181
kde	gnome
it s cross platform fairly efficient and will let you work with gnome kde windows or just generating image files fairly simply

705195
gridview	sqldatasource
looking at your code i don t think you re ever binding your gridview so your sqldatasource is never trying to select the data from your database

705199
pull	push
integrated with livecycle lcds you could have server push data to flex clients rather than pull based mechanism

705210
ssms	sqlcmd
then connecting with ssms or sqlcmd and run a restore

705257
freebsd	linux
for emulation of the network you can use open source products such as freebsd with its dummynet or linux with its netem module

705279

705322
folder	directory
the www folder is in my c program files xampp php www and i need to make a directory there

705349
inherited	properties
when using objects as hashmap s you need to use object.hasownproperty key to ensure that the properties is not inherited through the prototype chain

705358
folder	directory
you need to make sure that you give permisions to the parent folder to create directory in it 0777

705363
portrait	landscape
try using the landscape paper mode rather than portrait mode

705369
hash	md5
so all you re going to have to do is include a function called md5 that returns the md5 hash of the user s email

705378
fgets	strtol
if your example is representative that you indeed have a fixed format of five decimal numbers per line i d probably use a combination of fgets to read the lines then a loop calling strtol to convert from string to integer

705382
versioning	upgrade
on the client side show a message to the user if he she wants to upgrade to the new versioning

705463

learning flex and cairngorm at the same time is not recommended even by the the cairngorm folks themselves

705703
cairngorm	flex
it is definitely a very fast and easy way to deploy applications but learning the best way to use flex is hard enough and throwing cairngorm into the mix when you don t know how flex works might be frustrating but very rewarding

706457
bazaar	git
the python developers recently decided to switch to mercurial and as part of the process did some basic benchmarking of git mercurial and bazaar which is documented in pep-374

706457
bazaar	git
an incredibly rough eye balling of the numbers they posted showed bazaar to be 2-4x slower than either git or mercurial in the use cases tested

706457
bazaar	git
that being said the message conveyed on python-dev was that all of them git mercurial bazaar are better than subversion for the most part they are fast enough and the choice of mercurial over git bazaar was mostly based on the gut feelings of the bfdl and the attendees of pycon2009

706527

int	double
one way to fix this would leave the int2vec out completely although this means all int would be first implicitly converted into double

707261
executable	sfx
this is not the best way to do it but you might consider using executable sfx archive with both the .exe and .dll files inside and setting it to execute your .exe file when it s double clicked

width	height
the graphics2d method drawoval int x int y int width int height takes a height and width in pixels

monodevelop	sharpdevelop
it looks to me like that definitely is the case with sharpdevelop and monodevelop i.e ironpython can t be used to do design-time gui building

707511
client-side	server-side
it should be noted that the above confirmations are purely client-side so if you need to support clients that have javascript turned off you will need to handle all of this server-side as well

707526

708072
width	height
if you want your custom component to resize in a way other then simply stretching the height and width values you need a public setsize function

708072
width	height
now this works great when your resizing the component in flash but once you actually publish your swf file you will notice that it switches back to stretching width and height rather then using your setsize function i dont know why but thats what it does

708072
width	height
to fix this in your oninit function you need to take the width and height feed them into your setsize and then reset the scalex and scaley values back to 1

708080
cos	sin
the true north vector at latitude lat longitude lng is given by -sin lat cos lng -sin lat sin lng cos lat

708080

nunit	mstest
here s how attributes map from nunit to mstest

708683
nunit	mstest
i ve used both and in many ways nunit has a lead on mstest

708683
nunit	mstest
the biggest advantage of mstest is imo with the team-coverage integration in the ide - but you can get this with your existing nunit tests via testdriven.net test with - team coverage

708707
int	boolean
treating it in boolean context tells you if an error occurred - this will also cover things like it being unable to read in a valid int variable

708779
fflush	gets
you can output and fflush it gets to client before you end the script thus it s streaming

708785
hide	show
here s an example of the actual show hide layer

i have a site based on python django mysql postgresql

708828
implements	extends
if you add a class to extends the options currently you d add an enum item but don t implements mymethod you ll get a compiler error

708881
google-chrome	firefox
what garry said if youre using google-chrome or firebug plugin for firefox you can right click and inspect element and see a visual representation of how your elemenent is being sized really helps in these situations

708905
jar	manifest.mf
see if the manifest.mf in the jar contains the main-class attribute set correctly to the class that is supposed to be invoked if not try setting it

708938
width	height
cuboid here i assume that i can just subtract 2 thickness from the width height and depth and then everything looks fine

709465
nunit	mstest
i strongly prefer nunit over mstest

709493
min	max
you can then do a simple check on the min and max x y values to see whether the whole of the cube is visible

709498
nunit	mstest
we started out with mstest but converted to nunit

709506
post	get
that is to be expected because javascript strings are always unicode and functions like encodeuricomponent which are needed to properly format get and post requests use utf-8

709519
sorting	filtering
if you need a good visualization then go for excel where you can apply sorting and filtering and also have the possibility to create graphs

709592
min	max
try changing choice to sequence and put the min max occurs in the accountrowid element.

709602
post	get
this post can help you get started

709715

if you re using vbscript vb6 just move the ampersand and pound sign up to the top of this list and don t rely on this function to protect you against sql injection

709720
google-chrome	firefox
they do drop down in ie6 firefox and google-chrome

709752
put	get
also if you are encoding the text before you put it in the database you may get problems with it later

709770
ant	maven
maven and ant are possible solutions but can we use these tools to build existing projects

709793
stdout	stderr
foo runs for a long time without stdin or stdout stderr activity

709793
stdout	stderr
bar is a client of foo and runs with stdout stderr but no stdin activity

perl	tcl
note that if you re not a tcl fan there are expect modules for perl python java

709858
post	get
we are trying to get a client repro without much luck but in our case this appears to be completely network related or possibly some security software that doesn t like the contents of the post

709885
ilist	iqueryable
i don t know to do the same with iqueryable since it does not implement ilist

709919
opera	firefox
this seems to be a cross site scripting security restriction that webkit and opera impliment and ie and firefox ignore

709940

i have created a new sharepoint site on our moss server at and added a cqwp to it without issue

709945

710020
post	put
when you put items on your page that you want to be able to grab back on the post that are enumerated inside of a collection you ve got to give your things names

710096
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the above works on windows in ie6 7 8 firefox 2 3 opera 9.6 and google-chrome 1

710109
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it s available natively in safari google-chrome firefox and opera and available by using explorercanvas in ie which is a simple wrapper that makes ie s vml language accessible from a canvas compatible interface

710140
folder	directory
in order to share controls between web apps the only way i found was to either rewrite them into server controls or to use virtual directory to make the user controls actually in folder be in each project

710144
cassini	iis
this requires you to use iis for development not cassini and visual studio won t believe that the controls really exist but it will work at runtime and you can build just fine with only warnings about blahblah.ascx or blahblah.master path invalid

710150
richtextbox	textblock
make richtextbox look like textblock focusable false borderthinkness 0 borderbrush white ....etc

710273
width	height
i d do this with position fixed and appropriate margins and width height

710319
public	protected
you can set the option to only generate documentation for public protected classes but i do not know if that will fit your scenario

710322
interpreted-language	compiled-language
however it is also important to note that .net is not an interpreted-language but a jit just in time compiled-language which means it runs natively on the machine

710379
http.sys	httplistener
using httplistener will wrap http.sys which will give us some of the performance statistics we require out of the box

710403
factors	mean
on the other hand if there are certain factors that could change the behavior of this business logic then you should probably provide a mean of changing it such as xml configuration files that alter its behavior

710426
width	height
the big problem i found with programmatic skins is that the button refuses to measure the width height

710438
datamapper	activerecord
lastly if you have the freedom to choose your language you could try ruby s activerecord a rails package or datamapper or sequel

710442
spaces	delimiter
i would use logparser.exe you have a spaces delimiter entry that could be converted to a csv and then use import-csv in powershell to recreate a powershell object

710493
int	double
this prints derived.foo double - even though the compiler knows there is a matching method with a parameter of type int and the argument is type int and the conversion from int to int is better than the conversion from int to double the fact that only the foo double method is originally declared in derived means the compiler ignores foo int

710558
ironruby	ironpython
the dlr does sound cool and interesting but i m not sure i d end up using it much at least in terms of interoperating with ironruby ironpython

710570

710713
submit	submission
it sounds like you re expecting the alert dialog to happen on page load because you think the submit function is actually submission your form

710737
next	except
the rule is the const applies to the word that is to the left of it except when it is first in the type name and then it applies to the next word

710804
actionscript	mxml
then in the actionscript part or you could set this in the mxml too if you d like

it is an odd behaviour seen only on solaris that when i try to copy a symbolic link with the cp -r -p command to some other folder with a different name it copies the entire directory file it s pointing to

710943
stdout	stderr
where tomcat shows you the line number and gives me some information on the stderr or stdout this just shows the error in the compliled jsp file which is pretty much useless to me

710966
rss	feed
now i want to send a rss feed to the webmasters when a comment is posted

710967
ereg-replace	eregi
your ereg-replace solution is wrong because the ereg eregi methods are deprecated

spaces	linefeed
but what it does most of the time is replace two or more consecutive newlines along with any horizontal whitespace spaces or tabs that lies between them with one linefeed

710978
pivot-table	crosstab
what you are looking for is a pivot-table or crosstab report

710996

profiler	hprof
your kit java profiler is able to read hprof snapshots i am not sure if only for memory profiling or for cpu as well

711044
nsxmlparser	nsurl
i m not sure if you re doing iphone programming or not but for the record in the nsxmlparser class reference in the iphone 3.0 beta 2 sdk initwithcontentsofurl nsurl url does not appear to be deprecated

711052
implements	extends
in other words because bar only implements ifoo by virtue of extends foo you cannot use explicit implementation

711058
postgresql	mysql
you can t expect everyone that runs firefox to have mysql or postgresql installed on their machine

711079
postgresql	mysql
rather than bundling a huge db engine like mysql or postgresql with your deliverable sqlite is very lightweight and easy to include with your finished app

711100
udp	tcp
i m trying to find a simple tcp udp debugging tool

711129
oledb	dataadapter
suppose i have my typed dataset defind in the xsd file and now i m ready to create a dataadapter in code against that schema... by the way i am using oledb to access free-standing .dbf files in a folder.

post	get
my attempts thus far have gotten me to the point where i can display the data but i can t get it to post back to the controller

711198

sorting	grouping
sorting in gridview will result in effectively a grouping

711202
algol	smalltalk
smalltalk was mentioned about as much as algol 60

i am then adding an arbitrary properties to this new class int abc accessing it via a get set accessor that stores it s value in the viewstate it also returns 0 if the viewstate value is null i ve tried to access it without setting it

711348
subtract	add
will work because newvalues is going to be static when i need to add or subtract from the current value of the field

711377
gridview	rowdatabound
i don t think you can set a datasource like that try setting it on gridview s rowdatabound event

711406
coldbox	model-glue

711414
invokerequired	begininvoke
that s the interface that control implements with invoke begininvoke endinvoke invokerequired

711427
postgresql	mysql
consider using copy at least on postgresql - unsure about mysql

711433
children	parent
the parent contains the children so using the word parent in a composition relationship is also apposite depending on the type of relationship

711435
firefox	safari
if you don t want any text this works in safari and firefox didn t test ie

711467
stringbuilder	stringwriter
one of the constructors of a stringwriter object is stringbuilder

711510
copying	overwrite
i m using synctoy 1.4 as my sync tool and it seems to work fine when it s copying new documents from clearcase to sharepoint but it s throwing an error when i try to overwrite a file with a new version or try to delete an existing file in sharepoint because it s deleted in clearcase

711511
inherited	properties
this would really only make sense when you have a model hierarchy inherited where the view is showing the common properties of the various child models

711628
children	parent
the easiest of course is just to have your parent class object have multiple instance variables being the children

711633
rss	icalendar
rss and icalendar support

711674
google-chrome	safari
strangely enough this happens in google-chrome but not in safari

711683
button	checkbox
normally just a couple checkbox in the project properties i think under an advanced button in assembly tab

711687
subtract	add
but arithmetic methods are coded to handle over under-flows such that if you add one to smallinteger maxval you get 2 30 + 1 as an instance of largepositiveinteger and if you subtract one back from it you get back 2 30 as a smallinteger

711704
firefox	safari
it works in safari and internet explorer but i haven t seen it work with firefox

711707
google-chrome	safari
i checked your page in safari which uses same engine as google-chrome webkit and the page works fine

711712
super	self
the difference between self and super is where the method lookup starts from

711720

ubuntu	debian
there was a recent update to debian ubuntu which caused this error for me

711915
firefox	safari
it s working fine for both ie and firefox users but safari users are seeing intermittent problems

711916
int	chars
but we can also use a short int or even a chars

711949
switching	screens
you create complete screens in code or as .nib via interfacebuilder switching between them using uinavigationcontroller or a uitabbar

711956
daemon	cron
also i m making the assumption that this job is only being run by the cron daemon so we can use the execute bit to determine whether or not cron should run the job

711969
exponent	modulo
in any case most rsa key pairs use 65537 as the public exponent and the modulo is always carried as part of the private key

711976
folder	directory
as this is presumably the admin screens of your application you probably don t want to make the directory an application in it s own right - if you do you d lose access to the main application below it which isn t what you d want and you ll possibly also have to have a seperate bin folder under there with the admin .dll in

712014
int	chars
on the powerpc there s usually a massive performance penalty involved in using anything other than int or whatever the native word size is -- eg don t use short or chars

712026
updatepanel	formview
the problem i m having is that as the formview control is in an updatepanel the partial postback does not trigger the page load event when the control goes back to read-only mode and the edit button is not made visible

712043
invokerequired	begininvoke
the only way i can think of is to use the invokerequired and begininvoke methods that are built in to ui elements to help you ensure that all code modifying a ui element is executed from the same thread used to create the element

712054
haskell	sml
it is semantically influenced more by java sml haskell and a very obscure oo language called gbeta

712154

712172
getter	setter
if you use getter setter you can perform logic upon changes or access

712189
sudo	passwd
the first sudo will require an administrative passwd

712190
udp	tcp
the number of locations time as well as the way the location information is transmitted is it tcp udp etc will help determine the optimal approach

712195
getter	setter
i m assuming you mean exposing properties that would otherwise use getter setter - obviously there s a big difference if you leave all your attributes public

712208
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s 100 ajax -- supported in ie firefox safari and google-chrome

712228
httprequest	httpresponse
these include httpcontext httpresponse httprequest and httpcookie

712264
put	get
definitely try to boil this down to a minimum three-line program or so compile from the command-line then put that class into your ide and see if you still get the error and if not then change add one line at a time until you have the original failing program looking for what causes the problem

712297
put	get
edit to get the rendering time on the page would be relatively hard because by definition the page can t be done rendering until your time is put on the page and you can t have the time until the page is done rendering

712302
stdout	stderr
try just sending stdout to the log file instead of both stderr and stout

712378

if the block-level non-replaced elements in normal flow when overflow does not compute to visible element has any floating descendants whose bottom margin edge is below the bottom then the height is increased to include those edges

712420
noscript	meta
adding a refresh in meta inside noscript is not a good idea

712459
width	height
summary an embed with 100 width and height pushes its parents size to be 100 width and height of the grandparent

712468
post	get
i think the best you can get around this is by using ajax post whenever the user clicks on the submit button you can hook in that event create a json array of the things you want to persist and send it across

712468
post	get
the other way of course is to get all the information from the formcollection object in the post action

712514
disk	ram
i m not completely sure what classifies as activity on os x but if it s anything like linux i expect that network or disk io would count as would processes in the running state - that is to say crunching numbers or shuffling data around in ram

712532
installation	upgrade
oh and make sure you factor in patching scenarios upgrade installs with or without administrative permissions if applicable unattended installation multiple language support in the ui.

712535
superclass	subclassing
if you have a superclass and a subclassing you can hide the methods in the superclass from the subclassing by making them private

712535
superclass	subclassing
if you cast the subclassing to the superclass then the public methods on the subclassing are no longer visible

712556
folder	dir
for example i am at folder abc and i want to output the dir list so that the final text file will be named abc.txt instead of file_list.txt

712611
antivirus	norton
symantec wrote their own installer for norton antivirus 2009

712626
innodb	myisam
right now we re using mysql 5.0 myisam tables innodb was killing on space usage alone and suffering greatly on #6 and #4

712626
postgresql	mysql
we re definitely moving to at least mysql 5.1 if we stay with mysql for the next release but strongly considering postgresql

712626
postgresql	mysql
indexing is really our main beef with mysql and it seems like postgresql may help us out through partial indexes and indexes based on functions

712626
innodb	myisam
note on myisam vs innodb for us

712634
sudo	passwd
with the advent of sudo we seldom need to use a root passwd any more

712636
int	double
the problem is that your code has an int as the first argument and c++ doesn t know whether to promote it to a double or long double

712640
pop-up	dialog
what happens if the ide pop-up a modal dialog for some reason

712644
innodb	myisam
myisam is probably even faster than innodb for retrieval but perhaps slower for indexing index repair

712990
inherited	properties
i have a business object collection representing data from the database that inherited from collection and has a static method that calls a stored proc and then populates its properties with the data returned

713034
int	double
matrixvariable const qstring name int rows int cols double fill_real 0 double fill_complex 0 bool isreal true

713044
serializable	deserialization
the biggest bottleneck is likely to be serializable and deserialization of the data

713091
indesign	framemaker
if you need very fine control over typography you re better off with tex or a proprietary tool like framemaker or indesign

713145
ssl	https
use https or tcp over ssl depends on your communication channel

713145
ssl	https
i d say stick with https tcp + ssl

713148
sorting	filtering
for example you may want to add filtering searching and sorting operations at which point you will need to switch to list from collection

713148
ilist	icollection
a different plan would be to inherit from icollection or better still ilist t and then delegate to a private collection member

713155
hash-collision	key
therefore unless you are performing a lot of key based operations on huge dictionaries with many hash-collision the speed of key to key comparisons will not be a major factor

713159
g++	gcc
afaik all of the code in classic text the c programming language second edition can be compiled using a standard c++ compilers like gcc g++

713161
websphere	ibm
we re running a fairly complex app as a portlet on websphere portal server 5.1 on aix using ibm jdk 1.4.2

713169
postgresql	mysql
you need for example partitioned tables which are in stable postgresql releases since at least 2005 - in mysql it is a novelty

713180
csv	tsv
because it is diffculties to understand the csv tsv

713180
csv	tsv
marc will u give us a sample for doing it .v now ony heard the terms csv tsv

713189
serializable	deserialization
or the serializable deserialization or the actual client server processing beyond the data transmission

713199
httphandler	httpmodule
maybe you should use httpmodule instead of httphandler

713215
csv	tsv
probably the easiest route is to export individual tables as csv tsv

713223
octal	decimal
the hexadecimal or decimal or octal is just the representation of that value in the source code

713228
tcpclient	sslstream
luckily this is as simple attaching an sslstream msdn to your tcpclient

713257
int	chars	int	double
chars short int and long are of different size each just like float double and long double

713293
post	get
my task is simple make a post request to translate.google.com and get the translation

713308
websphere	ibm
once we had a project that suffered major gc problems websphere and ibm jdk due to heap fragmentation

713315
put	get
to put it shortly use decimal 25 13 and you ll be fine with all calculations - you ll get precision right as declared 12 digits before decimal dot and 13 decimal digits after

713361
implements	extends
so you can implements several interfaces and interfaces can extends several other interfaces

713388
codeigniter	cakephp
i am a fan of codeigniter but other options include cakephp and zend

713398
put	get
this technique is very used in web application for example in google when you put the first word you will get a droped down list containing the suggestions

713418
put	get
then when you do get to hasspaceavailable don t separately send the length because you ve put it into the data object

713418
subtract	add
after you check that the number of bytes sent was not 0 or -1 see the documentation add it to the pointer and subtract it from the length remaining

713448
mechanize	hpricot
note that mechanize no longer uses hpricot it uses nokogiri by default in the later versions 0.9.0 and you have to explicitly specify hpricot to continue using with

713479
subtract	add
you may add subtract an arbitrary integer and you may read and write

713486
width	height
height 200 width 400 status yes toolbar no menubar no location no

713539
post	get
if the only way you can get to that layout is through the form submission then you d need to attempt to do post to the server - however asp.net will generally refuse a postback from a different site - the viewstates etc will fail validation

713539
post	get
if you do have access to the code of www.vankampen.com then you could look at providing a mechanism to provide direct links to those pages or all a get rather than a post

713546
post	get
i can t use acceptverb.get on some asp.net mvc actions because when i use ie sends post instead of get

713558
restrict	shared
if you ve got a shared resource i would restrict access to it using a re-entrant lock

713575
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
anonymouse types only contain properties with public get modifiers and overrides of the gethashcode equals and tostring

713607
drools	jess
depending on what exactly you mean by business logic a rules engine such as drools or jess might be a more efficient way to implement them

713626

vs2008 is configured to go through iis for a variety of reasons cassini is not an option

713660
queue	fifo
i would like to read write from a named pipe fifo queue under linux

713675
int	boolean
the object is transformed into a python-like boolean an int and.

713703
boost	stl
the introduction to boost array a simple templated wrapper for conventional arrays which also defines stl-compatible iterator types and begin end etc contains some interesting discussion of their degree of compatability with stl

713712
portrait	landscape
i want to calculate angle of rotation when i am rotating the iphone from portrait mode to landscape right or landscape left but in yx plane

713712
portrait	landscape
if i will move iphone from portrait mode to landscape right by 30 degree then i want to move object 30 degree only but to landscape right

713721
lisp	prolog
take a look at haskell prolog lisp and an assembler variant at least

713728
hash	md5
add an offensive link and store the md5 or other hash of the offending image so that it can automatically tagged in the future

713801
postgresql	mysql
an alternative would be firebird which is not so flexible but in my experience it is in some cases performing much better than mysql and postgresql

713928
prepare	execute
the following code from shows a mysqli query being prepare and execute

713938
gif	png	tiff	png
i need a server-side script php python to capture a webpage to a png jpg tiff gif image and resize them to a thumbnail

713957
post	put
first as a disclaimer i think we would all be able to give you better answers if you post an example page demonstrating how the document is put together

714012
eazfuscator	dotfuscator
deepsea obfuscator has a nicely integrated experience dotfuscator also work and soon the free eazfuscator will also support it

714020
komodo	aptana
i ve tried eclipse aptana netbeans komodo and others and they aren t even close to intellij idea when it comes to javascript support

714085
int	double
.net also has value types int double datetime etc

714101
folder	directory
so looking at the above the structure is always the same - a root folder then two subfolders then an xml directory and then the xml file

714141
hide	show
the other thing worth mentioning about the sstab is the way it show hide controls

714147
folder	directory
rather than doing getfiles and doing a brute force search you could most likely use getdirectories first to get a list of the first sub folder loop through those directory then repeat the process for the sub folder looping through them lastly look for the xml folder and finally searching for .xml files

714147
folder	directory
the following code snippet will search a directory structure and find all xml folder inside the entire directory tree

714192
spaces	delimiter
assuming your words are delimiter by a spaces you can do something like this

714328
lan	localhost
i have a lan but no proxy server and the c windows system32 drivers etc hosts with 127.0.0.1 localhost are there

714347
cvs	svn
cvs svn git etc

714361
postgresql	mysql
which i found useful because it s a little more portable mysql postgresql etc taking into account the differences of course

714383
cpython	ironpython
it shouldn t do things that are impossible for ironpython and jython to copy. i ve seen reports that this is what kept the cool parts of stackless from being merged into cpython

714399
width	height
there s really no way to guarantee the width height of a nice non-monospaced font unless the application will be used in a very strictly controlled environment

714424
printwriter	bufferedwriter
printwriter and bufferedwriter by default both use the writer they are constructed with as the lock

714439
hide	show
and the following jquery function that triggers hide show on click for an element that is either video or text

714497
haskell	scheme
i programmed c++ for quite a long time but when i started learning scheme python and subsequently haskell a whole new world of thinking opened up to me

714574
hash	md5
i am thinking that md5 hash would be a good way to tell

714625
min	max
unless you are sure that the first and last on each line is smallest biggest you ll need to use something like list util s min and max

714646
put	get
i also cannot figure out how to put a bounty on this question but i would really really love to get this issue solved

714675
elf	coff	elf	dwarf
it s usually in coff or elf dwarf i get those two mixed up format

714703
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
according to this tiff is supported by adobe flash player and adobe air together with bmp gif jpg and png

714710
rdiff-backup	unison
to summarize i recommend you combine unison and rdiff-backup for an all-round solution to keeping your data safe and reliably in sync

714798
sorting	grouping
maybe let a couple users learn basic crystal principals grouping sorting summing etc and you write the stored procedure and they format it with crystal

714814
public	protected
package-private is stricter than protected and public scopes but more permissive than private scope

714864
tao	jacorb
we use remedy it for our support needs both tao and jacorb

714873
comparator	comparable
you might want to improve this class so that instead of the abstract isgreaterorequal method the sort order would rely on java s comparator and comparable interfaces and also would make the class use generics.

714889
subtract	add
now you can reference calculate add and subtract just by their names

714938
post	get
in this case it will be empty on post back and you get your exception

714955
vb.net	vb6
majority of time is spent debugging enhancing legacy apps c++ vb6 with vb.net applications this is why i m applying for a junior level posision and would be willing to take a slight paycut just to be able to do new development with guidance from a good lead developer

714981
hide	show
it will now control a div tag in the .aspx page to show or hide the records - because the onclick points to a client side javascript function

714981
hide	show
the result is show hide functionality of data with out doing a postback

714986
sorting	filtering
note that you have a range filtering condition over user_offtopic_count that s why you cannot use an index over this field both in filtering and in sorting by other field

715003
google-chrome	firefox	svg	vml	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
google uses svg in firefox opera google-chrome and other browsers that support it and vml in internet explorer so you don t need third-party plug-ins

715014
min	max
you can then do a simple check on the min and max x y values to see whether the whole of the cube is visible

715024
dreamweaver	aptana
dreamweaver seems to be popular but i prefer the free aptana as i ve always wanted to get my hands dirty with code to get the feeling of being in control

715024
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
your site will work better when the change to ie7 comes or a change to even something better like safari google-chrome firefox opera or basicly anything other than ie

715095
post	get
which means sending initial get request to extract all form field and then creating a post to simulate the post back

715095
webclient	httpwebrequest
there are plenty of samples on how to use httpwebrequest or webclient for screen scraping including simulating logins and such

715095
post	get
send a get request get data preserve cookies extract form fields create a post request recreate headers including proper referrer form proper post body reassign cookies and you should be set

disk	ram
set up a ram disk if you have lots of ram

715156
disk	ram
but ram disk will help if you have a known problem

715160
disk	ram
what nate bross said is probably the most reliable way to keep them in ram assuming the ram disk is dynamically created from a real disk somewhere at boot

715197
put	get
the best way i ve thought of to get around this is to put the candidate rpms in a completely separate rpm repository but this also gets complicated because we have multiple rpms coming from the same repository that are on different release cycles so we ll be trying to pull the release candidate version of rpm a from the new repository while still wanting to get development snapshots of rpm b from the development repository

715221
firefox	safari
safari seems to browse each item in a sorted order instead of firefox where it s browse each item in the order of the added elements

715256
put	get
i have my team review the project specs requirements and put together a basic preliminary structure to get them already thinking through the application and working out specific questions

715313
versioning	upgrade
per the debian policy manual my postinst script is getting called at upgrade and configure time as postinst configure old-version where old-version is the previously installed versioning possibly null

715313
versioning	upgrade
i want to determine new-version the versioning that is currently being configured upgrade to

715351
post	get
basically the difference between get and post is that in a get request the parameters are passed in the url where as in a post the parameters are included in the message body

715355
post	put
post and lesser-known friends put and delete are designed for modifying data on the server

715355
post	put
you should always design your server so that operations that modify data are called by post put delete

715355
put	get	post	put	post	get
other comments have links to rest which generally maps c r u d to post or put create get read put update delete delete

715358
datamodel	relational-model
in some domains those that would be better rendered with a fully object-oriented datamodel and that map poorly on relational-model you ll find that the two diverge quite significantly

715370
post	put
so if you re just getting a resource by id this makes sense but if you re committing changes to a resource you should be using put post or update for the http verb

715372
post	get
if you are passing on any arguments with characters that can get messed up in the url such as spaces you use post

715400
post	get
the difference is the same between get and post whether you re using ajax html form s or curl

715404
config	ini
the apache config will need to be set up properly for ini overrides to be effective

715429
try-catch	exception-handling
my question is how come funcb does not need to do a try-catch block around this java api method that throws an exception-handling

715509
ant	maven
i know ant offers that but i have not used maven myself

715530
googletest	gmock
i have chosen gmock which includes googletest

715552
firefox	safari
you could use the html5 workers api but that will only work on firefox 3.1 and safari 4 betas atm

715574
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
below exception there is runtimeexception also an unchecked-exception

715590
hide	show
you ll want to hide the click event item on mouseover so it doesn t show as well

715609
disk	ram
they are individually started via java -jar batch1.jar or some such. therefore sharing library .jar files only saves you disk space not ram

715630
folder	directory
the service account being used to run access the website directory security settings in iis has full control permissions on the folder and the xml file

715652
teamcity	nant
i then commit everything to svn and let teamcity run the nant script that executes msbuild.exe to compile the project and zip the output but the output is created in bin release and the zip file is empty because it looks in bin x86 release

715661
google-chrome	safari
on webkit based browsers safari google-chrome and others you can use the web inspector

715663
www-mechanize	lwp
make sure your lwp and www-mechanize modules are fully up to date

715670
boost	stl
it s just the right mix of close-to-the-hardware low-level grunt work to help you learn what s really going on with memory pointers and streams on one end combined with object design using high-level constructs like stl collections and garbage collection boost shared pointers etc on the other

715690
post	get
namely fake post requests require javascript to be enabled on the user side while fake get requests are still possible just with img script tags

715694
ssl	https
https via ssl is a tested method of doing this and it s a pretty easy fix

715757
grizzly	netty
it s minimalistic compared to grizzly mina and netty

715789
width	height
problem the build server has a basic video adapter and causes the forms to be truncated down to the resolution of the basic adapter rather than the height and width in the form itself

715789
width	height
one workaround that we ve discovered requires going into each form s load event and manually setting the height and width properties to the observed sizes in the form properties window

715789
width	height
neither does opeing the .frx file and converting a known height or width to hex then searching

715836
vim	emacs
i would recommend trying out vim or emacs

715932
sudo	passwd
this is generally a bad idea though as any user who gets access to an account that run commands through sudo without a passwd may be able to compromise the system

715932
sudo	passwd
also sudo should remember your passwd for a period of time

715940
sudoers	visudo
it explains all about nopasswd and the sudoers file which you should edit with visudo

715998
put	get
when following this method you have to consider all the available design elements that you can use to implement your mock up and make sure that you put them together in a well designed and semantic nature not just something that will get the job done

716021
folder	directory
the scenario to imagine would be something like joe sends you a large working copy with lots of nested directory and associated versioned .svn folder

716067
httphandler	httpmodule	isapi	httpmodule
in this mode asp.net httpmodule s basically have nearly as much power as an isapi filter would have had and asp.net httphandler s can have nearly equivalent capability as an isapi extension could have

716101
client-side	server-side
the deployment scenario introduces the potential to upgrade the server any server-side module the client and any client-side module independently

716104
ubuntu	debian
i would say that the easier to use and more complete free distros are fedora debian and ubuntu

716104
redhat	fedora
i switched to fedora when that project started it s simply the free open version of redhat

716105
innodb	myisam
although if you want to maintain the contents of your databases at all you re better off just using one of the disk-based storage engines innodb or myisam and just giving your server a lot of ram to use as a cache

716174
listboxitem	textbox
since the preview events bubble down the listboxitem will process the event as soon as the user clicks the textbox combobox or any other control you set the event on

716175
put	get
so i put one button on main window so when user clicks the button the datagrid on selected tabitem get processed

716226
firefox	safari
the above code seems to work correctly in safari 4 and firefox 3 i m not sure how it would work in ie

716243
for-loop	loops
enumeration is used when we use vector hashtable etc while iteration are used in while loops for-loop etc

716249
subtraction	addition
if the b operator models subtraction it really shouldn t be ambiguous but if it was addition it might be ok

716252
put	get
you can use the tostring method to get the string representation of a guid value so that you can put it in the form

716270
ienumerable	ienumerator
the .net framework provides two important interfaces relating to enumerators ienumerator and ienumerable

716333
punctuation	words
as such you have to be aware that funky punctuation and stuff can make it in--it s not just words

716388
for-loop	loops
a python for-loop has an unusual else clause which is executed if loops goes through all of the elements without a break

716398
public	protected
to make this work you would have a public or protected property on your page called showlabel which returns a boolean

716400
width	height
the height and width are stored in twips a device-independent unit of measure so you have to divide by screen.twipsperpixelx and -y to get the proper value

716412
post	get
there are some post about this matter but i didn t clearly get when to use object-oriented coding and when to use programmatic functions in an include

716414
google-chrome	firefox
contenteditable works tested in firefox and google-chrome on elements which are foreign to html xhtml if i use this doctype

716438
implements	extends
the second example here has some premisses that is that all car classes will either extends an abstract class or implements an interface

716438
implements	extends
both allow you to force extends or implements classes to define a specific function such as drive

716438
implements	extends
that is because they re extends an abstract class containing the drive method or implements an interface forcing the drive method to be defined

716438
implements	extends
so as long as you make sure that all your specific cars either extends the abstract class car or implements an interface such as canbedriven both of which must declare the drive method you can just call the drive method on an object which you know is a car but not what type of car without fear of it not being defined as php will throw fatal errors at you until you define those methods in your specific car classes

716453
drive	createfile
becuase it is a drive letter the usual way of reading and writing to a usb drive is to use file-system functions such as fopen or the windows createfile

716495
spaces	delimiter
it takes each line in the filehandler and splits it using spaces as a delimiter

716516
groovy	gpath
thanks to the improvements made in groovy 1.6 grails is quite a bit snappier than jruby on rails and you get amazingly good xml support via gpath

716516
vim	emacs
i use vim and emacs mostly because i can t stand using ides

716524
freebsd	linux
specifically i m looking for ways to be able to write and test a web-based application written in either ruby or python complete with a back-end database that i can then wrap up in a convenient set of platform-independent packages of some type for deployment on windows linux os x and freebsd

716557
rss	feed
i used the tag to add the rss icon and it leads to a page that provides a valid atom feed according to the w3c validator

716572
cvs	svn
i m not positive this use case is even relevant in git but noting a file s path and or revision numbers in the patch header included with cvs svn give me a warm fuzzy that the patch that i have received or created is diffing against the correct source or revision

716572
cvs	svn
i understand that revisions aren t as meaningful in git as they are in cvs svn due to the distributed nature but am i the only one who wouldn t mind seeing at least the abbreviated commit signature of the files in the header

716593
rss	feed
i ve worked with rss not atom feed in the past and have never had to change the header as long as the feed was formatted correctly

716625
mri	rubinius
rubinius is a ground-up reimplementation meant as an alternative to mri with a much cleaner foundation

716641
subtract	add
access speed is virtually identical to an array with the additional advantages of being able to add and subtract elements to a list although this is an o n operation with an arraylist and that if you decide to change the underlying implementation later on you can

716648
int	chars	int	boolean
don t forget that java has a fixed data types boolean chars int long float and object this include all objects even an array is an object

716658
strcpy	strdup
use my functions and copy information using strcpy or strdup

716674
versioning	upgrade
the migrations allow you to upgrade or downgrade the database schema from any versioning and to any versioning incrementally

716763
lisp	scheme
a usual programming exercise for students learning scheme a lisp dialect is to write a simple object system using closures

716780
post	get
then using the curl library in php you can make a get or post request to that url

716787
int	double
if you know in advance the number of elements and don t need flexibility an array of millions of int or double will be more efficient in memory and marginally in speed than a list because indeed they will be stored contiguously and accessed instantly

716787
int	chars
that s why java still uses arrays of chars for strings arrays of int for image data etc

716794
udp	tcp
generally the nat in front of the client at the tcp level will be able to determine that the connection at the udp was create

716794
udp	tcp
if the udp connection is created after the tcp connection by the server opening a socket to the client to a known udp port then upnp might be worth looking into it will allow you to automatically set up your port forwards on your nat that is only if your nat supports upnp as is the case of dsl routers

716794
udp	tcp
a work-a-round would be to client to open both tcp and udp sockets to the server

716794
udp	tcp
since the client behind the nat initiated the connection the states of both tcp and udp connections will be added to the nat s connection table

716819
mouse	keyboard
synergy doesn t allow you to move windows between machines that would require a silly amount of work behind the scenes but it does allow you to share a keyboard and mouse between two machines so they appear to be all one machine but actually run separately

716821
mouse	keyboard
it only forwards mouse keyboard events from one set of physical devices to different computers

716830
width	height
it says the height and width are stored in twips as angry jim observed

716830
width	height
don t ever set the height and width of the form at run time

716830
width	height
the vb6 runtime calculates the appropriate height and width from those

716874
rss	feed
you will keep refreshing all of your development rss feed all night

716891
many-to-many	one-to-many
by this i mean figuring out that foreign key relationships are a relationship one-to-one one-to-many or many-to-many of some kind the type mapping etc

716891
put	get
with sql it s easy because you can write a single query or a small number of queries to get all that data in one hit and put it in a custom value object just for that purpose

716910
put	get
put 74.50.106.245 into yougetsignal and you ll get a list of hostnames that previously resolved to the dailywtf server when people queried them not anything to do with the reverse dns ptr entry

716920
ready	each
qcodo is a mvc framework of code generator a lot of codes are ganerated from your database design and produce ready to use search edit form for each of your database table

716920
many-to-many	one-to-many
it also handle the database table relationship to pre-generate a set of methods for one-to-many many-to-many relationship between tables

716926
ubuntu	debian
same problem with debian unstable ubuntu jaunty both ship zsh 4.3.9

716968
jar	war
if you have a war file not yet deployed you can extract it using the command line tool jar or get a file listing from it

716968
jar	war
don t forget to copy the mysql jar file into web-inf lib before creating the war file

716970
google-chrome	safari
it goes wrong in a bizarre way in safari google-chrome and fx - the cell s size is calculated before the text is rotated

716974
google-chrome	safari
the new css transforms in the latest safari google-chrome and fx don t quite work either includes example

717008
post	get
you might want to first check that you can make get and post requests to the server first

717038
integer	unsigned
the vector s size is typically an unsigned integer

717044
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
my advice is to use mozilla as your 1st choice testing browser and every now and then test the page on other browsers ie6 ie7 ie8 opera google-chrome and safari at least

717059
integer	unsigned
as size usually returns an unsigned integer it should be quite safe to typecast it to a signed one

717123
shadowing	named
there s less code to read there s no unnecessary local variable introduced and no potential named clash with another local or shadowing of any variable with the same named in an enclosing scope

717128
disk	ram
my current development machine has four 3ghz processors in it 8gb of ram and 750gb of disk space raid 1 so it s really double that and two 19-inch flatscreen monitors

717174
button	checkbox
i am coming from a qt background and in qt i would use a stretch element between the button and the checkbox to push them apart dynamically

717231
webrat	cucumber
bdd is a testing paradigm shift especially if you start using cucumber and webrat but it s fantastic once you get into it

717237
uiview	calayer
i might suggest an alternative approach where you create a new uiview or calayer for each drawing operation

717363
many-to-many	one-to-many
there are a couple of additional lessons here about what it means to have a a one-to-many relationship or a many-to-many and what it means to to make an fk nullable or not

717367
subtraction	multiplication
my impression is that the above algorithm is better than the classic one because the multiplication tend to restore the loss of precision of the subtraction

717373
post	get
i m not terribly familiar with the difference between a javascript date and a vb.net date in terms of format but if you post an example i m sure we can get a basic conversion going

717385
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i have a property that changes to invalid as i move between viewdidload and viewwillappear

717385
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i don t do anything between viewdidload and viewwillappear

717444
postgresql	mysql
i am developing a php application that uses sqlite as database management system mysql and postgresql etc

717457
hide	show
the separation is not entirely clear in fact you can show hide view components or change then and that can be seen as altering the view

717471
gridview	sqldatasource
here is my markup in my .aspx page the sqldatasource is feeding my gridview

717489
try-catch	exception-handling
in this case the try-catch in methoda just elevates the exception-handling but doesn t really handle it

717524
itunes	iphoto
not document-based generally library-based like mail itunes iphoto create a subclass of nsobject instantiate it and make it the application s delegate and in the delegate s applicationdidfinishlaunching method create a window populate it with views and order it front

717552
hide	show
this textbox will then have the + symbol on it and clicking will show hide the your month-by-month breakout the hidden columns

717576
stdout	stderr
here s a related question using c++ -- cross-platform linux win32 nonblocking c++ io on stdin stdout stderr

717600
bitconverter	binaryreader
you could either use binaryreader around a stream or bitconverter with a byte array to convert an integer at a time or use buffer.blockcopy to copy the data from a into an

717633
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

717638
servicebus	masstransit
servicebus - for example masstransit

717662
freebsd	linux
i ve also looked at the linux and freebsd source but they are quite large and will take time to understand

717675
google-chrome	safari
however in webkit based browsers google-chrome safari etc the menu doesn t have a background and it seems like the padding is not being used

717681
for-loop	loops
why cannot i use foreach loops instead of for-loop .

717701
alloca	malloc
for example the arm realview rvct compiler s alloca uses malloc to allocate the buffer referenced on their website here and also causes the compiler to emit code that frees the buffer when the function returns

717703
post	get
the server confirms that post requests are coming through from ie yet it would get the post data only occasionally

717710
post	get
also i don t believe that post calls would ever get cached but just in case try setting the cached to false

717720
post	get
i can select the subject the original author the number of replies but what i can t do is get the username topic or date of the last post

717764
unsigned	short
because in vssapi.lib the first argument to shouldblockrevert isnâ t wchar_t itâ s unsigned short

717764
unsigned	short
once thatâ s done the lpcwstr macro is defined to unsigned short name mangling matches planets align and you can link

717815
for-loop	arrays
this function could take an arrays which could be nested into a 100 levels while you writing a for-loop would then require you to nest it 100 times

717859
ftp	telnet	tftp	telnet
curl supports following protocols http https ftp ftps scp sftp telnet ldap ldaps dict file tftp

717887
post	get
and hateos isn t limited to just traversing links using http get forms using post or some other method if the browser just happens to support it can be though of as describing a representation to send to the server

717983
udp	tcp
these are two different things socks is a protocol that allows you to route tcp and udp socks v5 through a proxy server and it s for outgoing connections routers dont have anything to do with this except they are acting as a proxy too

717994
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
i ve considered just storing the numbers with 1 subtract so for example 1.0001 would be stored as 0.0001 - but the problem is that to multiplying them together again i have to add 1 and at this point i lose precision

717994
multiplying	add
to address this i could use bigdecimals to perform the calculation convert to bigdecimal add 1.0 then multiplying and then convert back to doubles afterwards but i have serious concerns about the performance implications of this

717996
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
this means you can store the numbers with 1 subtract and instead of multiplying just add them up

717997
equals	compareto
i ve just written some code where i needed to implement compareto and override equals to get my program to work in a sane manner

717999
next	except
from the mozilla perspective the purpose of these changes except for adding more capabilities for use by web developers is to lead up to javascript 2.0 that is being developed as the next revision of ecma 262 revision 4 tc39 workgroup

717999
google-chrome	safari
also it may be interesting to note that webkit the engine developed by kde and used by safari google-chrome and several free software browsers supports javascript 1.7

718010
addition	multiplication
logarithms conveniently reduce multiplication to addition

718026
opera	firefox
what is more information on support in ie firefox and opera and their respective versions is available on all of the appropiate pages

718061
equals	compareto
this includes equals hashcode compareto etc

718086
folder	directory
you just have to convert all print statements in the console.py and platform_ info.py files under the python1 folder in your netbeans installation directory to use parenthesis

718154
folder	directory
maybe you don t need different folder in build directory

718174
mouseover	mouseout
the e in each of the functions represent the event object for the mouseover and the mouseout event respectively

718196
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
after researching it a little bit it seems that monodevelop was started as a port of sharpdevelop which is an open source .net ide for windows

718239
postgresql	mysql
i just want to re- familiarize myself with these different sql dialects and compare techniques and timing to the mysql and postgresql i do have installed

718247
tostring	compareto
i usually implement the compareto method as well as the tostring method

718256
vmware	virtualbox
for sql server you will have to get windows either as a separate os or in a virtual machine like virtualbox or vmware

718267
post	get
if you need to get data up to a server use a post

718291
many-to-one	one-to-many	children	parent
it seems a little backwards from an oo standpoint and obviously i realize that relational is way different from oo but i guess it s the only way to represent one-to-many relationships which feels like it should be more accurately described as many-to-one as the one parent doesn t reference the many children it s many child entries that reference the one parent

718293
system.in	system.out
x y via system.out and read in text via bufferedreader system.in but you don t have any control over what appears in the console as a result of user input

718300
many-to-many	one-to-many
in many-to-many relationships and one-to-many relationships with attributes ternary relationships etc. you have relation tables

718328
strstr	substr
if the number of options is small and you don t otherwise want need the extra flexibility and complexity of a parser you could simply search for each potential replacement substr using strstr

718356
move	drag
you can monitor the direction of a drag and move your sprite accordingly

718363
gif	ico
worse it tries for both ico and gif format for each

718370
multi-tier	soa	multi-tier	n-tier
web services is essentially soa service oriented architecture which can imply a multi-tier n-tier model

718407
equals	tostring
on objects that are used primarily for holding data rocks i find tostring and the equals hashcode contract to be invaluable

718407
equals	tostring
this is because rocks are typically passed into and extracted out of collections all the time most notably the hash set map collections which require the equals and hashcode contract and it is very easy to see these objects in a debugger if tostring is implemented

718446
equals	tostring
effective java has a chapter on how and when to implement tostring equals hashcode comparable etc

718508
post	get
it basically involves lots of ajax post get requests from each user to the server - which in turn translates to database reads and writes

718508
post	get
i know optimisation is quite a tricky specialised area but what advice would you give me to get maximum speed of operation here - speed is of paramount importance but currently some of these post requests take 20-30 seconds to return

718537
width	height
i would say a policy on images sizes pixels height and width is necessary as you seem to indicate that only some have problems

718581
int	double
don t forget to cast your int to double

718593
opensuse	linux
the easiest way now to get monodevelop is running opensuse linux under virtualbox

718596
equals	tostring
for data value classes i have an abstractpojo class which uses reflection to implement equals hashcode tostring and asmap

718596
implements	extends
i extends this class for all my data value objects so i don t implements this each time

718624
ilist	iqueryable
but to handle paging for findall i m debating whether or not to expose iqueryable ilocation instead of ilist to simplify the interface for circumstances such as paging

718625
ienumerable	ilist
i recommend using ienumerable instead of ilist with it you will have more flexibility

718650
children	parent
that encoded the parent of each node in the children

718697
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
an object is a variable of any type or a memory area allocated with malloc calloc realloc

718697
integer	unsigned
looking at things at a lower level a pointer is typically implemented as an unsigned integer

718697
integer	unsigned
in most modern environments this then becomes the same thing as checking for overflow with unsigned integer arithmetic

718728
typedef	struct
in order to have a nice struct i want to have a typedef to this function pointer

718792
firefox	safari
i am having this problem using safari 4 firefox 2.0

718793
firefox	safari
in firefox safari etc

718807
ironruby	ironpython
you could use a ironruby or ironpython script and utilise the system.net.networkinformation namespace although it would prob be easier to whip up a quick c# or vb.net console app

718862
children	parent
addlogicalchild will not result in logicalchildren returning our children automatically it only sets the parent

718934
firefox	safari
since the web site will be launched in about a year from now we skip support for ie6 and focus on ie7 ie8 firefox 3.x+ and safari version to be decided

718938
bash	tcsh	jline	readline
people familiar with the readline editline capabilities for modern shells such as bash and tcsh will find most of the command editing features of jline to be familiar

718949
google-chrome	safari
ie7 8 ff3 safari 3 and google-chrome

718996
pow	sqrt
if you need more things like sqrt log or pow this workaround will get too complex and you should really look for a library

719040
codeigniter	kohana
i am using kohana but this question applies to rails codeigniter or any other mvc web development framework

719043
boost	stl
however is there a less obtrusive stl or boost equivalent to writing

719064
ssl	https
in order to set up ssl and https i need to obtain and install an ssl certificate

719108
int	boolean
for other data types the compiler can catch this as an expression like has an int value so it can t be used in the if statement but an expression like has a boolean value so the compiler has to accept it

719152
width	height
there s no reason to define the width of your layout according to the height or width of a typeface

719159
lisp	scheme
their development environment was written in allegro common lisp and it included a compiler for a scheme a lisp dialect variant

719163
post	get
i personally see js requests just like get post or any other type of request

719170
subtraction	addition
also all addition and subtraction on that fixed-point variable was also fixed-point

719172
put	get
to get the maximum out of bricks just put them together

719180
x86	64bit
on the mac for example the 32bit version and the 64bit version runs on both powerpc and x86 from a single application

719187
sunos	aix
on the other hand autoconf used to be far more important when the target platforms were more heterogeneous and linux aix hp-ux sunos ... and a large variety of different processor architecture had to be supported

719227
fink	macports
the only issue is that if you use macports or fink these will probably not see that you have ghc installed and try to install their own version of it

719269
many-to-one	one-to-many	many-to-many	many-to-one	many-to-many	one-to-many
for many-to-many relations we can have have no relation a one-to-one a one-to-many many-to-one or a many-to-many

719291
inherited	subclassing
inserts will still be to the separate table usertype and usertype2 but then in oo programming ctors aren t inherited either and two subclassing of a common based don t necessarily have similar ctors

719322
free	malloc
you re calling free without calling malloc

719359
post	get
i figure i don t need to post the creation of three dropdowns when i can t get even one dropdown to work

719431
postgresql	mysql
every single time i thought i had them working i would get some random error involving the postgresql or mysql setup or the paths were screwed up or some other command line error not recognized as an internal or external command or something

719441
gif	bmp
i have an application that generates a replay of air traffic and i need to allow the user to capture parts of the canvas so it can be exported as a bmp of gif

subtract	add
just add and subtract your codes

719468
subtract	add
note that it does not necessarily have to be add or subtract

719494
debian-based	ubuntu
in my experience ubuntu and other debian-based oses are much more trouble-free developer environments for almost everything except c# and .net stuff

719497

719535
postgresql	mysql
for ror and django consider not using mysql and postgresql at this time

719537
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
that all works fine in ie fx opera - the code registers a document.onkeypress event handler when the box is shown then tests the event keycode to see if it s the escape key or not keycode 27 but this doesn t seen to work in webkit based browsers google-chrome and safari 3 though other keys can be captured this way

719545
firefox	safari
renders pixel-for-pixel the same in safari whose baseline i trust and both firefox and ie7 check out as good

719547
keydown	keyup
catch keydown keyup instead

719599
profiling	benchmarking
you can benchmarking in firefox using firebug s profiling and by writing out to the console like this

719629
put	get
i believe all macs sold in the last couple of years have been core 2 duo anyway and will all support at least 2gb - but it does pay to get one that will let you put 4gb in

719642
profiling	instrumentation
that being said instrumentation can be very valuable for the goals profiling is meant to address

719666
pop-up	dialog
asp.net pop-up dialog

719672
pop-up	dialog
the basic idea is to have the click function on the button pop-up the dialog then return false to stop the normal action

719676
kde	gnome
except in rare situations your keyboard and display are managed by a window manager x11 gnome kde carbon cocoa or windows

719695
getter	setter
define getter and setter if you want to access them externally

719709
libjpeg	libpng
libpng libjpeg and others are good for loading saving images at a low level but there are probably other higher-level image libraries as well

719713
bazaar	trac
if i would like to use a vcs like bazaar and use loggerhead instead of trac then right now there isn t really much choice beyond launchpad which has its warts

719742
aptana	radrails
aptana radrails is only as accessible as the eclipse ide and i imagine you would not interested in it...the k-force is weak in this one

719763
daemons	systemd
sqlite is the speed daemons of choice for systemd that don t make heavy use of concurrent connections and complicated database features

719763
postgresql	mysql
you might also want to take a look at mysql postgresql or mssql ce or express both free

719763
postgresql	mysql
edit based on your comments you will probably need something that runs on a server like mysql postgresql or mssql express

719788
inherited	properties
so if i want to use the memory management inherited by a synthesized properties i d use something such as

719797
awt	swing
shouldn t take you more than a day or two to learn the language but you might have to spend a few weeks on the class library how to use collections the concurreny package reflection logging swing awt dynamic proxies mbeans etc

719799
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the code works perfectly in safari firefox and google-chrome

719816
getter	setter
properties are just setter and getter for ivars and should almost always be used instead of direct access

719816
getter	setter
it s easy now to distinguish between ivars and getter setter

719827
mouseup	mousedown
the other tricky bits are handling mousedown and determining if its time to start dragging mouse move while dragging and mouseup for end of dragging

719836
actualheight	actualwidth
i could use an ivalueconverter on a binding object to calculate the exact center given it s actualwidth actualheight and translatepoint to find the upper left corner

719839
hide	show
this function looks at the state of the model member properties state and enables disables hide show whatever

719847
put	get
understandably you cannot put a lot of information into 5 minutes so hopefully this will give you enough to get going but if you have further questions please feel free to ask

altera	xilinx
you can trace activity on signals in a running fpga design using embedded logic analyzer software tools like altera signaltap or xilinx chipscope

719950
firefox	safari
because of the defined width select is cut off from showing their full values unlike in firefox safari where they are automatically resized to show the whole length of the value

719976

i created a folder devweb under the document root but instead of copying all the files i configured the server so that if a requested file didn t exist in the devweb directory it would look for it under the document root

720082
cvs	svn
currenltly we have cvs git and svn implementations

720133
hide	show
i am trying to trigger a show hide of one div at a time

720140
inherited	properties
in context of oo if you are working in a single inherited model there is an excellent case to be made for preferring interfaces over classes for defining your object model since that single super class pathway is fairly precious and you want to save it for something more substantial than defining properties that are exposed on an object or methods

720195
equals	gethashcode
generally speaking if you re overriding equals you want to override gethashcode

720195
equals	gethashcode
by overriding equals and gethashcode you can report equality based on internal values rather than the objects reference

720235
int	chars
the basic data types like byte short int long chars and string implement a good gethashcode method

720282
equals	gethashcode
when overriding equality you should always have a matching equals and gethashcode for two values if equals returns true they must return the same hash-code but the converse is not required - and it is common to also provide operators and often to implement too

720291
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
it works in firefox 1.5+ opera 9+ safari i don t know what versions and ie6+ using vml instead of canvas

720294
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
from everything i can see the uiviewcontroller s self.navigationcontroller is designed to always return the appropriate uinavigationcontroller as long as the uiviewcontroller exists within a uinavigationcontroller s stack

720326
inherited	subclassing
for example if one method in job2.pm needs to be customised i might create a subclassing customjob2 which inherited from job2 and contains only the method to be customised

720355
put	get
a variant way of doing that is for the constructor to get the current database handler and put a reference to it in an instance variable

720356
decoder	encoder
update i tried decoding fakebytedata using an online decoder encoder and could not load the image

720371
filesystems	ntfs
note that if you set a deny permission in the filesystems ntfs for a group like users then it will override all other permissions such that an administrator would be effected by the deny permission

720373
jobs	cron
i know that there is cron jobs for this on linux but that is not available on windows

720483
put	get
the closest you can get is to put a series of text boxes in the header and arrange them manually into a table

720495
width	height
i need to center align images variable width and height inside block level elements of fixed width and height

720539
width	height
it s not an object that can actually do anything or have any properties other than a width and height

720607
maya	blender
big names in the 3d modeling tool domain include 3d studio max maya blender lightwave and modo

720667
firefox	safari
i ve tried under both firefox and safari with the latest 2.0 download installed

720699
firefox	safari
also on each page i looked at these were written as html tags but were rendered as text by firefox and safari

720746
boost	stl
i would really recommend using stl vector or boost multi_array containers for this

720780
width	height
then you can access the stage s width height using

720780
width	height
note that there is no underscore before the width and height properties

720785
hide	show
i think i have sinse found a small plugin which allows show or hide the full path

720826
versioning	upgrade
this would allow me to display a message to inform them that they re running an old versioning and that they might want to upgrade

720826
versioning	upgrade
when one of my visitors is using such an old versioning basically i would like to encourage not force them to upgrade

720829
folder	directory
if you are used to creating a virtual directory pointing to the folder where your service resides that no longer works

720839
bibtex	latex
while it is possible to use make to do most of the work a specialized tool can handle the intricacies of latex such as rerunning bibtex a number of times to get all references sorted and things like that

720842
mouse	keyboard
the controller interprets mouse and keyboard inputs from the user and maps these user actions into commands that are sent to the model and or viewport to effect the appropriate change

720843
put	get
for such cases - this is what i do - i get rid of the code behind and simply put that code in my aspx ascx file itself

720873
opera	firefox
i also tried setting the option explicitly it s supposed to be the default. i ve tested in firefox 3 and opera 9.6 so doubt it s browser specific

721024
int	chars
enum causes c++ to choose an unspecified integral underlying type for you -- it could be as small as chars if your enum contains only small values though empirically most compilers by default will use an int

721207
int	chars
for asc you can cast the chars to an int like this

721207
int	chars
and for chr you can cast back to a chars from an int like this

721224
int	chars
given chars c and int i and functions fi int and fc chars

721224
int	chars
from chars to int analog of vb asc

721224
int	chars
explicitly cast the chars as an int i int c

721224
int	chars
from int to chars analog of vb chr

721224
int	chars
explicitly cast the int as an chars c chars i fc chars i

721224
int	chars
an implicit cast is disallowed as an int is wider has a greater range of values than a chars

721237
cdr	cons
you re checking whether the second cons cell cddr l has a cdr or not

721363
children	parent
i could save the parent first and then add the children on to it but this would introduce more work

721398
put	get
i need to be able to do common tasks like using the up one level button or put the control in file search mode get the active item etc

721431
factors	matrix
it doesn t sound like you d benefit a lot from a full digestion of a linear algebra course which goes into eigenvalues matrix factors other stuff

721444
hash	salt
it s encryption and from the sounds of things this is really more of a salt or cypher not real encryption. a hash is one-way by definition

721458
des	rsa	des	aes	rsa	aes
pycrypto supports aes des idea rsa elgamal etc

721493
pop-up	dialog
as i think about it more you could probably use javascript to load the pages as pop-up and then open the print dialog for each of the loaded pages

721503
gridview	repeater	listview	gridview
i want the photos to be stored in a thumbnail grid fashion when the user clicks on the photo it should bring up the photo on a separate page. - i would think any asp.net repeatable control that supports templating of the item element such as datagrid gridview repeater listview in asp.net 3.5 etc should do the trick for you here

721503
width	height
just set the image or asp image height and width as appropriate for your thumbnails

721563
gridview	repeater
maybe a repeater is better but you will be fine with a gridview if you are familiar with it

721608
subtract	add
all you need to do is find the sheet index of the starting page and the sheet index of the ending page subtract them and add 1

721609
versioning	upgrade
but i wanted to know a thing if i make a change to one of the dll files and upgrade it s assembly versioning from 1.0.0.0 to 1.0.0.1 but do not change the publish versioning it still is 1.0.0.0

721637
pop-up	dialog
i want to implement a logon dialog box that accepts a username password so obviously i don t want the user to be able to dismiss the modal pop-up

721738
post	get
one of the major benefits of going the wap web application projects route rather than wsp website projects is that you get the ability to have post build events

721840
put	get
to get aroud it have all the pages inherit from a base page and place put the master page reference there

721863
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
when you create an environment you pass the pointers to your own malloc realloc and free

721865
profiling	debugging
accelerating application development cycles with code assist quick fixes sql to java round-trip debugging and profiling tools

721872
mouse	keyboard
they also give you the opportunity to build your own and make use of the framework to handle mouse keyboard events and stuff

721878
dictionary	map
brute forcing use something like owasp dirbuster ships with a great dictionary - also it will parse responses therefore can map the application quite quickly and then find resources even in quite deeply structured apps

721900
lan	localhost
if you are using firefox and doing localhost testing or maybe even on lan you may want to try editing the network.dns.disableipv6 setting

721903
int	double
of course if operator+ makes sense in general for your struct then you d want to add overloads for using smystruct on the left as well and or make them templates so that you get functions for int float double long etc

721984
put	get
office workers are much less likely to report a vulnerability and are often incredibly sloppy in their security habits -- passwords get put into wikis and written down on post-it notes stuck to the monitor road warriors don t encrypt their laptop hard drives and so on

722003
folder	directory
my puzzle is that when i run the application via the ide and get it to print the current working directory system.out.println system.getproperty user.dir i expect the console output to be bin - instead the value printed is the projectroot folder without the bin suffix

722003
folder	directory
if i were to navigate to the bin folder directly and execute my java class the current working directory is printed as i expect it to be

722029
hide	show
then if rad3 is clicked menu2 hide and img3 show up but rad3 is still selected

722030
gridview	repeater
before you say it i m perfectly aware that a data repeater could do it but i m looking for the solution using a gridview

722056
hide	show
this becomes pretty easy if you use jquery s built-in methods such as show or hide

722079
vsts	tfs
since i do have vsts 2008 installed with the tfs client of course i find it odd that ssms express doesn t include support for it especially with the 2008 version

722100
integer	unsigned
operand with unsigned integer type

722100
integer	unsigned
then the operand with unsigned integer

722100
integer	unsigned
to the unsigned integer type

722118
versioning	upgrade
you need to update to the newest mvcfutures when you upgrade to the released versioning

722131
firefox	safari
firefox does not load external dtds nor does safari

722147
ant	maven
then use ant or maven to script the creation of separate ear files for customer a and b using the different properties files

722228
lisp	smalltalk
that s where smalltalk got it from possibly - since lisp had images already before smalltalk existed

722261
aptana	radrails
you might find that radrails aptana is an excellent choice - note make sure you look at the features and comparisons tab as radrails has many compelling features

722284
spaces	delimiter
what this does is first split the string using a spaces as a delimiter

722371
3dsmax	blender	maya	3dsmax	maya	blender
most of the engines to my knowledge have the ability to import models that have been made in other software like maya 3dsmax blender etc but i think the importing of textures may leave a little to be desired i could be wrong and looking at some of the demos people are making magic happen

722483
geocoding	geocode
reverse geocoding apis for getting city and state from the iphone s geocode latitudes and longitudes

722486
hide	show
i agree with doing this outside of the database that way other applications with different length restrictions can make their own decisions on what to show hide

722578
pull	push
your shared scripts can be handled as another independent branch in your main directory which your external partners can pull from and push to as a remote branch

722656
config	ini
his solution for the client command-line is good but the ini files don t always do the trick depending on config

722671
post	get
the solution is a pattern commonly known as post redirect get

722685
inherited	properties
to answer your other comment also this seems to have an effect on the text alignment of enclosed elements which requires tweaking to fix. that s the nature of how css works setting a properties on an element affects all of its children unless the properties is overridden by one of them assuming the properties is one that is inherited of course

722725
udp	tcp
and remember you only need this for lower level tcp or udp stuff

722762
mvp	presenter
you may want to look into mvp model-view presenter for asp.net forms as it uses very similar mvc concepts except the presenter is in control of changing the view s internals

722801
boost	stl
stl please no boost

722853
cos	sin
i have found this to be very useful when i need a fast implementation of sin cos implemented using a look-up-table for a sin cos implementation

722885
ienumerable	iqueryable
you could use the ienumerable extension to cast the list as an iqueryable and then use the dynamic link orderby extension

722922
free	malloc
however in c i can t handle malloc and free the same way

722942
solaris	aix	openbsd	solaris	openbsd	aix
it s been a while since i used a non-gnu system but last i used one neither solaris nor openbsd nor hp-ux nor ibm aix sed supported the -i parameter

722956
int	double
if it is skip it then use the istream operator to load an int double float or whatever is needed

722974
yslow	pagespeed
yslow or pagespeed - it is a firebug plugin it shows you why your web page takes time to load

722993
free	malloc
malloc and free are similar to new and delete malloc allocates new memory and returns a pointer to that memory

722993
free	malloc
free makes that memory available again so long as it s memory that was allocated using malloc

722993
free	malloc
the important thing with malloc free is to decide on and consistently maintain a disciplined use

722993
free	malloc
try to malloc and free a chunk of memory within the same scope if possible

722993
free	malloc
when you can t make it clear that what you re returning is malloc ed memory so the caller can free it

723023
width	height
anyways it s basically a table cell that sizes with the browser window whos size is the document size - 130px in height and document size - 50px in width

723033
vbscript	jscript
btw the visual studio docs msdn also include documentation for jscript vbscript html and css

723038
x86	64bit
however there was a reported bug on a 64bit os that my app was giving an error and the solutions for that i need to target x86

723101
post	get
this my original query that does what i wanted but get the first post not the last

723122
free	malloc
let it worry about malloc and when i remove the object let it worry about the free

723155
tapestry	struts	tapestry	wicket	struts	wicket	jsf	tapestry	jsf	wicket
what i would suggest is as previously mentioned to pick a framework and there are many to choose from such as tapestry jsf wicket struts etc

723244
filtering	grouping
filtering the 0 s before grouping

723253
x86	64bit
i run a 64bit dev machine and had targeted the build and release modes to the x86 platform

723329
goto	break
labeled break like in java would be better than goto for this purpose

723379
gif	png
it basically contain the emoticon image gif png

723392
post	get
once i get this working i ll post the code here as an answer myself

723401
keystore	jks
in java both of these will be jks although it has limited support for pkcs12. there are default keystore truststore locations for the jre as well as for each user

723426
interbase	firebird
interbase firebird and

723431
inherited	properties
i have a base class for some kind of user controls and in that base class and in its inherited classes i want to store some properties

723432
firefox	safari
however my simple solution turned out to not be so simple because the table also contains a tag which is not being displayed in firefox safari works

723433
post	get
mvc will require you have a better knowledge of the basic tenants of web development get post request html css javascript the result will be much better

723472
put	get
i also need to put a value in there to begin with since the date is loaded from a db once i get this code working that is

723472
google-chrome	firefox
i also tried google-chrome firefox and ie7 same behaviour.

723494
map	quadtree
more optimal then using a grid as your spatial data structure might be a quadtree because it logarithmically breaks down the map

723549
mockups	balsamiq
interface design can also happen in parallel and here too you should use mockups either on paper or using some tools balsamiq mockups is my favorite

723579
error-handling	exception-handling
the lack of implicit memory resource and error management garbage collection raii automatically-called constructors destructors maybe exception-handling force c users to write a lot of initialization error-handling and cleanup code

723579
free	malloc
you can only write so many malloc free pairs before you start to analyze the lifetime of every single variable you come across in every single language

723592
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
you can try it with this document admittedly not pure html but that document works in desktop safari and google-chrome and firefox 3

723607
pascal	delphi
we have released a new product for creating cross platform apps mac osx using delphi free pascal

723612
put	get
to take a quick stab at this without knowing which sql flavor i would say you need to put around your date values so they don t get treated as numeric values

723636
implements	extends
glassfish v2 requires you to extends some of its own internal classes that implements loginmodule or realm themselves

723667
cpu	processors
i seem to recall that the issue was surrounding how it would handle multiple processors and memory protection given that the entire microkernel runs in a non-priv cpu mode

723690
hide	show
1 not authorized access in which case the page should hide everything and just show the error message

723696
post	get
finally once we get this working mid may i will post video if able too and show you all

723714
inherited	subclassing
since with private inherited you don t have is-a no one will be able to use a baseclas pointer to a derived subclassing and you won t get the slicing problem when passinfg by value

723720
inherited	base-class
inherited privately instead of publicly as above and add wrapper functions into the derived class that call the implementations of the base-class

723742
put	get
and i had tried to open up two connections one for each server and using get and put to move it from server to server

723802
hide	show
because of this most people immediately understood that they could move between tabs we used javascript to hide and show the divs and a save would save changes to all of them

723858
client-side	server-side
you cannot just aribtrarily add text boxes client-side without having the corresponding server-side controls ready to read the data from the postback

723903
lxml	elementtree
you can do this with elementtree which is included in the standard library or with lxml

723948
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
then you use objectoutputstream and objectinputstream to write object

724010
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
what you want is to use the objectoutputstream and objectinputstream classes

724010
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
objectoutputstream has a method writeobject and the objectinputstream has a corresponding readobject method

724021
put	get
core animation also has the advantage that if you want to do lower level graphics or integrate quartz composer animations you can put either of them into a calayer and so get the advantages of all of the systems

724048
debian	linux
gnu assembler 2.17 debian gnu linux

724053
google-chrome	firefox
i tested your site in mozilla firefox 3.1 beta 3 internet explorer 8 and google-chrome 2 beta and the menus work

724094
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
malloc calloc realloc etc

724099
gcov	lcov
use gcov to create an executable that generates profiling output and then use lcov to generate nice html output for your code

724130
icmp	tcp
note that if your program is running with insufficient privs to do icmp ping then java will resort to using a tcp echo request to port 7 which will still suit your needs

i have a couple of divs with a class of .box_panel and i have it so that they on mouseover they go from 50 opacity and back to 100 opacity on mouseleave

729083
mouseover	mouseleave
the code i m using for the mouseover mouseleave effects is

729108
free	realloc
there s no need to free realloc at all

729110
keydown	keyup
yes many controls have keyup keydown propertys

729133
swt	swing
you might also consider using java with swt or even swing instead of c# but that will probably not be an option you re willing to consider

729166
keydown	keyup
it seems that what you need to do is to handle the textinput event rather than the keyup keydown events

729183
daemons	launchd
if you believe you installed it but it isn t working you may find that your sql server full-text daemons launchd service is disabled

729183
daemons	launchd
find the sql server full-text daemons launchd entry right click and select properties then enable it and start the service

729193
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome they line up fine next to each other but in ie the select box sits higher than the text box

729203
implements	extends
when implements the userdetailsmanager interface you have to implements five methods of its own and one which it inherits from the userdetailsservice which it extends

729220
postgresql	mysql
i do not know of any database that supports this sql server mysql oracle postgresql

729237
put	get
basically you use a regex pattern to get convert the functions into compatible strings and put themin a private member

729256
uilabel	uitextview
i use sizetofit with uilabel and it works just fine but uitextview is a subclass of uiscrollview so i can understand why sizetofit doesn t produce the desired result

729264
nfa	dfa
though the ecma standard does not specify the algorithm an ecmascript implementation should use the fact that the standard mandates that ecmascript regular expressions must support backreferences 1 2 etc. rules out the dfa and thompson nfa implementations

729393
queue	fifo
begininvoke on a winform control to make a call across threads will use the window s message queue which is fifo

729405
mouse	keyboard
i want to map a keyboard key press onto left mouse-button double-click and am looking for very simple tools or control panel extensions to do that and map key presses onto single mouse clicks too.

729437
try-catch	exception-handling
one reason which is important to me is that when i read a try-catch control structure in a software i maintain or debug i try to find out why the original coder used an exception-handling handling instead of an if-else structure

729518
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
enhanced for each loops the for-loop syntax is extended with special syntax for iterating over each member of either an arrays or any iterable such as the standard collection classes specified by jsr 201.

729518
versioning	upgrade
upgrade of jaxb to versioning 2.0 including integration of a stax parser

729518
sorting	filtering
many gui improvements such as integration of swingworker in the api table sorting and filtering and true swing double-buffering eliminating the gray-area effect

729533
min	max
any min max solution on c may not give you null as i think you want

729611
hash	md5
better use an unique hash md5 mt_rand

729618
cassini	iis
on iis not all calls will be processed by the asp.net handler unlike cassini the development server unless the call ends in .aspx .ashx etc

729677
dictionary	map
aside i had originally assumed that the dictionary stored a map from each case to the an index into another map for the return values

729775
ienumerable	ilist
think ilist inheriting from ienumerable

729791
inherited	properties
interface inherited increases the number of methods and properties for each level of inherited

729792
qtcpsocket	qnetworkaccessmanager
subclass qnetworkaccessmanager and integrate the subclassed qtcpsocket somehow this might involve subclassing even more classes the qhttp ones

729865
google-chrome	firefox
i have developed the code and it works fine in firefox 3 and google-chrome however it just doesn t work for internet explorer 7 8

729905
addition	multiplication
the user will give some input values for a and b and will choose what operation to perform letâ s say that he can choose to compute addition or multiplication

729905
addition	multiplication
the methods that compute multiplication or addition will be implemented somewhere no idea where

729942
for-loop	loops
though in performance critical parts of your application you should benchmark these functions versus the trivial for-loop because often loops are still faster

729943
setinterval	settimeout
they essentially try to do the same thing but the setinterval approach will be more accurate than the settimeout approach since settimeout waits 1000ms runs the function and then sets another timeout

729951
setinterval	settimeout
apparently the difference is settimeout calls the method once setinterval calls it repeatdly

729951
setinterval	settimeout
here is a good article explaining the difference tutorial javascript timers with settimeout and setinterval

729990
getter	setter
there s been a getter and setter ticket open in the djangoproject for a couple years now but no luck

729990
getter	setter
put your model field at a different name say image_field and write a getter setter pair using python s property syntax called image in your object that queries that field

729990
getter	setter
this will work for casual use by your functions but any calls from within the framework itself will obviously ignore your getter setter

729999
folder	directory
i have the following function that loops through a directory and checks for a specified folder and file

730028
hide	show
when i click on the visible row for a table i want the rest of its rows contents to show hide

730032
min	max
i want to validate an asp.net texbox with min char 3 max 10 and no special characters

730058
post	get
you can t issue a post request using jsonp only get because gets the resource

730068
min	max
be strict with specifying dimensions when using aggregation functions like min max mean diff sum any all .

730072
bids	ssis
alternatively if you built your ssis package in bids you can go to the menu choose file save copy of packagename.dtsx as ... choose sql server as the destination and fill in the server name

730129
folder	directory
what you can do is in the sharpbits.base folder that you download from codeplex there is a dll you can reference in the bin directory

730155
width	height
if changes in one editor need to be reflected immediately in another currently visible part of the app you could fake it by using a rectangle say where the fill was a visualbrush referencing the active editor and the rectangle s width and height were bound to the editor s actual width and height

730173
integer	unsigned
you can also get the first two bytes as a 16 bit unsigned number and assign it to an integer

730201
getter	setter
that leads me to believe i should create a getter setter for each piece of data

730201
getter	setter
unfortunately the getter setter pattern doesn t force the user to enter the data and without it characterization of the object is incomplete and therefore useless

730213
accessor	properties
if you need the validator only if the control is loaded with some data then you add it right after the data has been loaded be that onload or some properties accessor

730217
getter	setter
create a builder class which contains all of those getter and setter with a build method that returns an object of the class that you re really trying to construct

730235
many-to-many	one-to-many
note that if you re using many-to-many fields rather than a one-to-many there s built-in support for creating custom intermediary tables to hold meta data with the through option

730236
getter	setter
this will let you use getter setter without worrying that the characterization is incomplete

730259
x86	64bit
and if i had vista 64bit it d probably be under program files x86

730273
rss	feed
i m parsing an rss feed which has the time and date as utc i need to convert this into a unix timestamp

730313
getter	setter
but a getter setter approach has the same problem and this should be much easier to work with

730337
min	max
i want to validate a texbox with min char 5 max 20 allow alphabet and numbers and only 3 special characters

730367
setinterval	settimeout
both setinterval and settimeout return a timer id that you can use to cancel the execution that is before the timeouts are triggered

730395
next	except
this is fine except i also need to display the number of minutes and seconds until the next refresh

730396
asterisk	freeswitch
my first idea is to use asterisk opensips or freeswitch for the server and sip communicator minisip or linphone as softphone clients

730435
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the fact that i cannot find other mentions of this behaviour causes me some worry that i am doing something wrong - but my sites all work in firefox google-chrome safari across windows and mac and previously worked well enough in ie7

730505
ienumerable	icollection
the class currently implements ienumerable idisposable icollection and iserializable

730579
innodb	myisam
i am fairly inexperienced with the innodb engine and never experienced this issue with myisam

730599
webkit	gecko
all desktop agents use a specific rendering engine that is already built into web browsers thunderbird uses gecko earlier versions of outlook use internet explorer mail.app uses webkit etc which makes them virtually indistinguishable from the browser itself

730678
cvs	svn
if you use svn though you can also use cvs checkouts of drupal and other modules themes and the svn cvs metadata will be able to live beside each other happily

730678
folder	directory
for bulky folder like the files directory use a symlink in the proper location to point to a server-side directory outside of the webroot

730685
fitnesse	dbfit
there is a great tool built on top of fitnesse called dbfit which seems to take all the pain out of unit testing the dblayer

730813
division	modulo
of course modulo calculation isn t done like that it s done with division and a remainder

730813
put	get
in the library sense when you get to the shelf and the slot number you wish to put a book in there s already a book there

730832
cassini	iis
note the code runs differently depending upon whether you are running it under iis or cassini -- under iis the initial identity is the anonymous user

730857
equals	gethashcode
when testing for value equality is desired such as when using objects in collections you should implement the iequatable interface override equals and gethashcode for your class

730857
equals	gethashcode
if you implement iequatable you should also override the base class implementations of equals object and gethashcode so that their behavior is consistent with that of the iequatable.equals method

730870
post	get
the trick won t work very well if the chromeless window url is the result of a post or does a get that modifies state in some way on the server

730913
free	malloc
note i have also tested with new delete replacing malloc free without success either

730936
fgets	feof
the same is true in c with fgets feof et al

730938
free	malloc
if you write programs on c++ - use new delete instead malloc free

730950
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this works wonderfully in safari firefox and opera

730959
portrait	landscape
in my case i am using didrotatefrominterfaceorientation to check if the last orientation was portrait and if so load the view i want displayed in landscape mode

730971
free	malloc
there is no memory leak there but you should use new delete instead of malloc free

730989
post	put
i noticed that you rahkim commented on greg s post that you wish you could put his idea keeping the saturation and value constant and just varying the hue...a good idea into code

731003
google-chrome	safari
it s so very much not like a web widget set that i actually ported it to the desktop - - using webkit the same engine in adobe air google-chrome safari etc.

731020
imperative	declarative
what i want to do is to create a declarative and imperative binding so i can write

731049
hide	show
while i realize that i could just show the form off-screen and hide it along with many other forms of winforms hackish wizardry i d rather stick with the zen path and get this done right

731100
filtering	grouping
you may well want to grouping assemblies which implement similar functionality - colour contrast together while keeping them separate from very different kinds of filtering edge enhancing

731117
post	get
the certificate is a required part of authentication otherwise i get the error mentioned in this other similar so post

731205
codeigniter	cakephp
if you want to stay in the php world check out some of the common frameworks such as cakephp codeigniter or symfony

731205
postgresql	mysql
for example try picking up postgresql to have as an alternative to mysql and python django as an alternative to php

731230
children	parent
without knowing your domain it s hard to confirm this but defining equality between two parent based on their children relationship back to them seems a bit smelly

731230
children	parent
do your children really have a unique id in and of themselves or are they really defined by their parent and its relationship to their siblings

731233
activemq	rabbitmq
we d be interested to hear any experiences with the pros and cons of activemq vs rabbitmq vs zeromq

731251
fink	macports
launch is in fink and macports too

731263
webclient	httpwebrequest
i m looking to understand when to use a wcf services instead of just using webclient or httpwebrequest

731269
post	get
on post back and on initial request for that matter controlparemeter s view state is evaluated only to see if it changed so that the onparameterchanged event could get fired

731289
webclient	httpwebrequest
i m currently using wcf for most of the things that i would use webclient or httpwebrequest httpwebresponse in the past

731301
inherited	subclassing
inherited and implement the abstract method calculate in each subclassing here you ll see that both methods are the same but let s continue

731336
inherited	properties
i think that the common properties are inherited from the parent container so if you change the font size and style in the parent form it will change the default to the new child controls

731451
cassini	iis
are you using visual studio and cassini locally and iis remotely

731491
int	chars
int values are easier for sql server to deal with then chars values

731546
firefox	safari
it is coming out as desired in firefox and ie but oddly enough safari is acting up

731546
firefox	safari
now it looks fine on safari on my macbook but not on safari on my pc or in firefox for that matter

731587
getter	setter
this assumes that your bean has getter and setter for a city property which you have already implemented

731589
equals	gethashcode
i ve overridden equals and gethashcode in an abstract base class to implement value equality based on an object s key property

731611
google-chrome	safari
i haven t got safari so i cannot test although i m using google-chrome but the problem is probably coming from the

731613
equals	gethashcode
so there is no need to override equals and gethashcode because this is the same identity you want to implement

731625
setinterval	settimeout
for example if we represent a call to settimeout setinterval with

731625
setinterval	settimeout
in terms of browser compatibility settimeout predates setinterval but all browsers you will meet today support both

731626
ienumerable	ilist
observablecollection doesn t have a constructor that will take an ilist or ienumerable as a parameter so i can t simple new one up

731632
post	get
according to this usenet post you only get redirection if you have a console

731652
django	turbogears
this is easy to do in python -- use django or turbogears or any python-based web framework

731657
hide	show
note that i know audiences can also be used to hide show web parts but that is not something i am interested in

731673
serializable	deserialization
or another way to put it data mapping binding is not quite the same as object serializable deserialization latter tries to preserve more of object identity

731693
activemq	rabbitmq
testing of activemq rabbitmq etc

731695
hash	md5
with server 2000 domains there s an option for store passwords in reversible format - that will allow a domain controller to calculate md5 hash of the password to compare against your presented md5 hash

731695
hash	md5
ldap signon should select md5 digest as the authentication type supply the username and then supply the md5 hash of the password

731747
children	parent
a better solution would be for all of your grandparents parent and children all be the same class with two extra methods- hasparent boolean and haschild boolean

731844
mouseover	mouseout
the code basically sets alternating table rows to have a different css class and adds a mouseover and mouseout event change to a third css class highlighting the row under the mouse

731857
integer	unsigned
interpreted as unsigned integer it is +4 but we have to interpret it as signed integer -4

731862
subtract	add
add one to the magnitude of all even numbers subtract one from the magnitude of all odd numbers

731862
min	max
there are some cases where this won t work -1 max or min int but it works a lot better than anything else suggested so far

731864
floating-point	integer
for instance numbers should be stored using integer or floating-point types not strings because you can do math with numeric types but not with strings although it s easy enough to parse a number into a string that this is not a big deal

731871
mouseover	mouseout
2 attaches a mouseover and mouseout event to the row so the row changes background color when the user mouses over it

731879
mouseover	mouseout
mouseout row - the reverse of mouseover restores the old class name and background colour

731989
int	boolean
that means i want proper int boolean and nulls and i don t want extra object wrappers or something that tries to capture the entire xml infoset

731993
stackless	multiprocess
people told me to use the multiprocess package i checked it out and it looks good but i also heard that processes unlike threads can t share a lot of information and i think my program will need to share a lot of information. additionally i also heard about stackless python is it a separate option

732001
gif	png
this microsoft article has some information about gif files that should be relevant to png also

732006
button	checkbox
if i select the platform pocket pc 2003 and go to form view i get a long list of device controls button checkbox combobox etc.

732026
udp	tcp
if you do decided on using processed sharing information between sub processes can be accomplished in several ways tcp udp connections shared memory or pipes

732069
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
i have to add subtract multiplying divide 2 objects from the polynom class

732111
getter	setter
if you extend text you can add a getter setter that allows you to set the stylesheet of the underlying uitextfield object

732116
put	get
a server is another architecture where multiple client processes get and or put information into a central server

732126
hide	show
you best bet is probably to create a custom control by inheriting from the gridview class adding the required columns and exposing a meaningful property to show hide a particular column

732132
rowdatabound	datalist
i prefer to do all my rowbinding type methods in code behind as opposed to inline so i then consume the rowdatabound event of my datalist and simply bind the url property accordingly

732164
post	get
if the adminuserposts and ordinaryuserposts are written to the table post and the type column is correct you should get the subclass behavior you expect

732216
profiling	debugging
it sounds like you are looking more-so for debugging or profiling tools such as gdb and its various front-ends xgdb ddd and and gprof

732216
valgrind	memcheck	valgrind	glibc
memory bounds checking tools like electric fence glibc s memcheck valgrind and mudflap might help if this is a memory or pointer issues

732222
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked on responses

732240
subtract	add
the monomial will only allow you to add or subtract terms whose exponents are equal

732267
hash	salt
if you look in the database you will see a password hash and a salt hash

732270
ia-32	x86
this is due to the libc the standard c library which by default on a x86 ia-32 linux system is 32-bit functions provided by glibc gnu s c library

732281
ienumerable	iqueryable
please note i am not asking how to implement such a provider or how to write my iqueryable or ienumerable in such a way that allows recursion

732333
free	malloc
as it is now callers rely on knowledge that dvector is implemented using malloc and that free is the appropriate release call

732395
draggable	droppable
you can make certain elements of your page draggable others droppable then handle the events when the user drags an element around

732416
post	get
this way it doesn t matter if your posting method is either post or get

732431
cyberduck	winscp
then you ll be able to connect with any client that supports sftp cyberduck on mac winscp on windows

732434
client-side	server-side
from your comment on craig s mention of jqgrid you re either going to want to go with jqgrid flexigrid or another client-side alternative and wire it up server-side yourself or you will be better off with a non-jquery based commercial ajax grid component

732451
3-tier	n-tier
i don t agree with you that entity objects make the code harder to maintain actually the whole purpose of this architecture is to make it to easier to maintain and modify your code and this is what i see in practice i wrote spaghetti code for a long time didn t use 3-tier or n-tier architectures so i know what i m talking about

732466
disk	ram
if that is the case get a faster disk but first check that you re getting the most out of your existing one...some linux distributions don t optimize disk access out of the box hdparm stage the data into memory say by copying it to a ram disk ahead of time or be prepared to wait

732475
webkit	gecko
you can also write your client using c c++ with an embedded browser like gecko or webkit within it

732494
disk	ram
you might try minimizing the amount of time you spend reading from the disk by reading large amounts of data into ram then working on that

732494
disk	ram
sorta like the way cpu cache minimizes the time the cpu actually goes back to ram you could use ram to minimize the number of times you actually go to disk

732528
postgresql	mysql
for a db mysql is the sexy pick but postgresql is superior

732528
innodb	myisam
with mysql some features you want are in innodb and some are in myisam

732528
postgresql	mysql
postgresql performance has greatly imnproved with the version 8 release same as mysql now and has a nice windows installer finally

732540
joystick	keyboard
if you want to go for polling the joystick just because you are not able to capture the keyboard event i think you need to re-work your strategy

732542
comparator	comparable
look into the comparator and comparable interfaces

732542
comparator	comparable
your sort method should take comparator or you should specify t extends comparable so that the comparable interface can be used

732554
mouse	keyboard
use something like ahk auto hotkey it is a simple language that can be compiled to an exe and is designed for automating the keyboard and mouse

732559
joystick	wii	joystick	keyboard	mouse	joystick	mouse	keyboard
use something like ahk auto hotkey it is a simple language that can be compiled to an exe and is designed for automating the keyboard and mouse i m not 100 sure how well it works with a joystick but i m sure it s possible they managed to write some stuff for the wii remotes

732560
merb	ruby-on-rails
i am learning ruby-on-rails and have very little idea about sinatra merb

732574
pylons	turbogears	pylons	web2py	web.py	turbogears	web.py	web2py	web.py	pylons	turbogears	web2py
pylons and turbogears offer enormous flexibility and focus on best of breed components web2py appears to have a very cool dal orm that i m itching to dig into and web.py and werkzeug amongst others are minimalistic and don t try to dictate how you should build your app

732591
prepare	execute
now when you execute you will insert the number into the space reserved for your prepare statement

732595
merb	ruby-on-rails
merb is being merged into ruby-on-rails so pretty soon there shouldn t really be any reason to use one over the other

732602
g++	gcc
gcc v4.3 vs g++ v4.3 reduced to simplest case used nothing but simple flags

732608
g++	gcc
the g++ compiler must be doing something different from the gcc compiler

732617
free	malloc
i want to make my own malloc free so i can make a precise copying allocator

732620
int	double
off hand i thought that double could represent all int within their bounds exactly

732632
g++	gcc
when compiled with gcc and g++ the only difference i see is within the first 4 lines

732640
prepare	execute
the speedup comes when you prepare a statement once and then execute it many times

732701
getter	setter
if i extend it do i then also have to make sure to overwrite the actual delegate getter setter

732708
rar	zip
zip rar have overhead to store things like filenames

732722
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
it doesn t have things like getelementsbytagname or getelementbyid but if you know xpath you can still do that kind of thing with simplexml

732725
mp3	wav
so on your wav mp3 file you are at best going to be able to hear up tp 22 khz frequencies

732725
mp3	ogg
formats like mp3 and ogg are have to be decompressed before you can work with them

732749
gif	png	tiff	png
bitmap gif png and tiff are some of the common image types supported

732784
int	double
because 57 is an int and 57.0 is a double

732803
int	double
a sample can be represented as an int number usually 8 12 16 24 or 32 bits or a floating point number 16 bit float or 32 bit double

732837
mvp	presenter
of what i know of the mvp pattern the ui is simply that appearance and all the heavy lifting is done in the presenter

732863
hide	show
if you need to go the extra mile do as the other suggested and hide disable the link also in the tag and use jquery to show enable it

732870
implements	extends	inherited	subclassing
and then you have a subclassing b which extends a b cannot implements because b already implements inherited from a and a class cannot implements an interface twice

732935
equals	gethashcode
if you override equals you must override gethashcode as well

732995
maven	cobertura
in our project we run both junits and cobertura using maven

733017
firefox	safari
some of the most end-user visible innovation has come from a new browser war examples would be html5 several vendors canvas apple xmlhttprequest microsoft s outlook web access team input range safari s built-in rss reader and the video element firefox --these came from the proprietary level on up not from the standards tower on down

733075
profiler	gprof
it might interest you to know that an execution profiler like gprof does exactly what you re asking about - it tracks the amount of time spent executing each function

733170
g++	gcc
i also do not want to install cygwin for g++ gcc

733188
hash	md5
if you use an md5 hash of the image data as the file name for example you can prevent people from uploading duplicate images and you also don t have to think of a way to generate unique names for the images

733241
preorder	inorder	preorder	postorder	postorder	inorder
what you need is a basic tree traversal function preorder inorder or postorder -- this doesn t matter and a filter function

733277
listview	gridview
how to create a gridview like view to the wpf listview if i dont know the column names at the design time because the collection will be created at runtime and the collection will be of type datatable and it may contain a no.of columns.i can do it with wpf datagrid but i want to achieve this with wpf listview and i want to achieve this without code behind

733306
lisp	scheme
it depends on what you mean by scripting language. it isn t commonly viewed that way but many scheme implementations seem to fit the bill as well as python and lisp is sort of the archetypal functional language

733310
implements	extends
your application must then implements a class that extends the midlet class

button	checkbox
as it is stated there glui is a glut-based c++ user interface library which provides controls such as button checkbox radio button and spinners to opengl applications

733333
mouse	keyboard
next your usb keyboard and mouse will stop working

733343
post	get
i had a problem on the server side and after analizing the output with firebug i noticed that the request turns out to be a get instead of a post

733359
post	get
note from the documentation the method type is in uppercase get post

733419
opera	safari
check the site quickly in safari and opera to make sure design has no flaws there

733474
int	double
a c++ version probably bending the rules somewhat but works for all numeric types floats int double and even class types that overload the unary minus

733616
ssl	https
ssl https will encrypt this request for you to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks

733673
merb	ruby-on-rails
as mentioned already merb 2.0 and ruby-on-rails 3.0 are going to be the same thing

733673
merb	ruby-on-rails
the newly-combined merb and ruby-on-rails core teams are already at work on achieving that

733673
merb	ruby-on-rails
if you re dead set on using an orm other than activerecord for example you might start with merb now and update when 2.0 ruby-on-rails 3.0 ships

733673
merb	ruby-on-rails
right now merb is generally accepted to provide a better framework for varying one s components than ruby-on-rails

733673
merb	ruby-on-rails
sinatra looks like a brilliant solution for a web app that has low interface complexity and somewhat lower model-level code than would be normal for merb ruby-on-rails

733673
merb	ruby-on-rails
again with ruby-on-rails and hence merb soon now sitting on top of rack there s no reason not to include baby sinatra apps into the solution they can live together

733686
portrait	landscape
the thing i want is the first view will always be portrait no matter how u rotate the phone especially when back from second view and it was in landscape

733715
profiler	aqtime
you ll need to narrow it down by using a profiler such as jetbrain s dottrace or automated qa s aqtime

733725
width	height
i ended up using clearfix this allows me to set the desired width of the container and it s height will be adjusted automatically depending on the contents this works in all browsers

733754
inline	inlining
in the cases where the function call is unambiguous and the function a suitable candidate for inlining the compiler is smart enough to inline the code anyway

733757
wan	lan
your questions helped me to get around the problem when i change from lan to wan

733761
min	max
this assumes acthec is the same for all tasknames otherwise you ll need to pick a rule such as min or max

733777
postgresql	mysql
postgresql and mysql is often sufficient

733787
inherited	properties
so if possible i would need a way to define that everything that inherited from entity will have the id properties and that this will work with the linq to sql datacontext without cheating

733788
globalization	localization
easy localization and globalization with the .net framework

733794
unix	bsd	unix	solaris	solaris	bsd
my case in particular is with solaris servers but generic unix bsd tools are more than welcome

733828
gridview	linqdatasource
i have a gridview with linqdatasource

733886
srp	principles
following srp and kiss principles i designed an object with properties only but i need methods to work with the objects

733921
int	boolean
at once into c arrays especially for the int and boolean

733925
free	malloc
to reset the state of the heap you have to call free for every malloc call

733936
gridview	detailsview
you may want to look at gridview detailsview repeaters etc

733968
pop-up	dialog
button on the .net framework components tab in the dialog that pop-up might take a few seconds for it to show

733972
postgresql	mysql
if you want a fast free alternative to ms sql then postgresql may be a good choice - it is fast reliable and has a more open licence if you use mysql for a commercial project you ll want to read its dual licence very carefully

733972
postgresql	mysql
the only downside to postgresql is that it shares some of the same dba guru requirements as oracle where as ms sql can often be managed by a regular it person and mysql doesn t need much management besides restoring the old backups everytime it decides to become corrupted and lose your data

733995
x86	64bit
the application did work on the 64bit platform we just needed to specify x86 for the cpu which sort of defeats the purpose

734018
folder	directory
this can happen if you use import existing projects into workspace that are folder in the file system without the copy into workspace checkbox checked or if you create a project using an existing directory

734049
width	height
_pub.html img width this.width height this.height constrain true can_resize false

734071
hid	keyboard
this should show you the list of things you can get out in of a keyboard through hid

734088
passenger	thin
at the minimum you should consider using the rack middleware to make life easier for you - connect your app to rack and use rack to host the site through passenger thin mongrel etc

734147
uiview	uiwindow
uiwindow uiview and all uiview

734149
dpkg	apt
if you want an apt interface onto open source projects look at fink a dpkg system for mac os x with various open source packages

734207
ubuntu	debian
it is only available on some linux-based platforms like debian and ubuntu

734207
fink	macports
mac os x has two similar utilities fink and macports

734243
versioning	upgrade
general rule seems to be that a new versioning is an upgrade and is thus worthwhile

734243
versioning	upgrade
upgrading compiler versioning could well be a project in its own right make sure you have stable code and good tests before you do an upgrade and when you finish prove that it is still working the same

734256
folder	directory
i have several branches in my svn sometimes it is very small branch and it is nice to have it in the same directory but sometimes these branches grow big and it is nice to move the whole thing to another folder

734266
getdate	datepart
print right datepart year getdate 2 --string with leading zero

734266
getdate	datepart
print convert int right datepart year getdate 2 --int

734266
getdate	datepart
print datepart year getdate 100

734405
unix	aix
once at a unix shop aix iirc developers would work via nfs mount and checkin checkout via rcs.

734455
accessor	properties
i have a class called inparams with two fields a string and a long and their corresponding properties accessor to the fields

734476
fgets	fgetc
get the data with fgetc or fgetc_unlocked instead of fgets

734482
prng	random
so let s assume we have a prng that produces a random number between 0 and 31 and you want the smaller range to be 0 to 9

734500
prng	random
if prng is generating uniformly distributed random numbers then the above looks good

734501
prng	random
if you have access to a prng function say random that ll generate numbers in the range 0 x 1 can you not just do

734529
powerpc	i386
it may be better to simply compile with both -arch i386 -arch x86_64 which will allow the user to choose at runtime which one to run you can also include -arch powerpc -arch ppc64 if you want to support older powerpc macs

734559
typeerror	attributeerror
many times catching an attributeerror or typeerror is simpler and apparently faster

734621
post	get
this can be especially bad in an asp.net application where the input comes from post get

734638
imperative	declarative
declarative verbose and i find a imperative style much more succinct

734644
x86	mips
llvm is generally better than gcc on x86 but i haven t found any benchmarks for mips

734668
sorting	grouping
i m thinking that sorting either way may have no effect - a pebble landing at random on a wheel containing different sized by fitness slices will have exactly the same outcome chance whether the larger slices are grouping together or not

734741
gridview	linqdatasource
in an attempt to add additional search criteria i have tied in to the selecting event of the gridview s linqdatasource and am trying to add additional items to the whereparameters collection of the linqdatasourceselecteventargs

734780
accessor	properties
normally i use the public properties with some exceptions where i may want to avoid any extra code written in the properties accessor

734795
getter	setter
sometimes you will write getter setter that do important pre-processing for any realistic interaction with the field

734795
getter	setter
for example if a string field has a constraint that it must always be lowercase then at least one of your getter setter methods must make a call to .tolower or .tolowerinvariant and in your class code you probably want to use this to make sure that the constraint is enforced

734795
getter	setter
i think the bottom line is that it depends on what kind of logic you are using at any given point in the class and what kind of preprocessing exists in the getter setter

734795
getter	setter
if you are ever unsure or it seems like it doesn t matter it is probably better to use the getter setter public property so that you write more maintainable code that will follow constraints added later

734798
width	height
but an easy alternativ would be animate the height width

734824
gif	png
i ve changed some of the graphics from png to gif but it is just as likely to say it s waiting for somegraphicsfile.png as it is for somegraphicsfile.gif

734824
versioning	upgrade
when we upgrade to the latest versioning of jquery ui 1.7.1 and replaced the destroy s with disable s for the datepickers the problem went away or mostly went away - if you do things too fast while the page is loading it is still possible to get the n items remaining status

734898
agile	sprint
our contracts hasn t changed since we switch to agile the client still want to receive build at major milestone and is too far to be directly involved at each end of sprint

734903
translation	localization
as other s stated you will obviously have other localization issuse such as translation or date currency formats as well

734943
width	height
record_id filename path width height

734947
put	get
start documenting the code reviews put in a wiki a company sanctioned wiki -- don t get into trouble now just document it for now -- it s not yet time to pass judgement you re just gathering data

734950
getter	setter
more generally using setter and getter insulates you from changes

734967
boost	stl
stl boost and others who have a lot of header files to include they provide you with independent tools and you can use them independently

734968
tiff	bmp
assuming you mean that you want to take an image file jpeg bmp tiff etc and crop it then save it out as a smaller image file i suggest using a third party tool that has a .net api

734988
int	chars
for int chars etc it is 0 for arrays it is t

734994
onfocus	onblur
alternatively try using javascript regexp in the jsp that will trim onfocus or onblur

734994
onfocus	onblur
html text name testform property displayname onfocus javascript this.value this.value.replace s+| s+ g onblur javascript this.value this.value.replace s+| s+ g

735170
pop-up	dialog
this dialog box pop-up and basically hangs the test run as it requires manual intervention

735174
filtering	grouping
you can t filtering it sort by it or grouping by it

735199
opera	firefox
actually the above code sometimes looks like it works in firefox never looks like it works in opera

735292
google-chrome	firefox
everything seems to work fine in ie7 but in firefox and google-chrome i am getting the strange behavior

735295
post	get
according to this post sleep isn t available on windows xp and you have to download the windows 2003 resource kit in order to get it

735304
pop-up	dialog
if you happen to have ms visual studio on your build machine it will catch application errors and pop-up a dialog box

735334
opera	firefox
works in ie 6 7 8 opera 9.6 firefox 2 3

735334
google-chrome	safari
does not work in safari for windows 3 4 or google-chrome

735362
rss	feed
i m thinking it would be convenient to alert interested parties to the completion of the build process via an atom or rss feed

735396
boost	stl
using boost s bind and function are much better but it is impressive which can be done with just stl

735445
hash	md5
create a standard machine-readable format for publishing a small metadata set download link + md5 hash + optional public key and or certificate

735445
hash	md5
i know i manually generate the md5 and compare the md5 hash but it s a very repetitive series of steps that can be error prone and computers are great at automating things like this

735453
mouse	keyboard
i believe this gets around the problem with the exclusive lock which you would encounter for example when trying to open a handle to a device that windows considers a system keyboard or mouse

735469
spaces	delimiter
classes are spaces delimiter so if you want them hidden by default.

735493
glut	soil
i m trying to make a simple textured rectangular in opengl using soil and glut

735609
ocl	uml
some of the things i ve read about and are considering include z state machines uml 2.0 possibly with extensions such as ocl petri nets and some coding-level stuff like contracts and pre and post conditions

735625
uiview	subviews
you can animate any view root view or subviews just by changing supported properties within a uiview beginanimations commitanimations block

735647
unix	solaris
sorry didn t mention the code is cross-platform linux windows solaris and a few other unix flavors mostly using gcc for compilation

735664
fileoutputstream	filechannel
if you want to do that use a fileoutputstream get the filechannel and directly write the floatbuffer since it s a bytebuffer

735665
x86	64bit
edit for gcc-only code you can use __i386__ to check for 32-bit x86 chips and i suggest trying __x86_64__ or something similar to check for 64bit x86 chips

735665
x86	64bit
note it has come to my attention that the previous answer involving __ia86__ is actually a different chip not a 64bit x86 chip

735696
put	get
what you could do instead is have the 2009 and 2010 in a table and beside them put the names of the ranges then do a vlookup to get the range name

735708
internationalization	localization
the development of multilingual software currently goes through two phases the first phase is internationalization and the second phase is localization

735729
ocl	uml
some of the things i ve read about and are considering include z state machines uml 2.0 possibly with extensions such as ocl petri nets and some coding-level stuff like contracts and pre and post conditions

735758
post	get
you can send post or get data with that request and it will function just like if a form sent that information

735768
stdio	gets
if you have to work around this then you need to wrap your current socket opening code so that if it gets an file descriptor in the range 0..255 then it calls dup2 to create a file descriptor in the range that stdio won t use - and then close the original file descriptor

735806
client-side	server-side
i have a datamember that is a nullable enum type on the server-side however when i generate a client-side proxy the type in the proxy is non-nullable

735815
onclick	onsubmit
i ve seen reports of some odd bugs in ie7 where confirm didn t execute in an onclick or onsubmit event handler

735835
tabcontrol	tabitem
when the user click on the small button i remove the tabitem from the tabcontrol

735848
int	chars	int	boolean	int	double
even and especially if those objects are the primitive wrapper types byte chars short int long float double and boolean

735865
rss	feed
unfortunately it looks like itunes does not make this information available if it even uses rss feed to handle podcasts

735926
versioning	upgrade
the problem you will run into is that if you ever need to have an app use a different versioning of the dll all the others will have to upgrade or downgrade

735994
hash	md5
but even in this case a common hash function as sha1 or md5 will be of little use because modifying a single pixel or metadata such as the author will change the hash and make it impossible to identify the two images based on a common hash function

736005
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
you may need to resize the view before adding it to the window and call viewwilldisappear viewdiddisappear viewwillappear and viewdidappear on currentview and the new view controller before and after they re removed added

736048
post	get
we then do our http get post and use a bsf assertion and javascript do complex validation of the response

736062
affinity	processors
the openmpi project has a library to set the processors affinity on linux in a portable way

736062
cpu	processors
on these intel xeon processors two cores on each cpu share their l2 caches i do not remember whether the processors has an l3 cache

736123
hash	md5
what i do is put the md5 hash the mysql query and store that as the key for the memcached data

736161
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this is a bug in firefox and apparently safari 3.5 win and opera 9.5 win iframes reload if moved in the dom tree

736169
binutils	newlib
i used this blog of anthony green as a guideline where he describes porting of gcc newlib and binutils

736232
int	chars
you can hash int chars plain ascii full unicode bytes longwords etc etc

736263
put	get
put the two together and you should get what you asked for

736269
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
she uses touchesbegan and touchesmoved to determine swipe direction then sets the animation based on the direction in touchesended

736320
for-loop	loops
i changed the for-loop for...in loops and it worked

736330
children	parent
in essence the responsibility of the children s destruction is passed to the parent object

736365
atomic	lockless
the individual reads of a and b are atomic and all writes elsewhere in the code to these two memory locations are also lockless atomic

736409
x86	64bit
if you are targeting x86 you can use the 64bit compare exchange support and pack both int s into a single 64bit word

736424
int	chars
int getopt int chars const const chars

736432
tapestry	wicket
i was hoping to find something like wicket tapestry or barracuda for the scala language

736454
int	chars
myself i d probably end up using something like pax s suggestion but actually use a union of chars 1 and void and int to make the common cases convenient and an enumed type flag

736466
post	get
here it is i can understand why you might want it pure scala but you haven t stated that s necessary and with the techniques defined within the blog post and there is another blog which also helps you should be able to get it close enough to what you desire

736499
apache	nginx
i ve got nginx reverse proxying requests to apache 2 with mod_php

736499
apache	nginx
i checked nginx and apache s logs

736502
websphere	ibm
ibm s websphere real-time

736537
awt	swing
the latest version 2.1 is compliant with jdk1.5 so you should have swing awt available

736568
inherited	properties
my structure is made up of various object types with different properties but each inherited from a base abstract node class

736568
children	parent
like i said before each node has a unique guid identifier but right now nodes reference their parent children directly and do not store their ids

736568
serializable	deserialization
the following is what i m planning to do for serializable and deserialization of this structure

736614
mouse	keyboard
in a non-web interface the controller handles the inputs from things like the keyboard and mouse choosing which views to render and what changes to make in the model based on those inputs

736665
public	protected
and is your foo class methods declared public protected or private or package local

736665
public	protected
perhaps less obvious is if they are package local no public protected private scope then you can only override them if you are in the same package as the original class

736665
public	protected
if you declare the original a method in foo public or protected you will get the result you expected

736701
vim	textmate
i just recently set up my vim environment from textmate after becoming addicted to its modal input

736701
vim	textmate
picture comparison between textmate left and vim right

736789
listview	gridview
i am using a wpf application in which i placed a listview control which has 3 gridview columns

736797
public	protected
access modifiers private public protected

736835
listview	gridview
from what i see the wpf gridview is just a view mode look n feel for the listview control.

736878
pecl	pear
hint pear classes are pure php pecl packages are modules

736893
pecl	pear
if you can t or don t want to user pear and pecl you still can use the diff utility called by exec

736898
google-chrome	firefox
for example software such as ie8 google-chrome or firefox might all be tagged browsers to categorize them on a download page

736900
serializable	deserialization
in addition i ve created a static class in informa for serializable deserialization

736900
serializable	deserialization
my serializable and deserialization methods are below

736920
quicksort	heapsort
for general-purpose sorting the answer appears to be no as quicksort merge sort and heapsort tend to perform better in the average- and worst-case scenarios

737020
pop-up	dialog
this handler does close every alert or confirm dialog that pop-up up but first it gets the text shown by the dialog and stores it

737230
int	chars
performance is also better when indexing and traversing int than chars columns

737294
public	protected
this refactoring process is obviously made much easier if you are already using properties in place of public protected fields

737294
getter	setter
will implement the necessary backing field and getter setter code for you

737294
vb.net	vb6
vb6 already did this for com-exposed classes and i see absolutely no reason for vb.net and c# not to do the same

737307
createelement	each
2 use createelement setattribute and appendchild to create and add each div

737312
ready	each
this would allow to have copy n paste ready examples in the config file plus you could nest them to explain various points in each example

737323
implements	extends
you can see it wraps and changes the httpservletrequest object to the securitycontextholderawarerequestwrapper class which extends httpservletrequestwrapper which implements httpservletrequest and feed it back to the standard servlet filter dofilter chain

737329
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
use a normal inputstream fileinputstream wrapped in an inputstreamreader and then wrapped in a bufferedreader - then call readline on the bufferedreader

737334
config	ini
in fact the current suggestion is no longer ini files but the registry for small parts of the config and xml files in appdata if you ve got a lot

737369
ant	maven
think of javac ant maven etc

737382
implements	extends
if not implements a class extends the authentication interface on which you can put your authentication parameters

737409
getter	setter
now in some sense getbalance may not be relevant enough to argue that getter and setter are good because it doesn t or maybe shouldn t have an accompanying setter and speaking of which a function called setbalance float f could be bad in my opinion because it would imply to the implementer of the function that the account must be manipulated out side of the class which is not a good thing

737421
ostringstream	std
an example in std ostringstream is the str function

737421
getter	setter
the standard library often follows a pattern of using the same function name for a pair of getter setter functions - str being an example again

737437
getter	setter
for less typing you can implement trivial setter getter as inline methods

737437
getter	setter
and don t forget that getter and setter are somewhat evil

737438
getter	setter
the legwork is not more if you implement just the default setter getter inline in the class declaration which i tend to do - more complex setter move to the body though

737474
nunit	typemock
at my work place we are using typemock and nunit for our unit testing

737489
accessor	properties
the cf jit compiler does not perform the same optimisation as the desktop jit compiler and does not optimise simple properties accessor so in this case adding a simple properties causes a small amount of code bloat over using a public field

737519
put	get
the only way to get it right for sure is put everything yes that too in one big file

737552
getter	setter
getter and setter are evil

737552
getter	setter
use of getter and setter is in opposition to the fundamentals of object oriented design data abstraction and encapsulation

737552
getter	setter
overuse of getter and setter will make your code less agile and maintainable in the long run

737552
getter	setter
you ll need to change the private data field the getter the setter and all the client code of this class that calls these getter and setter

737552
getter	setter
this not to say that getter and setter don t have their purpose

737552
getter	setter
the getter and setter make it more difficult to fix the problems since the client code dostuffwithaccount is now bound to the data-type we used to implement the account balance

737552
getter	setter
granted you could have changed the internal type to float and still supported the getter setter idiom

737552
getter	setter
but it doesn t take long to realize that the getter setter arrangement is doubling your workload and complicating matters as you need to support both the code that used ints and the new code that will use floats

737552
getter	setter
the overall point though is that you must be careful with getter and setter

737552
getter	setter
do not get into the habit of writing getter and setter for every data-member

737596
getter	setter
that s fairly common in c++ after all if it doesn t take any arguments we know it s the getter and if it takes an argument it s the setter

737617
versioning	upgrade
you either have to backport the sqllite module from python 2.5 to python 2.2 or ask your web hoster to upgrade to the latest python versioning

737622
keydown	keyup
alternatively you could handle keyup keydown events

737931
ferret	sphinx
i ve no idea how applicable to your situation this is but evan weaver compared a few of the common rails search options sphinx ferret a port of lucene for ruby and solr running some benchmarks

737960
folder	directory
the result of this wizzard is a discomap and wsdl files that are put in the app_webreferences folder of your site in a directory structure based on the namespace you ve chosen in the dialog

737996
folder	directory
this gives me a bit of a problem since if i run the program from another directory with the command . folder folder program for example my program will not find the text because the working directory isn t correct

738005
mouse	keyboard
i figure tracking my keyboard and mouse is a good way to see when i left and arrived

738005
mouse	keyboard
have a system wide callback for every mouse and keyboard press

738053
config	ini
config reader setter which reads the config from ini xml file and sets the environment of the application

738078
super	implements
i searched many years for the paste command knowing this is a super basic operation someone must already have implements something to solve this problem

738118
rss	feed
i d like to be able to collect rss feed online as an alternative to collecting them on a desktop machine using a regularly running process

738134
nswindow	nscursor
try using nscursor directly the nsview cursor rect methods depend on things such as a properly sized and visible nswindow to work properly which aren t necessarily the case in full screen mode

738266
opera	firefox
it should select the empty paragraphs so i edited my code to the following but it doesn t show in firefox it works in opera

738317
disk	ram
it would be a shame to be storing a bunch a data on disk and waiting on slow-ass disk i o when the user has 8gb of ram

kde	gnome
the kde window manager as well as gnome and all wms that follow the freedesktop standards support the extended window manager hints ewmh

738359
kde	gnome
i have never worked with kde but gnome provides such functionality so i assume that kde has it too

738362
udp	tcp
i have a couple applications that communicate over tcp udp sockets

738406
kde	gnome
newer gnome and kde

738406
kde	gnome
freedesktop wanted to make the ewmh as broad as possible apart from gnome and kde

738431

if you have multiple vhosts on the same server it s pretty common to have each site in a directory under var www and each of these have a htdocs folder which is mounted as the web root

738462
equals	compareto
objectsâ equals and compareto methods

738494
getter	setter
i hardly ever use getter and setter in my own code

738541
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
i am looking for a cross-platform .net and mono on windows macosx and linux way to decode wav mp3 or ogg files such that i can then play the decoded streams through directsound or openal as desired

738541
mp3	ogg
a solution that can decode either mp3 or ogg would be sufficient -- decoding both is not necessary

738541
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
if it or another solution can decode wav as well that would be ideal but isn t strictly necessary since i could potentially convert my wav files to mp3 or ogg

738568
children	parent
other things i ve tried that haven t worked is applying a class or id to the parent li class top-level or li id top-level --that didn t stop the sifr it still grabbed the children

pop-up	dialog
when i use the grid in a pop-up dialog the only way for the user to leave is via a button either close or ok

738784
qimage	qwidget
if you want to render some graphics from inside your dll function without passing in any pointers to qimage or qwidget type things probably the thing to do is use opengl

738790
mouse	keyboard
we can capture the mouse events but how do we track the row lost focus triggered by the keyboard

738814
serializable	deserialization
soooooooo seems like the best solution is to have each implementation pass a list of node types it uses to the serializable and deserialization methods in the framework project

738819
gridex	janus
the gridex control from janus systems can do it but honestly i d really stay clear of doing things like janus systems do so it s better you should find your own way

738826
pop-up	dialog
i have this annoying problem where my exception window in visual studio 2008 is replaced by a windows pop-up dialog box see images below

738836

the things which actually make the most difference to how threads get scheduled ie thread priority and thread cpu affinity are already exposed by apis and support for numa aspects are starting to appear in mainstream os apis too

738892
put	get
get the javascript code from and put it in the tag

738897
int	chars
the chr function returns a chars given by the int for the corresponding ascii chars

738904
int	chars
the function chr would convert chars to int values and would be no use here

738925
postgresql	mysql
i know very few who support derby but they support mysql postgresql firebird and others.

738929
pop-up	dialog
the goal is when information dialog window pop-up it can always go to the specified url

738981
versioning	upgrade
one more reason for upgrade to newer windows versioning

738996

swt	swing	awt	swing
i take it this is a client gui application swing swt awt but beyond that i think we re going to need more details

739205
hide	show
you could add remove the label from the layer to hide show it just retain the label instance for later retrieval

739253
createelement	each
2 use createelement setattribute and appendchild to create and add each div

739288
qstring	qfiledialog
i think its probably some mismatch between the qfiledialog the qstring its passing back and the string the my python expects

739306
kde	gnome	kate	kde	kate	gnome
if you re not running gnome but are still using linux kde you might be able to use kate

739395
processors	work-stealing
my uneducated guess would be that there is a run-queue per processors and a work-stealing algorithm when a processors is idle

739395
freebsd	solaris
i m still reading design impl of freebsd with solaris internals being the next on my list so all i can do is make wild guesses atm

739452
hide	show
by the way this is probably just be because you have abbreviated the model code but if you want to show and hide dynamically your model will need to implement inotifypropertychanged

739470
vim	emacs
then i imagine there are ways to configure vim to work nicely with matlab i m an emacs person these days and there are solutions for emacs

739507
hide	show
i would like to have a button used to expand retract the height of the cell when it is pushed you know show and hide

given the buffering inherent in all the stdio functions i would be tempted to read the stream character by character with getc

739694
organization	naming
i have been trying to clean up the naming and organization conventions of our projects unit and integration tests

739694
organization	naming
it seems that if there is one best practice for unit test organization it is that the layout and naming of the test classes and namespaces should mirror those of the code under test

739734
implements	extends
you could extends the foreign class assuming it s non-final and make that class implements the interface

739738
int	chars
with hn the first chars of the variable name is i for int l for long w for word etc

739748
fgets	atoi	printf	fgets	printf	atoi
sizeof is a keyword because despite it s name and usage it is an operator like + or or rather than a function like printf or atoi or fgets

739751
int	chars
if you look up the c standard you will find that fundamental types include int chars etc but not size_t

739794
free	malloc
6945 address 0x7 is not stack d malloc d or recently free d

739794
free	malloc
6945 malloc free in use at exit 4 bytes in 1 blocks

739794
free	malloc
6945 malloc free 1 allocs 1 frees 4 bytes allocated

739945
int	double
even if you re given a positive int it s not hard to get it to a double

739945
int	double
going from a 32-bit int to a double should provide adequate precision

739953
profiling	instrumentation
a managed implementation of a code profiling is not possible same for java as well as then the profiling would instrumentation itself

740021
backtracking	greedy
the difference is instead of first expanding the match to the maximum and than doing backtracking by decreasing the match one character at a time greedy the lazy modifiers will first be expanded to the minimum match and than be increased one character at a time

740026
serializable	deserialization
update i realised a minor issue with the optimization flags i was using was causing the serializable data to be written incorrectly which resulted in the inconsistency of deserialization times

740067
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
i haven t used git but i used svn and bazaar which is similar in philosophy to git so i can answer you in general terms

740149
elf	coff
you can parse the coff elf whatever format file from the build and this gives you the information you need to work out the names and types of the variables in your object

740175
squeak	visualworks
i was aware from the beginning that smalltalk has several dialects perhaps dialect isn t the best word but by this i mean visualworks squeak and dolphin to mention just three

740175
squeak	visualworks
so far i have limited my foray to visualworks and squeak

740211
innodb	myisam
however due to various and maybe obvious reasons i want to switch from myisam to innodb as i need transactions at some places

740253
rss	feed
once you use xslt to transform the rss feed into html it is simply treated and thus rendered as a standard html document

740285
gridview	linqdatasource
i have a gridview that is bound to a linqdatasource control that is returning a collection of customers

740310
rss	feed
a lot of sites have rss feed for updated and new apps on the apple iphone app store

rss	feed
however apple s rss feed generator only shows feed for the top 100 free paid apps

740327
opera	firefox
as you ll be able to see at this demo page everything pretty much works at least in opera and firefox save for the gradient being ever so slightly off at the end hover to be shown the hex value

740382
folder	directory
zipoutputstream can handle empty directory by adding a forward-slash after the folder name

740405

xsl-fo denotes the use of xslt to produce fo documents

740410
xsl-fo	xslt
xslt formatting objects or xsl-fo is

740410
xsl-fo	xslt
xsl-fo is part of xslt

740412
xsl-fo	xslt
xsl-fo stands for extensible stylesheet language formatting objects and is about formatting and now is known as xslt to avoid all confusion

740414
xsl-fo	xslt
xslt is used for transforming xslt which is the same as xsl-fo is used for formatting

740419
children	parent
internally controls that are children of a naming control gridview have their full ids built by appending ids of their parent using

740422
width	height
here s an excerpt from some code i wrote that given a x and y calculate the screen boundaries sx sy and sw with screen width and sh for screen height

740432
xsl-fo	xslt
one would therefore take a load of data in say an xml format and then use xslt to convert that data into a document consisting of xsl-fo that in turn is rendered using an appropriate tool in say pdf for print or other means of distribution

740534
serializable	deserialization
edit the requirement that the structures be mutable doesn t really affect much with regard to my answer - i still think that serializable and deserialization is the best solution to this problem

740534
postgresql	mysql
the only case in which a database would be better is if you have a system where multiple users are interacting with and updating a central data repository and for a case like that you d be looking at a database server like mysql postgresql or sql server for both speed and concurrency

740538
children	parent
capturing starts catching events at the parent elements as it moves down the chain of the children until it reaches the element where the event was triggered

740558
int	chars
i m using sql clr integration with the idea that we store data with general types like chars int but then contextualize the data with constraints specifically check constraints

740612
google-chrome	firefox
it is supported on most browsers ie firefox google-chrome and stream live video feeds

740671

740674
allocator	stl
search for stl allocator and memory pool

740704
ssl	https
as it s internal you don t need a paid ssl certificate if cost is the reason for avoiding https - i can t think of any other good reasons - you should be able to use a self-signed one

740711
sctp	tcp
note that sctp implements a 4-way handshake with cookies built into the protocol to protect against syn floods while allowing more information to be stored in the cookie and thus not having to limit the protocol features supported because the size of the cookie is too small in tcp you only get 32 bits of sequence number to store all of the information

740717
super	self
super worker self .__init__

740721
multicastdelegate	delegation
a multicastdelegate has a linked list of delegation called an invocation list consisting of one or more elements

a new feature i wish to add to our local network is the ability to retrieve email from free email services such as gmail yahoo and hotmail using php

740799
children	parent
by using raiseevent with the same event passed on the children things seem to work but somehow it raises the event on the parent root canvas as well

740826
google-chrome	firefox
i also read about plug-ins for firefox and google-chrome that supposedly support activex but they aren t native

740860
addeventlistener	onload
if i do an online onload event for embed objects that seems to work but i can t seem to get the load event working through addeventlistener

740873

mark the test with the expectedexceptionattribute this is the term in nunit or mstest

741042
post	get
you may have to modify it if you re not using a formview but i think you ll get a good start with that post

741060
dictionary	map
there isn t a terrific direct mapping since c++ set and map use comparators whereas .net hashset and dictionary use hash codes

741071
onchange	keyup	onchange	onblur	keyup	onblur
the keyup won t prevent a right click paste operation that could go over the limit- you may want to set the value onchange or onblur as well as on the keystroke

741099
gridview	formview
the code you pointed out refers to a formview however i am tring to change it to a gridview

741117
inherited	base-class
c# as far as i know it can constraint the parameter to implement an interface or inherited a base-class

741129
mouse	keyboard
the clipboard in response to a keyboard or mouse event makes this

741257
lwjgl	jogl
otherwise there are numerous high-quality 3d apis available for java eg jmonkeyengine or ogre3d or you can always use lowlevel apis such as jogl and lwjgl

741301
subtract	add
however for compression then i need to subtract these 128 bit values and for decompression i need to add these values

741303
min	max
i don t like this however because i m replicating the subclasses constructor code having to remember to trim the string again and pass the same min max lengths when necessary

741334
int	boolean
my db have some fields using int data type but after ss generated them all of them re boolean db type

741341
subtraction	addition
although i should warn you for anything more complicated than addition and subtraction and shifts you ll need to use non-trivial algorithms

741341
subtract	add
to add and subtract you can create a class structure that holds two 64-bit integers

741341
subtraction	addition
you can use simple school math to do the addition and subtraction

741341
subtract	add
basically do what you do with a pencil and paper to add or subtract with careful consideration to carries borrows

vmware	virtualbox
if you don t have the cash for vmware if you do it s the best money can buy try virtualbox

741354
mouse	keyboard
the definition of the focus action is to bring the input keyboard or mouse to a certain element usually an input field

741371
subtraction	addition
if all you need is addition and subtraction and you already have your 128-bit values in binary form a library might be handy but isn t strictly necessary

741371
integer	unsigned
i don t know what your compiler uses for 64-bit types so i ll use int64 and uint64 for signed and unsigned 64-bit integer quantities

741386
versioning	upgrade
i expect you can upgrade from the standard versioning though

741403
vmware	virtualbox
if you need linux compatibility as well then look at virtualbox or vmware

741403
vmware	virtualbox
if you go with virtualbox or vmware on both mac and linux then you will be able to pass around the same vm files rather than having a windows vm to run in mac and a windows vm to run in linux not to mention the licensing costs of having two copies of windows installed

741424
opera	firefox
when i was testing it through opening the file with firefox opera it worked

741432
mbunit	nunit
look at visual c# express for your ide and compiler ndoc for your documentation mbunit or nunit for unit testing and i believe c# express will handle deployment as well

int	double
to get your intended effect cast the int to a double before the division

741710
put	get
i want to get all this record and put

741711
put	get
therefore a replacement for your fetch get put would be

741746
udp	tcp
we develop a network library that uses tcp and udp sockets

741772
outputstream	inputstream
your server s outputstream is a printstream but your client s inputstream is a datainputstream

741772
bufferedreader	printwriter
even better might be to change both to use printwriter and bufferedreader like the example client server pair in sun s socket tutorial

741772
outputstream	inputstream
when you send data through one type of outputstream you should receive it at the other end with the matching inputstream

741772
outputstream	inputstream
just as you can t store a string object in a double or a double in a string not without converting it you can t send data from one type of outputstream in this case a printstream to a different type of inputstream

741776
inherited	properties
- create a base class that both these user controls inherited from and in the base calass you can define your properties that the controls should interact through

742047
division	modulo
this requires use of integer division and modulo

742076
public	protected
in my opinion hiding them is tantamount to hiding public protected private keywords in method signatures or any other component of the language

742084
allocator	stl
you can do a quick check using stl allocator

742084
allocator	stl
over load the new operator for the point class and use the stl allocator to allocate memory rather than malloc or default new operator

742096
hash	md5
i have read and re-read the code and i don t understand how i use those functions to turn example into a md5 hash

742097
super	extends
and i want to call a method with its parent class name when i extends my super class to any class

742110
subtract	add

742112
pascal	delphi
delphi s object pascal language isn t the only language to recognize this problem

742116
width	height
if you are drawing a circle you could use math to figure out the final height width

742134

pdostatement execute works with parameters markers so you have to construct query before calling pdo prepare

742145
fink	macports
launch is in fink and macports too

742193
switching	screens
i would also provide a simple way to switching from full screens to windowed for instance by pressing esc and another way to go back to full screens

742211
free	malloc
it s a plug-in replacement for malloc new and free

742225

put	get
the simpler you make it and more trust you put in your devs the less hampered your devs will feel and more likely to just get on with it

742374
allocator	stl	boost	allocator	boost	stl
the only solution i know of is to implement something similar to the apache pool you allocate a block of memory and have your allocator which you give to stl or to boost work inside this pool

742469
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd
reference freebsd netbsd openbsd and os x manual pages

autorelease pools are kept as a stack if you make a new autorelease pool it gets added to the top of the stack and every autorelease message puts the receiver into the topmost pool

742482
lisp	scheme
with the thousands of implementations of lisp and scheme available i m having a very hard time finding just the right one to use for windows development

742495
width	height
i started writing a jsfl command for flash that gets the x y width height from elements on stage and generated the box2d code

742504
scheme	racket
a fairly complete usable and free scheme implementation is racket formerly known as plt scheme

742553
filtering	grouping
at the moment i m doing a simple select with the filtering applied grouping by day and it s running pretty well but i was wondering if there s a smarter more efficient way to extract such data

742554
children	parent
in the stitch you ll either update child tables foreign keys in the insert by doing a subselect on the new parent or you ll insert children and do a separate update to fix the foreign keys

742616
children	parent
in addition you could write a super-naive algorithm to confirm this isomorphism by attempting all possible mapping functions and ensuring that for every node in the first tree that gets mapped to a node in the other the corresponding mapping happens with the parent and with the two children

742730
codeigniter	kohana
kohana and codeigniter both have encode_php_tags

742732
verilog	hdl
when learning any sort of hdl verilog vhdl... it is important to keep one thing in mind

742752
accessor	properties
if you choose to use get set accessor instead of normal properties you will be creating a library which has a very different appearance than what every other programmer is expecting

742760
codeigniter	kohana
since kohana does not use eval for templates it is possible that it is just left over from codeigniter days

742763
int	chars
the variable exfile is not an int not a chars not a struct file--nothing you can express in the type system

742774
disk	ram
i have a machine with 24 gb so i was planning to install vista 64-bit and nothing on it but vmware workstation 6.5 vista image that will be installed on a ram disk that i will make on the main vista

742774
disk	ram
the whole vmware image will be in ram so i will install visual studio 2008 in it and put all my sites there as if it was a real disk

742774
disk	ram
i have done a few tests of running applications from ram disk and the performance was blazing but i have some concerns

742774
disk	ram
since itâ s a ram disk once the pc is restarted everything will be gone visual studio sql databases my sites and everything else

742777
codeigniter	kohana
if you re using other xss preventing methods provided for codeigniter or kohana there s no necessity to use this

742794
disk	ram
to me this doesn t seem like a good idea if the system goes down the ram disk is destroyed

742794
disk	ram
i would focus on simply allocating the ram in a helpful manner and keeping the os files on disk

742822
accessor	properties
you can only bind to from properties in .net so if you use get set accessor you are not playing nicely with others

742831
jqmodal	thickbox
all things considered though to have the floating div with the form and such you re going to want to use one of the many plugins already made for this such as thickbox or jqmodal

742847
onchange	onblur
you can also use the onchange method instead of onblur

742851
vb6	vba
strange that this lack of registration does not seem to affect the dll s ability to function other than its discoverability within vb6 s and vba s references dialog

742887
gif	png
also im not sure how to filter for more than just one type of file ie jpg gif png in the directory info

742892
bazaar	trac	bazaar	svn
the usages would be to host my own repositories bazaar svn etc have a small webserver to host a wiki trac for my personal programming projects and a ftp to host files

742903
getter	setter
explicit getter setter methods should be used when non-trivial calculation processing is done so where an actual action is performed

742970
width	height
width 800 height 600

742974
rss	feed
i have an rss feed that i m setting up on my new site using django

742974
rss	feed
currently i have an rss feed being served per user rather than just one big nasty global rss feed

742974
rss	feed
the only problem is that the links that are returned by the rss feed have the completely wrong domain name in the links

742974
rss	feed
servername in apache was set to the domain that i was seeing being used by the rss feed to build the urls

743022
int	double
i have made all those int mess to double

743033
nunit	mstest
in fact if you google around for reactions to mstest you ll find many who think it a ripoff of nunit

743056
listselectionlistener	listeners
register listeners with the jlist generally you ll want a listselectionlistener

743070
width	height
in particular i m interested in how the panels handle child objects that have width or height set to auto and horizontal or vertical alignment set to stretch

743126
pull	push
i would also look at other tools to push pull the data into other formats

743151
boost	stl
note you just need to make the swap a no-throw method this is relatively simple if you are using stl objects as they all define a no-throw swap just for this situation as does boost and all good libraries so you should follow suite

743160
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
one way is to use nscalendar and nsdatecomponents

743173
udp	tcp
it has lower-level replication mechanisms which can allow you to use udp or tcp multicasting broadcasting replication

743220
wmv	asf
i did not face the same issue with other formats like asf wmv

743229
wmv	ogg	wmv	flv
for example flv wmv ogg theora etc

743287
yacc	bison
but that s not something i d ever suggest to anyone who hasn t had to write compilers or parsers before without the benefit of lex yacc bison or other similar tools

743335
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i found some examples that implement checkbox in dropdownlistfor but nothing involving the autocompleteextender

743349
disk	ram
ram disk is a great idea in principle but you might not gain as much as you think

743349
disk	ram
if it s similar to what you have with vmware + ram disk it would be much easier for you to maintain

743388
super	self
put your self loadobjectsfromplist before super viewdidload

743434
getter	setter
but i want a simple property getter and setter pair int getoneid void setoneid int on the many domain object rather than the association methods that hibernate would ordinarily expect me to provide one getone void setone one

743434
accessor	properties
because of the code generation issues it would greatly simplify things if i could have simple properties based accessor for the fk field

743485
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
have subclassing inherited from the superclass for each actual payment

743508
pop-up	dialog
this is the same dialog that pop-up on clicking an icon displayed to the extreme left before anything else on the perspective bar

743544
width	height
now it s obvious that i ve encapsulated width and height access is somehow restricted but i ve not abstracted anything okay maybe i ve ignored where the rectangle is located in the coordinates space but this is a flaw of the example

743598
many-to-one	one-to-many	many-to-many	many-to-one	many-to-many	one-to-many
i don t have any experience with oodbmses but my experience with nhibernate + ms sql server has been very positive in terms of enforcing and cascading changes down one-to-many many-to-one and many-to-many relationships

743649
put	get
but when i try and put a filter into it for the company i will get an error at runtime when the company is null

743656
accessor	properties
however you can t just synthesize this properties you would have to write your own accessor because the compiler has no idea where you want to get this value from

743659
getter	setter
in this case you could declare these as properties and implement the setter and getter yourself using the objc_ runtime methods above

743669
inline	inlining
if inlining a function duplicates the code in the place the function is called then the static and local variables are duplicated for each function calling it and if there is only one thread running the function that calls the inline one at the same time then the code is thread-safe

743683
post	get
scott stevenson explains in his blog post a quick objective-c 2.0 tutorial part ii how to get public properties with private setters

743692
children	parent
tasks and schedules are children of project and would not cause a parent to be deleted

743697
int	double
i think instance variables are simple data types like int or double

743711
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter
it can easilly be controled by setting some flags on the mouseover mouseenter and mouseleave events

743735
cos	sin
the test program uses printf to show the result stored at 0x30fa8c but for the second sequence the result is displayed as -1.#ind the first using cos and sin works fine

743844
width	height
you have to synchronize it s width and depending on the content also the height of it s rows

743860
post	get
if not you ll have to post your mapping to get additional advice

743874
httphandler	httpmodule
you should use response.writefile method in an httpmodule or httphandler to manually stream the file to the user

743889
put	get
i have a product column and another column is stores where i put in all the stores where it is possible to get this product

743906
hide	show
i found resizemode windowstate and windowstyle but none of those properties allow me to hide the close button but show the title bar as in modal dialogs

743939
hash	md5
md5 sha1 or any long hash function seems too heavy for a simple task i am not doing cryptography

743940
try-catch	exception-handling
and while it is true that you should avoid try-catches when they aren t necessary check instead of letting x throw nullreferenceexception you will find that especially on web applications there are tons of times were try-catch statements are absolutely required because sometimes you will lose connections or the user will do the wrong thing and exception-handling will be thrown whether you like it or not

743997
min	max
it can validate credit card numbers dates min and max characters and many other features

744042
persistent	transient
i don t know if nh use the same transient annotation attribute as the java version to ignore a property in persistent operations

744046
punctuation	words
this allows you to filter out any punctuation you don t want and use only words

744068
subtract	add
the built in date class handles â œoverflowâ very well this can be used to add or subtract time

744070
cdr	cons
hons generally runs slower than cons because in creating a hons an attempt is made to see whether a hons already exists with the same car and cdr

744110
pop-up	dialog
the box works fine when people enter non-numeric values but when they delete the value in the box a dialog pop-up saying

you just need to redirect the user to another page or the same page... after processing the post - that way when they hit refresh the last request and the one to be repeated will be a get

744229
mouse	keyboard
and finally such automation relies on taking control of the entire ui including i o devices such as the keyboard and mouse

744237
aggregate-functions	sum
also there is no product aggregate-functions in sql so of course you can just do sum log x or exp sum log x to get the equivalent of product x

744251
google-chrome	firefox
upgrading to firefox or google-chrome

744262
bitblt	gdi
i use a rewritten version of jeff s user-friendly exception handling and he uses bitblt from gdi to capture screenshots

744335
inherited	properties
within the forms that inherited from it i set the acceptbutton properties based on the requirements of the application

744387

744394
svg	vml
1 if you re intent upon vml svg one library i know that can bring the two together is raphaeljs which has some degree of text support but i m really not sure how sophisticated the degree of manipulation of the text is

744405
getter	setter
dot syntax works in many places throughout objective c although it is only considered acceptable for getter and setter

744462
submit	submission
try collecting items in batches say 1000 and submit these batches to the database rather than submission the items one by one

744493
typedef	struct
my usual style for declaring struct in c includes the typedef so i forgot to mention it sorry

744502
typedef	struct
you should probably typedef the struct once in an h file to make it an actual type and then declare instances

744502
typedef	struct
here s a good tutorial on typedef for struct

744516
installation	upgrade
now hacking a joomla installation is not really a good idea since upgrading will become hard and a not upgrade joomla installation is a great security risk

744562
getter	setter
warning the syntax for defining getter setter apparently is not something that ie doesn t implement nicely

744571
profiling	benchmarking
if you re really concerned about performance should should benchmarking profiling the code before you decide to make a design decision based on those performance worries

744643
mousemove	mousedown
if you wish to react before the user removes his finger from the screen listen to mousemove events and check the direction and distance relative to the mousedown event that you require for an action to take place

744649
udp	tcp
overlay tcp on top of udp as tcp already does

744661
getter	setter
it sounds like it s a very small class empty constructor two fields two setter getter

744664
udp	tcp
if for some reason you must use udp seriously just use tcp some quick and easy reliability features would be a presence heartbeat acks and xor ed checksums

744695
sctp	tcp
if you absolutely need a message-based transport layer protocol where you can turn off some of the tcp reliability features like head-of-line blocking check out sctp

744701
udp	tcp
reliable udp is not the same as just using tcp

744741

browsers including internet explorer firefox and google-chrome all have different ways of doing some things and there can be the pain of having a pair of code running in some cases if you have some javascript mixed in with the server side code

744768
boost	stl
for instance i have tried asking questions about the company s use of things like stl boost 3rd party libs etc. but that only seems to get incrementally closer to the reality of situation you ll find once in it

744791
implements	extends
note that you don t strictly have to extends java.util.observable - you can implements the design pattern without doing that

now i would like to have a calculated field on my salesorder object called total that is the total of all the lineitems subtotal fields plus a few other things like tax and shipping but don t worry about that for now

744911
n-gram	words
as for input representation you can try your luck with extracting words and character n-gram

744989
client-side	server-side
client-side is all about user interaction server-side most often has no user

744989
client-side	server-side
client-side is ephemeral users come and go server-side is persistent

744999
inherited	properties
my objects are setup in a tree structure and values for each properties are either set in each object or inherited from parent objects

744999
inherited	properties
in the propertygrid i want to visually show the user what properties values are set in the selected object and which are inherited from parent objects

744999
inherited	properties
the other set shows the properties values assigned to the object that are either set in the object or inherited if not set in the object

744999
inherited	properties
i would like to combine these two groups into one buy showing set properties in regular text and inherited values in italic text

745024
move	drag
so for example if i move the pointer to the border it correctly turns into the left-right drag icon

put	get
i set the data access mode to sql command but when i try to put in the sql above i get invalid parameter count when it parses the sql

745211
vim	textmate
if you don t like vim textmate is a decent text editor

745226
getter	setter
you don t have to synthesize numberofsides if you re planning on implementing the getter and setter

745226
getter	setter
you ll need to declare the getter setter in your interface accordingly

745226
getter	setter
btw another approach would be to use the synthesized getter setter and add a separate method - bool isnumberofsidesvalid which performs this check

745227
mouse	keyboard
if you are using winforms and will only deploy on windows machines then it s quite easy to use user32 getlastinputinfo to handle both mouse and keyboard idling

745231
post	get
if i ever get a blog i will be happy to update my answer with a detailed post

745245

745352
tomahawk	trinidad
good widget library available in tomahawk trinidad

745366
int	boolean
during the conversion to .net it was decided that when using visual basic conversion routines to convert a boolean value to an int value visual basic 6.0 semantics would be maintained on the return value

745366
int	boolean
under the hood this does an implicit conversion from int to boolean

745380
wicket	seam	jsf	wicket	jsf	seam
i believe that you can use seam with jsf wicket and gwt

745380
jsf	seam
since the focus of your criteria seem to be the marketability of your skills i would suggest trying out seam and jsf via facelets

745401
versioning	upgrade
i favour appending a versioning identifier to interface and coclass names whenever i want a clear upgrade path and anticpate any changes

745403
post	get
you have the option of passing on variables through either a get or a post

745465

the short and simple answer is if you can t adjust the base testclass code no there s no way you can modify the class to replace a method by another

745479
post	get
you get this warning when a page in the browser history was the direct result of an http post

745479
post	get
this is avoided if your search form uses method get instead of method post

745489
ant	maven
adding build tools such as ant my personal favorite and maven growing in popularity and ability pretty quickly to your toolbox allow you to do more advanced building and even unit-testing

745517
put	get
my guess is this is a way to get code that will work whatever you put in n and s just a guess i m too tired to try and see if that is the case

745529
vmware	esx
we have two vmware esx boxes that hosts our dev machines and it works great as long as people remember to switch off those images that are not in use

745594
allocator	stl
obviously unless you specify an allocator that somehow puts the data on the stack the end result will be the same using stl containers will probably use less memory than using stack allocated arrays or objects

745620
post	get
these values don t have to be passed from script to script as get or post values

745670
noscript	meta
you can have a noscript block in the head element with a meta refresh tag in it

745681
keydown	keyup
you need 2 different callbacks one for keydown and another with keyup or keypress which is only fired when the element registered both the keydown + keyup

745682
button	checkbox
what i want to do is to change from a checkbox to a two radio button like this

745702
accurev	plasticscm
if you really want to handle multiple releases but not suffering the pain of clearcase you should try something like accurev or plasticscm

745718
int	double
conversions from int to double and vice versa involve the representation of floating point and you might lose accuracy which does matter in pointers

745723
wmv	mediastreamsource
if you were working with wmv i would set up a mediastreamsource and pass in the desired video frame to the mediastreamsource as my first sample

745724
put	get
to get all the items and put into a document or to a string just do a for like this

745753

jboss	oc4j
oc4j 10.1.3 and jboss 4 support this model of deployment

745789
interpreted-language	compiled-language
so the workflow in python is much more similar to that of an interpreted-language than that of a compiled-language

745795
innodb	myisam
if it is more read than write then you should stick with myisam if its more write than read you should look into innodb

745795
innodb	myisam
if you want to know the difference between innodb and myisam then wikipedia has a great list of their differences

745795
innodb	myisam
myisam uses table-level locking on writes to any existing row whereas innodb uses row-level locking

745837
spaces	linefeed
it defaults to including spaces tabs and linefeed which was why you were getting the incorrect behavior

745849
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox

rest describes a collection of resources addressed by uris with a set of canonical methods get post etc

745912
jobs	cron
cron jobs are run on a specific schedule not on a specific interval

745927
jobs	cron
since cron runs jobs time-based not interval-based there s no blindingly simple way to do it

745963
innodb	myisam
that said a very hot table lots and lots of select s will benefit from being migrated to innodb because myisam does not support concurrent read

745985
inherited	properties
all business items inherited from a common ancestor and have an id properties integer unique

745996
button	checkbox
this.form should be fine gets the form object from the submit button which should then let you get the checkbox from it via getinputs

nsstring	nsxmlparser
in cocoa you will generally use an nsxmlparser which just uses nsstring

746009
post	get
edit i did finally get this working and decided to write a short blog post with complete source code required to write the custom binding

746047
post	get
i hope that in this post i can get people s opinions on best practices for the interface between jsf pages and backing beans

746058
mutators	setter
this is what is typically known as a setter or mutators and you can overload the method to accept multiple different types of parameters

746079
csla	.net
i suspect that the main compatibility issues with csla under mono are centered around mono not implementing all the .net data binding nuances especially datagrids and serialization format differences

746082
next	except
you can start with any letter and all the letters that surround it are fair game and then once you move on to the next letter all the letters that surround that letter are fair game except for any previously used letters

rss	feed
i have been writing some web services to be used by a few different client apps and i was trying to write a web service method that simply outputs an rss xml feed

746203
16-bit	64bit
you can extend this idea to 64bit int s or trade off memory for speed assuming your l1 data cache is large enough and reverse 16-bit at a time with a 64k-entry lookup table

746207
bazaar	git
let s suppose right now i want to support bazaar and git

746207
bazaar	git
so of course i can make bazaarlogfilereader and gitlogfilereader and hard-code them into the program but i want it to be set up in such a way that adding support for a new version control program is as simple as plopping a new class file in the directory with the bazaar and git readers

746207
bazaar	git
so right now you can call do-something-with-the-log --software git and do-something-with-the-log --software bazaar because there are log readers for those

746215
rss	feed
asp.net rss feed

746251

width	height
the first is a container element which has its width and height set to the dimensions of a single flip state and its overflow set to hidden

746370
width	height
the third element has its background-image set to filmstrip.png and its width and height set to the dimensions of this image

746371
firefox	safari
firefox however doesn t have extensive scripting capabilitiesâ if you are willing to use safari there is an applescript command available to inject javascript code into a document the do javascript commandâ look it up in safari s scripting dictionary available from within script editor

746411
keydown	keyup
i think your best bet is using keybd_event keydown called extendedkey with the lwin value of the system.windows.forms.keys enum then keydown second character + and keyup both keys

put	get	post	put	post	get
i m aware there are dozens of questions about this and blog after blog post but can someone put the simplest answer or link to the existing question if there is an appropriate answer to get the following working on visual studio 2005

746587
post	get
post your results if you get a chance

746606
udp	tcp
a great many applications that use udp use it because they need the low-overhead low-latency nature of it much more than they need the precise reliability of tcp

746606
voip	sip
think about sip in voip telephony for example

746627
opera	safari
i want to make a cross-browser ff3 ie6 safari opera w3c valid html and css both stretchable horizontally vertically without javascript and with semantic and lesser html markup round corner

746631
asterisk	freeswitch
asterisk or freeswitch is very different

746631
asterisk	freeswitch	asterisk	ivr	freeswitch	ivr
asterisk and freeswitch meanwhile can function as pbxs ivr servers media servers etc

746631
asterisk	freeswitch
if it is to tinker with certain high-level telephony applications use asterisk or freeswitch

746660
datarow	bindingsource
where templatebinder is a bindingsource object with the datasource property set to the datarow i want to trickle out throws an exception when i go to show the form

746680
multibyte	substr
according to the documentation the substr function is multibyte safe

746694
equals	tostring
the equals hashcode and tostring methods should be generated

746705
jlist	jtree	jlist	jtable	jtree	jtable
that way you can have jlist as well as jtable and jtree display massive amount of cells without having to instanciate components for each cell

746705
jlist	jtree	jlist	jtable	jtree	jtable
just as neil coffey said you can add your listeners to the jlist jtable jtree instead and use the helper methods locationtoindex ... getcellbounds ... to dispatch which cell was affected and thus deal with cell specific logic

746724
equals	tostring
create a constructor for those fields as well and also implement equals hashcode and tostring methods

746735
std	ostream
i have to know whether there is some kind of ostream which accept an instance std string and write on that instance

746744
ostringstream	std
std ostringstream part of sstream header

746765
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i tested it on ie6 ie7 firefox 2 and 3 safari and opera

746786
width	margin
if you want a rounded border rather than just a rounded solid background the above can be tweaked using border negative margin position relative absolute width and background-image position so it works but can t remember off the top of my head how

746910
put	get	post	put	post	get
if you have wfetch or fiddler or live http headers then i would show the client side request as well and highlight the absence of view states and highligh the post get verbs put delete if you are using wfetch

746919
textmate	aptana
textmate is my favorite but if you want code completion netbeans is the best choice aptana redrails is outdated

746948
cassini	iis
my understanding of the problem is that the process trying to execute the code is running as a different account under iis than it does under cassini

746954
webkit	gecko
css3 border radius covers gecko webkit and khtml

746955
trie	tree
its a bit bloated but at least i reuse tree trie from cpan

746987
tga	pgm
btw i m trying to write image files first i want to try with tga pgm

746996
vb6	vba
microsoft have been dropping hints at a managed-code version of office with an integrated vsto presumably in the same way as the vb6 ide is integrated for vba so the vs ide would be integrated for vsto ever since .net was first released

746999
gif	png	tiff	png
i wouldn t want to attempt tiff png gif or jpg in fortran without the help of external libraries however

747020
getter	setter
if you do not want to hardcode calls to each getter and setter reflection is the only way to call these methods but it is not hard

747031
arp	tcp
based on your comment below if you want bypass disable the arp handling of the tcp ip stack then winpcap should let you do that

747059
min	max
because of this all your checks will work perfectly because you don t do any checks that check the actual data valid e-mail address min max username length etc

747101
width	height
but it has to keep the factors between the width and height

747120
width	height
there you can skip either of the parameters height or width and it will resize correctly

747138
width	height
really you should have a target width or height then adjust the other dimension by the same proportion

747221
nsmutablestring	nsstring
so i made currentelementvalue an nsstring instead of an nsmutablestring and i can get the proper intvalue

747245
dictionary	map
if you have absolutely no idea what fields can be in each element your only choice is to create a property bag map dictionary of key value pairs

747269
post	get
should be post or get default is get but not head

747286
postgresql	mysql
my problem is when i need to query a relational database - i m only really concerned with postgresql and mysql - i ve been struggling a bit

747289
scons	autotools
in c i can use autotools scons cmake + cpp

747294
postgresql	mysql
linq provider for mysql postgresql oracle this is open-source

747295
put	get
put all your deployable items in a .bat .cmd file and call it in post-build event to get everything deployed

747300
metaphone	soundex
at the bottom is link i put up to c# implementations for soundex double metaphone php similarity and levenstein

747310
put	get
unfortunately when i ve verbally asked folks how they go about debugging on linux i typically get the following answer oh i just put a bunch of print statements. omg

747310
centos	linux
since it is on linux and will be working with c++ code on the centos 32-bit os i am hoping here is a preferred opensource solution

747310
centos	linux
so i guess i asking for the preferred opensource ide for c++ code on centos linux

747323
bresenham	dda
you are looking for line drawing algorithms something like bresenham or dda you can find some reasonable implementations here ofcourse instead of drawing a complete line you would move your ball along that line but the way of finding the set of lines to move on is the same

747335
nsmutablestring	nsstring
intvalue should work identically nsstring and nsmutablestring

747362
anjuta	gnome
anjuta is a really great ide for gnome

747394
hash	salt
i was wondering if it was a common practice to salt and hash a password like

747394
hash	salt
e padding || hash salt || password

747394
hash	salt
to eventually decrypt a record in this database the server will know the length of padding and simply take away padding to reveal hash salt || password

747399
lisp	prolog	lisp	smalltalk
for example learning prolog made me truly understand recursion for the first time smalltalk and ruby helped me understand the beauty of dynamic typing lisp just blew my mind and c made me realise what was going on behind the curtains.

747420
hash	salt
having a good salt would prevent someone doing a standard lookup and it would also strengthen the hash against dictionary attacks

747420
hash	salt
if the salt and the password are combined within a hash it would greatly reduce the use of offline attacks and you wouldn t need to take any special precaution of protecting it

747455
children	parent
a task object can have one parent task and several children task objects

747455
children	parent
the estimatedhours startdate and enddate properties of a task which has children is a parent depend on those properties of its immediate children

747455
children	parent
the parent task s startdate is the earliest startdate of its children

747455
children	parent
the parent task s enddate is the latest enddate of its children

747455
children	parent
the parent task s estimatedhours is the sum of its children s estimatedhours

747455
children	parent
the parent s properties are a reflection of its children so any changes to children may require the parent s properties to be adjusted to reflect the changes appropriately

747455
children	parent
a parent task would listen for these events on its immediate children task objects and make appropriate changes to its own properties when those events occurred

747472
put	get
- you get many templates for your like i use it a lot when the database return no result you can put a message here to inform the user instead of showing blank screen

747586
client-side	server-side
remember that no matter how much client-side validation you do you still need to do server-side validation

747594
put	get
you basically have to weigh server load against speed - if you poll often you get a very responsive client but you put a lot of load on your server

747626
findwindow	showwindow
showwindow with the intptr from findwindow and 0 sw_hide

747628
superclass	subclassing
you may have proper superclass subclassing relationships

747628
superclass	subclassing
one choice is to have a superclass table with an optional fk reference to the additional information in the subclassing

747628
superclass	subclassing
one choice is to have a subclassing table with a mandatory fk reference to the superclass information

747631
ant	maven
it is simple to get maven to run arbitrary ant scripts as part of the build

747631
ant	maven
this question has an excellent description of how to run an ant script with maven s process-sources build execution phase

747635
folder	directory
with tools we ve used previously it s been possible to set up a reference directory or folder on the network which stores the latest revision of everything that s been checked in so that people can easily browse the latest versions without having to use a dedicated tool

747740
post	get
a more complicated way would be to test if the variable exists in the get array if it doesnt then its post

747806
udp	tcp
using this paradigm you can use udp tcp http peer-to-peer msmq - all using the same 3 core concepts

747820
implements	extends
i know that in eclipse if your class implements an interface or extends an abstract class there is a quick way to add the method definitions to your class

747838
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere once upon a time included a similar set of tools for their whole j2ee application server not sure if they still do but i would assume that s still true .

747854
google-chrome	firefox
litterally this is all i have in my html and it works as expected in google-chrome and firefox

747863
wordpress	joomla
i know this can be done with wordpress but i can t seem to find the joomla equivalent

747863
folder	directory
i really don t want all the joomla folder clogging up my root directory

747888
getter	setter
better i d say to have explicit getter and setter using properties

747960
folder	directory
here s a post build macro that i think will work by copying all files in a directory called configuration to the root build folder

747983
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
in the instance of zip codes you should never have a time where you need to add to a zip code or subtract or multiplying two zip codes together

747989
bazaar	git
has tried out bazaar mercurial darcs git

748003
terminate	timeout
that way the client s connection won t timeout while waiting for the system call to terminate

748006
stdout	stderr
ffmpeg uses stdout for outputing media data and stderr for logging progress information

748013
lisp	prolog	lisp	smalltalk
but functional ml lisp haskell logical prolog object oriented c++ java smalltalk imperative c pascal fortran even

748047
width	margin
this won t work because image size + image margin + othertext width parentdiv width

748094
jquery	jqmodal
i would recommend using jquery with the jqmodal plugin instead of using a â popupâ

748116
post	get
here is a blog post that should get you pointed in the right direction

748170
stdout	stderr
the commands module provides an extremely simple interface to run commands and get the status return code and the output reads from stdout and stderr

748177
post	get
get this post that etc

748177
post	get
get this post that etc

748219
opera	firefox
if i try it in firefox opera i get a new session id on the redirected page

748226
vim	textmate
if you re coming from any other os and or you don t like vim then textmate

748258
ssl	https
i am now trying to implement ssl support for it so that it can handle https requests and responses

748262
integer	unsigned
you may consider switching id to an unsigned integer so you can get up to 2 32 bits available i am guessing criteria is never negative as you are assigning it to an id column

748271
sorting	filtering
the downside is that the sorting filtering of these data are exceedingly difficult.not only that when the data size is large it s very slow to read them from hard disk into memory

748299
getter	setter
property getter setter in javascript

748331
post	get
i can see the view when calling the get edit action method but the strongly typed post action method receives only a viewmodel class with null parameters and i can t figure out how to retrieve the post parameters

748341
children	parent
alternatively if your database supports recursive sql queries you can use that and it will only select the nodes that are children of your parent node

748347
getter	setter
to add on- you need to closely inspect your setter and getter and see if they return a different value on different calls

748384
implements	extends
the reason you re properly using interfaces is due to the fact that you cannot have all your classes that needs these methods extends a base class that contains these yet you need to know that specific classes promise to implements these

748518
equals	compareto
by convention you should either implement the equals method to be consistent with your compareto method or clearly document your class to note the inconsistency

748518
range	max
if you want to include max in the range add one to diff

748555
cunit	cppunit
pick a good platform i like cunit and cppunit and go from there

748632
listview	gridview
i ve got a listview control bound to an observablecollection of items and i ve set it s view to a gridview with columns bound to properties data

748639
width	height
also after i click dismiss to the error box that pops up the images do load afterwards but are then set to the size of the actual image not the width and height i set the component to

748653
gendarme	fxcop
as well as fxcop gendarme is another tool to look at it is mono s version of fxcop but they are different in approach and the errors that they actually find

748656
gendarme	fxcop
gendarme for mono is similar to fxcop

748682
put	get
do make sure you remember to get your serial number in if you put this on production

748798
put	get
or on some hosted sites that you re allowed access to you need to put in a ticket to the service center or help desk to get them make it an app

748809
post	put
if you know vb you can also create your own functions and put them in the queries...but that is another post

748829
post	get
for more details on what i m trying to accomplish and why see my question here http get post request and google geolocation api

748848
pull	push
if i can it seems that even though pull is favored for merge replication i would want to use push to make the server bear the brunt and easier management

748857
children	parent
i would add a node to the tree and each node contains a parent and a collection of children

748873
put	get
any information i can get would be better than nothing so please feel free to put in partial answers

748910
redmine	trac
we hit the same problem with trac our solution was to move to redmine

748919
perl	tcl
i mean a shell script or perl python ruby tcl whatever to do that is probably less than 5 lines of code and less than 10 minutes of work

748921
mouseout	mouseup	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mousedown	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseleave	keyup	mouseleave	mousedown	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseup	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	mousemove	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	keyup	mouseup	keyup	mousedown	keyup	mouseenter	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	keydown	mousemove	mouseleave	mousemove	mouseenter	mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseout	mousedown	mouseenter	mouseup	mouseleave	mouseup	mousedown	mouseup	mouseenter	keydown	keyup	keydown	mouseup	keydown	mouseleave	keydown	mousedown	keydown	mouseenter

748939
put	get
i need to put a max length on my test field on my views using asp.net mvc with the entity framework and i can t find how to get the max length of a varchar field

748984
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
if you open different brwosers at the same time such as firefox opera google-chrome and ie you ll have to log in in all of the browsers independently

749063
pop-up	dialog
if you get no pop-up dialog at all then my guess is one of the following has happened

749071
keydown	mousedown
you could also store the selection in other events such as mousedown or keydown which are known to be triggered before a change

749097
boost	stl
this is the easiest solution that comes to my mind as neither the stl nor boost contains anything to do it easier

749136
ssl	https
you need to get a cdn that supports serving files over https then use that cdn for the ssl requests

749206
heapsort	shellsort	quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	shellsort
while people have spent careers worrying about which is the best sort algorithm for very large databases for small n it really doesn t matter whether you use quicksort heapsort radix sort shellsort optimized bubble sort unoptimized bubble sort etc

749218
cpython	ironpython
this is also the approach taken by python or at least cpython the most common implementation. the jython and ironpython implementations also take this approach but compile to the bytecode for the java and c# virtual machines resepectively

749218
cpu	processors
in some cases this can actually outperform native compilation as it is free to perform runtime analysis on the code and can use specific features of the current processors while static compilation may need to compile for a lowest common denominator cpu

749221
min	max
also good for selection algorithms finding the min or max

749284
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
i m not sure how opera google-chrome or safari handle sessions

749330
coldfusion	railo
btw for those interested in running railo cf or open bd on tomcat matt woodward will be speaking on that this week at the online coldfusion meetup in the 6pm slot on thursday april 16

749333
pascal	delphi
in old day pascal delphi when you wrote

749334
listview	gridview
i have a listview that is configured as a gridview

749334
converter	multibinding
it is easy enough to pass the cell value to the multibinding converter

749347
opera	google-chrome
everything works great in ie6 ff3 google-chrome and opera

749349
sorting	filtering
jxtable from swinglabs has several nice features column control toggle column visibility highlighting rows sorting rows filtering rows horizontal scroll control and resizing columns and it is free

749368
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i have jquery code which works offline in safari and opera but neither in firefox 3.1 nor 3.08

749379
sqlcommandbuilder	sqldataadapter
when you re all done use a sqldataadapter and sqlcommandbuilder to auto-generate your insert statments and flush it to your sql tables

749387
opera	safari
both safari and opera come with javascript debuggers

749425
superclass	subclassing
all the classes involved are subclassing of a common superclass

749425
superclass	subclassing
i want to return an array of classes that are all subclassing of a particular superclass

749439
richfaces	icefaces
regarding drag-and-drop i ll suggest that you look at richfaces or icefaces

749458
implements	extends
the object htmlinput is abstract thus on runtime time it is always implements by an object that is extends htmlinput

749469
mouseup	mousedown
now when you mousedown inside the span move the mouse anywhere outside the frame and mouseup the span stays gray forever -- css considers it active forever

749505
int	chars
instead of a bool you could use an int chars or string for your answer if the questions are multiple choice

749528
stdout	stderr
also ensure that you do not have stdin stdout or stderr being intercepted by the java process

749548
children	parent
this departs from the classical adjacency list in that instead of children holding the parent_id the parent holds two children ids or null

749553
xslt	xquery
i am studying computer science and we have to do a programming project which must be strongly related to xml and using xsd and xslt or xquery xpath at least

749567
interbase	firebird
one day i ask in mysql forum if event like in firebird or interbase exist in mysql and i see that someone answer yes i m really not sure

749580
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest versioning 1.6.x

749614
versioning	upgrade
if a direct upgrade to .net 2.0 or greater is not an option i would use a development vm with the older vs versioning to maintain the .net 1.1 projects

749625
ubuntu	linux
this is on linux ubuntu 8.04 and os x 10.5.6

749628
versioning	upgrade
the sql code that brings up your database layout versioning to upgrade

749666
hide	show
i want to click a button show a loader image execute a time-consuming function hide the loader image

749682
hash	salt
and that is the hashtype salt hash

749682
hash	salt
is it the password and salt combined and then hash or is something else entirely

749686
crypt	md5	crypt	hash	hash	md5
hashtype is either sha1 default md5 or crypt -- the algorithm used to perform a one-way hash of the password

749686
hash	salt
salt is a random string used to salt the raw password to create the hash

749686
hash	salt
as the documentation describes the hash is the salt algorithm and password hash

749703
hash	salt
then the algorithm name the original salt and password hash are concatenated separated by s to form the digest

749757
boost	stl
by the way i know that the boost library has a great serialization class however i m trying to learn how serialization would work using the stl library for now

749758
internationalization	localization
these are the primary options that i am exploring and i would consider using different tools for different portions of the project but what i m mainly interested in is if anyone has any experience to share with regards to localization internationalization

749758
put	get
i haven t yet put together a site that supports multiple languages so before i get in trouble by underestimating the task or making poor assumptions i d like to get some input to help guide my decision-making process

749795
labwindows	cvi
do your normal development in labwindows cvi

749841
profiling	debugging
the reason i m doing this is to better debugging a windows service and allow easier profiling of the code

749853
firefox	safari
your only way to get painting to occur will be to split up execution of your function or move the function onto an html5 worker thread -- and they only work on the betas of firefox and safari or more generally any sufficiently recent build of webkit proper

749898
width	height
instead controls in winforms provide their own width and height properties so this code should work

749906
width	height
writing to the properties width and height of this copy makes no sense because it is just a temporary copy and not backed by memory anywhere

749957
many-to-many	one-to-many
relations may be one-to-one one-to-many many-to-many

749957
many-to-many	one-to-many
you ll see that a many-to-many relation can in fact also model one-to-many and one-to-one

750003
subtract	add
but it allows you all sorts of wonderful date functions to add subtract and decompose intervals of time which you can t do with an int without re-writing all those functions yourself

750032
google-chrome	safari
i m most concerned with safari and google-chrome at the moment but i m open to suggestions for any other browser

750064
dreamweaver	fireworks	photoshop	fireworks
i am completely new to web programming and i have taken a couple day classes in photoshop illustrator dreamweaver fireworks and indesign

750070
free	realloc
the linux and solaris man pages are very clean and the 89 standard realloc ptr 0 works like free ptr

750075
realloc	malloc
if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the

750075
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call

750075
free	realloc
to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

750075
realloc	malloc
if ptr is null realloc behaves like malloc for the specified size

750075
free	malloc
if the requested size is zero then you get back whatever malloc 0 might return which is often usually a null pointer but might be a non-null pointer that can also be returned to free but which cannot legitimately be dereferenced

750099
udp	tcp
a sock_dgram socket uses udp underneath which is entirely packet-oriented as opposed to stream-oriented like tcp

750145
prng	random
i am trying to make a java implementation of the park-miller-carta prng random number generator

750152
postgresql	mysql
start with the free ones like mysql or postgresql then.

750152
cvs	svn
learn to use source version control systems such as cvs svn and vss microsofts unfortunately not free -- the first two are

750173
preorder	inorder	preorder	postorder	postorder	inorder
you pretty much have a choice of preorder postorder and inorder

750184
floating-point	integer
ok so the essential problem is that you need to do floating-point division not integer division as others have pointed out

750184
int	double
if you absolutely insist on using park-miller-carta i d at least wrap it in a random subclass and let java.util.random take care of converting int to double etc-- after all that s what extensible libraries in an object-oriented language are for.

750242
firefox	safari
update i also tried the code in firefox 3 via firebug and it behaved just like safari

750280
python-mode	pymacs
it uses pymacs and python-mode to do just what you are looking for

750299
opera	safari
so far opera has been the best on mobile browser followed by iphone safari pocket ie was the worse and blackberry browser was too old except for new devices such as storm

750313
strncmp	strcmp	strncmp	memcmp	memcmp	strcmp
you will have to use one of strcmp strncmp or memcmp

750350
realloc	malloc
however realloc is only guaranteed to work on arrays allocated by malloc and similar functions containing objects without user-defined copy constructors

750371
hide	show
a manually show and hide the image

750371
hide	show
using this the element will show hide for any request

750390
jaxp	stax
i ve dealt with a few xml apis in java but i don t have a good understanding of all the frameworks available in java for dealing with xml for whatever purpose jaxb jaxp xerces stax castor etc.

750424
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

750441
wordpress	expressionengine
i m looking at amember which seems to be a user role package that supports this supports lots of payment methods and has plugins to tie in to both expressionengine and wordpress

750482
opera	safari
so do many mobile browsers including iemobile opera mobile and safari on the iphone

750484
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
the set of c functions malloc calloc realloc free are raw memory operations

750484
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
c++ does not have an equivalent of realloc but only typesafe equivalents to malloc free through the use of new new and delete delete

750495
lodash	underscore.js

752573
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
a compulsion of ld_preload on hp platform only and not on other unix flavors aix linux and solaris

752692
switching	screens
often times i want to look at 2 documents maybe the aspx file and the cs file on two different screens but i can t drag one to the other screens so i have to just switching back and forth

edit ant has correctly pointed out that on error goto -1 is a vb.net statement and isn t valid in vb6

752814
getter	setter
the next step might be to use this struct or class in the object itself...but since you re using getter and setter the decision of how to represent it internally will be transparent to the users of the class anyways so this decision will relate more to how complex the class is than anything

752847

client-side	server-side
since jquery treeview is a client-side component you can t access it from the server-side

753400
getter	setter
but if the data is non-trivial enough that you really do need setter getter then it is non-trivial enough to need error handling as well

753400
getter	setter
so in those cases your getter setter should be returning some kind of error code or doing something else to indicate something bad has happened

753455
objectdatasource	formview
i m using a formview with an objectdatasource and binding using # bind whateverprop - and all of my nullable columns are coming back with default values of the type in them

if a user clicks on a button that does a post lets say it has username and password in the post and those credentials get authenticated successfully

753917
put	get
if i did a redirect to a completely different application so i can t carry session etc and i use a get with the username and password in the querystring i could even use basic encryption if that helps but regardless and then when it gets to the page i check to make sure it came from the page i expected it to come from pull the values from the querystring put them in a session variable and then do a redirect back to the same page removing the querystring values so they can t be viewed by user

753926
put	get
it s not really a good idea to put username and passwords in a get request even encrypted because

753945
hash	salt
also think about using salt hash for the passwords instead of just storing it plaintext if that s not the case already

753945
hash	salt
added as mehrdad correctly comments ...even in case of salt hash it s still vulnerable to replay attacks.

753957

the readwrite variables will exist as properties with both a getter and a setter

754528
width	height
the iframe is set to 100 width and height

754545
cassini	iis
perhaps testing it on iis if not cassini with a 64bit application pool is causing a context switch somewhere which causes the mock identities if they get assigned as a thread s identity to get marshalled across a boundary like that - the lack of a serializable attribute will probably cause a typeloadexception

754557
internationalization	globalization
according to the w3c globalization is another term for internationalization

when a draggable is on top of two droppable currently the jquery behaviour is that the draggable will hit both droppable

755410
draggable	droppable
my expected behaviour the draggable should fall on the first droppable only and should not get triggered for any other subsequent droppable which is around

755410
draggable	droppable
the basic idea is that when a draggable is dropped on two droppable the event timestamp of each droppable event are very close to each other

755412
cvs	svn
all the source code for red hat jboss products is available in opensource in svn cvs etc. but the sold version is what is called the productized version

755428
implements	extends
if a tag is not supported you can right click it and add a template for it or you can extends the supported tags by implements the extension points

755433
bash	zsh
if you are using a bash or zsh type shell such as git bash or babun on windows or most linux os x shells then this is a much nicer more succinct way to do what you want

755440
.htaccess	httpd.conf
put the rewrite rule in var www .htaccess instead of httpd.conf

755502
post	get
i would be mainly interested in the get post methods to understand the interaction with a webpage

755525
keydown	keyup
ideally something which doesn t involve me having to track the state of keyup keydown for each and every textbox although if there is no other way i ll do it like that

755543
ienumerable	ilist
the most basic interface you could pass here is ienumerable since doesn t inherit from ilist

755593
firefox	safari
it looks the same in firefox 2 3 safari 2 3 and ie 6 7 8

755613
folder	directory
i d like to do a search for folder directory from java and go into those folder directory in java

755644
unsigned	short
when converted to a 16 bit unsigned short will be

755667
hide	show
after the show method is called the visible property returns a value of true until the hide method is called

755673
iprincipal	iidentity
i would recommend using forms authentication with perhaps a custom backend using iidentity and iprincipal

755676
integer	unsigned
any integer is converted to a given unsigned type by finding the smallest non negative value that is congruent to that integer modulo one more than the largest value that can be represented in the unsigned type

755689
google-chrome	firefox
i m testing this page in ie6 ie7 firefox and google-chrome and it works in everything but ie6

755751
versioning	upgrade
where i work we have an install script for each new versioning of the app which has the sql we need to run for the upgrade

755792
jobs	cron
duplicate see cron jobs on google appengine

755792
jobs	cron
cron jobs are now officaly supported on gae

755805
rss	feed
i want to create an in-house rss feed i work for 3 mobile australia for consumption on an inq1 mobile phone or any other rss reader for that matter

755805
rss	feed
however testing it out on the phone s built-in rss reader i realize that without the ability to password protect the feed or otherwise restrict access to it i stand little chance of being able to develop this idea further

755805
rss	feed
update i should have explained that i already have placed folder-level permissions on the parent folder which brings up the normal authentication dialog when the feed is viewed in a browser but which just results in a failed update with no explanation or warning in the phone s rss reader and is indistiguishable from the file being missing when i next try and refresh the feed

755806
public	protected
const-ness like access restriction public protected private benefits the programmer more than it assists with optimization

755820
rss	feed
private rss feed

755836
rss	feed
assuming your rss feed is over http then basic http authentication would probably do the trick

755836
kerberos	ntlm
the authentication scheme basic username password ntlm kerberos etc is up to you

755836
rss	feed
you should avoid simply hiding the rss feed by changing it s name

755854
ienumerable	iqueryable
system.linq has tolist on iqueryable and ienumerable

755934
flac	ogg	mp3	flac	mp3	ogg
i am looking for something to control playback of either raw sound or mp3 ogg and flac

755937
drwatson	minidump
you want a combination of a minidump use drwatson to create these if you don t want to add your own mini-dump generation code and userdump to trigger a minidump creation on a hang

755960
processors	hyperthreading
rather take into account the number of processors smp multi-cores hyperthreading to decide how many threads should run in parallel

756066
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
and then it seems that every window manager - gnome kde xfce or other - also has a keymapping utility

756102
int	chars
first of all sets have permutations not strings or int so i ll just assume you mean the set of chars in a string.

756191
rss	feed
edit my website is using asp.net and there is a rss feed there

756203
rss	feed
i would parse the rss feed of the quote website assuming that it has one and display the quotes that way

756226
rss	feed
first and easiest would be to grab the quote via their rss feed if available

756226
rss	feed
if the site doesn t provide an rss feed you ll need to implement some sort of screen scraping script to grab the relevant portion of the page you want

756262
sequence	permutation
not entirely to the point i must admit after some comments but the code below can be used to generate a random permutation of a finite sequence

756325
pop-up	dialog
i have a jquery ui dialog pop-up that displays a form

756327
gridview	datalist
gridview has much more bells and whistles than datalist

756327
datalist	repeater
use datalist repeater and other more customizable controls when you re willing to customize them more radically

756338
free	malloc
on a non-gc environment for each allocation you would end up calling malloc and that requires locating in the list of free memory fragments the most suitable one according to the specific malloc implementation

756407
hash	md5
these are md5 hash returned with the json structure to be sent with a following request

756441
put	get
if you can get them to put it on the server you won t need to translate anything

756452
hash	md5
however this can be remedied by having the client sent the md5 hash with each request if it is different than what the server expects an entire list will be sent instead of a list of changes

756536
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uitabbarcontroller and each tab handles a different uiviewcontroller that pushes on the stack new controllers as needed

756541
public	protected
see also framework design guidelines section 4.4 do not define public or protected internal constructors in abstract types

756561
multiplying	add
multiplying the vector by the distance then add the resulting vector to the point

756583
public	protected
they must be protected since public constructors does not make sense either

756656
gtkmm	glibmm
i am using gtkmm and glibmm and i would like to update the gui from another thread

756715
multiplying	add
multiplying you number by 2 n convert to an biginteger convert to binary string add a decimal point at position n from right to left

756720
onclick	onsubmit
also if you put your ajax code assuming that s what you re doing in the onsubmit handler instead of onclick on a button you can also make it so that pressing enter has the same effect as clicking on the submit button which the user might normally expect

756758
width	height
and the width filter is only applied by to those images that pass the height filter

756761
jar	manifest.mf
after reading this added the jar to the manifest.mf which solved the problem

756800
hash	md5
i also tried comparing the hash of the suspicious site s url md5 method in php

756873
min	max
i ll also be able to calculate the max and min peaks

756887
junit	testng
completed junit testng test

756889
getter	setter
choose source- generate getter and setter

756889
getter	setter
another idea is to define your bean with getter and setter you can use the above technique but include setter then you can create a wrapper class for it that only has the getter

756894
profiling	debugging
jvm ti supports the full breadth of tools that need access to jvm state including but not limited to profiling debugging monitoring thread analysis and coverage analysis tools

756894
profiling	debugging
note jvm ti replaces the java virtual machine profiling interface jvmpi and the java virtual machine debugging interface jvmdi

756899
ubuntu	linux
fwiw my local machine is running ubuntu 8.10 and the remote machine is running red hat enterprise linux es release 4 nahant update 1 so there is a bit of a difference in versions but all i m really looking for is a few pointers on where i should be looking for problems

756945
profiler	yourkit
yourkit also has a pretty good profiler

756947
profiler	yourkit
several profiler s such as yourkit have api s for tracing memory allocations

756957
range	minimum
after creating instance of a progress bar you set the range of the progress bar by using minimum and maximum properties of the progressbar

756966
firefox	safari
this would prevent the enter button and remove any newlines and carriage returns that got in anyway only tried this on firefox and minimal thought put into this - it might not work on safari or ie as-is

756981
post	get
for all possibilities to get hold of or to start excel see this blog post by andrew whitechapel

756986
accessor	properties
properties make it your code look like assignment but in reality they re the same as traditional accessor methods you might have written yourself prior to obj-c 2.0

756986
accessor	properties
with properties obj-c is simply generating the accessor methods behind the scenes for you instead using the keywords you specify in the declaration assuming you use synthesize and don t write your own accessor methods anyway

757026
cvs	svn	perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
currently supports svn perforce and cvs

757053
boost	stl
no does not inherit the members of myclass but you can use stl s and boost s facilities to perfrom operations on the vector without explicitly coding an iteration for each operation you need

757078
move	drag
however when i drag the primary window jframe i need to send updates as it move to the secondary window jwindow below

757078
titlebar	window
without completely understanding everything i was hoping to get and deal with whatever is drawing the window s titlebar something about the rootpane it seems

757088
mouseover	mouseout	hide	show
css contains display none for all submenus and my optimistic idea was simply to show proper ul elements when mouseover is fired on first level entries then to hide them when mouseout is fired on the submenu the ul element

757088
mouseover	mouseenter
no change using mouseover or mouseenter

757135
richfaces	tomahawk
we are currently using myfaces + tomahawk + richfaces + some of our own components but we are at a point in which we can move away from richfaces if needed

757172
httphandler	httpmodule
the rest of asp.net is still useful httpmodule httphandler the web.config file the membership provider etc when you re doing asp.net mvc and i d say likely a prerequisite to really using asp.net mvc well

757184
realloc	malloc
however if you are stuck with an array you can always malloc the memory and then realloc if you need to make the array larger

757184
realloc	malloc
do a search here on so there is information about malloc and realloc

757259
mouseover	mouseout
i had some crazy issues with mouseover and mouseout events

757288
width	height
if the text is long enough to change the canvas height it will only be resized if i manually change the width of the window forcing a redraw of all renderers

757308
opera	firefox
the most you ll be able to get is msie firefox opera x.x

757330
getter	setter
besides if you throw another libs into the mix like some json-converting lib or beanmapper or dozer or other bean mapping cloning lib based on getter setter properties you ll have the guarantee that the lib is in sync with the persistence manager both use the getter setter

757356
n-gram	words
for performance reasons index all these words as trigrams or bigrams so that when you are performing a lookup you convert to n-gram and lookup via hashtable or trie

757356
metaphone	soundex
use a phonetic key soundex metaphone to index the words and lookup possible corrections

757371
inherited	subclassing
these classes all inherited from a common base class but that base class doesn t define a couple methods that are common to all subclassing

757382
versioning	upgrade
we could make the code into a library and allow apps to remain on an older versioning of the library until they re ready to upgrade

757398
x86	mips
at my university the assembly programming x86 and mips class is drawing to an end

757432
pull	push
i can t git push pull to github from my corporate vpn

757432
pull	push
or am i stuck disconnecting from the vpn when i need to push pull

757444
put	get
it was discovered that when using flash to produce visual assets using stateful skins and exporting them to swc with the flash flex asset toolkit you get runaway flash movies presumably something internal to the way this is implemented say forgetting to put stop commands in frames

757444
stateless	stateful
and a jsfl script that you can use to convert stateful skins to stateless skins

757672
twitter	myspace
if they start at twitter they ll have to do myspace facebook friendfeed etc

757699
telerik	radwindow
telerik has a control called radwindow which is more or less a modal window

757734
temp	tmp
if you encounter the error condition touch a temp file say tmp alert.email

757781
google-chrome	firefox
one of the great things about web development is that most often when you see a site and think how did they do that it s very easy to look at the code and find out and also to test it out - tools like firebug for firefox the developer tools in ie 8 f12 and google-chrome will all display nicely formatted source and css and will let you modify it in situ

757782
width	height
note no height or width specified

757798
kde	gnome
in fact most of desktop applications web browsers word processors desktop environment itself like windows explorer kde or gnome are written in compiled languages with careful thinking about resources.

757807
width	height
if you really wanted to make it perfect you would need to write some javascript that would read the original picture width and set the ratio accordingly to specify a height

757821
vb.net	vb6
i have converted a vb6 project to vb.net and am left with a large number of inline warning messages such as upgrade_warning couldn t resolve default property of object varjonskeet that i would like to get rid of

757880
bibtex	latex
then i removed the line and compiled the bibtex again hoping to have a working latex file again

757886
put	get
note in the past the option of ndoc may have seemed more appealing - and some people still use it - but sandcastle seems to be the official and recommended method at this moment especially given that it s reasonably stable and complete enough for almost any purpose. see the sandcastledocs website to get started this was unofficially put together by one of the developers at microsoft i believe

757911
bibtex	latex
i think you are tripping over the multi-pass nature of latex plus bibtex

757911
bibtex	latex
that s why the complete set of steps includes an initial latex call a bibtex call and two follow-up latex calls

757986
jobs	cron
i pay 6 month or so for dreamhost.com and i can run cron jobs on their servers - it s included

758025
post	get
grab the get variable here all within class radiogridadmin as described above in my initial post

758037
superclass	subclassing
it s all about the contract of superclass and about subclassing implementing this contract

758037
superclass	subclassing
in short words it comes to the question if you really can safely use your subclassing as superclass taking into account that superclass is defined by its contract which is not only code

758086
queue	fifo
the simplest way of implementing it is not by recursion but rather with a fifo queue where you add the neighbor elements to the one you are testing at the end and extract the first element from the queue to perform the next check

758130
telerik	radcombobox
btw i m using a telerik radcombobox but this scenario is not specific to the telerik control

758153
telerik	radcombobox
this works for the standard asp.net dropdownlist but also for the telerik radcombobox

758194
int	double
in c the solution is simply to cast the int to double

758225
iprincipal	iidentity
i notice some of the types specifically iidentity and iprincipal you are implementing are not located within a assembly

758248
put	get
otherwise you need a way to get your linux-side client to put them into the environment with setenv 3

758256
hide	show
i ve already worked with the qsystemtrayicon class but now i would like to minimize or hide my app window and show only the tray icon

758280
onchange	onkeyup
it seemed quite simple at first but i can t use onchange onkeyup on the iframe

758287
getdate	dateadd
to see the results replace dateadd hh -1 getdate with dateadd mi -15 getdate and you ll get the results for the last 15 minutes and 0 for other minutes

758298
many-to-many	one-to-many
simple examples are modeling many-to-many relation where a relation can only be one-to-many or assuming values can t be null or treating a foreign key as an attribute

758305
vim	emacs
komodo spe vim emacs are all editors ides with python integration and will all work very well - which you prefer depends on your tastes and workflow

758312
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
i prefer to minimize dependencies on 3rd party libs so it s usually boxlayout for dialogs and gridbaglayout for complicated layouts

758352
hide	show
in your system tray icon event handler call show or setvisible true on your window and optionally hide your tray icon

758395
entity-relationship	diagram
this would produce a class or entity-relationship diagram with traceability back to the domain model

758413
folder	directory
one reason is that the app.config file is in your app s folder under the program files directory and everything in program files is read only for standard users by default

758442
postgresql	mysql
a couple of virtual machines or even a single virtual machine for all the products perhaps an ubuntu box for postgresql mysql and a windows 2008 server machine for the remaining products - i like one or two vm s because this is a more portable environment for running the tests when on the road off-site as my laptop would probably crawl to a halt running 8 or 10 small vm s

758485
jsf	seam
you might find it easier to use jsf with seam which simplifies much of how you work with jsf and replaces jsp with facelets which is a great improvement

758491
inherited	properties
the properties of anonymous boxes are inherited from the enclosing non-anonymous box in the example just below the subsection heading anonymous block boxes the one for div

758526
rss	feed
i am looking to test an rss feed i have created and i am looking for some good rss feed applications to test with

758635
post	get
if you are using a post request to submit to the shopping cart a good idea then the post-redirect-get idiom mentioned by bobince will strengthen your application further - the user won t be prompted to resubmit the form if they use the back or forward buttons to get to your shopping cart page

758654
gdal	ogr
many projection libraries such as proj.4 and libraries using it like gdal ogr will allow you to specify an elevation

758761
onresize	onscroll
so far two non-optimal solutions have been to set or to call invalidate during onresize and onscroll

758767
cruisecontrol	teamcity	teamcity	nant	nant	cruisecontrol
if you are taking a more open source approach such as teamcity cruisecontrol then nant may be better

758788
pop-up	dialog
a dialog will pop-up where you can select which sites to enable firebug the whitelist

758819
super	self
super connection self .__init__ args kwargs2

758840
put	get
get the binaries for that exact version of your application and put them somewhere on your hard drive

758844
client-side	server-side
i want to test to make sure the build works both server-side and client-side by testing the website

758879
implements	extends
i am using asp.net mvc so i was thinking about just extends the jsonresult type and then extendig controller so that it also implements a jsonp method

758889
versioning	upgrade
as you say checking a new versioning and updating the references allows instant upgrade for the team

758900
post	get
the antiforgerytoken is only valid for post requests get requests are supposed to be idempotent.

758946
inherited	properties
in the drive s security properties add administrators if it s not already there and in the privileges for administrators give full control and enable all inherited

759012
int	boolean
and occasionally this mixing of int with boolean can come out really handy like this build_assert.h

759024
profiling	debugging
a profiling debugger for analyzing code running on a distributed system allowing you to debugging step through these hosts and there network interactions from a single runtime would be really neat and with the popularity of distributed systems is going to be a must

759111
post	get
get and post requests work ok

759114
stdout	stderr
i just redirect stderr and stdout to dev null so your

759145
octal	decimal
the 377 is octal - its decimal value is 255

759150
int	double
as the others have pointed out comparing eg 1.0 1 will work out because the int 1 is type cast to double not float before the comparison

759202
int	chars
the error message is quite clear you re trying to do a comparison between different types hence the chars varying int notice

759218
int	double
an ieee754 64-bit double can represent any 32-bit int simply because it has 53-odd bits available for precision and the 32-bit int only needs well 32 -

759222
int	double
but yes a double can represent a 32-bit int

759223
int	double
a float or double is guaranteed to exactly represent any int that does not need to be truncated

759223
int	double
for a double there is 53 bits of precision so that is more than enough to exactly represent any 32 bit int and a tiny statistically speaking proportion of 64 bit ones too

759370
int	double
use of double for intermediate calculations will push all rounding and precision loss out to the conversion back to float or int

759371
mvp	presenter
look into mvp model view presenter

759390
opera	safari
so to complete your list you have dragonfly for opera and webinspector for the browsers based on webkit like safari

759396
opera	safari
they say that it works in ie opera and safari

759557
typedef	struct
the most common way i ve seen this solved is to bundle the struct declaration with a typedef like this

759573
idictionary	ilist
idictionary ilist

759589
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
we are developing on ubuntu 8.04 but our production servers are running linux centos and we are also using sqlserver 2005

759668
boost	stl
boost serialization provides a templated save methods for stl collections for a set

759698
put	get
i have my own list that i ll put on the wiki when i get around to reorganizing it

759753
int	chars
if you really want to know the difference cast each pointers to a chars and then to int and then subtract

759753
int	double
casting each pointerpointer to an int and then subtracting gives the same answer as the unecessary double casting above

759818
action-filter	onactionexecuting
you will need to do this either in the action method or perhaps more appropriately in an action-filter or the onactionexecuting etc method s

759819
inherited	properties
so you create one class with the properties and methods they share and child classes which inherited the properties and methods of the parent and also add their own to handle the differences

759832
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
on ie6 and firefox it works fine google-chrome opera etc etc

759856
width	height
issue not able to resize an image to its original height and width

759856
width	height
the image losses its original height width

759897
hide	show
i would get to grips with a javascript library like jquery as it will take care of all the cross-browser issues for you and has such useful methods as toggle to show and hide elements

759897
hide	show
also if you wanted to hide previously show submenus you would use this

759930
vsto	add-in
an example is described ins this article on msdn how to add custom xml parts to documents by using vsto add-in

759942
multiplication	modulo	division	modulo	division	multiplication
multiplication division modulo

759942
subtraction	addition
.- subtraction + addition

759963
filtering	grouping
i ve created a table with a grouping filtering so some values stay hidden

759969
pop-up	dialog
during install time a form of dialog should pop-up and ask the user for db credentials

759973
google-chrome	firefox
my application s javascript is working on firefox and ie but it is not working in google-chrome

760166
hash	md5
i am taking the md5 hash of an image file and i want to use the hash as a filename

760171
sdlc	methodology
if you are going to do anything in regards writing or designing code one of the things you should always do is write a spec irrespective of whatever methodology you are using wether it is scrum xp agile or sdlc

760173
post	get
use post to upload and get to download

760187
ienumerable	icollection
the for-loop is a nice alternative but if your ienumerable collection does not implement icollection it is not possible

760207
stdout	stderr
basically you need to redirect both stdout and stderr to your file

760211
width	margin
i then have a content div which has a left margin of more than the menu s width

760233
hide	show
listing works i extended it to a foldable solution to show hide directory contents

760301
std	ostream
if i implement a custom std streambuf that outputs to nowhere i imagine that the std ostream layer will still do all the formatting

760397
rss	feed
an rss feed of the last 15 errors

760402
jboss	resin
we support bundled applications servers including tomcat resin jboss and others

760416
swt	swing
i would use eclipse rcp when you really need a platform to built on top not just widgetery like swing or swt

760437
accessor	properties
i have a field which should only be used by its properties accessor

760458
mechanize	hpricot

760514
getter	setter
i had students in my design patterns class doing it for an assignment adding removing javabean getter and setter

760548
idictionary	icollection
for some reason i was glued to the idea that i wanted to stick with an implementation of icollection that wasn t an idictionary probably because i m refactoring classes that were originally meant to be used with nhibernate mappings

760561
dictionary	map
i would also strongly recommend that you reorder your type parameters - pretty much every dictionary map whatever i ve ever seen with key and value type parameters has put the key type parameter first

760575
int	boolean
you could implement these either as boolean flag columns or have an int column that acts as a bitmask

760631
post	get
before deciding to implement your own protocol take a look at http libraries like libcurl you could make your server use standard http commands like get for download and post for upload

760631
post	get
i m mentioning this because in java you ll probably be able to make a servlet to do exactly the same thing using http get for download and post for upload with less than 100 lines of code

postgresql	mysql
i m testing out dblinq-0.18 and dblinq from svn trunk with mysql and postgresql

760717
move	drag
problem when cursor move out of the child view during mouse drag obviously i am not able to track the event and hence i cannot resize the rectangle

760759
stdout	stderr
the server writes stdout and stderr to files maybe in logs

760872
hide	show
of course i could put the 4 steps in one page and show hide but that s not my point with the question

760877
getter	setter
as an aside in c++ it s an especially good idea to give both the getter and setter for a member the same name since in the future you can then actually change the the pair of methods

760922
uiview	subviews
from withing a uiviewcontroller that is tied to a uiview drawn in a nib file i try to add another view as a subviews to the first view

760922
uiview	subviews
the uiview shows up and the graphview subviews is instantiated correctly its properties are there and i can access its methods

760932
equals	gethashcode
with nhibernate entities you are meant to override equals and gethashcode

760972
put	get
the above code means get me text of first syslistview32 control hence 1 at the end from application which title starts with windriver and put it in ouputvar variable

761008
bids	ssis
you could possibly even just use ssis package editor in bids itself for the job and incorporate a facility in your application to execute the package

761046
width	height
there doesn t seem to be a drawpoint drawpixel whatnot but instead you can use drawrectangle with width and height set to 1 to draw a single pixel

761130
width	height
after a user inserts the width and height in the textboxes on the ui the size object should be created

761163
postgresql	mysql
in mysql or postgresql

761202
versioning	upgrade
what you can do is fix the headers yourself generate a patch and then apply that patch to later versioning of the headers if you upgrade the library

761208
put	get
i know its something simple i just don t know about so i put up a bid on elance to get someone to solve it for money even

761214
inherited	subclassing
edit on another note i wouldn t even use the phrase subclassing or the inherited phrase to describe classes that are defined to implement an interface

761237
jlist	jlabel
i abhor visual-based gui creator editor software but am getting a little tired of manually instantiating jpanels and boxes and jlabel and jlist etc.

761306
persistent	transient
or something to update the persistent object with the use of an transient object

761308
gridview	sqldatasource
i have an sqldatasource object linked to a gridview which receives data from a database when executed

761310
pull	push
i pull data in and push data to from the following

761311
ant	maven
the advantage here is that you dont get the overhead and transition cost to maven it uses ant targets so will work with your current set up

761328
post	get
unfortunately in many organizations you can t honestly have a post project discussion of what went wrong and how to prevent that next time without getting into a finger-pointing blame session that causes people be quiet rather than get bad marks against them for their performance appraisal

761367
post	get
you should be using a post request rather than a get request if it is important that a certain action changes something on the server

761367
post	get
responses to post requests are never cached although if you do post-redirect-get then the get after it may be but that s another story

761372
richfaces	icefaces
by the way adding ajax to facelets is easy if you use something like richfaces or icefaces

761386
mechanize	hpricot
bankjob uses mechanize hpricot as suggested in other answers to scrape a website with a table in it and produce csv output it also produces ofx which is irrelevant to your need - since it s bank-statement data but the csv should work for any kind of data

761396
put	get
to a person all the development managers wish we would get more qa people rather than configuration management because we have found that qa is extremely valuable to us and configuration management only causes projects to get farther behind while we wait for someone to put the new code out on the release schedule rather than when it is ready to go

761398
children	parent
you could still style this however you want to give it the appearance you want although it may not be as easy if you really are displaying tabular data about the parent and children

761398
children	parent
if changing the code from a table to a list is not possible desired but you have access to the server-side code that presumably generates this table you could at least make things easier then by giving all the children a class with the id of the parent and giving all the parent a common class

761440
children	parent
better would be to have the child nodes defined as actually children of the parent td then jquery can simplify things for you

761461
codeigniter	cakephp
i have used codeigniter and cakephp both of which are php mvc frameworks

761472
lisp	smalltalk
other dynamic languages such as common lisp and smalltalk can compete evenly with static languages in many use cases because dynamic lookups modifications are more controlled

761542
nunit	moq
i have been writing unit tests using nunit and moq with my silverlight code for some time now

761573
migrate	upgrade
this also gives you the ability to replicate migrate or upgrade the machine without reconfiguring and reinstalling

761573
ubuntu	debian
also run your lamp configuration on an operating system without a gui debian ubuntu fedora etc

761581
postgresql	mysql
since postgresql is a lot more sane than mysql there are not that many tricks to report on

761596
codeigniter	kohana
and a thing about codeigniter i asked some time ago people about it and most says that kohana based on codeigniter is better

761602
int	double
shorter types are converted to longer types float to double short to int etc.

761602

profiling	benchmarking
so then i read further and it seems 2.2.2 has benchmarking profiling built in

761701
put	get
in mvc a page is what you get when you put the three together

761729
width	height
what is the best page size height and width - mostly width to make the pages as i do not know what devices will be accessing the mobile portion of the site

761805
daemons	launchd	daemons	systemd
systemd management tasks such as managing the fdhost launchd service mssqlfdlauncher restarting filter daemons host process if you change the service account credentials configuring server-wide full-text properties and backing up full-text catalogs.

761849
hide	show
for the page that initially show the control the javascript in the control works fine but for the page that initially hide the control the javascript doesn t work

761854
public	protected
resharper suggests changing the accessibility of a public constructor in an abstract class to protected but it does not state the rationale behind this

761864
public	protected
therefore the only types that should have access to a constructor are its derived types and hence protected makes much more sense than public

761932
csv	tsv
i need to be able to parse both csv and tsv files

761938
rss	feed
also i suggest subscribing to ado.net related rss feed

761965
csv	tsv
in a well-formed csv or tsv file the number of commas or tabs respectively per line should be constant no variation at all

761991
put	get
i m using ibm s .net classes ibm.wmq to put a request message and then get a response message

762063
drawrect	touchesmoved
however this is still calling drawrect within touchesmoved which is giving me the effect i want but is way too slow on the iphone

762067
apache	lighttpd
lighttpd for video instead of apache

762080
apache	lighttpd
lighttpd for video instead of apache

762096
comparator	comparable
if all objects in the graph implement comparable - you can just call comparator

762116
mktime	strtotime
you can look into using strtotime instead of mktime

762189
joystick	keyboard
poll the keyboard joystick whatever and cache the last direction entered by the user

762221
hash	md5
function genkey given a string q this may be a md5 or sha hash and a seed string the function must generate a new string p

762239
cassini	iis
cassini therefore runs under a domain account and iis 5.1 under a local account

762239
cassini	iis
the situation sounds similar as fails when the server is running under a domain account which is my situation with cassini - running as my normal domain user account and works when running under a local account which is my situation with iis

762308
apache	mod-jk
if you have the capability to do so i would recommend using either mod-jk or mod-proxy-ajp to pass requests from apache to jboss

762340
feedback	review
they are doing his annual review and want feedback on the product of his work for the last year

762372
width	height
could you not just expose 2 properties - width and height from your model along with a size property

762372
width	height
the width and height would appear in your binding expressions and then when you want to get the size property it initialises based on these two fields

762377
stdout	stderr
or first join stderr and stdout and then grep out those specific errors

762394
width	height
i know the height width is available via window.innerheight and window.innerwidth

762416
google-chrome	firefox
when i run this in google-chrome ver 2 it doesn t return the string but it works in firefox ver 3

762469
versioning	upgrade
not all users will necessarily be in a position to upgrade some users may be accessing your site from their workplace where the it department mandates a particular versioning of ie

762524
getter	setter
anyhow you can add the intercepting code to getter and setter of each property too

762579
superclass	subclassing
you can t change the superclass from a subclassing

762592
width	height
a width height measurement of 0x0 is often indicative of the component in question not having been fully laid out at the time of the reading including child components

762614
put	get
to hopefully get around this i put all the data that needed to be decompressed into a memorystream and then read to end with a deflatestream

762640
stdout	stderr
you could read the stdout stderr of which into a variable or an array using backticks rather than checking for an exit code

762677
accessor	properties
this doesn t work because the verifyget method needs to know the return type of the properties accessor and i can t figure out any way to insert it at runtime you ll notice my lame attempt to use object which crashed and burned

762696
wordpress	joomla
the only other option i can think of is to simply replace your existing cms with a more robust one like drupal joomla wordpress which you could then extend with modules

762707
teamcity	nant
teamcity supports nant msbuild ant and am sure any other build platform you can install on on the buildagents

762734
decoder	encoder
use the decoder or the encoder

762751
post	get
feel free to make edits and post on the vim wiki or as a plugin if you get it refined

762758
dictionary	map
1 the format method accepts either a varargs array or a map in .net it d be a dictionary

762764
put	get
my model expects a blob so when i put in the image as img then it throws a fit and i get

762791
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari which behaves the same is trying to parse it as an html document but fails because it is non-whitespace text content outside the document element html which is not allowed

762791
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and ie manage to apply their â œfix up text outside any elementâ broken-html-rule to save you but google-chrome doesn t

762791
google-chrome	safari
but beware the mimetype parameter is not supported by google-chrome or safari

762805
getter	setter
- i like this pattern for setter getter

762846
width	height
when the browser s html parser sees a canvas element of a given width height it needs to allocate an onscreen pixmap to cover that area

762873
post	get
so while i started a lot of post i end up unhappy with them halfway through and they donâ t get finished or published

762895
phpunit	simpletest
phpunit and simpletest are the major xunit systems in php

762895

763096
public	protected
class key is a protected inner class of public class keyed

763119
bazaar	git
sounds like a distributed version control system like git or bazaar might be what you are looking for you can keep all of your code locally setup the repository on your external storage device but you still get the option of branching and merging

763137
multiplying	add
in 32 bit integer math basic math operations of add and multiplying are computed implicitly mod 2 32 meaning your results will be the lowest order bits of the add or multiplying

763137
modulus	bigint
if you want to compute the result with a different modulus you certainly could use any number of bigint classes in different languages

763137
multiplication	modulo
but i ve been told that there are special tricks for efficiently computing a b mod c when c is of the form 2 n -1 or 2 n +1 that don t use 64 bit math or a bigint library and are quite efficient more so than an arbitrary modulo evaluation and also properly compute cases which would normally overflow a 32 bit int if you were including the intermediate multiplication

763166
16-bit	64bit
this can require 64bit computations or you can split a and b into 16-bit parts and compute on 32-bits

763178
mbunit	nunit
and does support nunit mbunit and xunit.net

763179
post	put

763184
disk	ram
my primary objective is to write data to ram and when the cache is filled i want to flush all the data to disk database

763189
free	malloc
this will typically have asked the os for a big chunk of memory up front or at the first request which it then manages via the malloc free interface

763215
cvs	svn
syncing - merging in git is painless unlike scms like cvs or svn

763222
int	chars
in c a chars is an int type like int and long long int

763249
ssl	https
if you need https or anything else then you can put another reverse proxy or web server in reverse proxy mode that can handle the ssl before havp

763265
ssl	https
if you need https or anything else then you can put another reverse proxy or web server in reverse proxy mode that can handle the ssl before havp

763267
awt	swing
no gwt doesn t support layout managers from swing awt

763267
awt	swing
swing awt is pixel-based while gwt renders to html

763267
awt	swing
gwt layouts simply output different html tags div table inline elements ... while swing awt layouts do actually compute position of children components

763275
equinox	knopflerfish
he made it work with equinox and knopflerfish

763284
swt	swing
i would recommend swt over swing any day as it is very easy for an average programmer to create a responsive and native-feeling swt app while it takes a swing expert to create a decent swing app

763288
int	double
from the online help for imnoise it internally converts the image to a 0 1 double number adds the gaussian noise then converts back to int output

763289
stateless	stateful
www is made stateful usually by cookies uri parameters and session management and now that we ve those for a couple of decades we ve mostly gone over the stateful stateless issue of www

763319
swt	swing	awt	swing
the fact that it s written in java has nothing to do with any desire by the gwt team to allow you to port swt awt swing to gwt

763321
free	malloc
problems with malloc 3 does in most cases not arise from out-of-memory but from a logical error in your program that leads to misbehaved calls to malloc and free

763369
typeloadexception	missingmethodexception
check out this blog post debugging a missingmethodexception missingfieldexception typeloadexception

763378
post	get
an easier way to get yourself voted up is to post intelligent responses

763406
firefox	safari
most of my testing is on firefox and safari but some clients have expressed interest in using the app on internet explorer with winxp and vista

763421
post	get
i realize there have already been a number of post on n-tier design and this could possibly be me over thinking things and going round in circles but i have myself all confused now and would like to get some clarity from the community please

763521
accurev	svn
i m not sure if you are asking anything but you are demonstrating that accurev streams are different tools than git or svn branches

763530
strlen	strcmp
sticking a null in the middle of a character array would certainly interfere with the c string functions such as strcmp strlen etc

763621
postgresql	mysql
but my customers will be deploying to mysql or mssql or postgresql and i can t guarantee that a compatible olap engine will be available

763643
children	parent
i also tried manually passing my domain graph a session and having each parent entity evict its children

763675
getter	setter
sometimes the model object is empty or the viewmodel is just forwarding property getter setter to the model object

763695
argumentnullexception	argumentexception

this works fine in xamlpad but not in silverlight 3 and expression-blend 3

763701
hide	show
set up beforesend and complete callbacks to show hide an in progess image say an animated gif spinner

763720
filtering	grouping
my approach is a bit more generic putting the filtering parameters in tables and then using grouping by having and count to filtering the results

763723
bitblt	gdi
to get the lightening fast drawing speeds you really need gdi and bitblt which is a serious pain in the but to use with gdi+ especially if you are in managed code hard to tell if you are using managed c++ or straight c++

763764
apache	nginx
it seems to be common wisdom that if you are deploying django on an apache server then you should still put an nginx server in front of the application to serve static files at which nginx is more performant

763801
put	get
if you put on a function which returns something other than a hresult you will get strange results random exceptions

763801
put	get
if you put on a function which does not set the last win32 error code you will get garbage instead of a useful error code

763805
rss	feed
i am using .net c# and i want to fill datagrid with rss feed

763805
rss	feed
when i return rss feed in to dataset then i got multiple table wich storing diffrent data

763831
rss	feed
it s open source and handles rss feed nicely

763831
rss	feed
you can easily bind to a rss feed like this

764006
rss	feed
take a look at the rss feed using firefox so you can easily see the structure of the feed

764074
verilog	vhdl
pacoblaze was written in verilog which like adam said less common than vhdl

764106
csla	.net
so on the .net-side tools like .net tiers or csla come to mind

764175
codeigniter	cakephp
your other option is using an existing framework like others have suggested such as cakephp codeigniter etc

764192
hash	md5
i have never checked and compared the md5 hash to the real md5 hash at programs homepages

764193
scheme	prolog
not everybody is comfortable expressing their ideas in an object oriented design say c# or java as functions and closures scheme as logical derivations prolog -- there are some problems for which it fits

764196
ant	maven
if you have problems with doing that in maven itself try using ant create two different deploy tasks one per server and another task which has them as dependencies

764196
ant	maven
done this you need to integrate the new ant tasks into maven which isn t difficult at all using the antrun plugin

764209
trojan	virus
if the download is done via unencrypted http then it s being routed through a number of networks and there most definitely is an opportunity for people to manipulate it and insert a trojan or virus

764215
hash	md5
an md5 hash is a form of validation

764226
sorting	filtering
i have a page books that display a user s books and there are a few sorting and filtering options in that page like this

jboss	weblogic
if your application is written in java and you are running on either jboss or weblogic saml support is built-in

764262
public	protected
this class would have then access to the protected _rows stored internally and you could add a public method to applying your filtering

764307
xlc	acc
both gcc and xlc are able to handle these but acc 3.73 on h11.23 pa risc is puking

764315
avr	microcontroller	microchip	avr
for new development in c others have already mentioned the embedded systems market where the development is often for software put into rom or eeprom flash memory where it is referred to as firmware for microcontroller microchip pic avr 80c51 68hc11 etc. where object code size ram usage and performance matters so the usage of a programming language with fewer high-level or generic abstractions or assumptions is desirable

764315
quicksort	mergesort
priority queues binary trees mergesort quicksort knuth-morris-pratt and karp-rabin should be at least vaguely familiar

764315
boost	stl
this is because the c language lacks the stl boost cpan and other standard libraries available in other languages

764315
haskell	scheme	lisp	prolog	lisp	scheme	scheme	prolog
for programming experience functional languages like lisp scheme prolog ml objective caml haskell and scala are good candidates for making you think different. admittedly prolog is actually a declarative logic programming language but it is still programming experience expanding

764392
rss	feed
for example if you have a blog with an rss feed your project structure would look like this

764396
yacc	bison
i m trying to figure out how i can display a message prompt when using lex yacc flex bison

764401
cos	inverse
this value is |a|.|b|.cos theta but as the two normal vectors should be normalised it will give cos theta so just take the inverse cosine to get the rotation amount

764408
postgresql	mysql
if and only if you elect to use the more involved blob approach here s a snippet of code from an old project of mind back when i was learning django that handles blob for mysql and postgresql

cat	tee
tee copies stdin to stdout like cat and additionally writes everything to the named file

764490
merb	ruby-on-rails
this will be made less onerous by ruby-on-rails 3 which is intended to be orm agnostic after the merge with merb

764490
merb	ruby-on-rails
if ruby-on-rails 2.3 + datamapper presents problems one can also consider other ruby web frameworks merb sinatra etc.

764499
post	get
one more method is to combine post and get values

764534
floating-point	integer

764577
disk	ram
all your changes will be cached in ram until you commit at which time the database will explicitly sync to disk

764595
lang	http-equiv
however html 5 changes this and the meta http-equiv content-language is considered non-conforming html which nevertheless defines the document-wide default language and only supports a single language so is effectively identical to xml lang on the html element

764600
bash	zsh
i am trying to move to zsh from bash

764628
equals	gethashcode
create a code generator that uses reflection to look through your business object fields and creates a new partial class which overrides gethashcode and equals

gentoo	linux
but on gentoo it seems that the less command line is a little more powerful than the one i use on other linux distributions or cygwin mac os x.

764660
intersect	contains
you ll need to use an algorithm to see if the rectangles intersect and also check if one is completely contains within another 3 tests for the simple algorithm

764662

i ll mess around with those parameters and post my findings when i get a chance

764750
ienumerable	ilist
ienumerable and ilist are interfaces

764750

ilist arrays both implement ienumerable

764794
width	height
he says the code should be able to resize both height and width yet his resize method

764868
int	chars	int	double
in java everything except byte short int long float double and chars is passed by reference

764892
division	multiplication
three is out because the conversion to binary would require expensive multiplication or division with remainder

764920
width	height
consider that my page has a fixed width 2 columns of varying height and my footer has a 100 percent width

764921
prop	each
in our display object list program each character prop and npc has two parts a resource database assistant and a character instance

764972
bash	zsh
you can t expect zsh to be able to run the bash commands in your .bashrc so you should convert it into a new .zshrc instead of trying to run .bashrc from .zshrc or copying the former into the latter

764972
bash	zsh
though - and i d first misread this part of your question - you shouldn t experience errors from bash when running your .bashrc unless you put zsh commands in there

765028
postgresql	mysql
use an r to postgresql or mysql etc. interface

765112
folder	directory
i want my repeater datasource to point to an image inside my image folder in my root directory

765135
gnupg	gpgme
i remember discovering bug in shadowing g_malloc in gpgme code or other related to gnupg as the glib internals changed

765155
width	height
you might need to put in some height and width conditions on span too

765156
subtract	add
you can subtract the begin iterator from the const_iterator to obtain the position the const_iterator is pointing to and then add begin back to that to obtain a non-const iterator

765183

if you are not sure of the type of the error and occurance but want to continue the execution of the code although an exception-handling had occured then a try-catch block will help

765210
try-catch	exception-handling
codewise it is correct works however the power of try-catch is that when an exception-handling is thrown from deep down in one of the functions you re calling

765304
versioning	upgrade
i was using s#architecture fluentnhibernate to create this mapping i have upgrade to the latest versioning and it seems to be working fine

765305
post	get
i have written a script in python that uses cookies and post get

765322
boost	stl
in my opinion the only folks that need to stay on top of absolutely every nuance of the language are the library writers -- people implementing boost stl loki etc

765341
cassini	iis
the app includes a global.asax file that should run some code - it works fine in cassini but in iis the debugger never hits the function

765362
maven	xdoclet
maybe have a look at the xdoclet maven plugin- xdoclet is often used for generating sources from doclet-style markup in classes autogenerating mbean interfaces from implementations and that sounds similar to what you re doing

765434
width	height
where ptr points to an array of width height uints

765435
post	get
i suspect though that what you really want to do is not get the view model but the underlying widget model and select list value on form post

765446
pop-up	dialog
ultimately the last frame on the list is one that has been provided by the os this handler will pop-up a app-crash dialog if an unhandled exception reaches it

765466
switching	screens
what i tend to do these days is temporarily switching the media of the print stylesheet to screens while i m developing and then switching it back before going live

but when i click in firefox or google-chrome this tip doesn t shã³w at all

765670
awt	swing
part of my answer seems to be here but i m wondering how to get a blur effect in swing awt

765676
allocator	stl
in addition there is a pool allocator included with it fsa.h that i wrote to speed up stl on game consoles

765722
integer	unsigned
warning negative integer implicitly converted to unsigned type

765731
integer	unsigned
-10 is parsed as an integer value and assigning int to unsigned int is allowed

765737
portrait	landscape
i assume it has something to do with the iphone storing extra exif metadata about the camera position while the photo was taken however one of the pictures was taken in portrait mode and somehow got rotated to landscape

765757
post	get
try doing it yourself if you get stuck at specific points then you can post those specific problems

765768
regasm	tlbexp
to make .net assembly visible to com i need to use tlbexp tool and or regasm tool

765823
folder	dir
i want to list all the folder inside dir that have inside them a folder called foo

765859
interpreted-language	dynamic-languages
groovy is not an interpreted-language it is a dynamic-languages

765913
valgrind	memcheck
if you ve used memcheck from valgrind you ll probably be familiar with this message.

765929
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
as for production side of things upgrading your database in transaction msi-style installation is much better than attempting to upgrade at each app startup since you can potentially end up with desynchronized database-application versioning

765960
put	get
finally the only way i had to assuredly get the dll to update was to remove the copy of the dll from the gac remove the copy of the dll from the bin directory run the site so that it would fail and then put the new version of the dll into the gac

765972
post	get
if you fetched the page via a post a refresh will re-send the post data while putting the url in a new window will issue a get to the server

765973
pop-up	dialog
exampleã you change a file extension and a dialog pop-up saying

766023
int	chars
an array is a group of entities of the same type say int or chars len 1024 or bank and they are one after another so you can access each of them with a numeric index

766061
inherited	subclassing
in order to subclassing nstextfield you would want to create a new objective-c class file file - new fileâ but edit the header so that the class inherited from nstextfield instead of nsobject

766072
integer	unsigned
if you use int32 or int64 as the type for a negative number the resulting varint is always ten bytes long â it is effectively treated like a very large unsigned integer

766111
nsbuttoncell	nsmatrix
the technique must be possible since nsmatrix does this but after reading every api and forum available i haven t found a way to initiate nsbuttoncell s tracking behavior without using its control s setcell method

766147
stdout	stderr
i run this program remotely and lose handles to stdout and stderr if that information helps at all

766176
width	height
of width width and height height

766232
mouse	keyboard
the window manager also registers for raw input events from the input devices keyboard and or mouse and it generates messages for those input events

766244
nunit	moq
it would be helpful to link premade installers for these things like the standard installer for nunit and moq linked above

766282
gridview	repeater
no problem using a gridview if that layout is exactly what you want - but it very rarely is and a repeater is probably a better choice

766286
mouseover	mouseout
i have an unordered list with mouseover and mouseout events attached to the li elements

766286
mouseover	mouseout
when i mouseover the li the mouseover event is fired but when i mouseover the link contained in the li the mouseout and the mouseover events are both fired in order

766289
invokelater	invokeandwait
if you have an ampty start method i d recommend you use invokelater in the init instead of the tutorial recommendation of invokeandwait

766313
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter
alternatively use the mouseenter and mouseleave events instead of mouseover out

766340
apache	nginx
i would say proxy-ing django to it s own server only really comes in if your rolling with mod_python ie serve static with nginx and proxy django to an apache instance running mod_python

766381
inherited	properties
my problem today has been wanting to first use a wildcard in my css and then trying to use the inherited properties instead

766450
slideup	slidedown
it seems to use target s initial position where it was before the expansion contraction which makes sense since both events are initiated at the same time but even when i try to pause scrollto and wait until the slideup slidedown transition is over it still behaves the same

766451
opera	safari
if i remember correctly some older versions of safari and maybe opera didn t support todataurl but the more recent versions do

766459
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
normally if you get the style to work in both firefox and google-chrome safari ie is only a few corrections away of being correct

766478
put	get
when you take the object out of the collection you get the integer that you put in

766479
inherited	properties
multiple inherited makes it easier to compose classes from small mixin base classes that implement functionality and have properties to remember state

766491
firefox	safari
there is a great site position is everything that details how firefox ie and safari conform to standard css

766515
children	parent
changing the number of children updated the counter cache as it should and removing the counter_cache true from the child would let me update the value on the parent

766574
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
update i deleted the clientaccesspolicy.xml file and kept just the crossdomain.xml file in place and bingo everything worked

766580
serializable	deserialization
for example a large part of our system based on hadoop is based on a mapper that handles serializable and deserialization of items to json and applies a number of processors that each take an item of content and either modify and return it or return null to reject

766587
rss	feed
i thought about using kodak s image of the day rss feed but i m having quite a time figuring out how to parse it

766587
rss	feed
i also tried the astronomy picture of the day via this rss feed but it s just the original page s html stuffed into cdata.

766595
ssl	https	tunnel	packets
for example you could tell the ssl tunnel to listen on port 443 https and forward all decrypted packets to port 80 http

766614
listview	gridview
the listviewupdatedeventargs object that s passed in to the itemupdated event handler for the listview does not have a keys collection like the gridviewupdatedeventargs object passed into the rowupdated event handler for a gridview

766621
for-loop	loops
merge sort algorithm aside nested for-loop with iterator s is just as valid as nested for loops with two variables i and j

766629
getter	setter
i like how groovy makes all of your instance variables and class variables public and writes getter and setter on your behalf

766646
getter	setter
i use netbeans which has tools to write getter setter auto implement abstract methods and various other shortcuts

766648
versioning	upgrade
the lack of backwards compatibility makes 3.0 a much harder sell than a seamless upgrade because you have to adjust your thinking and discard some programming techniques to use the new versioning

766649
getter	setter
in this kind of situation an ide which can write the getter and setter for you can be your friend

766649
getter	setter
i find that having to write the getter and setter are the most repetitive and un-interesting part of writing new classes

766649
getter	setter
with an ide like eclipse which can automatically generate the getter and setter for you it can reduce the pain of writing the redundant code

766664
getter	setter
but as others mentioned eclipse and netbeans will easily create the getter setter so if you don t have to do anything special with them then it should be pretty easy

766664
getter	setter
i tend to put my properties in their own class which is just getter setter then i don t have to look at the verboseness as well as equals and hash methods if needed then in my other classes i just use that and hide the boring extra coding

766683
getter	setter
no getter no setter no hassle

766722
cvs	svn
one of the great things about tools like cvs and svn is that it is quite easy for developers to end up with an unofficial personal branch from things that are not properly checked in merged etc

766810
libjpeg	libpng
so far i ve made sure i ve installed libpng and libjpeg with darwinports i m running on os x leopard but that doesn t seem to do the trick

766838
memcpy	malloc
man memcpy man malloc etc

766912
unsigned	short
i could just pass the number pf_packet represents it s an unsigned short

766917
versioning	upgrade
i ve found that vendors generally provide a reasonably straightforward upgrade path from versioning to versioning and upgrading becomes more problematic if the upgrade must skip a few versioning .net framework 1.1 - 3.5 sp1

766917
versioning	upgrade
if these upgrade are not done the new application being developed is limited to using old versioning and consequently will add to the time and cost of future upgrade

766936
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
client application has some field number a and number b and label for result and some possible actions represented by the buttons add subtract multiplying divide etc

767060
int	chars
if you have a very straight forward method signatures methods that takes and returns primitive types such as int chars void .

767060
boost	stl
however if your class methods uses modern c++ programming techniques such as boost shared pointers and stl containers then it is a very different story

767107
innodb	myisam
personally i d use the innodb plugin and the file per table option but you could also use myisam if you fully understand its characteristics and limitations

767132
perforce	svn
most of them have a way to handle different versions of a project for example perforce svn etc

767174
for-loop	loops
i don t see incrementing iter or it in the outer for-loop invalidating the logic in the later for loops the point in 1

767185
cvs	svn
based on your experience of a scm tool svn git cvs etc can you please tell me what features from below list is supported by that scm tool

767250
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
however on vista it throws argumentexception s and invalidoperationexception s on certain files and on win7 it throws fileformatexception s and ioexception s

767268
super	self
i believe calling super a self .__init__ will call the superclass of a which is object

767276
hash	salt
i know we hash and salt passwords but that s another story as we do not really need password originals

767300
hash	salt
the best scenario is to hash the email address with salt

767328
children	parent
changes made to a parent process only propagate to newly-created children

767371
nunit	mstest	mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest
nunit or mbunit instead of mstest

767371
mbunit	nunit
with the given oss alternatives subversion nunit mbunit i don t see any disadvantages using them

767398
gridex	janus
i ve been working with janus gridex for web for a few days

767446
goto	break
to be sure there is still goto in java - it s now called break continue and throw .

767448
getter	setter
1 user object should be plain object with just getter setter methods this would facilitate passing object across tiers - from data access tier to business tier to web tier

767453
profiling	benchmarking
if you re trying to measure your code execution there are profiling or benchmarking for java

767461
expander	grid
the reason that you can t simply use a grid or dock panel with the textblocks in to control the alignment is because the default template of expander left aligns the header content instead of allowing it to stretch

767553
allocator	stl
i also was using a lot of stl so i created a custom allocator google for stl custom allocator - there are loads of links

767621
packets	multicast
it s possible that your switch is multicast aware but if igmp is disabled it won t notice if any attached hardware subscribes to a particular multicast group so it wouldn t forward those packets

767651
versioning	upgrade
having put a lot of faith in jquery already especially their techniques for cross-browser compatibility i will either upgrade to versioning 1.3 and use their function providing that upgrading doesnâ t cause too many problems or use this suggested method directly in my code

767697
rtsp	rtmp
afaik it is not possible to consume an rtsp feed in the flash player so i m thinking that we would need some sort of a converter on the server that takes the rtsp stream and converts it to rtmp so we can consume the feed in our flex app

767719
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to tomcat 6.0 or downgrade the servlet jsp jstl versioning

767818
google-chrome	firefox
use the title attribute to get your desired result on ie firefox google-chrome

767962
post	get
my rule of thumb is to use ajax when the context of the view isn t changing but a full request get post when a new action new context is invoked

767969
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can use the mouseenter mouseleave events to do this

767970
gridview	objectdatasource
if you use the objectdatasource as your gridview s data source you don t have to do those code-behind methods - it s all handled for free

767980
gif	png
does it become a gif png etc

768009
vb.net	vb6
this served as well when ms decided to axe vb6 in favor of vb.net

768107
tablelayoutpanel	numericupdown
the program consist of one form with one tablelayoutpanel tablelayoutpanel1 one numericupdown coins and one button flip

768237
portrait	landscape
for example a device may be designed with a portrait square or landscape screen

768237
portrait	landscape
this will reset the device back to portrait when your application gets focus if anyone changes it to landscape

768272
quicksort	mergesort
functional quicksort and mergesort

768272
quicksort	mergesort
here s a linked list with quicksort and mergesort methods written in a functional style

768278
gwt	icefaces
there are a couple of frameworks which implement this securer server driven ria one is it mill toolkit based on gwt and icefaces should also be one to my knowledge

768288
hash	md5
there is a couple scripts out there on the internet to create an md5 hash

768310
decoder	encoder
if this is how your data is encoded there are plenty of snippets around that will tell you how to decoder it and many languages have the encoder and decoder built in or in an included library

768315
post	get
the system of adding page parameters to a url is know as http get as distinct from http post and some others less commonly used

768318
short	base
in short it s impossible to guarantee consistency with a large enough code base

int	chars
and the people who read his description assumed that by type he meant the actual programming language type int float zero-terminated string chars pointer

768394
g++	gcc
you can use make to compile your c and c++ programs by calling gcc or g++ in your makefile to do all the compilation and linking steps allowing you to do all these steps with one simple command

768401
stdout	stderr
- supports redirection of stdout and stderr

768406
entities	entitymanager
try to use entitymanager s flush method between persisting part and fetching car entities

768455
16-bit	64bit	unsigned	short	int	chars
the integral types are byte short int and long whose values are 8-bit 16-bit 32-bit and 64bit signed two s-complement int respectively and chars whose values are 16-bit unsigned int representing utf-16 code units

768476
min	max
then look at min max and average recordsize columns

768483
gmail	hotmail
for example if you have say 50 aol users 20 gmail users 20 hotmail 5 yahoo 5 misc

768483
gmail	hotmail
- you could argue you are willing to risk that 5 of your emails are rejected - so take the minimum size allowed by aol gmail hotmail and yahoo

768500
pyodbc	adodbapi
i ve used pymssql and adodbapi and when those threw exceptions created issues i swapped out the code and replaced it with pyodbc and it either fixed the problem or gave better error messages so i could debug faster

768527
pull	push
your other option would be running a database server on the machine creating web services that run locally and push pull the data from the database and then call those services from your flash application

768560
mouse	keyboard
therefore if your event handler is intensive when the index changes it will slow down the scrolling as it will run each time the selected index changes each time your scroll with the mouse or keyboard

768594
post	get
if you need to post the data not use get one easy option is to create a form element on the fly attach input elements with the values you need and submit it

768621
post	get
edit i did finally get this working and decided to write a short blog post with complete source code

768641
post	get
i m trying to do an asynchronous http s post on .net compact framework and i can t seem to get it working

768641
post	get
the exact same code works perfectly when i do a simple http get but when i throw in some post params everything fails

768661
post	get
if you happen to be able to sanitize and post the code we might be able to get a bit more insight but realistically i can t see a need for it

768684
width	height
if you have tables like standarea area in m 2 standsize length width height etc - then you would have objects in your model to match these standarea standsize - these could both extend a common base class standdata

768726
profiler	gprof
gprof - profiler

768783
min	max
i m positively scared that by the end of the project i may end up with handling with very a high number of fields - and for each i would have to make sure they follow a very similar set of constraint and behaviours for example i want them to be bounded between a min and a max

768783
getter	setter
i want to be able to increment and decrement both without going through a setter and getter

768783
getter	setter
getter and four setter and maybe a couple resetters too

768783
getter	setter
now i hit in this problem while plugging field into gamecharacter most java textbooks say that each class should have private fields with public getter and setter

768783
getter	setter
are the advantages of encapsulation so massive that i should go ahead and have getter getter and setter getter and so on.

768790
google-chrome	firefox
i have a fairly simple crud web application c# asp.net that runs fine in firefox ie7 and google-chrome

768797
getter	setter
for example if you have strength you could have a strengthmanipulation class that is initialized to a specific player object and then provides getter setter all with appropriate validation and exceptions and perhaps things like calculating strength with bonuses etc

768797
getter	setter
when you access a field in vb at least in old vbs you usually call a property getter and setter and vb simply hides the call for you

768826
getter	setter
it sounds like your main complaint isn t so much with the abstraction of setter getter methods but with the language syntax for using them

768826
getter	setter
direct field access is fine until you need to switch to a getter or setter and then you will have some refactoring to do possibly ok if you control the whole codebase

768840
public	protected
as long as types remain unchanged in their public or protected layout and method signatures are not changed adding methods or types is fine the jit should be able to link the dll just fine

768850
udp	tcp
indy delphi is a library tcomponent for delphi representing the true power of winsock.it provides components for tunelling tcp udp connections and much more

768959
post	get
assuming of course we re working with html forms and get post data backend language agnostic

768974
floating-point	integer
for example a generic structure for adding numbers would not care whether given floating-point or integer arguments but would have difficulty adding q + pi

769008
rss	feed
i subscribe to a number of rss feed mostly from within my own timezone uk currently gmt+1 a.k.a bst

769008
rss	feed
when i load up my rss reader in the mornings it has gathered all the nz news at once normally around 100 items and i feel compelled either to read them all or to mark them all as read to feed my need for zero-unread-count

769008
rss	feed
i figured a good solution to this would be to time delay the rss feed somehow so i would be drip-fed the stories at their time +12 hours so i could read them through the day as they come in

769017
getter	setter
create a class with those members protect the setter or set them from the constructor and provide getter methods

769043
getter	setter
you could define a bean to hold the values fields with getter setter or use a map for the values

769050
implements	extends
instead what you should do is first create your class that implements the same interface or extends someclass and then pass that instance to doeverything so your class becomes agnostic to implementation of someclass

769065
post	put
there are some tools apart from selenium that can help with testing an atom service - have a look at jmeter for example which can help a lot with encoding the put post requests

769129
stdout	stderr
redirects â stderr â to â stdout â at the end makes the command run in background

769130
stdout	stderr
if you want to pipe stderr or stdout to a file you can do that easily

769157
onfocus	onblur
onblur is the opposite of onfocus

769158
stdout	stderr
every unix program has two output streams stdout and stderr

769158
stdout	stderr
the 2 redirects stderr file descriptor 2 to a file represented in this case by 1 which tells the shell to use file descriptor 1 which is stdout

769265
getter	setter
are the advantages of encapsulation so massive that i should go ahead and have getter getter and setter getter and so on.

769265
getter	setter
imo encapsulation has nothing to do with wrapping a getter setter around a private field

769265
getter	setter
the problem with getter setter is that they create overly tight coupling between the object with those methods and the rest of the system

769265
getter	setter
one of the advantages of real encapsulation is that it reduces the need for getter and setter decoupling your object from the rest of the system in the process

769300
ftp	telnet
indy is a winsock wrapper that provides blocking socket behavior for network internet programming ftp telnet http etc.

769309
pop-up	dialog
when i call a refresh webbrowser.refresh a dialog box pop-up to confirm

769357
regasm	tlbexp
yes you will need to set the comvisible attribute to true and then register the assembly using regasm or regsvcs along with tlbexp

769371
disk	ram
session data is stored in the ram of the server if you have a high traffic site that is going to get full real quick and the last thing you want is that data being swapped to disk

769417
getter	setter
in this way the backing collection is never instantiated if the getter is called without the setter ever being called

769432
httphandler	httpmodule
i ve used both httpmodule ihttpmodule interface and httphandler ihttphandler interface and it occurs to me that i could implement this using either mechanism

httphandler	httpmodule
as stated here httpmodule are simple classes that can plug themselves into the request processing pipeline whereas httphandler differ from httpmodule not only because of their positions in the request processing pipeline but also because they must be mapped to a specific file extensions

769460
post	get
post will not get cached

769473
multiplication	modulo
constant space with no additions subtractions multiplication divisions modulo or arithmetic negations

769513
equals	gethashcode
you only need to override gethashcode on reference types if you override equals

769513
equals	gethashcode
if two objects are equals as per equals you need to guarantee that they ll have the same hash code with gethashcode so you should override it

769529
subtract	add
so if i hit 8 on the number pad i don t want numpad8 i want the int value 8 that i can add or subtract or whatever

769547
equals	gethashcode
as for the other questions reed actually beat me to the punch re gethashcode and equals

769588
int	chars
in order to obtain its numerical valaue you should find the chars for the key that was pressed then parse it from a chars to an int

769624
subtract	add
so i create two classes add and subtract

769642
subtract	add
you can expose an interface imathoperation for example with a single method such as compute and then specify types implementing the interface add subtract etc in the di framework config file

769646
firefox	safari
also i m not sure if text-indent works in ie--i m currently on a mac and it works with firefox and safari

769656
jar	war	jsf	seam
i have a fairly typical javaee application composed using ejb3 seam components spring beans and jsf all packaged into several jar and war files inside an ear file

769686
width	height
and the width 2 and height 2 of map will product the following

769686
width	height
granted i have to know the width height of the map in order to make sense of the file

769692
spaces	delimiter
this is part of a process that reads in a spaces delimiter record and writes out a fixed format record

769693
ftell	fread
you will be throwing aways niceties of ftell fread but it will skip a layer of indirection if read throughput is really important

769752
disk	ram
you may want to do a more comprehensive performance analysis running the both programs with different input sizes from different devices a ram disk would be good and multiple times in a row

769768
super	extends
there s some restrictions on what you can use extends and super for in this fashion

769807
fputcsv	fgetcsv
for php use build in fgetcsv fputcsv functions

769827
comparator	comparable
as long as your property class is comparable using the default equality comparator you should be able to take the set union and assign it to the properties collection

769859
post	get
now if you re asking for prevention of duplicate submit the standard way is the post redirect get pattern

769920
for-loop	loops
one of the most obvious primitives there is the parallel for-loop - looks sort of like a for-loop but tries to execute loops in parallel

769943
put	get
finally get a computer and take it apart and put it back together again

770009
vb.net	vb6
for the same reason vb6 programmers needed to understand the windows api to get anything done and vb.net and c# programmers need to at least know what msil looks like you should be familiar enough with javascript to understand what jquery is doing

770044
jquery	simplemodal
it opens a client-side jquery popup using simplemodal the popup itself still needs some work

770047
width	height
most height width properties on tags assume you are talking about pixels so it doesn t know what your character means

770207
tcheckbox	tlistbox
add a tlistbox tcheckbox tedit to the form and run the application

770267
stdout	stderr
the construct is shorthand for that is it redirects both stdout and stderr into the pipeline

770337
post	get
let me know if you manage get this work together as i am myself looking into this subject i actually found this post looking for this answer myself p

770361
perforce	svn
writing a wrapper is a good idea anyways as it gives us the option flexibility to swap the vc system out with svn or git why you would if you can use perforce i don t know...

770367
cvs	svn
svn provides the version number as a macro like cvs

770374
dlsym	dlopen
do you mean dynamically loading libraries using dlopen and dlsym and so on

770401
profiling	debugging
to get the dissassembly window go to debugging | windows | dissassembly i m using the c# developer profiling

770403
rss	feed
it s actually an rss aggregator but since all sharepoint lists have built-in rss feed you can use it just as well to aggregate the sharepoint lists from the different sites

770410
ant	maven
you could also do a similar sort of thing with ant or another tool but this is what i have done using maven

770414
submit	submission
this is probably happening due to an error in the submission handler code - safari will submit the form as usual if there is an exception there

770436
hide	show
i thought about a bunch of panels or divs that i could hide show but not sure i really like that solution

770438
inherited	subclassing
the com.xxx.domain.model.scheme class is a mapped subclassing entity of the abstract fund entity on a single_table inherited hierarchy and i m getting this error for all entities on the hierarchy

770451
post	get
uris addressability and the use of http get and post

770469
uiview	subviews
the main wrapper view is a subclass of uiview and it contains a row of buttons that are added as subviews

770523
single-quotes	double-quotes
single-quotes and double-quotes

770543
typedef	struct
the library allocates and frees memory for an internal struct - which is hidden from the client using a typedef

770544
ant	maven
you can set it up in your ant script we don t use maven for our projects and it bumps the version number automatically

770566
typedef	struct
we can treat them as abstract data types or objects if you like and define a typedef ed struct disc program track say to represent each one

770597
inherited	subclassing
another option is to subclassing page and then make your pages inherited from it so you ve got one place with all common functionality

770626
tapestry	wicket
for java take a look at struts2 spring mvc tapestry wicket etc

770685
serializable	deserialization
one problem of this approach is that xml-rpc doesn t support any authentication system and has some lack of performances in the serializable deserialization between the object notation and the xml representation

770691
postgresql	mysql
one thing i like about postgresql over mysql is that it has a slightly more open licensing policy

770770
tail	lsof
perl xargs lsof find grep bash tar gzip tr tail diff patch and bc

770784
portrait	landscape
my aim was to get the application functioning in both landscape and portrait mode and all i could figure out to do it was this code below

770784
portrait	landscape
the app was working fine in portrait but when switched to landscape the text wouldn t expand to the right to fill up the additional space

770790
folder	directory
unfortunately that directory where tomcat is located is in another user s home folder 1 to which i have ony read access

770792
cdr	cons
define z cons car x cdr y has allocated a new cons cell for the head of z

770805
readonly	temporary
this temporary removes the readonly protection for the memory where the iat resides

770883
hash	md5
you need to md5 hash the email address and then put it into a gravatar url

770883
hash	md5
if you want those random drawings that appear you can use an md5 hash to get them

770885
cdr	cons
after define z cons car x cdr y z holds a brand new cons with the same as x and the same car as x and the same cdr as y

770885
cdr	cons
after define v cons cdr x cdr y v holds a brand new cons whose car is the same value as the cdr of x

770885
cdr	cons
the very same cons cell as cdr x

770896
ready	each
i think we should get ready status from ajax call before starting making another call to server except you were creating a new ajax object for each call but i could be wrong

770921
hash	md5
md5 was only broken in the sense that there are algorithms that given a bunch of data a additional data b can be generated to create a desired hash

770923
hash	md5
if you care at all about security it would be better to choose an unbroken hash algorithm such as one of the sha-2 family sha-1 has also been weakened though not broken as badly as md5 is

770923
hash	salt
you can mitigate this attack by storing the password on your server hash with a random salt

770923
hash	salt
you store the pair on the server and send the salt to the client so that it can compute hash password+salt to use in place of the password in the protocol you mention

770923
hash	md5
while the current attack against md5 may not work against the protocol you describe md5 has been severely compromised and a hash will only ever get weaker never stronger

770948
hash	md5
md5 provide more collision than sha which mean someone can actually get same hash from different word but it s rarely

770964
glassfish	weblogic
in an app server such as glassfish weblogic etc spring can use the jta transaction manager

770987
vim	emacs
edit of course some text editor vim emacs mcedit etc is needed

771012
multiplying	addition
the scaling multiplying by begin-end seems to work correctly but the addition of begin does not seem to be returned

771015
centos	linux
etc. my platform is linux based centos 5 with apache 2 and php

771026
lisp	scheme
it uses common lisp which is slightly different from scheme in some aspects but you should be able to get by with it

771032
profiling	instrumentation
a profiling should do the trick or you could build a test version with some instrumentation

771037
hash	md5
presidential election in a file with the md5 hash value 3d515dead7aa16560aba3e9df05cbc80

771037
hash	md5
the md5 hash value is worthless as a checksum because too many different files give the same result

771044
hash	md5
in your example the hash would be of md5 message + time + md5 password and you could safely store md5 password in your database

771122
width	height
the position of a control is within the client area of the parent so first we need to get the width and height of the parent window

771122
width	height
then we get the width and height of the control

771126
for-loop	loops
even if you re not familiar with ruby s c internals it s pretty clear that this function has a for-loop iterating upward to check that the type of all the arguments is t_module and then uses a while loops iterating downward to actually include the modules - so the modules in include x y z would actually be included in the order z y x

771139
ubuntu	linux
i usually prefer linux for programming i program in django on ubuntu

771149
vmware	virtualbox
using vmware or virtualbox you could set up a shared folder so both the virtual instance and linux can look at the same file to test the website locally

771163
vim	emacs
i will admit my bias i use os x i like linux i use vim i like emacs sometimes

771163
vim	emacs
the definitive text editors for linux are vim and emacs both of which are quite often used from the command-line but both of which have quite wonderful graphical versions

771163
vim	emacs	vim	aquamacs	emacs	aquamacs
i personally am a vim man but with a gui that suits my native environment os x i really like emacs well aquamacs especially for perl

771163
vim	emacs
i personally find vim easier to use both as a command line editor and as an ide whereas i never got the feel for emacs as a command line editor

771163
vim	emacs
as a bonus both emacs and vim are readily avaliable for windows and are almost ubiquitous on unix-based platforms

771163
vim	emacs
emacs is open source under the gnu gpl and vim is open source under a charityware license that asks you to feed the children in uganda but that is still very gpl-like

771163
vim	emacs
eclipse is a full-blown ide unlike vim and emacs which have little overhead and allow you to write a quick shell script as easily as a large application and some find that a bit cumbersome for their work but it suits others very well

771165
folder	directory
put the appengines_utilities folder in your application directory the directory that contains your app.yaml file

771188
extjs	mootools	codeigniter	cakephp
moreover you could learn using framework if you have a time be it css framework blueprint 960 etc php framework cakephp codeigniter etc and ajax framework mootools yui extjs etc

771236
children	parent
when i tried this very reluctantly see below as to why it really fell over there were relationships in my l2s entity pointing to children and then the child pointing back to the parent and obviously when enumerating for building the wcf object it could not traverse the tree infinitely in this fashion and to the best i remember it resulted in an overflow exception so what i am basically saying is beware if you go down this road

771246
opera	firefox
use as many browser platforms for testing as you can under linux firefox opera konqueror

771267
getter	setter
so what you might do is on your own custom subclass of exception databaseexception add a triggeringsqlstatement member with a getter and setter and then at the place where you attempt to execute the statement catch the original exception from postgresql create a new databaseexception set the triggeringsqlstatement to be the statement you just executed and call initcause on the databaseexception to set the exception caught from postgresql as the cause of your exception

771332
profiling	debugging
this allows you to build a nicer api improves testability and add hooks for debugging logging profiling

771334
range	max	range	min	min	max
imagine for a range of values you want the min and max returning but you also wish to return the initial data no summary of data

771505
put	get
put the names in both places clarity is the reward you get for the task of maintaining the signatures in two places

771623
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
we use a couple of different machine images with ie6 ie7 ie8 ff2 ff3 google-chrome opera safari for windows installed on them

771662
expression-blend	silverlight
have a look at jesse liberty s silverlight video tutorial series which includes a couple of videos on expression-blend

771789
vsto	add-in
when creating an vsto outlook add-in there are some restrictions which are a bit annoying

771789
vsto	add-in
maybe an alternate way of creating an add-in without using vsto

771794
heapsort	bubble-sort	quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	bubble-sort
so this comparer can be used with bubble-sort as well as with quicksort heapsort or any other sort algorithm

771818
versioning	upgrade
you didn t mention your visual studio versioning but if it s 2005 you might want to consider an upgrade to 2008

771825
int	double
the call is ambiguous between the following methods or properties system.math.round double int and system.math.round decimal int

771829
int	double
the problem is that you make an int division results also in an int and a int can be implicitly converted to both double and decimal

771856
integer	unsigned
yes it s safe indeed it s the most effective way of converting a byte into an effectively unsigned integer

771857
teamcity	nant
i have a nant build file set up which works fine from the cmd line but not in teamcity

771892
quicksort	heapsort
average asymptotic order of quicksort is o nlogn and it s usually more efficient than heapsort due to smaller constants tighter loops

772003
ubuntu	debian
ps yes i know it just works with debian ubuntu distros -

772009
getdate	dateadd
select date from table where date dateadd d -7 getdate

772009
getdate	dateadd
select date from table where dateadd d 7 date getdate

772009
getdate	dateadd
ck s correct but it should also be noted that the first can be faster because dateadd d -7 getdate is a constant expression it only needs to be evaluated once no matter the number of rows while dateadd d 7 date in the second needs to be evaluated for each row

772013
min	max
the same logic applies if you want to use having clauses on max min etc.

772107
getter	setter
i m trying to get all properties from a type but using typedescriptor.getproperties thistype will only supply me with properties that has both setter and a getter

772111
postgresql	mysql
i am contemplating a switch from mysql to postgresql

772111
postgresql	mysql
see also migrate from mysql to postgresql

772162
postgresql	mysql
also converting from mysql to postgresql on the postgresql wiki

772170
postgresql	mysql
basically postgresql is pretty strictly ansi mysql isn t

772170
postgresql	mysql
i d strongly suggest getting your mysql to as strict an ansi compliance as possible before converting to postgresql then checking for any warnings when you run your applications

772196
postgresql	mysql
although bad form in mysql in postgresql an inner join without an on clause can t happen use cross join or the like

772211
springsource	grails
in order of prevalence and support the option with the most commercial support available documentation books and jobs is the plain servlet framework one --and then grails which is owned and supported by springsource a major player on java frameworks

772214
put	get
you have to put the inotifypropertychanged in the viewmodel to get commandsink to work

772226
folder	directory
allow directory browsing in iis and download the root folder

772245
vmware	esx
vmware esx is the heavy for-pay solution the big brother of esxi and has all of the high-end goodies needed for a virtualized server environment including live migration of running machines from server to server yes you can move across hardware shared images shared filesystem etc

772355
std	ostream
i want to define myostream which inherits publicly from std ostream

772503
min	max
then look at max min and average record size

772521
int	double
if it does the string is converted to int or double

772524
cpu	affinity
the tsc isn t guaranteed to be synchronized on all cpus so if your thread process migrates from one cpu core to another the tsc may appear to warp forward or backward in time unless you use thread process affinity to prevent migration

772559
folder	directory
i just needed to copy the include file to a folder on my hard disk and set visual studio tools|options|vc++ directory to point to the copied folder

772573
min	max
aggregation queries group by having sum avg max min

772593
icommand	ivalueconverter
you either need to modify your myhyperlink class so that viewmodelcommand is also an icommand or write an ivalueconverter that will find the correct icommand implementation given the command name in your view model

772606
pull	push
i d suggest grabbing a free chat script from elsewhere or if you want to roll your own for fun experience then go ahead but start with a db and build a page that will push and pull messages from the server

772624
hide	show
one of my first ideas was to convert this example into library that i can call from .net application basically my library would contain 2 methods show and hide tooltip

772667
pull	push
if you just want to learn it start with a simple ajax pull app then try to program one using ajax and push

772674
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
they are inherited from the superclass and since they are not declared private they are visible to the subclassing

772692
shadowing	named
what you are doing is shadowing the existing variables defined as x and y meaning that body.x and body.y are essentially overlapping the named for point.x and point.y making the latter two variable completely inaccessible from the body class link to java language specification definition of shadowing

772692
shadowing	named
named shadowing is generally perceiving as a bad practice and a cause of bugs and if you turn up the javac compiler warnings the compiler will dutifully warn you about this

772710
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
i upgrade perl from perl58 to perl588 on suse linux.it looks that even though the config.pm exists for the older versioning the newer versioning installation breaks the older version.while the upgrade of perl on other oses like hp and aix does not disturb the older versioning

772711
hide	show
as an alternative since you are simply doing a show or hide option you could just use buttons which might provide a better ui

772715
firefox	safari
also they look much better in firefox and safari than in ie

772774
hide	show
and now you can use all of window s methods and properties to move resize show and hide your tooltip as a bonus you can also insert more advanced context into the tooltip images buttons hyperlinks your logo or make it look more intresting

772785
rss	feed
see up of the inbox there are rss feed

772785
rss	feed
but my own rss feed don t see description tag

772872
hide	show
now i am synching this with the other datagrid adg2 to show hide columns

772872
hide	show
but when i show hide columns all the other columns are not rearranged properly despite of having the same sizes as the columns in adg1

772876
int	double
i ve created the following structure which maps unique double values to one or more pairs of int

772901
rss	feed
for example i go to gmail and i click search rss feed i add my own rss and gmail need send request to my own webserver

773001
disk	ram
so i imagine the fastest is to write a program that streams the results from the disk holding in ram only the last valid value and the current one filtering out every value that is equal to the last valid

773029
post	get
this may be a pathetically simple problem but i cannot seem to format the post webrequest response to get data from the wikipedia api

773068
for-loop	loops
i don t know whether it will be faster than the two options you present but it is more standardized than the qt foreach and avoids some of the problems that you may run into with a regular for-loop namely out of bounds indexing and difficulties with translating loops to a different data structure

773078
int	double
unfortunately much of the data is in strings where it should be int s or double etc.

773078
int	double
i thought i d use an extension to the string class and generic s to pass in the type this is because it could be a double or an int or a long

773081
post	get
you seem to be pushing the input data on http post but it seems you should use http get

773084
post	get
you might want to try a get request first because it s a little simpler you will only need to post for wikipedia login

773152
udp	tcp
udp connections are not like tcp connections

773225
hide	show
js for tabs generally does no more than show hide maybe load content

773236
width	height
in order to obtain an image that is rotated angle degrees to the right and scaled down to height x width pixels

773236
graphics2d	bufferedimage
using graphics2d and bufferedimage i will have to do this which is neither readable nor easy to write

773271
quicksort	mergesort
see quicksort vs merge sort for a comparison of quicksort and mergesort which are two of the better algorithms in most cases

773277
mergesort	heapsort
if you re looking for something with good worst case performance i d look at mergesort and heapsort since they are o n log n algorithms in all cases

773277
mergesort	heapsort
heapsort is nice if all your data fits in memory while mergesort allows you to do on-disk sorts better but takes more space overall

773285
mergesort	heapsort	quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort
quicksort is usually the fastest but if you want good worst-case time try heapsort or mergesort

773290
cpu	irq
so when a peripheral triggers an irq line the pic interrupts the cpu and tells which vector to jump to as if the corresponding int instruction was executed

773293
vb.net	vb6
dos to vb3 vb3 to object oriented design in vb6 and vb6 to vb.net

773293
vb.net	vb6
finally it is straight forward to make a design in vb6 that is ports over to vb.net readily

773352
coff	omf	elf	coff	elf	omf
there are lots of different formats out there coff omf elf the list goes on..

773356
integer	radix
for example for integers or anything that can be expressed as integer the fastest is radix sort which for fixed length values has worst case complexity of o n

773384
readonly	temporary
the main lesson to take away from that is use const references in readonly loops as it avoids the creation of temporary instances

773385
csv	tsv
i ve got a web site that outputs reports in various formats html csv tsv excel etc

773406
boost	stl
my own guess speculation but it makes a lot of sense is that phobos will become analogous to stl a truly standard library of core functionality and tango will become a utility library kind of like boost as more of its core functionality is absorbed into phobos and or druntime

773414
boost	stl
my implementation is c++ so any stl or boost would be excellent

773417
min	max
instead of doing a min or max on my aggregated group i wanted to do a first

773445
min	max
you are right not to use max or min

773445
min	max
since it sounds like all your really care is that you get exactly one arbitrary record for each group what you can do is just min or max an id field for that record and then join the table into the query on that id

773449
post	put
i can generate new post without any problem but when i want to put comments to my post i can put at most one comment for each post

773449
put	get
when trying to put more i get a classcastexception as follows

773486
typedef	struct
i ve got a library with a certain typedef struct

773499
implements	extends
you will need to extends the web application into a new zone and either implements forms based authentication or use windows authentication with a reverse proxy such as isa server

773558
touchesbegan	touchesended
i m using touchesbegan touchesended to handle the touches

773560
typedef	struct
is not a complete typedef declaration in c as it does not give a name to the type only to the struct struct tags are not in the same namespace as type names in standard c

773586
put	get
that said you could either have those images in a hasharray imagename- alt and get the alt from there or you could put the alt in the value of the radio concatenated to the filename with a separator like | and then parse them out in the function you use to display the image

773593
rel	alt
why not put the alt value in the rel of the input then place that on the image too

773619
gridview	rowdatabound
likewise you will need to read from your saved check state list to re-check the boxes during the gridview rowdatabound event

773638
webclient	httpwebrequest
i ve tried like 7 different ways to create an http request all more or less the same thing different implementation using webclient using httpwebrequest etc

773707
ubuntu	linux
if you use a popular linux distribution like ubuntu you ll have perl and i believe python loaded initially

773707
biopython	bioperl
these are popular languages for use in bioinformatics and have some nice libraries bioperl biopython cpan etc

773738
width	height
height 300 width 300 inlineid myonpagecontent

773738
width	height
change the values of height width and inlineid in the query accordingly inlineid is the id value of the element that contains the content you would like to show in a thickbox

773762
min	max
round-trip ms min avg max med 20 23 37 21

773762
min	max
round-trip ms min avg max med 19 23 38 23

773762
min	max
round-trip ms min avg max med 269 272 275 272

773762
min	max
round-trip ms min avg max med 63 66 73 67

773803
listview	gridview
they specifiy a style to be applied to all s below a table with the class names listview detailstable gridview

773807
rss	feed
i m realizing that pulling in a weather rss feed might be the only clean solution but i am not very familiar with parsing rss feed so it will require a lot of labor on my end since i ll be digging through documentation

773828

773866
hide	show
style it however you want show it when you start loading your content and hide it when you re finished

774165
inherited	properties
create a custom membershipuser object that inherited from membershipuser and provides my extra properties

774182
serializable	deserialization
cloning and serializable don t interact well with the use of final fields if you need to set the value of that field to something different than what is returned by clone or the deserialization process

774200
int	double
otherwise you specify what class or primitive you return int double string whatever

774221
lapack	mpi
for dense matrices mapreduce is the wrong solution -- you need locality and broad exchange among nodes -- and you should instead look at lapack and mpi and friends

774251
serializable	deserialization
there are lots of little details which this doesn t explain but this is the general idea of serializable deserialization

774289
ironruby	ironpython
you can trivially access clr internals objects and return values from ironpython i don t know about ironruby

774296
multiplying	add
my coworker always says first estimate the project length then multiplying it by two add 1 and then add the next highest units

if you are looking for a reusable x-browser solution the following function works for ie firefox and opera

774381
ferret	sphinx
i ve used ferret in the past with few problems although i ve heard sphinx is better

774426
multiplying	add
i am aware of the multiplying and add solution but since these are arbitrary length numbers the multiplying and add operations are not free so i d like to avoid them if at all possible

html does not support a dropdownlistfor with checkbox

774613
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
you can have a dropdownlistfor or a checkbox list

put	get	post	put	post	get
this allows you to authenticate not just post and get methods but put head and delete so you have the full complement of rest methods

774706
put	get
i have put my code into production and what ever i do i can t seem to get an api key to work

774707
versioning	upgrade
and as long as your app s in versioning control i d do the upgrade in one shot and go through the error messages one at a time

774750
post	get
you may get a clue on how to solve your problem by looking at this post css overriding styles on nested elements

774823
hide	show
the only way that i know of is to dispose the ctabitem for the tab you want to hide and then create a new ctabitem when you want to show it

774826
oledb	openrowset
edit again you may want to give the sql openrowset method a try it will let you insert directly to any oledb provider

775039
getter	setter
those property setter getter should be private anyway

775056
put	get
to put it another way if a user is logged in and goes to and is an admin user they should get what they would see the same thing as if they had gone to

775066
hide	show
do you have a method that hide everything except the background do the thing that make the page shift and show everything now at the right place

775069
integer	unsigned
using classless inter-domain routing cidr you will have a tuple address prefix where address is a 128-bit unsigned integer and prefix is a tiny 0..128 unsigned integer

775096
junit	testng
junit 4 doesnt seem to support the description attribute for the test annotation like testng does

775104
width	height
you can then call the javascript function from silverlight and pass it the actual height and width

775121
postgresql	mysql
if those limitations aren t an issue for you and you like the oracle approach then give it a shot otherwise consider an opensource server like postgresql or mysql which have none of the aforementioned limitations

775121
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql will allow you to scale your application without any cost other than hardware obviously

775147

775169
implements	extends
you can create a completely custom class to function as the renderer given it implements certain required interfaces or in most cases you extends an existing component

775177
allocator	stl
the stl implementations i ve used support an allocator as a template parameter which you could use to make a container use your segregated free list but you d still be writing your own

775178
children	parent
in an inverted parent-children object model you must modify the parent s collection of children objects in order to cause nhibernate to update the child records references to the parent

775179
boost	stl
i don t think stl has anything but it looks like the boost library might have it

775205
typedef	struct
typedef struct

775257
postgresql	mysql
if it s windows i d go with oracle or mysql as i have heard only bad things about running postgresql on windows machines

775268
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
if the public facing apache is left only to serve static content then consider replacing it with something lightweight such as nginx or lighttpd

775313
udp	tcp
it is typical of any udp tcp or config attribute work in any language or environment

775339

if it is 16 bit use unsigned short

775458
ssl	https

775514
inline	inlining
however f# supports inlining which allows functions to be more generic because they are inline into each callsite

775575
getter	setter
as these are property getter and setter using get and set are appropriate

775580
ubuntu	debian
i m looking for a way to interact with the gnu libparted library from python but so far what i ve found a gsoc project from 2005 and an ubuntu debian package that s been dropped from the archive have been disheartening

775646
getter	setter
property getter and setter don t have names starting with get and set because it s some convention reserved for naming getter and setter

775646
accessor	properties
ultimately i think you just need to get over whatever hangup you have about using get and set for things that aren t properties accessor

775697
width	height
drop this xaml onto a brand-new user control that does not have a width and height set

775702
hash	salt

expression-blend	silverlight
i ve been using silverlight 3 and expression-blend 3 since the day they became available about a month now and haven t had any real issues

775719
queue	fifo
the main question is if this low-level sharing is really needed - i am not an expert on linux but i would consider to use for instance a fifo queue for the master shared memory segment so that the os does the locking work for you

775739
put	get
my strong belief therefore is that i need additional fu to parse my eval statement to get the same time i put into the field

775766
int	chars
one effective property of this is that if i have a nil list int i can t interchange it with a nil list chars

775766
int	double
it also occurs to me that the instance of list in the specification of cons is also confusing you be really careful when parsing that whereas cons is specifying a constructor which is basically a pattern that haskell is going to wrap the data into list a looks like a constructor but is actually simply a type like int or double

775771
hide	show
the same way you could also maximize or hide show your window

775786
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
but otherwise the most common filesystems windows ntfs fat linux ext 2 3 mac os x do not store any metadata or other information about files

775797
libjpeg	libpng
also i know that there are other requirements for libjpeg libpng etc

775804
boost	stl
including stl boost and tr1

775814
post	put
my intention here is to have a single thread of will-make-you-a-better-programmer-just-for-reading sort of articles or papers or really standup blog post that the writer has put in a lot of effort to distill anything that will take you less than a day to read

775827
haskell	sml
dispatch found in haskell sml and

775906
prepare	execute
you prepare a statement such as an insert and then execute it with just the relevant parameters

775935
wtl	atl
if you want to wrap the structures with a class i d recommend you try atl wtl first since the structures you re wrapping might already exist as classes there

775962
postgresql	mysql
this will reduce the risk of conflicting configs and also increase the flexibility of running a custom set of vms oracle + mysql + postgresql and not the others etc.

775990
post	get
like on page submit you will get all page data in action method which accepts post verb right

775999
folder	directory
along with the folder hierarchy into my working directory

776005
inherited	subclassing
they occur when a persistent class is inherited by two or more subclassing

776011
gif	png	tiff	png
it can read convert and write images in a variety of formats over 100 including dpx exr gif jpeg jpeg-2000 pdf photocd png postscript svg and tiff

776012
button	checkbox
in this example i put one button to check and one button to uncheck gridview checkbox

776020
gif	png	tiff	png
it can read convert and write images in a variety of formats over 100 including dpx exr gif jpeg jpeg-2000 pdf photocd png postscript svg and tiff

776043
tiff	bmp
the exception to this rule would be uncompressed image formats like uncompressed bmp or uncompressed tiff but i doubt you re using that

776054
gif	png	tiff	png
it can read convert and write images in a variety of formats over 100 including dpx exr gif jpeg jpeg-2000 pdf photocd png postscript svg and tiff

776075
put	get
we get paid a lot of money to put them in the right order and make magic happen

776102
bibtex	latex
however i d like to learn some more advanced features of latex such as editing or even creating my own class files and bibtex styles

776111
post	get
i ll post code when i get it to work but i d be interested if others think this is the right thing to use btw i m vista or greater for os level

776133
versioning	upgrade
if that s not an option then you have to go with the oldest versioning otherwise if you upgrade and don t maintain backwards compatability you ll break existing clients

776137
inherited	properties
another way is to use the fullname properties of the fileinfo class inherited from filesysteminfo see usage below

776158
3-tier	n-tier
i don t have the impression the link you mention is telling something about 3-tier or n-tier

776165
superclass	subclassing
where ichild is the interface for subclassing of superclass

776180
awt	swing
i m using swing components to make the gui but when i looked for the way of making the canvas i only found the class canvas from awt

776197
awt	swing
as for the question on awt and swing yes it is true that you do not want to mix components from the awt and swing as they differ in the way they render gui components

776197
awt	swing
awt is based on heavyweight components meaning they native windowing for painting the gui while swing is based on lightweight components meaning the gui is drawn by java itself without using native components

776197
awt	swing
a good guide on the difference of awt and swing is provided in painting in awt and swing article from sun

776223
put	get
now what i know so far is that i have to use a dependencyproperty to get the value from the usercontrol and then put it inside a public string

776289
ironruby	ironpython
the dlr may be the complement for this since it can dynamically generate execute code from abstract syntax trees it s used for ironpython and ironruby

776347
rar	zip
if the file is an exe check whether it s a sfx and if it s a zip rar or 7z sfx check the embedded archive

776431
mbunit	nmock
we use visual assist x for refactoring support acceptable mbunit gallio for unit testing the managed classes and nmock or rhinomocks for our mocking framework

776501
getter	setter
there are ides that support code generation of getter and setter methods

776523
integer	unsigned
works for any unsigned integer type not just uint32_t so you could make versions for other sizes

776523
clang	icc
icc but clang doesn t seem to provide them anywhere except in msvc compatibility mode with

776523
16-bit	64bit	clang	icc
gcc and icc not clang also provides __rolb __rorb for 8-bit rotate left right __rolw __rorw 16-bit __rold __rord 32-bit __rolq __rorq 64bit only defined for 64bit targets

776523
x86	64bit
for narrow rotates the implementation uses __builtin_ia32_rolhi or ...qi but the 32 and 64bit rotates are defined using shift or with no protection against ub because the code in ia32intrin.h only has to work on gcc for x86

776523
compile-time-constant	constants
a carefully-written gnu c inline-asm rotate would allow the count to be an immediate operand for compile-time-constant shift counts but it still couldn t optimize away entirely if the value to be shifted is also a compile-time constants after inlining

776613
versioning	upgrade
we also use release branches and we do ocassionally check things into them usually critical bugfixes for customers who cannot upgrade to the latest versioning immediately

776690
ienumerable	icollection
this is sometimes confusing to people especially if you have something modifiable like an icollection returned rather than an ienumerable

776762
division	modulo
the modulo is the compliment to the div operator and returns the remainder of a division of two whole numbers

776779
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
instead of datainputstream you can use objectoutputstream to write and objectinputstream to read

776796
superclass	subclassing
return values are no problem as long as they are more specialized in subclassing than in superclass

776818
actionscript	mxml
now when you create thelist either in actionscript or in the initialize event handler of your mxml component make a new yourcustomeventdispatcher give to it a reference to thelist and add it to itemrenderer

776820
folder	directory
how do i add new views to the site adding in a new folder to the application views scripts directory seems to do nothing

776850
codeigniter	cakephp
here is codeigniter s and cakephp s for starters

776941
bazaar	svn
i started using bazaar after a long camping in the svn field

776941
bazaar	svn
as a result i use the same svn repo structure in bazaar and i perform a physical copy of the trunk every time

776950
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for example safari 5.1 firefox 7 google-chrome 20 etc

776952

pascal	delphi
i m new to c# been a pascal lover until i found c# in depth.in delphi there is a try statement that is also implemented in c#

777099

sysml	uml
having said that uml and it s offspring sysml are right now the only game in town

777123
factors	mean
by that i mean remove all the external factors that can have an impact in my problem

777149
bazaar	svn
i have no idea why svn has it that way but basically tags are just a marker at a point in time in your bazaar repository

777153
hide	show
as a site-builder i don t need to create graphicsâ i only rearrange the layers hide ones and show others pick colors widths heights and so on

777164
nvarchar	sqldbtype
the nvarchar sqldbtype maps to the .net string datatype

777183
ironruby	ironpython
managed jscript been really hard to find relative to ironpython or ironruby

777198
photoshop	fireworks
i think the more affordable fireworks can also work in my experience however the only reliable way to open the psd as the designer intended was using photoshop

777245
post	get
there is no ispostback -- everything is either a post or get or other http verb

777245
post	get
if you need to have the same action name do both get post and they actually do different things you can either give them separate signatures or use the actionnameattribute to alias one of the actions so the methods can have different names

777282
post	get
i m not sure if i understood your question correctly but on the controller you would have an action that handles the initial get from the browser and a second action to handle post

777293
tinyint	boolean
mysql tinyint iirc boolean maps to this automatically

777337
hash	md5
if your only purpose is to be able to validate the contents of your business transaction log table you could store a hash value md5 or sha in say an xml file on the application server

777444
ubuntu	debian
under a debian system i m on ubuntu with apache2 and the deflate module already installed which it is by default you can enable deflate compression in two easy steps

777455
client-side	server-side
i m thinking this would work both client-side and server-side with results being converted to the appropriate language-specific data structure or perhaps kept as json

777461
getter	setter
setter and getter enables you to add additional abstraction layer and in pure oop you should always access the objects via the interface they are providing to the outside world .

777461
getter	setter
consider this code which will save you in asp.net and which it would not be possible without the level of abstraction provided by the setter and getter

777481
hide	show
you can hide it and then show it again w o any problems though

777481
width	height
it could be your left and right positions that make it close -5000 pixels in combination with your width and height 0 pixels

777508
int	boolean
so if i use an int instead of boolean i can doe something like

777534
width	height
returns a new cgrect containing the x y width and height values of the view s bounds

777551
width	height
additionally i would like to be able to set the width and height of the table as a whole and have all the text in each row to dynamically resize appropriately

777555
stdout	stderr
in this case you could even just use system and check its return value for being zero while redirecting the stdout and stderr to dev null

777575
rss	feed
i have an application running under jetty and i want the application to return self referencing absolute urls when generating an rss feed so a client must be able to work without a current url context

777581

general purpose boost loki stl

777767
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
ie opera safari and google-chrome all support this behavior

777837
rss	feed
if it is for you to see not an on-screen counter but something you can look at separately google analytics perhaps with feedburner if you have an atom rss feed

777884

778046
stdout	stderr
that s like backticks but gives you stdout and stderr separately

778071
hex	binary
this is a bit hacky but you could go via the hex string representation and there to binary with the hex codec

778081
uniq	grep
we use grep cut sort uniq and join at the command line all the time to do data analysis

778093
pyexcelerator	xlrd

778095
bmp	png
i even tried converting it to png jpg and bmp to see if that makes any difference

778119

in some database interbase firebird perhaps others... your can trigger event

778161
solaris	sunos
taken from sunos 5.9 aka solaris 9 usr bin false

778164
sorting	filtering
this is more of a subsonic 3 solution but have you seen rob s screencast using subsonic3 t4 and the jquery grid to do pretty much most of what you are asking above paging sorting filtering

778183
postgresql	mysql
which is incorrect - the postgresql databases contain schemas and those are the equivalent of the databases in mysql

778195
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox

778277
getter	setter
getter and setter methods

778287
serializable	deserialization
secondly deserialization must support literally any type that is serializable

778357
mouse	keyboard
the actual behavior of the control is split in two parts where one part is the atl gunk that interfaces with the ole host and the other part is the real meat which just receives callbacks for window attach sizing drawing and mouse keyboard events

778361
folder	directory
i m looking for the easiest solution to implement a folder browse dialog with checkboxes in front of the directory in my c# winforms project

778367
button	checkbox
what i want it to do is that when the checkbox gets checked it deletes the row instead of people having using the remove minus button

haskell	scheme
a lot of people think the reason languages like haskell and scheme haven t gotten wider adoption is because people are ruined from them by imperative programming

778530
fastcgi	scgi
scgi like fastcgi is a serialized protocol suitable for inter-process communication between a web-server and a web-application

778531
g++	gcc
you just have to make sure you use g++ not gcc

778547
multiplying	add
in all things you want to learn in the order that such knowledge is required such as learning how to add before learning how to multiplying

778568
imperative	declarative
functional programming declarative programming of any kind really on the other hand is a completely separate paradigm that requires a whole new set of considerations performance and otherwise many of which are much easier to visualize if you understand imperative programming first

778570
single-quotes	double-quotes
be aware too that you can use single-quotes instead of double-quotes to reduce the need to escape characters like double-quotes and backslashes

778602
yacc	bison
if you insist then f lex and yacc bison are the tools likely used by your compiler-writers

778608
width	height
you should create one image with a width of 50px and a height of 24px where you have both the play part and the stop part

778647
icommand	ivalueconverter
i can work around this with a fairly ugly hack that involves using an ivalueconverter to instantiate the icommand i need

778647
icommand	ivalueconverter
the hyperlink binds to the name of the icommand it needs from the alert object and the ivalueconverter swaps the name for a new instance of the icommand itself

778652
yacc	bison
it is so much nicer to handle than bison yacc

778687
post	get
instead of a link in the email you could probably just create a form that post the information instead of sending a get request to your site

778688
width	height
i have the reportviewer control set with width of 100 and height of 100

778688
width	height
in ie7 while it takes the entire width of the page it only takes up a small portion of the height

778688
width	height
in firefox both the width and the height are messed up

778712
put	get
you can also use the remove tag to get rid of things you don t want or put everything in a location and tell it not to inherit

778737
websphere	ibm
disclaimer i am an ibm consultant and specialise in websphere esb

778737
websphere	ibm
ibm certainly markets both websphere message broker and websphere esb as products that make it easy to build an esb along with the datapower hardware appliance

778759
client-side	server-side
server-side validation is required simply because client-side validation can be disabled

778786
client-side	server-side
as others mentioned you should keep the duplication as the client-side validation is to help the application react sooner to help the user but the real validation is on the server-side as you should never trust anything passed in until it has been validated

778786
client-side	server-side
you will probably do more extensive validation on the server-side esp if there is a need to check against a data source for example is the username unique would be on the server-side but is the username long enough or an email address could be done on the client-side and server-side

778790
client-side	server-side
what you can do is have the server-side validation logic being run by web services that your client-side validation can call via ajax and also when you post back to your server

778797
stdout	stderr
with system both stdout and stderr will go the same place as the script s stdout and stderr unless the system command redirects them

778797
stdout	stderr
to capture a program s stdout but discard its stderr

778797
stdout	stderr
to capture a program s stderr but discard its stdout

778797
stdout	stderr
to capture a program s stderr and let its stdout go to our own stderr

778797
stdout	stderr
to read both a command s stdout and its stderr separately you can redirect them to temp files let the command run then read the temp files

778797
stdout	stderr
you can also use file-descriptor redirection to make stderr a duplicate of stdout

778797
stdout	stderr
note that you cannot simply open stderr to be a dup of stdout in your perl program and avoid calling the shell to do the redirection

778797
stdout	stderr
this fails because the open makes stderr go to where stdout was going at the time of the open

778797
stdout	stderr
the backticks then make stdout go to a string but don t change stderr which still goes to the old stdout

778797
stdout	stderr
to capture a command s stderr and stdout together

778797
stdout	stderr
to capture a command s stdout but discard its stderr

778797
stdout	stderr
to capture a command s stderr but discard its stdout

778797
stdout	stderr
to exchange a command s stdout and stderr in order to capture the stderr but leave its stdout to come out our old stderr

778797
stdout	stderr
to read both a command s stdout and its stderr separately it s easiest to redirect them separately to files and then read from those files when the program is done

778806
getter	setter
and wrapped in a getter setter property

778807
django	turbogears
you ll want some kind of framework i d recommend django or turbogears

778810

these properties along with any protected methods constitute the inherited interface of your class

778848
put	get	post	put	post	get
provide a callback as the third argument of the post call that will get the value returned from the method and put it in your textbox

778907
put	get	post	put	post	get
note that because web browsers generally only support get and post rails uses a hidden field to turn these into put and delete requests as appropriate

778983
pop-up	dialog
after switching to ie8 i was able to determine the cause was the ajaxcontrol toolkit s modal pop-up dialog

778991
hash	md5
i m looking for something to do this that is nice and simple as in having a text file with username md5 hash pairs

779069
super	abstract
inheritance is more to do with inheriting members and or member implementations from parent to child aka base to derived super to sub abstract to concrete class

779078
multicastdelegate	delegation
the compiler creates a new type for you derived from multicastdelegate which in turn derives from delegation

779092
jdk1.4	jdk1.5	jdk1.6	jdk1.4	jdk1.6	jdk1.5
i have observed a great difference in sun java performance when code is compiled through jdk1.6 as compared to jdk1.5 or jdk1.4 over 4 folds

779117
profiler	yourkit
using a profiler like yourkit will not only tell you which methods are hot spots in terms of cpu time but it will also tell you where threads are spending most of their time blocked or waiting

779122
multicastdelegate	delegation
from an implementation perspective the delegation class defines the fields used to represent a delegation s function pointer and the multicastdelegate class provides the base line functionality used by events

779138
awt	swing
for examples some schools teach people to build guis using the awt or swing class library that are supplied with java although there are other options

779148
struts	wicket	jsf	wicket
you may not even need to know all lower-level servlet and jsp stuff thoroughly as higher-level frameworks such as struts jsf or wicket have become popular

779166
width	height
don t set width or height or stretch on the path

779172
i2c	spi
acted as communications translators for board-level i o spi - i2c - rs232 - usb

779178
put	get
so sql says yes i have a value for you but it can t put it anywhere so you get an exception

779184
int	boolean
value types are primitives such as int and boolean or structures and can be identified because they inherit from system.valuetype

779283
awt	swing
is there a functional equivalent to swing or awt in c#

779293
apache	nginx
the idea was to keep keep static file serving away from apache by placing a light-weight event-driven http server like nginx in front of the heavy apache processes

779293
apache	nginx
be sure that you re not prematurely optimizing by using nginx where apache + mod_wsgi would do just fine

779293
apache	nginx
nginx is awesome but for a django solution nginx is imho a better fit as a load balancer for many apache instances or a separate server for static files

779354
int	double
the input object can be anything like string or int or double etc. sometimes it can be a multi dimensional array

779367
post	get
this all works fine i get the object post back from the create view - and my method membertocreate.save actually writes what it is supposed to to the database

779399
move	drag
2 allow the user to easily move items around whether by drag and drop or some other method

779407
post	get
then on successive http requests you might send along that guid in an http header or as a value in each get or post request similarly to the way facebook handles their api clients for instance check the timeliness of that value on the server and if all s well carry on

779441
button	checkbox
however there are checkbox in my gui and i can t figure out how to deselect these checkbox when the reset button is pressed

779455

779458
postgresql	mysql
linq to mysql oracle and postgresql dblinq

779504
binutils	bfd
for a system based on formats supported by binutils most of the detail you need can be learned with the bfd library

779504
elf	dwarf
a quick scan of keil s web site seems to indicate that they abandoned their proprietary arm compiler in favor of licensing arm s realview compiler which appears to use elf objects with dwarf format debug info

779516
gif	png
i don t think anybody should ever be editing web graphics jpg gif png directly

779517
google-chrome	safari
the strangest thing though is that this error only occurs in google-chrome and safari

779517
opera	firefox
firefox ie and opera all post the form without a problem

779571
google-chrome	safari
if you have a cfform cfgrid on the calling page you may want to look at the javascript that s generated by cf and test it against google-chrome safari

779585
cherokee	lighttpd
there are however several very lightweight http servers like cherokee and lighttpd

779645
put	get
in safari the only way i can get it to not submit is to put onsubmit return false

779674
ant	maven
there are also plugins for maven and ant that invoke hbm2ddl automatically

779702
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
between ie6 7 8 firefox 2 3 google-chrome safari and the other lesser known browsers and versions it sounds like an nightmare to support across the board

779734
firefox	safari
it is most noticeable in firefox and least noticeable in safari with ie being in the middle

779746
implements	extends
you can achieve this behavior by implements your custom membership provider or extends an existing one

779805
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
google-chrome and safari will pass a field s value even if the field lacks a name while ie firefox and opera do not

779811
for-loop	loops
ssis actually has a for-loop container that can loops over a set of numbers over the rows in a rowset over files in a folder etc

779832
draggable	droppable
this is an issue when using the jquery ui draggable droppable plugins because it clones dom elements during a drag drop

779832
move	drag
i want to be able to inject data into the dom element that is move during a drag drop operation

779879
strstr	strncpy	strstr	substr
you could build your own replace function using strstr to find the substr and strncpy to copy in parts to a new buffer

779884
strstr	strcpy
you d need to roll your own using something like strstr and strcat or strcpy

779895
postgresql	mysql
after seeing the wiki link to postgresql figured i d edit this post with links for mysql oracle docs not really an optimization guides specifically but both are good resources especially the mysql one

779911

however the range of changeset you cherry-pick must be contiguous

779969
hide	show
show hide the trayicon depending on forms visibility

780017
atomic	interlocked

780030
int	double
where idsb are the types of the data you re binding int double string blob

780044
udp	tcp
but since you can implement all of tcp with udp it has to be possible

780044
udp	tcp
metaphorically think of udp like sending postcards and tcp like making a phone call

780084
stdout	stderr
cron usually captures the output of stdout and stderr and e-mailes any output to the crontab owner

780091
stdout	stderr
inside that script i d ensure that i trapped stdout and stderr to a known or knowable file

780111
cout	cin
scanf is faster than cin printf is faster than cout etc

780152
folder	directory
once the user has specified the directory i want to be able to delete it so that when i launch the installer it can create the folder itself such that it gets flagged for uninstall

780152
folder	directory
while it does let the user browse for a directory it s not as intuitive as folder browser dialogues that i ve seen in installers in the past

780156
free	malloc
i am wondering if there is a cross-platform allocator that is one step lower than malloc free

780175
atomic	interlocked
interlocked instructions provide atomic and inter-processor synchronization

780228
free	malloc
c gives you malloc and free c++ adds new delete and and the placement forms in addition to what c provides

780228
free	malloc
you could implement your own malloc free without worrying about the underlying os

780251
udp	tcp
unlike tcp this does not mean that the peer closed the connection because with udp there is no connection

780280
hide	show
i don t think you need the show hide since it happens so fast

780376
client-side	server-side
retrieve a list of post_ids that you want to show comments for then retrieve all comments for those posts and filter them client-side or you could do it server-side if you had windowing functions i think though those aren t in mysql

780376
postgresql	mysql
if windowing functions ever get added to mysql they re in release 8.4 of postgresql option 2 might become palatable or even preferable

780389
post	get
all you can do is post and get and you can only post 10 items a day significant interactions

780404
post	get
if you want to get all post at once or some subset with a where the following will surprisingly work

780404
children	parent
parent 1 has noo children

780417
stdio	gets
for example in windows a line ends with r n and this gets translated to a single n by stdio since that is the c convention

780417
fseek	ftell
because of this the c standard only defines fseek in text files in a few cases to the very beginning to the very end to the current position and to a previous position that has been retrieved with ftell

webkit safari and google-chrome but firefox and opera have plans to implement similar in upcoming releases

780966
superclass	subclassing
jon in the comment below is correct you can narrow the scope but then you would still follow the protocol that you will return a one should you return a three from three.foo because subclassing will all implement the superclass interface

780997
try-catch	exception-handling
you should try-catch unsupportedencodingexception exception-handling

781007
superclass	subclassing
overriding a method and trying to return a less specific type is a violation of the liskov substitution principle which says that subclassing must fulfill all contracts of their superclass

781040
button	checkbox
i agree that checkbox have more of an implicit true false meaning another point is that for radio button you can force the user to make an active choice by having neither option selected

781045
button	checkbox
we had an experience with customer base of older age group they understand yes no radio button better then checkbox

781045
button	checkbox
and we were forced to remove checkbox and put radio button everywhere

781100
getter	setter
there is a workaround presented there but it requires me at least if i get it right to write a custom interface ifileinfo and provide it with a lot of getter and setter which i want to avoid

781111
prng	random
if i were to use random values i would go for a prng with fixed seeds so that every run actually checks the same numbers

781113
post	get
note that the form element only allows get and post

781128
codeigniter	cakephp
options may include django ruby on rails joomla cakephp codeigniter

then you will have to use your own malloc and free functions to do the actual mallocing and freeing but also keeping the allocation table updated

781155
sorting	filtering
pulling large amounts of data into a web application and doing sorting filtering there is always going to be slow depending on your definition of large

you can use javascript something like jqgrid or yahooâ s datatables

781270
tablesorter	datatables
for simpler datatables you can use jqueryâ s tablesorter

781294
width	height
this initializes with the height of our experiment being 200px and the width is automatic

781294
width	height
the reason why i got the widths and height of the element before zero-ing them was if said width 100 and height 100 in my animate it would set it to 100 of the pages width and height...we don t want that

781342
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
they are the superviews of a uitableview which is inside of a uinavigationcontroller which is inside of a uitabbarcontroller

781354
min	max
he makes the point that his implementation doesn t consider min or max dates though

portrait	landscape
my issue is that mainview renders correctly in landscape mode despite the frame passed into mainview initwithframe being in portrait while the child pdfview renders into a portrait frame

781395
nsdatecomponents	nsdateformatter
to convert a string to a date you use the nsdateformatter class or maybe nsdatecomponents if you already know the hours minutes and seconds

781395
nsdatecomponents	nsdateformatter
you can then use either nsdateformatter or nsdatecomponents to get the new time back out again

781507
background-color	transparency
remove the borders of the input and set its background-color to transparency

781578
children	parent

782375
perforce	cvs
we are considering switching our source control repository at my work from perforce to either cvs or subversion

782375
cvs	svn
i said that i didn t think cvs was as popular as svn recently and was met with a lot of blank stares

782375
cvs	svn
my boss told me that i must still be stuck inside the windows-programming world if i was considering svn because most unix-based developers use cvs

782375
cvs	svn
in addition another coworker said cvs was a lot more popular than svn

782375
perforce	svn
i am really only familiar with using svn perforce and git

782383
cvs	svn
svn vs cvs

782383

782449
opera	firefox
this is one solution to the problem tested in opera firefox and internet explorer 7

782452
pull	push
i commit push go to another place pull commit push

782494
cvs	svn
the overwhelming answers as far as i can tell are that many more new repositories use svn than cvs and the migration is all from cvs to svn

782494
cvs	svn
there are arguments for keeping cvs if you already have it but for virtually any other case i d recommend svn over cvs and so would most of the people who use either heavily

782508
cvs	svn
the company i work for is in the process of moving from cvs to svn there really is no competition between the two

782508
cvs	svn
cvs essentially only versions files while svn keeps track of both files and folders

782512
hash	md5
also as a bit of ghost debugging it s very possible that your passwords are md5 hash in the database since you should never store them in plain text

from there you can get the checkbox button cell at the given row and change the cell s drawing style based on it s state

782663
cvs	svn
i don t know about installed base but from the large number of developers i know from the internet svn is quite popular unlike cvs

782744
awt	swing
since every swing callback like button listener comes in on the awt thread you normally don t have to think about this but for an active rendering situation you have to pay close attention

782749
post	get
right now when the fields get edited php post names instead of

782786

783198
int	double
then they can tag a bunch of resources as belonging to projects take over the world or fix my car. the tags are strongly typed so a tag may store single or multiple string s int s double s etc

783198
sorting	filtering
the problem is that resources need to behave both as tuples for tabular viewing sorting filtering and as tagname tagvalue maps

783211
datediff	difference
i have a report that calculates multiple date difference in business days not datediff for a variety of business reasons that are far too dull to get into

when then the element is dragged you may programaticlly increase decrease the max min preff size of your component most likely a jtextarea and let the lym resize the visual apparence of the component

783438
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
for this example i m attaching the event to all anchor tags in the page but you could replace getelementsbytagname with getelementbyid for a specific one

i2c	spi
if your hardware has any other unused serial interface spi i2c .. using them would be easier

783505
getter	setter
i set it up at debug level in the assembly.cs file so that it defaults to logging all method calls that aren t property getter or setter

783526
vb.net	vb6
i m sure most of the time the reason companies go forward with vb.net is exactly as you mentioned - large amounts of vb6 in the organization both in terms of codebase and developers

783526
vb.net	vb6
keep in mind that asp websites and vb6 applications can be migrated to vb.net with little to no pain

783534
vbscript	vb6	vb.net	vb6
i m unusual in that i come from a c c++ background know c# but actually prefer vb.net i severely dislike vb6 vbscript

783534
vb.net	vb6
i say all this because it s important to remember the vb6 is not vb.net

783534
vb.net	vb6
i really hated vb6 but i fell in love with vb.net almost instantly

783534
vb.net	vb6
however vb.net did inherit some things from vb6 and not just a syntax style

783535
vb.net	vb6
completely subjective opinion but i d say anyone who jumped on the vb.net bandwagon would have come from a background in vb6 classic asp

783568
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
a have the interface called math that has add subtract divide and multiplying and then i have a class called intmath that implements math that is optimized for integer math and i have another class called floatmath the implements math that is optimized for floating math and i have a generalmath that implements math that handles everything else

783579
postgresql	mysql
database likely mysql or postgresql - sql jdbc

783581
vb.net	vb6
also some companies who jumped .net 1.0 from vb6 thought that vb.net will be the major language which turned out to be a big mistake after couple of years

783588
bazaar	git
the entire open-source world except perhaps the eclipse community has moved on to modern source-control systems subversion git mercurial bazaar and so on

freemarker	velocity
as for your template language you could use jsp velocity freemarker

783611
junit	jmock	junit	easymock	easymock	jmock
you haven t explicitly mentioned unit testing but that should certainly be part of the mix - i don t have much experience outside junit as an actual testing framework but there s also easymock and jmock amongst others for mocking of dependencies

783664
put	get
you could try to put your native dll somewhere in the above mentioned dirs and try if you get better results

783665
jsf	seam
if you are going the with a java back-end i would recommend hibernate for your jpa jsf with richfaces ajax skinning and facelets view rendering templating for your front-end and seam to put it all together

783745
chown	sudo
i may need to write a script to locally sudo chown lampp lamppusers each time i use a different machine

children	parent
as aaron has already pointed out you can set delete behaviour to cascade and that will delete children records when a parent record is deleted

783778
cvs	svn	perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
there is a good deal of comparing git mercurial is considered to be ok and cvs svn perforce

783794
chown	chmod
i would advise just setting the whole directory to 777 with chmod chown changes ownership as the user and group each user is in will be different on each machine you can t really do better

783828
google-chrome	safari
if you re interested check out a script i wrote -- it s a cheap firebug replacement that doesn t interfere with any normal console like safari or google-chrome but does extend it with almost all the firebug methods

783840
children	parent
basically no you have to make three delete statements in a transaction children first and then parent

783890
prepare	execute
name and prepare execute that

783916
squash	merge
oh and this will also squash away your merge just fine

784073
ubuntu	debian
debian packages should work on ubuntu

784078
rss	feed
rss feed for errors

784081
ubuntu	debian
if you want to make a gcc similar to the one shipped with ubuntu apt-get source gcc and look in debian rules for their configure flags they may be applied on multiple lines

784091
ubuntu	debian
if it is in a debian repository it should would under ubuntu no problem

784246
ccl	clisp
clisp and ccl throw the same error though worded slightly differently

784273
versioning	upgrade
otherwise i d just follow their hard upgrade directions which appear to be functionally equivalent to the usual pg_dump pg_restore approach used to upgrade to a new major versioning of postgresql

784328
allocator	stl
it defines a new std allocator which can provide stack-based allocator for the initial allocator of storage for stl containers

784328
int	chars
for example if the string is going to store a decimal-formatted 32-bit int you know that you do not need more than 11 chars to do so

784329
crossover	mutation
you could experiment with the mutation and crossover thanks nathan algorithms to see which do the best job

784352
folder	directory
the vs installation disc contains a directory called remote debugger which has two folder x64 and x86 that contain the set-up application for the specific platform

784391
onclick	onchange
edit i tried onclick and onchange

784495
cvs	svn
to be honest svn was supposed replace cvs but it s branching model is very close to vss and thus total shit

784495
cvs	svn
if i was given an option between cvs and svn i would chose cvs

784518
width	height
you will need to empirically determine the exact height and width of the pdf

784531
google-chrome	firefox
update this works on firefox google-chrome but not ie

784538
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
arithmetic operation - like addition subtraction multiplication division except

784578
int	chars
isdigit c should be called on a chars not an an int

784595
hash	md5
md5 hash would be faster than comparison but slower than a normal crc-check

784617
mouse	keyboard
in fact i find myself rather unable to complete even single player games before dissecting their mechanics and gaming them in a specifically read-only not cheats per se mouse and keyboard input only fashion

784647
appfuse	spring
appfuse is a spring hibernate app designed to be used as skeleton for new projects

784657
packets	multicast
i wrote some client software to send out a multicast over the lan with a client computer on the same switch as the cluster so that each node in the cluster would receive the packets and respond

784657
wan	lan
it works great except when i run the client software on a computer that has both lan and wan interfaces

784657
wan	multicast
if there is a wan interface the multicast doesn t work

784657
wan	multicast	wan	lan
so obviously i figure the multicast is incorrectly going over the wan interface eth0 rather than the lan eth1. so i use the so_bindtodevice socket option to force the multicast socket to use eth1 and all is well

784657
wan	lan
and is there some way perhaps an ioctl call that i can have the application automatically determine if a particular interface is a lan or wan

784658
inherited	properties
inherited is a general object oriented programming concept whereby one type can be of the same type as another object but introduce new properties and behaviors a lion class could inherited from a mammal class while javabeans are just java objects that adhere to a set of conventions

784659
implements	extends
when objects extends a class or implements an interface on the other hand the properties methods are accessed via that interface superclass

784662
getter	setter
a java bean is a simple class which contains some properties data elements and getter and setter getproperty1 setproperty1 myvalue to read and write those properties

784662
inherited	properties
inherited is an object oriented principle in which one class exhibits the properties and behaviours of another

784694
put	get
of course this is unhealthy note the necessary omission of override on method1 - if you put it back in you will get a compiler error

784706
inherited	subclassing
it can do that because b is derived from inherited subclassing is-a a

784714
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
here is my touchesmoved which i call in the touchesbegan

784719
pop-up	dialog
use floating divs instead which looks like a modal dialog but are better than the pop-up

784734

link this post i want to be able to read an image files height and width without reading in the whole file into memory

784743
diffmerge	winmerge
i managed to defined external tools like notepad++ and winmerge or diffmerge

784748

on top of the raw socket sits a layer called sctp just like tcp which is indicating every now and then that it is missing some packets

784798
alloca	strdup
if you were implementing strdup well you can t use alloca

784802
typedef	struct
pay special attention to pointers struct unions bit fields typedef and the c preprocessor

784807
int	chars
bool getint const chars string int out

784818
charindex	substr
look at the builtin functions charindex patindex and substr

784818
charindex	substr
charindex finds the positon of a specified character patindex of a pattern substr returns a portion of a string by position

784821
disk	ram
you can certainly load the texture from disk into ram in any number of threads you like but opengl won t upload to vram in multiple threads for the reason mentioned in reed s answer

784935
pop-up	dialog
jquery ui has a decent pop-up modal dialog api and i ve worked with the boxy plugin which is very easy to implement

784951
fiddler	charles
if you use a transparent echoing proxy this can show you all http traffic charles and fiddler are two good example i recommend charles

784994
client-side	server-side
since your code is executing on the server-side there is no way to display the alert client-side and perform the redirect

785007
put	get
you can put a long object in to get it work

785007
getter	setter
when the c++ function contains another c++ class as parameter swig generates this c++ class as java object with getter setter and all c++ functions you want to call

785007
perl	tcl
swig is used with different types of languages including common scripting languages such as perl php python tcl and ruby

785009
hide	show
implement the forms as usercontrols instead put them onto the same form and show and hide the controls as appropriate this can also be achieved by loading the forms stripping form borders and such and setting their parent to a panel or something similar

785028
put	get
i think you are going to need to do some user validation and i would be tempted to put keys to the decryption in a separate database and provide some other mechanism to get that out which should require authentication

785059
getter	setter
and it creates setter and getter automatically

785072
sctp	tcp
if you include sctp in the application itself then that will more than double the number of messages being passed into an out of the kernel which will impact performance when compared with using the pre installed tcp

785072
sctp	tcp
i would seriously consider sticking with tcp unless you are sure sctp is needed or unless you control the hosts your app is deployed on

785073
getter	setter
in this case it creates tells the compiler how to create the getter and setter methods for the member variable

785099
onchange	onblur
is there a situation were onchange would be called but onblur would not be called

785108
onchange	onblur
so really they are almost the same thing but for onchange to behave the way onblur does something in that input needs to change

785115
versioning	upgrade
i don t believe the implementation details are set in stone and so potentially an upgrade to a future java versioning could cause problems

785152
inline	inlining
if used more than once definitely make it a function and let the compiler do the inlining possibly adding inline to the function definition

785205
portrait	landscape
i d also like to see - not currently included in the betas - a decent camera api that allowed us to customize the appearance of the capture screen and as another poster said have it work properly in landscape and portrait mode

785209
hex	binary
either as binary perhaps hex or characters

785240
versioning	upgrade
i know that some companies refuse to upgrade ie unless absolutely necessary but seriously i would no longer support ie6 since the current versioning is 8 and most people should have 7 by now

785261
hash	salt
usually a salt hash of the password is stored and compared

785261
hash	salt
the hash should be salt to avoid duplicated hash if the some users have the same passwords

785261
hash	salt
you can calculate the salt hash of the password and store that within your file

785281
serializable	deserialization
use the xmlignore attribute to mark a property to be ingnored in serializable deserialization

785282
google-chrome	firefox
to paste without formatting to a browser firefox google-chrome at least ctrl + â shift + v on windows linux see below for mac os x

785310
hex	binary
it would help to see examples of data both in binary single and db string form in hex to verify that this is what s happening

785330
profiling	debugging
once up and running it can give you all sorts of debugging and profiling information and the output format of xdebug can be read by the amazing kcachegrind tool visualizing and reporting on the stack and graphing your application flow if you re a happy linux camper

785357
width	height
you cannot give an inline element set width or height dimensions they will be ignored

785371
codeigniter	cakephp
so far i ve checked out frameworks like codeigniter cakephp but their support for firebird is vague or little at most

785391
interbase	firebird
the zend framework has a firebird interbase db adapter in incubation so almost clean out of the box and i ve used it and it worked like a charm for me

785487

i was thinking about using cron jobs to check every minutes if it is still alive but there might be a cleaner way or standard way of doing this

785595
int	chars
colorval chars 8 or int depending on how you re representing colors

785627
client-side	server-side
client-side validation preventing a round trip to find out that there s an error is nice-to-have server-side validation verifying that things truly are in order is a must-have

785766
button	checkbox
user makes a selection of names by clicking checkbox and then there is a send button which sends out emails with remittance advices and self-billing invoices attached

785796
versioning	upgrade
i know that since you are using the express versioning you qualify for the upgrade price for visual studio 2008 professional

785797
put	get
the point is get the current url parameter and put hyperlink with same querystring parameter

785821
getter	setter
i assume it has a getter setter for access to its datastore is it possible to override this code

785837
tiff	png
basically whenever i do a metafile.loadfile ... and take that to save it as a tiff png etc some areas of that source files are missing

785890
versioning	upgrade
if it wasn t fixed by versioning 4.2 you ll have to upgrade to get it

785948
content-disposition	content-type
i have a servlet that sends a file by setting the http content-type to application zip the content-disposition to attachment and writing it on the response s outputstream

785948
google-chrome	firefox
however when deploying on a clustered jboss server ie hangs on 0 requesting file information for the whole transfer and then fails with an error message stating that the file wasn t available for download even stranger is the fact that with firefox and google-chrome the servlet behaves correctly same way as on localhost

786007
int	chars
that will convert a single hex chars upper or lowercase independent into an int

786021
int	boolean	int	double
while this works for other data types such as varchar int double etc it does not with boolean

786023
pop-up	dialog
you need to pop-up a feed dialog to allow this it s not too intrusive though - it works quite well

786033
jython	pypy
this is a developing area with other languages -- python has jython iron python even pypy and stackless

786033
jruby	rubinius
ruby has jruby rubinius and others -- but as good as these are they can t match the maturity found in the various jvm offerings

786047
post	get
i have have i need for my post but i am racking my brain to get the comments right

786050
hide	show
my workaround so far for what it s worth is hide the control for a couple seconds after the form loads then show it

786051
debugdiag	debugging
you can use debugdiag or the adplus script hang mode in this case that comes with debugging tools for windows

786070
post	put
by contrast methods such as post put and delete are intended for actions which may cause side effects either on the server

786074

i use an the icon library from icon experience - your pay but all icon sizes 16x16 up to 256 x 256 are provided in ico and png formats

786258
google-chrome	firefox
works for me on ie7 firefox and google-chrome although with google-chrome i had to un-maximise the window then remaximise it - looks like a rendering bug to me

786286
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested it in google-chrome firefox ie6 ie7 and safari and it looks like it works

786292
implements	extends

786330
aggregate-functions	sum
you cannot nest aggregate-functions - select sum max x will always error

if i wanted to put another folder inside the flex directory and have the packages be com.mydomain.whatever

786687
post	get
the funny thing is if i enter data in to the textboxes that will get populated into the returned myviewdata in the post controller

786695
ferret	sphinx
i found that the best solution to the problem was to use lucene xapian ferret sphinx or whichever full-text indexer you prefer

786800
websphere	ibm
there are a number of mature offerings about which i know next to nothing together with a new product from ibm itself websphere mq file transfer edition which is being actively developed and recently announced an updated version 7.0.1

ready	each
it s up to the image display to show the image as each pass is rendered however and i m not sure if flash does this or waits until the completed image is ready

786901
getter	setter
i think the public getter and setter are needed

786951
unsigned	short
it fails to convert -1 to an unsigned short

786973
post	put
using post isn t a cure for such things as you can put together a form post in javascript pretty easily but it s a good start

787040
wma	asf	wmv	asf
i guess silverlight would work best with microsoft technology so i want to use the asf format with wmv wma encoding

787125
webclient	webrequest
i had to deal with this recently - another way to approach it is to use the fact that webclient is inheritable and change the underlying webrequest from there

787132
ccl	ecl
however my plan is to use ccl to build an application bundle on os x and ecl to build a stand-alone executable on linux and windows

787132
ccl	ecl
my impression is that the fastest but most expensive route to doing application delivery across those three oses is to buy allegro but an alternative more work but cheaper would be to use ccl on os x corman on win32 and ecl or sbcl on linux

787132
glfw	sdl	glut	sdl	glut	glfw
my impression is that the situation is constantly improving callbacks in cffi seem to work on most platforms now which is a big help in interfacing to most c toolkits but i ve been working more with gl glfw glut and sdl though not yet with lispbuilder mentioned by justinhj above which looks cool

787189
google-chrome	firefox
i ve heard that it has sqllite on board but what else makes it any different from google-chrome s application mode get the same functionality using firefox s prism plugin

787212
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i have an app where my main view accepts both touchesbegan and touchesmoved and therefore takes in single finger touches and drags

firefox	safari	webkit	gecko	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
same managed programming interface but is implemented with the gecko engine from firefox and an alternate implementation with the webkit engine from google-chrome and safari

787400
drawrect	touchesmoved
touchx and touchy were instance variables and they were getting reset in touchesmoved before each call to drawrect was complete

787400
drawrect	touchesmoved
therefore if i moved fast on the screen touchesmoved would get called then call drawrect then touchesmoved would get called again before drawrect had used touchx and touchy so the drawing would get out of sync with the boolean array backend

787400
drawrect	touchesmoved
to solve this i stopped using touchx and touchy in drawrect and started deriving the same point by using the dirty rect that was being passed in from touchesmoved

787448
primitive	reference-type
i ve found documentation for marshaling primitive from c++ to c# but i m not sure how to handle reference-type or non-pritmive types such as vmloader or optionlist both of which are classes

787488
wordpress	joomla
just look at wordpress especially the new 2.7 release drupal a very popular cms and joomla another very popular cms

787497
udp	tcp
because it uses udp it won t unduly stress the network via tcp retries and the like snmp clients are or should be architected to handle dropped packets etc.

787500
opera	firefox
this simple code works fine on firefox and opera

787505
winpcap	wireshark
using wireshark installs winpcap which may be overriding the changes the malware made or the malware may simply detect it is being monitored and not attempt anything fishy

787520
int	chars
but going back to the specific case of visual c++ even if you call delete the compiler will realize that it doesn t need to iterate through the array calling destructors when it s an array of primitive types like int chars or pointers

787576
puts	gets
the first query gets all of the news articles and puts them in an array

787578
websphere	ibm

notice that he makes no mention of ienumerable nor ienumerator

787603
nsinteger	double
assign is for primitive values like bool nsinteger or double

787646
gtk	gdk
the step from gtk import gdk suggested by lukasz is necessary and has to precede creation of the pixbuf otherwise you will not get the save method as observed by the original poster

787710
free	malloc
if code in one dll calls free with a pointer allocated by malloc in a different dll

787722
postgresql	mysql
i m switching from mysql to postgresql and was wondering how i can do autoincrement values

787724
outputstream	inputstream	gzipinputstream	gzipoutputstream
jpeg is lossy so if you need the exact same image on the other side you can use a gzipoutputstream on top of the socket s outputstream to send the compressed data and receive it on the other side through a gzipinputstream on top of the socket s inputstream

787726
getter	setter
actually i do the to_i bit in an override of the attribute s setter and reverse the process in the getter

787796
button	checkbox
on the javascript onclick on the checkbox i want to disable the radio button in the rblconsole radiobutton list

ostream	istream
each istream and ostream has its own locale

787834
getter	setter
i have to confess that i tried some other codes and example getter setter type with dispatchevent or without and i can t get over it

787841
post	get
get requests should not have side-effects - all actions should be done using post requests only

787859
width	height
you would want to use this over height width so you don t accidentally scale an image up

787859
width	height
you would just want to limit the maximum height width proportionately

787864
hash	salt
when you generate the hash together in the same statement in 2000 they end up with the same salt random seed number at the beginning which makes them identical

787864
hash	salt
you always have the same salt at the beginning of the hash where as in 2005 its always different

787864
hash	salt
if you can generate the hash with the same salt then you can compare them which means trying a brute force or dictionary attack have a look at this article on how to do it

787869
post	get
looking at the log my post is getting changed into a get

787876
int	chars
so answer column in your table has to be int decimal etc. not chars 1

787876
min	max
edit min and max work for char data type

787895
post	get
this executes message get action i enter some text in the text area and click on save to post the form

787906
int	double
i have a second class typevalue and its defined as below which can hold one of int long and their unsigned variants float double std string

787906
int	double
operator double long int

787916
post	get
note that in your post method the sometext key shouldn t even exist until you set it it won t be carried forward from the version of the code that responds to the get

788005
profiling	benchmarking
assuming i remember i ll be sure to post some profiling benchmarking on different time space radii configurations

788008
mbunit	nunit
not nunit mbunit xunit.net etc

788008
moq	typemock
rhinomocks moq and typemock all depend on things that are not available in .net cf

788011
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it would be really easy with getrange i do not need internet explorer compatibility so getrange which work for firefox google-chrome and safari is ok if the text was plain text

788044
firefox	safari
the user agent switching is not a mode all it does is makes safari report the ie firefox etc user agent -- so navigator.useragent will report the ua of a different browser

788079
multiplying	add
in other words as you process each digit from left to right multiplying the previous total by the base effectively moving it left one position then add the new digit

788097
hex	binary
since four binary digits are identical to a single hex digit you can simply convert each hex digit to binary individually then string them together

788137
jruby	mri
i have jruby and ruby mri installed

788137
jruby	mri
after i installed the rails gem for mri should i have pointed jruby to it or was it necessary for me to also call jruby -s gem install rails

788150
int	double
in the line in sub search that says dtf.keys idx 0 place your cursor after the right parenthesis and backspace you should get a tooltip that says extension elementatordefault index as int as double - index the zero based element of the index to retrieve

788153
nunit	mstest
you have probably figured this out already but with visual studio 2008 professional the best way is to use mstest i m an nunit guy through and through but this is it

788161
qtreewidget	qtreeview	qtreewidget	qheaderview	qtreeview	qheaderview
if your tree widget is called treewidget you should be able to call the header method which is from qtreewidget s parent qtreeview then sortindicatororder from the qheaderview class

788185
udp	tcp
packet may be udp tcp layer 2 frame

788193
cpu	processors
domain-specific vector processors with highly specialized instruction sets like modern gpus for gaming would be able to handle these tasks much more efficiently than a high power general-purpose cpu

788220
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
for consistency with the enumerable linq operators throw an argumentnullexception not a nullreferenceexception

788228
interbase	firebird
zend framework has support for firebird and interbase in the extras you must download the full package instead of minimum package

788240
getter	setter
you should define a class state having two attributes code and name with getter and setter getcode and getname

788301
setinterval	settimeout
the only things i know that will take a string and eval it other than eval are settimeout and setinterval

788354
jobs	cron
many of them allow you to run cron jobs

788517
postgresql	mysql
i know this is not what sqlite was designed for i am less interested in a postgresql mysql sql server based solution as i am trying to keep my app a light as possible with a minimal amount of dependencies

788569
nsstring	nsdata
can i get nsstring or nsdata object from it

788662
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview that has an image and some buttons as its subviews

788676
postgresql	mysql
we help them package their server software which is typically based on php java or ruby together with a web server or application server apache tomcat the language runtime and a database typically postgresql mysql into a self-contained easy to use installer

788696
post	get
consider using ben copsey s asihttprequest framework for generating and sending synchronous and asynchronous htttp requests post and get

788700
queue	fifo
rather than specifically coding in the two variables i implemented them inside of a fifo queue

788716
post	get
you can use this to issue get requests where variables are encoded in the url or post requests where the variables go in the body of the request

788716
post	get
you won t need to download or parse the form itself at runtime if the structure of the form doesn t change you can hard-code the variable names in your program at the point where you construct the get or post request

788722
post	get
the general idea that you have is correct though normally a html form will perform a post back to the server rather than a get

788722
post	get
you can tell is a form is a get or post by looking at the method in it s opening tag

788826
rss	feed
what you are getting is not a webpage but an rss feed

788840
stateless	stateful
web is stateless by nature and desktop is stateful

788881
width	height
if i dont set width and height of b he will resize accordingly to a size up to a certain point where a has scrollbars which is the good behavior

788881
width	height
i can solve it by setting a percent width and height of 100 to b when i do a

788881
width	height
if i remove percent height and width it will be the whole canvas as expected

788881
width	height
what would be perfect is keeping the percent height and width while child width is smaller than parent a width

788886
int	chars
take a look at the code points at index 2 by casting the chars to int to get your answer

788974
ssl	https
i have an old site that now doesn t have an ssl and i want to block access to all https pages

788975
min	max
also i have several variables for min and max latitude longitude

789006
min	max
if you wanted to you could use an aggregate function ie max min on table2 this would eliminate the duplicate rows from table1 but would also hide some of the data from table2

789020
firefox	safari
unless you re distributing the browser you won t be able to dictate when ie firefox safari etc

789047
client-side	server-side
we have been using the spaw editor for a few years now which you handle and code via php instead of javascript so its a server-side coding perspective instead of client-side

789085
int	chars
that s why i mentioned of thinking of using 64 chars web-safe alphanumberic non-reserved chars and then some since then i could create seemingly random urls which could be unpacked to a list of int expressing a set of id numbers

789092
inherited	properties
the datacontext properties will be inherited so to speak by all of the inner children

789096
division	modulo
let be integer division whole numbers and be modulo

789118
swt	swing	awt	swing
a bit more specifically things like swing which has those jpanels jbuttons and so on you mentioned as ui components and swt are currently based on awt and work on top of it to render the ui and allow it to work as expected

789118
awt	swing
there s been a lot of reinventing the wheel to achieve swing awt kind of ui creation on the java s web side since it s a clever model like you seem to already know google web toolkit tries to do its part to make web seem more like a desktop application while in reality it merely automates the needed javascript ajax underneath to make the web page behave as if it was a desktop application

789134
x86	64bit
on a 64bit machine the programfiles environment variable will actually point to the program files x86 directory for a 32 bit application

789190
ubuntu	debian
fyi in ubuntu and or debian the scripts are at etc bash_completion.d

789280
versioning	upgrade
and then again jumping major versioning numbers means increased revenue by way of user upgrade

789280
opera	firefox
there are cross-browser development issues between ie firefox opera etc but it s much easier to test and debug than say running a complex application on a desktop system with varying graphics processors anti-virus software or builds

789298
radiobuttonlist	onclientclick
in the case of the radiobuttonlist the onclientclick attribute is rendered on the element but the unrecognized oncluck element is rendered on the enclosing element

789378
bash	zsh
if you re using bash 4.0 or zsh

789388
jboss	weblogic
the application can be deployed on both weblogic websphere jboss

this line is from a man page for calloc malloc realloc and free

789416
queue	fifo
a queue consumer processes the messages fifo and sends a response that gets routed back to the web service

789448
unsigned	short
unsigned int short unsigned int

789448
unsigned	short
unsigned int short unsigned int

789476
int	double
also while you re at it there is no need to convert to a string then to a double - you can convert directly from int - double and avoid the string conversions

789499
implements	extends
what if i have a class that both extends an abstract class and implements an interface for example

789503
vim	emacs
the question does not refer to some vim-mode in emacs but to vim inside emacs

789503
vim	emacs
i just want to use vim in emacs

789503
vim	emacs
you can get to vim in emacs with commands m-x term and vim

789511
solaris	aix
is it more a problem on aix than solaris or windows

789517
pop-up	dialog
i have a button on a jframe that when clicked i want a dialog box to pop-up with multiple text areas for user input

789536
tapestry	struts	tapestry	wicket	struts	wicket
some technologies that i have been looking at are spring wicket struts guice hibernate and tapestry

789536
tapestry	wicket
i am a bit wary of tapestry and wicket

789537
inherited	properties
with csla.net all domain classes need to inherited from businessbase which contains non-virtual properties

789571
struts	stripes
very simply if you are comfortable with jsps and servlets then if you want to save some of the drudgery of web programming i would look at stripes or struts 2

789571
struts	stripes
i am very familiar with stripes and only am aware that struts 2 is similar so i will focus this entry on stripes

789571
put	get
on top of that you get if you use their form tags you get nice behaviors when for example they put fred in your date field

789577
gif	png
how it works is simple you have the small youtube image as transparent png or gif and then set the background image as the larger image this will then give the effect of the smaller image being in the center with no extra markup

789595
children	parent
mousechildren means it s children don t register mouse events they just dispatch from the parent

789596
vim	emacs
what you re seeing is that the terminal setting term in your shell vim session doesn t match what the emacs terminal is doing

789618
division	modulo
it s most likely that means integer division by modulo - the result is within 0..360 range

789631
width	margin
but one thing you should remember when floating elements is that they will only take up the space they require this includes margin and padding unless you set a fixed width

789643
vim	emacs
for all purpose editors vim and emacs come to mind but i m afraid they just cannot compete against vs08 resharper when it comes to c# which i m using a lot on this moment

789655
treemap	treeset
a little look into treemap treeset and comparable would have probably pushed you through this problem

789679
bids	ssas
likewise microsoft also uses bids to help developers dbas and analysts create data cubes - multidimensionally joined tables using a specialized schema that allows sql server analysis services ssas to churn through pretty much any combination of data relations in order to provide analytical data

789722
udp	tcp
first you mean protocol in the sense of the available operations â a perfectly reasonable usage but confusing when you confound it with tcp vs udp that sort of thing as i did

789722
udp	tcp
named pipes but then my intuition says you also have the option of local and remote which means you also have the option of udp or tcp

789731
versioning	upgrade
our development process has us leaving dependencies external to the current build at the previous release versioning until a fix requires an upgrade

789744
uicontrol	uibutton
one way of thinking of a uibutton is as a shorthand way of setting up an area of the screen that can respond to various instantaneous touch events the response it makes is defined by uicontrol s target-action system for delivering messages to other objects

789744
post	get
if this still doesn t solve your problem you re going to have to post some code in order to get more insight into what s going wrong

789762
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uinavigationcontroller is to navigate a heirarchy of views with uiviewcontroller

789781
qmail	exim
common mta s are postfix exim and qmail

789784
vim	emacs
i say it is diverse but in reality the majority of linux development is actually very similar using a collection of common tools gcc gdb grep find vim emacs ctags cscope and some source repository of choice

789803
jboss	weblogic
can t do anything specific to weblogic websphere or jboss

789863
virtualbox	esx	vmware	esx	vmware	virtualbox
i do all my sharepoint work on a virtualbox in our vmware esx server and it works like a charm

789863
vmware	virtualbox
i run both vmware and the new virtualbox software on my laptop but that is just for fun as the performance is below what i would accept in my daytime job

789906
nswindow	nsbutton
i have created a simple nswindow with an nstextfield and an nsbutton in interface builder on leopard

789911
aptana	radrails
plus aptana supports python pydev as welll as ruby on rails radrails in case you come across them in near future

789931
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
i ve heard good things about team foundation svn git bazaar and mercurial

789931
bazaar	svn	bazaar	cvs	cvs	svn
i ve used cvs clearcase mercurial svn and a little bazaar

789936
realloc	malloc
the more appropriate way to hold this information is in a style that is very c like and used in c++ as vectors automatically-resized blocks of contiguous memory using malloc and realloc

789936
qsort	strcmp
since we ve got a built-in implementation of qsort that uses a function pointer all we have to do is wrap strcmp for use with these types and pass the address in

789954
boost	stl
i googled for stl filter iterator to see how to do this and boost filter_iterator came up

790000
mockups	balsamiq
depending on how close you are to implementing something balsamiq mockups may be what you want

790068
versioning	upgrade
they way i do it is to keep the dependencies at the last release versioning until a change actually requires an upgrade to the next snapshot

790070
xna	slimdx
if you don t want some of the overhead of xna i ve found slimdx to be a very nice little framework

790070
xna	slimdx
xna and slimdx give you access to shaders very fine grained control of alpha blending as well as the potential to easily extend portions into 3d later if needed

790073
jar	war
forcing maven to produce a war and a jar in the same module is possible but will cause you problems down the road

790079
keydown	keyup
if memory serves when i implemented this in webkit it was necessary to make the keycode be 229 on keydown for all keys typed in an ime for compat with ie -- but i cannot recall what the behaviour of keyup is

790098
folder	directory
i generally create a separate application folder - complete with its own controller and view directory as well as a public directory for static content - for the entire administration system

790099
keydown	keyup
if memory serves when i implemented this in webkit it was necessary to make the keycode be 229 on keydown for all keys typed in an ime for compat with ie -- but i cannot recall what the behaviour of keyup is

790134
filtering	grouping
it supports filtering mapping grouping etc

790158
opera	safari
safari and opera go to the right place

790211
put	get
so you need to learn how to make that request with jquery and put the html you get from the request into the page at the right point

790224
joptionpane	jcomponent
most of the time the message parameter in joptionpane is a string but you can pass in a jcomponent or array of jcomponent as well

790258
width	height
take the greater of width max dx and height max dy

790302
fseek	fread
take a look at fseek and fread from stdio.h

790337
firefox	safari
100 repeatable with firefox no problem on safari i don t have windows installed on this box

790370
opera	firefox
so what i want to know is how to create an object considering browser compatibility firefox opera etc and whether the usages of it are same

790380
firefox	safari	webkit	gecko	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it is not a standard but it is supported at least on webkit safari google-chrome etc and gecko firefox

790394
hide	show
if you need some kind of hot state then you have to use small images which are absolutely positioned above the original image and show hide them using javascript

790422
width	height
width height image decompressed and image compressed length are always the same

790473
rar	zip
it s much better compressing than zip rar

790477
min	max
how can i get max date and min date from a list date column

790503
quicksort	heapsort
i d use heapsort rather than quicksort because you said you only need to look at the top few values

790505
post	get
a cgi program renders the page on each http get post on reload submit etc

790514
mouseup	mousedown
strangely although your click event isn t firing in ie if you change it to either mousedown or mouseup it works as you d expect although you still have your image hover issue

790545
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome uses a fork of webkit if you didn t know which is also used by safari

790650
elf	coff
2 compile and convert generated elf object file to coff object seems like objcopy of gnu binutils could help me with that

790650
elf	coff
then i tried to convert elf object to coff format and i can t find any information on that

790653
bazaar	git
with a dvcs like git bazaar or mercurial this is dead easy as it requires no changes in the central repository

790670
stdout	stderr
basically what i ve done below is print stupid messages to stdout stderr depending on how much memory is being used

790701
np-hard	np-complete
to be np-hard you have to prove a problem h is np-hard if and only if there is an np-complete problem l that is polynomial time turing-reducible to h ... in other words l can be solved in polynomial time by an oracle machine with an oracle for h.

790729
queue	fifo
this won t have queue fifo characteristics but will allow you multiple consumers in a very easy fashion

790758
rsa	dsa
rsa dsa minimum today is 1024 bit actually so elleptical curves becoming more in use since they are faster and using shorter keys

790758
rsa	dsa
email clients using certificates nowadays - so it s separate thing x.509 but for using with rsa dsa most common option is sha-1 somewhat weak now

790767
gridview	repeater
if the problem is getting the id from the checkbox within a repeater then this article might help select all checkboxes in a gridview

790767
gridview	repeater	gridview	datalist	datalist	repeater
you want to access a control that is in a control that repeats layout gridview repeater datalist and the like using javascript

790772
folder	directory
create a folder in the app views directory of your application called shared and store the partial there

790787
rsa	dsa
as for key size whether rsa or elgammel dsa i would recommend 2048 bit keys anyway now

790787
rsa	dsa
the difference is rsa is based on factorial math while elgammel dsa is based on logarithmic math neither can necessarily be considered better or worse to not though i that elliptic curve based stuff is closely related to the logarithms stuff

790846
opera	firefox
firefox and opera work fine so im really not sure what i am doing wrong here

790864
nullreferenceexception	argumentexception
for example throw argumentexception instead of nullreferenceexception for a null this

790914
firefox	safari	webkit	gecko
have look at the mono.webbrowser control - it embeds either gecko as used by firefox or webkit as used by safari into winforms without using activex

790915
emacs	textmate
i m talking about a more thorough sdk experience than just editing files with textmate emacs and copying them over to the device

791021
postgresql	mysql
several have been built on top of open-source technologies like mysql and postgresql but none are available for free

791021
vertica	greenplum
if you are in the buying mood check out these companies greenplum asterdata netezza vertica

791024
folder	directory
look into the repository directory and you ll find a hooks folder with a ton of sample scripts

791093
cpython	ironpython
it s not possible to make object monkeypatchable without deeply messing with the c-coded internals and recompiling the python runtime to make a very different version this is for the classic cpython but i believe exactly the same principle holds for other good implementations such as jython and ironpython just s c java and s c c# respectively

791119
children	parent
as you visit a node you point its left-child pointer to its parent its right-child pointer to the last time you took a right turn on your path which is to be found in the parent s right-child pointer at this moment and store its real children either in the now-redundant parent s right-child pointer or in your traversal state resp

791146
inherited	properties
your implementation is problematic because you re replacing the entire prototype object losing the properties of the inherited function prototype and it would also break or at least make it more difficult the ability to make use of inherited later on if you wrote other classes the same way

791184
put	get
this will work even if you are not root since it only fetch the source code to the app-name and put it in the current directory which is easier than having to track down the source and there is a better chance to get it work since you download the version that should work on your system

791187
inherited	properties
secondly because i m using an abstract method i am forced to go to the o r designer and change the inherited properties of every id field in my system to override

791193
ienumerable	iqueryable
since linq statements referred to a linq-to-sql iqueryable are translated to sql queries you will have to use the asenumerable extension which will in turn cause a read of all the items in the database and do reflection-related stuff on that ienumerable

791249
width	margin
create a wide margin at least the width of your sidebar for your content container

791270
pop-up	dialog
i am trying to set up my wpf application so that when an exception goes unhandled an error dialog pop-up

791270
pop-up	dialog
if i use showdialog the window is usable until it s closed and then the same ...has stopped working... dialog pop-up and dies

791290
getattr	isinstance
you can do introspection in elixir as you would anywhere in python -- get all names of attributes of class foo with dir foo extract an attribute given its name with getattr foo thename check the type of the attribute with type theattr or isinstance etc

791290
getattr	isinstance
module inspect in the python standard library may be a friendlier way to do introspection but dir getattr isinstance c are perfectly acceptable in many cases

791294
visualvm	btrace
visualvm with btrace or the built in trace claims to help with tracing but i haven t been able to find any tool that shows timing on method calls

791294
min	max
i found one of the answers i wanted in the qeurystatistics which reports for each compiled query the cache hits and misses the number of times the query has run how many rows were returned and the average max and min execution times

791306
width	height
honestly all i really want to know is the width and height of the page

791317
width	height
where x and y are the width and height of the window you want

791395
swt	swing
swt is an alternate toolkit for java that has slightly less cross-platform compatibility than swing but is still popular nonetheless

791413
put	get
this dereferences one time too many - myballs is an array of pointers or put another way a pointer to the first element of an array of pointers - just lose the asterisk in front of myballs and now you ll get the pointer from which you can access the struct or alternatively turn the - into a .

791436
comparator	comparable
one option is to implement the comparable interface and then override comparator

791436
comparator	comparable
you may be better of avoiding implementing comparable and create a comparator object and there s a version of collections.sort that takes the comparator

791458
min	max
warning myclass may not respond to +mymethod min max

791465
min	max
however i see that your error message complains about the signature + mymethod min max which also suggests you re trying to send the message to the class rather than an instance of the class

791486
versioning	upgrade
but the versioning of rubygems and rails shipped with leopard are now outdated though so you ll need to upgrade these before you go too far

791486
versioning	upgrade
to upgrade your private copy of rails whenever a new versioning comes along in future it s just this again

791495
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade the rtm versioning of visual studio 2008 with sp1 the entitydatasource control doesn t appear in the data group of the web project toolbox by default

791544
textarea	textbox
it shouldn t matter whether the field is a textbox textarea radio or select

791571
gridview	repeater
i m trying to extend a custom repeater i have in order to display in a tabular fashion reasonably similar to a gridview

791583
hide	fadeout	hide	show
i tried to show an error message using the jquery effect fadeto and tried to hide the message by appending a button and using fadeout but doesn t seem to work

791600
cil	ildasm
for cil msil i can write the code in a text editor and compile decompile with ilasm ildasm

791647
int	chars
255 is being processed as an int literal and causes the entire expression to be int based rather than unsigned chars based

791652
inherited	properties
if you want to access this from outside the listbox then exposing the scrollviewer via a properties should work again through inherited

791669
width	height
if you just need the page width and height i think pageformat.getimageablewidth and

791727
opera	firefox
explorer mozilla firefox opera and

791741
inherited	properties
i m experimenting with textarea and inherited to implement some additional functionality on the protected textfield properties

791775
width	height
for instance the first slide only has a picture in it 400px width 300px height but the next slide has lots of info including pictures text and video content totalling at 400px width and 800px in height

791799
freemarker	velocity
templating systems like freemarker and velocity make it much easier to generate markup

791807
multiplying	add
however because it can perform some combination of multiplying and add it s also used to optimize some regular calculations

791826
equals	compareto
if people subclassing your given class are allowed to add state members then you already have enough of a headache with functions like equals and compareto that clone is jut one more case where you need to require special handling

791829
apache	nginx
so my vote is to skip a night of drinking a month and learn ubuntu servers setup dns vhosts apache etc capistrano deployment svn and mongrel nginx passenger while you learn rails

791836
cpu	processors
the internals of processors inside a single family have changed a lot over the years so that eu reference would need to be clarified with the exact cpu model

791865
asihttprequest	cfnetwork
this doesn t answer your question directly but you might consider looking into ben copsey s asihttprequest library which wraps around cfnetwork classes and includes asynchronous threaded request code that takes a lot of work out of doing this properly

791897
jar	war
i have a j2ee app deployed as an ear file which in turn contains a jar file for the business layer code including some ejbs and a war file for the web layer code

791897
jar	war
the ear file is deployed to jboss 3.2.5 which unpacks the ear and war files but not the jar file this is not the problem it s just fyi

791942
equals	gethashcode
this seems to allow its correct use in dictionary and collection classes that rely on the equals and gethashcode methods for determining if the value already exists

791964
put	get
i don t think i would put either in production unless it was as a stopgap to get something critical out of the door in a major hurry or as a proof of concept or prototype

792028
subtraction	addition	integer	unsigned
modern computers since circa 1970 use a representation of integer data called two s-complement in which addition and subtraction work exactly the same on both signed and unsigned numbers

792032
internationalization	localization
that combined with decent message catalog support makes internationalization and localization pretty easy except for right-to-left languages

792076
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
you ll need a crossdomain.xml or clientaccesspolicy.xml in place on the remote servers to allow silverlight to communicate with them

792092
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i ve updated the color changing methods so that the background color can be animated when called from touchesbegan but not implicitly animated when called from touchesmoved

792160
put	get
i ve put an instance of the client proxy for the wcf service into a property on the app class so i can get it from anywhere in the app

792190
put	get
just to get my program compiling i just want to put placeholders for now

792194
google-chrome	firefox
the following effectively resolved the disabled buttons not showing up as grayed out in firefox and google-chrome

792211
yacc	bison
lex and yacc flex and bison

792212
postgresql	mysql
i m running mysql and postgresql on a netbook

792215
yacc	bison
it is not clear that there is a c++ target but the chances are high that the c target can easily be used with c++. i m still old school and tend to use yacc or bison but that s because i m familiar with it rather than because it is still the best though it is still good

792225
free	malloc
so while it may tell you something about theoretical limits it says very little about the performance of real garbage collectors versus real implementations of malloc and free

792225
free	malloc
a study that i like better took real programs and compared explicit malloc and free with hans boehm s conservative garbage collector

792225
free	malloc
- in real programs originally written to use malloc and free garbage-collected versions run at about the same speed but require twice as much memory

792233
profiling	benchmarking
if you are really worried use a profiling or write a benchmarking

792244
google-chrome	firefox
this effectively resolved the disabled buttons not showing up as grayed out in firefox and google-chrome

792274
bazaar	git
it is often the case that scientific programming requires input output of gigantic files and that kills performances very quickly on every dvcs i know of bazaar hg git

792303
chm	rtf
i have a large number of basic text rtf html pdf and chm files that i store on a usb key as a personal knowledge base

792319
bazaar	git
bazaar is such a fast moving target and presumably so is git that any claims about performance are likely to be out of date by the time you read them

792341
post	get
there are a couple of good post already on how to get the lines of the file so i thought i would add a bit about efficiency

792370
getter	setter
even if the getter or setter just wraps a private field it is good style to have these setter and getter as opposed to allowing direct field access

792394
range	minimum
but i want a substring that range from length 2 to 6 and print the substring of minimum length

792423
google-chrome	safari
oh and don t forget your safari google-chrome and ff2 testing

792460
floating-point	integer
the difference between each floating-point number and its corresponding integer is less than 1 or equal to 1 if you really must

792476
subtract	add
to get the next integer you add the next fp number to your running total round the running total then subtract the integer running total from the rounded running total -

792520
folder	directory
removed .svn lock files from each of the directory leading to the images folder

792520
folder	directory
moved the images directory to home folder and committed deleted images

792525
getter	setter
add your indexed getter and setter too of course

792570
post	get
if you post the code that you tried you may get a more detailed response as to what is going wrong

792599
serializable	deserialization
if your class is enum-like it should mean that it should contain no serializable state - deserialization should be possible from its type alone a sort of an id as you said

792621
pull	push
eventually i realized it would make much more sense to have a separate repository a bare clone that doesn t have any files in it then have computer b push to it and computer a pull from it

792629
ant	maven
what about all those build systems like ant scons maven rake etc

792632
implements	extends
hadoop mapper interface extends jobconfigurable and closeable but i see a big difference because it s a framework that uses user code implements those interfaces versus a service that could have multiple implementations

792634
addeventlistener	onload
from that you can see the relevant part is simply to note a datestamp immediately before the iframe is encountered and then add an event handler to the iframes onload event which will work regardless of the domain of the iframe source and doesn t require modifying the content to take another measurement normally i d add these events with addeventlistener attachevent but you get the idea

792638
queue	fifo
rather than letting those methods directly change state i put their parameters by converting them to a command object in a fifo queue erlang s mailbox and a react method which processes that queue

792640
put	get
now i get all the meta of files writte nin files and i need to write some logic so that i can put proper data in proper tables

792649
vsto	add-in
i m working on a ms word add-in vsto

792662
udp	tcp
http commonly used tcp udp

792665
getter	setter
there is relatively little value in making a field private if you are going to add a getter and setter

792714
accessor	properties
yes - getfoo and setfoo are accessor methods for a properties named foo - this is part of the javabeans specification

792714
getter	setter
many people misunderstand the concept and believe that encapsulation just means writing setter and getter for private properties instead of making them public - and then rightfully consider that idiotic

792764
vmware	virtualbox
run vmware virtualbox

792971
post	get
i know i have to style my file input but how to get it to post automatically on file selection

793008
spweb	spsite
notification handlers -- it will be the spweb spsite or spwebapplication that the feature was activated on -- and you could save yourself writing a configuration interface just to have users set which webs your timer job should work with and which not

793015
width	height
in my application the label has a width of 100 height of 500 and font size of 400

793096
postgresql	mysql
since it sounds like you are going for the classic lamp setup you may as well install postgresql or mysql

793123
nexus	artifactory
we used to use artifactory but ended up switching to nexus a while back

793131
gridview	rowdatabound
on your gridview rowdatabound method check to see if the data item is the dummy row make sure the rowtype is a datarow first before trying to check the data

793146
rtl	vhdl
i recommend the chu pong p. rtl hardware design using vhdl

793193
maven	pom.xml
as of version 2.0.9 maven uses pom.xml order for classpath so you can actually manipulate it now

793204
int	chars	int	double
if you look in the documentation for string format specifiers you can find out exactly what chars to use for each type of replacement int double object etc

793227
ubuntu	linux
elfedit would have probably been a nice tool but i have not found a version for linux in particular ubuntu

793267
organization	naming
rather have a sane naming convention and be consistent with your organization

793285
portrait	landscape
if you want to force it to rotate from portrait to landscape here is the code

793289
int	chars
read will return int but after checking that they are not -1 indicating end-of-file you can cast that int to a chars

793302
subtraction	addition
you can also carry out operations such as addition and subtraction to calculate time between two timespans or to calculate a new time based on a time and duration

793320
stateless	stateful
also they are stateful struts 1 actions were stateless

793342
inherited	subclassing
we create a subclassing of system.web.ui.masterpage and make sure all of our master pages inherited from our specialised masterpage so that every page gets these classes added on for free

793547
inherited	subclassing
this means that your subclassing would inherited the static variable from the parent and thus the instance as well

793559
draggable	droppable
i want to use jquery draggable droppable to let the user select a group of objects each one has a checkbox in the corner and then drag all the selected objects as a group.

793616
width	height
creating a rectangle based on origin and width height mapped against an array index

793637
richfaces	icefaces
i think it makes no sense to mix icefaces with richfaces

793646
recv	epoll
it s strange that after the client has closed the connection epoll still can poll recv and send events

793659
return-value-optimization	nrvo
as others have already pointed out this is the case of the name return-value-optimization nrvo

793679
hash	whirlpool
i m trying to insert binary data a whirlpool hash into a pg table and am getting an error

793712
scatter	graphing
i ve currently got prefuse to plot a scatter graphing where the x axis is the computer name and the y axis is its temperature

793737
getter	setter
for example when you select you want something green it updates a getter setter in the singleton to be green

793737
getter	setter
then when the application needs to know what color was selected it gets the info from the same getter setter

793747
subtract	add
just look at the first or last element and add or subtract 1

793755
httprequest	httpresponse
i m new at using the the libraries webclient httpresponse and httprequest in c# so bare over with me if my question is confusing to read

793804
rss	feed
they provide calendar event feed in rss and custom xml

793857
tiff	png
it is capable of reading writing png s and at least capable of reading tiff writing should be supported too

793902
directwrite	direct2d
direct2d and directwrite were introduced in windows 7

793928
folder	directory
i m assuming you re referring to the web-inf directory in the root of the web application folder structure

793933
min	max
max or min will work on a char field

793943
keydown	keyup
you can do a simple test to see if any keydown keyup events are triggered when you press the buttons

793966
int	boolean
you could create an ivalueconverter which converts an int to a boolean based on the cutoff

793968
folder	directory
if you are absolutely sure the content is in the right folder then it s probably the server that doesn t let anything to be served from the bin directory for obvious security reasons

793995
postgresql	mysql
they are equivalent for all 4 major database systems oracle sql server mysql postgresql

793996
directx	direct2d
direct2d is built on directx 10.1 so will not work on xp since directx 10 is vista+ only

793996
directx	direct2d	directx	directwrite	directwrite	direct2d
direct2d and directwrite technical previews are both currently available in the march 2009 directx sdk

794036
vb6	vba
apparently this used to be a way in vb6 and vba to short circuit and execute the first true case

794037
versioning	upgrade
if this still yields the same result you should probably upgrade your versioning

794127
rss	feed
for instance if you have any sort of news or events feed then provide rss feed for those

794243
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox opera safari and google-chrome all work without problems

794244
min	max
i have an array of doubles and need to do a calculation on that array and then find the min and max value that results from that calculation

794314
post	get
i m new to nhibernate and trying to get my head around the proper way to update detached objects from a web application form post

794345
post	get
i m surprised i didn t see this mentioned in the other post but you can use managementfactory in java 5 6 to get at a lot of the memory usage information

794361
int	chars
are you sure that the sizes of chars and int variables are the same between the c and fortran code

794362
children	parent
when the items are checked make them children of the group object when unselected set them back as children of the document body or static parent or whatever

794414
hide	show
an alternative would be to show the dialog hide it immediately show a topmost progress form instead and then hide that but i think showing a single dialog is more seamless an experience for the user

794434
int	chars
the binary number could be an unsigned int two s complement int an ieee floating point number a string of chars or something else entirely

794434
integer	unsigned
so 7 in two s complement notation is 00000111 just as it is as an unsigned integer

794434
integer	unsigned
so yes positive integers in two s complement notation are represented the same way they are with unsigned integers assuming it is a valid integer for the number of bits being used

794464
min	max
now perform a sortof binary search starting with min b max end of the list

794464
range	max	range	min	min	max
if the element at p is greater than p-b+1 recurse on the range min pivot otherwise recurse on the range pivot max

794464
min	max
continue until min pivot max o lg n

794474
post	get
if you want to avoid it you need to use get method instead of post

794499
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
resizing the input doesn t work in safari or google-chrome just firefox and opera

794514
return-value-optimization	nrvo
just for completeness with the other answers the standard allows the compiler to omit the copy constructor in certain situations what other answers refer to as return-value-optimization or named return-value-optimization - return-value-optimization nrvo

794584
firefox	safari
it works in safari but not in firefox 3.08 3.1 beta3

794601
trie	tree
i m currently implementing a radix tree patricia trie whatever you want to call it

794686
min	max
using the code below you can get a random integer between min 1 and max 365 then using the dateadd funection you can create random dates in the last year

794687
factors	mean
by this i mean a central server that will inspect all the packets on the network and apply logic drop delay alter etc based on factors external to the actual network such as weather and line-of-sight

794687
udp	tcp
they also don t handle either udp or tcp

794687
udp	tcp
i need a way to transparently run our server and apply the effects without changing any existing software and some can t be changed anyway for both udp and tcp

794687
spoofing	traffic
to that extent we were thinking of using arp-poisoning or spoofing whichever you prefer to call it to force all the traffic through one or potentially multiple for load-balancing of these servers to perform the packet shaping

794693
profiler	yourkit
i used the yourkit profiler to take a snapshot of the memory before the tab was opened opened a tab closed it again and took another snapshot

794708
ienumerable	icollection
as adam robinson points out you could consider implementing some or all of ienumerable t icollection t icollection ienumerable if you want users of your class to be able to for example iterate over items in the queue

794708
ienumerable	icollection
the standard queue class queue t implements ienumerable t icollection and ienumerable implementing at least these would be good for consistency

794716
ienumerable	icollection
a better idea would be for you to inherit from object and have priorityqueue of t implement icollection and ienumerable of t explicitly

794745
ssl	https
adding a ssl certificate https to tomcat6 should not cause these problems

794745
ssl	https
you enabled ssl https

794794
lisp	scheme
other than that lisp is a family of diverse dialects with diverse implementations scheme common lisp emacs lisp visual lisp clojure logo ... and several others

794801
put	get
right now i would have to say the put method is better since it works and i could not get the webservice to work

794823
stdout	stderr
the hard part here is doing the pipes - but a bit of io pipe fork and reopening stdout and stderr and it s not bad

794853
division	multiplication
2.0 with fast - o n log n - multiplication division algorithms

794853
addition	multiplication
addition multiplication comparing

794857
hide	show
i can manually show and hide the tooltip just fine

794961
sortedmap	sortedset
i want to make a class usable in sortedset | sortedmap

794967
sortedmap	sortedset
this is why all sortedmap sortedset implementations that i know of allow you to pass in a comparator at creation

794984
equals	compareto
effective java recommends that if you don t implement compareto consistent with equals you should clearly indicate so

794998
equals	compareto
if you want to have compareto inconsistent with equals it is recommended that you instead use an explicit comparator by providing a class that implements comparator

794998
equals	compareto
whether or not equals and hashcode are consistent with compareto is a different matter

795004
mockito	easymock
i used the mockito mock framework for the example and typed it quickly but easymock or your preferred mock framework should do it as well

795027
hex	binary
in response to this question asking about hex to raw binary conversion a comment suggested that it could be solved in 5-10 lines of c or any other language.

795027
hex	binary
nb this doesn t mean hex to ascii binary - specifically the output should be a raw octet stream corresponding to the input ascii hex

795033
inherited	subclassing
if your reall really need to have multiple inherited two base classes so that you can get the functionality from both you could have your base class the one you definately need be a subclassing of stream itself

795040
globalization	localization
check out wpf globalization and localization overview

795076
ssl	https
i am pasting the working code to log in to a ssl powered https site using http client 3.1

795124
int	double
you could for example have a struct with an int 32 bit and a double 64 bit

795159
submit	submission
alternatively you can be sneaky and use a hidden submit that should correctly identify a key-pressed for submission but this probably has some significant impact on accessibility

795161
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the code below works fine in firefox google-chrome opera etc

795164
client-side	server-side
php alone can t determine how the form submit event was triggered because that happens on the client-side while php is a server-side language

795229
post	get
and like the comments said you can t just replace a post with a get because that s a bad idea for a variety of reasons

795229
post	get
however you can combine the two let the request be a post but issue a location header redirect which the browser will then execute as a get

795229
post	get
to the user this will look like a single operation but to the browser it will be a post followed by a get which effectively eliminates this issue

795233
public	protected
you can create simple workflow that move new document from public document library to protected one

795294
stdout	stderr
i am trying to redirect both stdout stderr of a unix command and append to a log file in a korn shell

795312
folder	directory
some plugins from the plugins directory some folder from the features directory

795312
notepad	textpad
yes i could just use notepad textpad but there is a project i am working on where a lighter version of eclipse would be useful

795338
vim	emacs
on a related theme - you might want to consider using emacs or vim as your editor but that s more of a personal preference thing

795352
int	chars
while solving this i encountered the fact that chars y.compareto x just returns y - x while int y.compareto x returns -1 0 or 1

795386
background-color	transparency
you can also specify background-color here so you don t need to use transparency

795411
cdr	cons
the cdr of the cons you ve just created points back to itself the definition of order_list used in the second let is the definition being created

795480
cassini	iis
another option for you is to simply skip cassini and debug under iis

795545
punctuation	words
if the character is a non-word character punctuation space possibly more add the current words to the words list in the forward index and clear the current words

795550
autofac	castle-windsor
check out structuremap castle-windsor ninject and or autofac

795567
versioning	upgrade
if you ve got multiple versioning of the class stored in the database it might be pretty tricky to deserialize and upgrade them all to a consistent serialization format in a single pass

795567
int	boolean
just be careful as you add new fields to the class that they make sense with their default values boolean are false objects are null int are zero etc

795592
entityspaces	lightspeed	nhibernate	entityspaces
there are many products of this type you can use built-in .net frameworks such as the entity framework open-source ones such as nhibernate or commercial products such as lightspeed llblgen entityspaces or openaccess disclosure i work for a company that makes a commercial orm

795611
width	height
the img tags often don t have any width or height attributes ie it s often just

795611
width	height
since i rarely have the width and height attributes in the image tag to work with i figured i could use jquery to listen to the readystatechange event of the image and when it s loading pick up the size of the image and properly size the iframe even while the image is still loading

795735
vim	emacs
evil recent vim emulator for emacs

795754
camping	ruby-on-rails
the only significant difference that i m aware of is that camping is based around the mvc pattern like ruby-on-rails and is coupled to activerecord

795779
nfa	dfa
that s exponential space in the worst case though every state in the dfa maps to a subset of the powerset of the nfa states

795779
nfa	dfa
now instead of constructing the equivalent dfa you simulate the nfa

795804
post	get
if i can get this working i ll post an answer up with the basic steps to implementing it it s a little confusing as the documentation is a mixture of sql 2000 and sql 2005 references

795809
rtf	odf
when you add wingdings characters to a word document you re actually changing the font for that character to wingdings. this is possible because most modern text editors use advanced document formats like rtf odf one of the various word formats etc

795862
x86	64bit
both versions require 64bit hardware but the x86 version of the os is still 32-bit -- like running any other 32-bit app

795868
int	chars
i m writing a function using icu to parse an unicode string which consists of kanji numeric chars s and want to return the int value of the string

795907
google-chrome	safari
with ie you ll want to create a textrange object in mozilla you can make use of window.find or a selection object webkit safari google-chrome require yet another method

795949
ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest
check out the ftpwebrequest and ftpwebresponse classes

795984
ftp	telnet
ftp passwd telnet etc

796003
filesystems	ntfs
i m using windows xp sp 3 and my filesystems is ntfs

796017
google-chrome	safari
which safari google-chrome share

796033
ubuntu	linux
with that said the easiest method is to get setup with a linux distro that is mono friendly such as suse or ubuntu

796033
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
monodevelop was taken as a branch of sharpdevelop and designed to work with the mono compiler from the ground up

796096
width	height
you can then set the width and height on it

796109
internationalization	localization	internationalization	globalization	globalization	localization
internationalization i18n localization l10n globalization g11n

796131
dlsym	dlopen
the original dll will still contain the getpid function and you can access that via a combination of loadlibrary getprocaddress on windows or dlopen dlsym on linux

796259
firefox	safari	svg	vml	opera	safari	opera	firefox
for a good while browsers have had support for vector drawing -- firefox safari and opera support the element as well as svg and ie supports vml

796263
ienumerable	iqueryable
i think your question is better phrased like this what is the difference between ienumerable t and iqueryable t with respect to linq

796263
ienumerable	iqueryable
lucas the different is ienumerable t does in-memory querying and iqueryable t does out-of-memory

796263
ienumerable	iqueryable
meaning once you are in a foreach iterator you are using ienumerable and when you are building your query via either extension methods or using linq from o in object synatax you are building an iqueryable t

796267
post	put
you put general delivery and the mailman is expect to know where the letter goes or you can pick it up at the post office if he doesn t

796336
stdout	fflush
use n and fflush stdout for c-style i o or std endl stream manipulator

796361
ienumerable	iqueryable
your question implies that one syntax is ienumerable and the other is iqueryable but this is incorrect

796361
ienumerable	iqueryable
now about your title with respect to linq ienumerable and iqueryable are very similar

796361
ienumerable	iqueryable
difference being that ienumerable takes as paremeters and iqueryable takes as parameters

796361
ienumerable	iqueryable
to achieve this all he has to do is cast the iqueryable into an ienumerable where he wants the switch to happen

796368
temp	tmp
gettemppath is most likely returning the value of the tmp or temp environment variables which at least under windows xp are typically defined in terms of the short path name

796379
apache	nginx
there s extensions for apache lighty and nginx so there s a good chance there s one for your webserver

796392
nsmutablestring	nsstring
oc_pythonstring which is what python strings are bridged to is an nsstring subclass so you could get an nsmutablestring with

am testing my webpage on firefox and everything is looking fine but when i run my page on ie or google-chrome a section with

796444
post	get
i got output buffers on all error reporting but no errors it doesn t redirect when i post with the form even though it definitely passes because the session var is set and i get to the die part

796458
google-chrome	firefox
it s likely that you have malformed html that firefox is handling differently than ie and google-chrome

796513
stdout	stderr
well there are two stdout stderr but it doesn t matter here the redirects the output normally written to the console handle to a file handle

796548
firefox	safari
also i m guessing that firefox ignores this issue and just and compensates for it while safari may be more strict in its implementation of the code so it doesn t compensate

796579
vtk	itk
there are also vtk and itk with a huge amount of manifold image processing algorithms

796631
set	bag
bag like set but can contain elements multiple times

796633
valgrind	glibc
yes there are false positives with valgrind that s why it has suppression files for particular glibc and gcc versions for example

796633
valgrind	glibc
the false positives may arise if you are using older valgrind with newer gcc and glibc valgrind 3.3 with glibc 2.9

796694
keydown	keyup
since the multiple occourrence of keydown is due to the keyrepeat settings of windows i think that you should somehow track the keyup event of that key also to know that the key has been released

796786
accurev	plasticscm	perforce	plasticscm	perforce	accurev
you may want to check perforce purecm plasticscm or accurev

796802
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	opensuse	linux
then i d install latest mono 2.4 on a linux box opensuse is the one they use so it will always go smoothly for development but we also use ubuntu internally and start playing around with the compiler monodevelop which is quite good since 2.0 and so on

796857
disk	ram
the non paged pool should be reserved for memory that must stay in ram so if you are doing something critical that would affected by a memory page from disk operation then use non paged

796890
mathml	mathjax
edit it s been a while since i last updated this post but with html5 becoming adopted by browsers there is a new player in the game that introduces latex and mathml back into the mix mathjax

796960
width	height
you may also need to use the same converter for width and height so that it increased in size to match as well

796994
cos	sin
y r cos a sin b

797014
inherited	properties
classes structs primitive types arrays boxing interfaces inherited abstract virtual new sealed properties nullables

797067
internationalization	globalization
one problem of globalization internationalization are that date and time formats in different cultures can differ on many levels day month year order date separator etc

797078
width	height
moreover only tables possess elastic properties which allows the to stretch to the width height of their content

797078

sum	coalesce
if that s null coalesce returns its second argument 0 otherwise it returns the non-null value of its first argument which is the sum we want

797136
post	put
i didnâ t want to flood this post with code so i have put the sections on i think are important please let me know if i need to clarify more

797139
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
monodevelop is was a sharpdevelop branch with the latter having solution support

797141
pascal	delphi
another option is lazarus which is based on free pascal which itself is based on delphi

797175
min	max
max and min should still be displayed

797186
client-side	server-side
i don t believe that it s possible to handle a 404 error client-side because a 404 error is server-side

797194
unsigned	short
it s also an unsigned integral type but an unsigned short .

797198
integer	unsigned
for off_t you might need to cast to the largest unsigned integer type unsigned long and use a lu specifier

797203
inherited	properties
it has someitems properties which is an where inheritedfromdo is a class inherited from dependencyobject

797204
int	boolean
the construct is common in c c++ because boolean values are represented using int

797230
qstring	qtextedit
only qtextedit definitely has an append qstring slot

797231
post	get
the second part of that rules is a request is a url and a method get or post

797231
web.py	turbogears	django	web.py	django	turbogears
django turbogears web.py etc

797269
expression-blend	silverlight
i am working with expression-blend and c# to create a silverlight site

797270
mouseover	mouseout
but you have to write code for event like mouseclick mouseover mouseout keydown etc

797328
invariantculture	cultureinfo
you can use the config file as martin mentioned above but as good practise you should definitely set the cultureinfo wherever necessary to invariantculture to cater for data thats being sent through in different locales

797341
bash	tcsh
bash tcsh csh sh etc. etc.

797341
loops	if-statement
however you should never write a script with if-statement or loops in a traditional shell language

797447
versioning	upgrade
you must decide whether or not you want to do patching of your files or upgrade everytime you install a new versioning

797464
mbunit	nunit
nunit and mbunit has a rowtest attribute that allows you to sent different set of parameters into a single test

797484
integer	unsigned
the number of items stored in a list can t be negative so why not use an unsigned integer type for it

797527
fast-forward	merge	pull	push
the rebase approach is slightly more evil - you d have to push with --force as your push would not be a fast-forward merge you d pull the features branch from under someone who had cloned it

797528
pull	push
iâ m not quite sure what it is that you want but of course can you pull from a subversion repository and push to a git repository from the same working copy

797547
post	get
not that crazy about seriously complex security for example a simple post or get of a request and an envelope back with results might be good enough

797575
freebsd	linux
i am trying to port a tool to osx which is designed to run on linux and freebsd

797599
firefox	safari
you can use -moz-border-radius and -webkit-border-radius to get rounded corners in firefox and safari enhancing the visual experience of your site but ie users still get the content albeit with plain old square corners and then there are plenty of javascript solutions out there to achieve this for people with javascript enabled

797611
int	chars
if key was a chars or cast to chars in the cout statement you ll see the chars representation of the int

797612
width	height
also only width and height of the body div can be hardcoded

797626
hash	salt
non-random salt for password hash

797645
hash	salt
with this in mind salt suddenly makes a big difference because of this salt the attackerâ s pre-calculated hash the aforementioned rainbow tables are of no value

797646
hash	salt
however salt only protects when one can get the hash from the database

797662
serializable	deserialization
what i want to know is whether the serializable to file and then deserialization when needed would actually load the data faster

797664
hash	salt
a salt is used in conjunction with a cryptographic hash not merely tacked on the front of the password

797664
hash	salt
you don t store the salt password or the password but rather the hash of the salt password

797664
hash	salt
good passwords protect against guesses dictionary attacks salt help protect against someone getting a hold of your hash passwords by making it expensive to use precomputed tables

797665
hash	salt
the real value in a salt is not only in protecting a single record against attack but rather making it so that if multiple users have the same password they will appear different in their hash form

797678
width	height
the image will now fill to the container div s height and scale its width with its aspect ratio

797684
hash	md5
passwords are never stored in a database only the hash is stored md5 sha1 sha2 etc

797684
hash	salt
if you choose a salt then xor the salt with the password hash then the attacker can just undo the xor operation and get the original hash at which point rainbow tables are extremely useful

797688
hash	md5
if i take a md5 hash of an email and change one character the hash changes dramatically i want something to not change too much

797706
hash	salt
if however you use the salt 123456 obviously a random one would be better they will see a hash

797706
hash	salt
even if they are able to compromise the salt when they get the hash you should try to prevent this by storing them separately they will be left with

797740
postgresql	mysql
while i m sure encrypted stored procs are a simple matter of programming in postgresql at least mysql and stored procs do not have a long history together with postgresql s custom languages support i don t see why this would be useful

797856
hash	md5
metadata such as an md5 hash or timestamp for time received may be helpful for large datafiles

797860
git-am	git-apply
note from git google summer of code 2009 there is a project to teach git-apply the 3-way merge fallback git-am knows

797860
git-am	git-apply
for various reasons it would be nice to do the entire temporary tree dance directly inside of git-apply as it can benefit say the git-sequence s apply command speed up git-am processing by forking less etc

797871
put	get
just as an empty request body is in keeping with the original purpose of a get request and empty response body is in keeping with the original purpose of a put request

797872
client-side	server-side
you need to understand the difference between server-side code and client-side code

797888
folder	directory
the output directory contains the created setup.exe and i manually place the additional dependencies folder containing the files required for steps 1 2 and 4 mentioned above

797900
apache	lighttpd
go look up something about lighttpd or apache and how they need to be set up to run cgi scripts for instance the example for apache

797915
listview	gridview
using a listview + gridview and then customizing the style to look more like a calendar

797915
listview	gridview
i m thinking the listview gridview would be more elegant but i still need to create a listview for each cell and then i have to figure out how to style the control in such a way that it looks more like a calendar and less like a table

797921
getter	setter
automatically implemented properties are the way to go if you getter and setter do not require any validation logic

797982
int	double
when processing the bar.cpp file the compiler will create a new definition of the foo class with every t replaced with the int type for the fooint instance and a new definition of the foo class with every t replaced with the double type for the foodouble instance

797996
tolower	toupper
try using toupper or tolower on both

798047
hash	md5
by the way a hash like md5 is trying to do pretty much the opposite thing that a metric does so it s hardly surprising that this wouldn t work for you

798054
free	malloc
unless you have a really good reason to do so do not do it as you are very likely to use free on a new-allocated buffer or delete and a malloc allocated one

798061
deselect	multi-select
if the dgv is set up to allow multi-select then you d obviously want to deselect any existing selection

798105
next	except
so far i have everything working except the panel is not being cleared before drawing the next rectangle so i end up with rectangles everywhere

798119
gridview	rowdatabound
i used to do the same to gridview when in gridview rowdatabound event i manipulate the contents like

798154
integer	unsigned
take c c++ for example size_t is the type of the integer for memory sizes and allocation and is unsigned but ptrdiff_t is the type for the offset you get when you subtract one pointer from another and necessarily is signed

798161
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome both display an empty text box and when you read value back you get null

798186
srp	principles
i would recommend to read more about single responsibility principles srp

798227
google-chrome	firefox
the application works fine in both ie and google-chrome but does not seem to work in firefox

798236
mouseleave	mouseenter
in this control override the getcontainerforitemoverride method to return a new hovertrackingitem which handles mouseenter mouseleave to notify the parent hovertrackingitemscontrol

798307
put	get
if you put elmah on your asp.net website it will automatically log and handle all the exceptions that get thrown by your app as you are testing it

798331
jlist	jtable
then you can build a jlist jtable of files using this icon

798339
getter	setter
if you add a string to your action named the same as your checkbox s and expose it via accessors getter setter struts 2 should auto populate it

798413
email	dkim
i m hacking some support for domainkeys and dkim into an open source email marketing program which uses a python script to send the actual email via smtp

798418
google-chrome	firefox
i have placed a findfile.manifest file under home akshay .mozilla firefox xxxx.dev google-chrome

798428
equals	gethashcode
inheritance is the way to go and each class should override the equals and gethashcode where needed

798459
automake	autotools
generally autotools see autotools book gnu autoconf automake libtool are quite common

798498
folder	directory
when opening a solution vs creates an empty bin debug or release when in release mode folder in the parent directory or even the parent of the parent directory of the actual bin folder specified in the project files

798568
ready	each
and the beautiful thing is that it would execute each task whenever a core is ready to execute

798574
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu and probably all other children have mono in the repository

798574
ubuntu	debian
however i would suggest version 2 which requires using the sid repository in debian don t know about ubuntu

798590
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
as long as you go with major upgrade from versioning to versioning that works just fine - you can uninstall the old versioning and then re-install the new one - no major problems here

798604
post	get
when the user selects her choices and post s using the submit button i would like for our application to store her selections in the model and then render a page with the id of the model so that the user can get back to the page she created at any point with a simple get request

798619
mockito	easymock
first i needed to realize that i cannot mock webservicetemplate with mockito since it is a concrete class you need to use easymock if this is essential

798734
rss	feed
i have a problem with reading an rss feed in my site

798749
profiling	benchmarking
all the benchmarking and profiling is now in rails which is awesome

798796
doc	rtf
i have a problem i have to get the o p in excel of the report using xml publisher my report displays around 29 columns and those are not fiiting in the word doc template rtf

798803
hex	binary
i don t recall seeing this method before but mikko rantanen pointed this equation out in a comment on the question code golf - hex to raw binary conversion

798862
post	put
4 post to obtain a url to which you then put the file

798876
stdout	stderr
on further testing it looks like the jvm is putting the message i want to stdout or stderr

798876
stdout	stderr
i believe i would need to capture stdout and stderr to get the error i m looking for unless of course there is a simpler way

798891
int	chars
in some programming laguages a string can hold a sequence of chars and an unsigned int can only hold positive whole numbers

798895
post	get
i ll post the full solution when i get the chance it was enough of a hack that someone else will hopefully find it useful

798925
put	get
so i guess the question is where do i put those parameters so i can get at them with js in a nice cross browser way

798925
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the only interesting thing with this is the difference between click events in ie and in firefox google-chrome and safari

798925
button	checkbox
ie allows anything to have a click where as the others limit click to input elements of type button checkbox radio reset or submit

798960
hbase	hypertable
keep in mind tools like hbase and hypertable are key value stores so don t do ad-hoc queries and joins without the help of a mapreduce cascading app to perform the joins out of band which is a very useful pattern

798975
solaris	aix
get the following all available for windows linux aix solaris etc .

799002
jquery	scriptaculous
was one consideration for us but essentially we ve played with mootools prototype scriptaculous and jquery and have found jquery to be the easiest for us all to understand support

799024
int	chars	int	boolean
the basic types like int boolean chars and pointer are safe to read at any time

799037
factors	mean
dry does not mean limiting your model and you should keep that in sight when factors behavior via inheritance or anything like that

799043
getter	setter
then i use the entity classes from database to generate the xxx entity class which contains all the necessary annotations and getter and setter methods

799051
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
further more you could try to stop it somehow but it appears that firefox 3 ie 8 google-chrome 2 and opera 9 are executing the html attribute handler in the first place and then the one attached i didn t tested with jquery though but with addeventlistener and attachevent

799057
tunnel	packets
in any case the idea is to provide an ssl tunnel over port 443 that our c#.net remoting packets they re http packets at the moment may pass through

799073
datalist	repeater
render the data however you like using datalist or repeater or whatever

799078
udp	tcp
this is because udp is a datagram protocol vs tcp s stream protocol

799142
udp	tcp
udp is ideal for things like broadcasting and streaming audio or video a dropped packet is never a problem in those situations. so if you need to ensure your data gets to the other side stick with tcp

799142
udp	tcp
udp has less overhead than tcp and is therefore faster

799167
inherited	properties
atm it is braindamaged in the way that it does not really distinguish between current instance variables and inherited properties variables

799171
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this works in internet explorer ie5.5 ie6 ie7 firefox opera and now safari netscape 8 and mozilla

799176
public	protected
public protected method names properties class names and so on are subject to best practice guidelines

799187
bazaar	git
i have had a really quick look at git mercurial and bazaar

799233
udp	tcp
tcp is that tcp is good when data delivery is better late than never udp is good when data delivery is better never than late

799233
udp	tcp
also note that udp can be multicast while tcp can t

799254
accessor	properties
that depends on the properties types and possibly on their accessor methods

799323
dictionary	map
you can use a dictionary to map exceptions against functions to call

799375
coalesce	nvl
i ve also tried some equivalent ones recognized in other databases nvl ifnull and coalesce but sqlite doesn t seem to recognize any of them

799379
icmp	udp
a third advantage of using connected udp sockets is it allows you to receive icmp error messages back to your application such as routing or host unknown due to a crash

799379
icmp	udp
if the udp socket isn t connected the os won t know where to deliver icmp error messages from the network to and will silently discard them potentially leading to your app hanging while waiting for a response from a crashed host or waiting for your select to time out

799389
folder	directory
in target1 i am batching against the identity of the items in pathdir and then performing a transform on item subdirectory which contains the common folder names found in the unique directory to create a new item containing the full paths

799391
put	get
your best bet is to get a weekly code review meeting going where you put your code that follows the standards up on the screen and get your colleagues critiques

799403
accessor	properties
in the viewmodel in the set accessor of the group1selection properties i have something like

799403
puts	gets
where populategroup2 performs my service call async gets the data and puts that data into the exposed property of group2

799407
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade to versioning 5 from 4.2 and it was not an improvement

799429
ssl	https
the second tells mercurial to allow pushing without ssl since hg serve does not currently natively support https

799429
pull	push
mercurial will now allow push from users who can authenticate via http basic authentication and allow pull from everyone else

799464
lxml	beautifulsoup
if that s truly unacceptable you have two additional solutions you can screen-scape the bitbucket page for your repository using a tool like beautifulsoup or lxml or you can wait until bitbucket releases their api which will likely provide this functionality

799528
mako	genshi
i d suggest using a template to generate the output you can start with the buildin string.template or try something fancier for example mako or cheetah genshi jinja kid etc

799554
zipoutputstream	zipfile
i m using the java.util.zip library and zipoutputstream in order to create a zipfile of a directory and all the files and directories under it

799640
mp3	ogg
see gstreamer perl bindings and converting ogg to mp3 as an example

799700
folder	directory
the obj folder is the temporary directory for the compiler

799723
width	height
depending on what you re after image.width or image.naturalwidth and height equivalents width height gives the width height attributes on the image tag naturalwidth height gives the dimensions of the actual underlying image

799729
webdev.webserver	iis
the property httpcontext.current.request.applicationpath represents the virtual directory in iis or webdev.webserver

799853
post	get
hi can anyone past some code how to do a restful web service get and post method

799859
metaclass	subclassing
it d certainly be possible to subclassing django s modelbase metaclass and add the functionality you need

799882
capitalize	uppercase
also note that using the set sommand to put the variable in the environment will work as well but nmake automatically capitalize environment variable names even for weird ones like windir which is lowercase in the system for some reason and is case-sensitive so to use the environment variable you must use the variable in uppercase

799971
mockups	balsamiq
i ve been using balsamiq to create mockups

799998
onenote	ms-office
not free but if you already have ms ms-office with onenote installed it s great for stuff like this imho

799999
nsurlrequest	nsmutableurlrequest
verify that you actually have a nsmutableurlrequest and not a nsurlrequest at this point

800011
murmurhash	fnv
the recommended hash functions for these data structures these days are fnv jenkins and murmurhash

800015
integer	fractions
an easy solution is to split and count the floating point value when still a string eg splitting at the decimal point and counting the integer part length and the fractions part length then create the formatter as

800016
stdout	stderr
in more complex scenarios where you want to fetch stdout stderr or the return code you can use well known standard modules like ipc open2 and ipc open3

800021
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
it starts by calling either document.addeventlistener domcontentloaded or document.attachevent onreadystatechange depending on the event model and goes on from there

800034
stdout	stderr
there is also no point in returning stdout stderr or exit status of the command

800034
stdout	stderr
it allows you to read stdout stderr and write to stdin of your command

800071
mouse	keyboard
and then the command can be pushed in an execution queue both when the user presses a keyboard button moves the mouse or without a trigger with the playback mechanism

800105
stdout	stderr
ipc open3 run a process and create a pipe to stdin stdout and stderr

800128
post	get
if you send a get request to index.php you ll show some output and if you send a post request to index.php you ll perform some data manipulation

800137
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i am trying to make a for-loop that checks a 16 element arrays so it loops from 0 to 15

800169
for-loop	loops
the criteria of using a for-loop instead of a while loops is that you know beforehand exactly how many times a for-loop will execute

800176
ienumerable	iqueryable
the kind of thing that i was after was replacing the queryable constant in the expression tree with a concrete ienumerable or iqueryable via .asqueryable result set...this is a complex topic that probably only makes any sense to linq provider writers who are knee deep in expression tree visitors etc

800179
wmv	asf
i m compressing raw avi files to wmv using the asf writer

800187
for-loop	loops
the for-loop is equivalent to the following while loops

800209
uitableview	nsindexpath
cgfloat tableview uitableview tableview heightforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

800217
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
because the dictionary doesn t implement inotifypropertychanged or inotifycollectionchanged

800230
mouse	keyboard
if i have no nodes selected and that treeview gains focus i ll get an afterselect event with the first node selected even though i didn t select it using the keyboard mouse or programmatically

800235
bash	zsh
i need to change the following bash code to zsh

800237
for-loop	loops
you cannot accomplish this with the built-in loops structures and as bill the lizard said you probably don t really want to reuse the for-loop variable

800264
post	get
the best resources i ve found to get my head around uac is is robert flamings blog he s got a series of about 25 post that explain how vista uac and msi all interact

800295
stdout	stderr
when i wrote this code i would also get the error via stdout stderr

800295
stdout	stderr
the best way to redirect stdout stderr in your process is by using freopen

800296
awt	swing
what you really must understand with dealing with swing and in fact awt is that you need to keep all interaction with the components of the awt event dispatch thread edt

800334
stdout	stderr
after getting a hold of stdout and stderr which you ll need anyway add -xcheck jni to your jvm command line to get extra jni-related warnings from the jvm

800354
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
but it obviously can t use msxml in firefox google-chrome safari opera etc

800367
cvs	svn
in the cvs svn world there are various statistics metrics tools

800397
hudson	bamboo
atlassian bamboo cost sun hudson free and cruise control free are all popular options in order of my preference and have support to handle phpunit output because phpunit support junit output

800399
swt	swing
then swt interferes with swing

800433
folder	directory
they certainly can t run in the same folder or virtual directory

800437
post	get
the general rule of thumb is that if you re retrieving something use get but if you re sending or changing something use post

800509
post	get
you can use get or post

800539
os.path	shutil
i just wrote some code to move vmware virtual machines around and ended up using os.path and shutil to accomplish file copying between sub-directories

800551
hash	md5
md5 is a cryptographic hash function not necessarily an encryption method

800551
salt	md5
you will probably want to save these old passwords in a separate column then when the users login to the new system compare the md5 ed version of that password with the old one and if the digest matches perform sha1 with a salt on that password and store that in a separate column

800682
hash	md5
the part of rex m s answer about using sha1 to generate a hash is a good one md5 is also a popular option

800685
hash	md5
md5 16 bytes time to hash 500mb 1462 ms

800685
hash	md5
under normal situations when you use the md5 algorithm with no malicious intent and no third party has any malicious intent would you expect any collisions meaning two arbitrary byte producing the same hash

800687
width	height
try to preload the image into hidden dom and when it loads you can try to get its width height

800697
hash	md5	hash	hmac	hmac	md5
as long as you don t care to protect against collisions you are still safe to use md5 in an hmac as well and you do want the speed sometimes you want a slower hash then you can still use md5 confidently

800699
hash	md5
i am not an expert at this sort of thing but i keep up with the security community and a lot of people there consider the md5 hash broken

800707
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested in ie6 firefox 3.0.5 and google-chrome and they all work

800711
stdout	stderr
if you click on that you will see the stdout and stderr output of your running application

800712
execl	fork
so basically i set up a pipe and fork and then call execl

800720
mp3	wav
decode the mp3 to wav reverse the order of the samples re-encode to mp3 then play it

800775
implements	extends
ideally then i d extends zend_view_abstract to allow me to implements other concrete functions that we require but i don t know how to set this up

800786
jdom	dom4j
it doesn t seem like any of the normal xml libraries dom4j jdom java xml have any built in support for this

800790
bash	zsh
i get bash when i start terminal now although i have bin zsh at terminal settings in mac

800802
daemons	systemd
since the wait systemd call is waiting on the parent daemons process it should exit

800866
ubuntu	linux
the issue is when use the cleanlooks widget style for the vertical scrollbar it looks ok on the linux ubuntu machine where qt-4.3.3 is running

800904
jboss	glassfish
i d like the solution to be as simple and straight forward as possible i m trying to avoid things like glassfish or jboss

800952
pop-up	dialog
actually i want to pop-up my own dialog which save file on server without asking the target path location instead of adobe s save as dialog

800957
wordpress	joomla
install drupal joomla or wordpress download some plugins and design a custom site for your boss

800969
hash	md5
in md5 s defense there is no known way to produce a file with an arbitrary md5 hash

801067
put	get
being the one that management has put between a rock and the hard place then what you need to do is get them to buy the fastest processor and best tools that they are willing to spend based on the colorful pie charts and graphs that you are going to generate from thin air as justification

801084
put	get
it d suggest to put more than 0.5s because sometimes your lataency can get higher

801085
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
you should take a look at objectdatasource instead of sqldatasource

801106
hide	show
if you re going to use a table to display this don t try to dynamically hide or show table rows it doesn t work well

801121
wxpython	wxformbuilder
wxformbuilder can generate .xrc files for wxpython

801135
pop-up	dialog
you can use jquery ui library to pop-up dialog box for editing

801139
entity-relationship	diagram
bear in mind that sql server since at least 2005 possibly earlier has been capable of generating entity-relationship entity relationship diagram from the management studio

801163
gzipinputstream	gzipoutputstream
use gzipinputstream and gzipoutputstream which are compatible with gzip format

801177
wxpython	pyqt
this may not answer your question directly but i chose pyqt because there were no good ui designers for wxpython

801184
translation	localization
localization to both is similarly complex - besides getting your texts translation you ll need to make sure you don t use bold text doesn t work on either script and make sure any linebreaking algroithm works when words are no longer stings of letters seperated by spaces

801207
mouse	keyboard
simulate mouse and keyboard input wh_journalplayback

801207
mouse	keyboard
if you try to simulate these events by sending or posting messages windows internals do not update the keyboard or mouse state which can lead to unexpected behavior

801207
mouse	keyboard
if hooks are used to play back keyboard or mouse events these events are processed exactly like real keyboard or mouse events

801257
put	get
the answer that you will get here is no different from the answer in the other question put in a separate project for each separate dll

801268
post	get
to me the most useful thing is testing form submissions including each parameter in a get or post request for each form that is necessary for the operation of your site

801306
freebsd	linux
tested on freebsd and linux

801347
hash	md5
when inserting it with a special routine which needs a csv file the password in this case the alphanumeric key is stored as a md5 hash

801375
int	double	min	max
of course this doesn t explain the strange behaviour of numerics_limits min which could be a result of the fact that there are different min max borders for int min -2 n max 2 n-1 but not for double

801462
implements	extends
although i think that using view helpers would be the correct zend-framework -way of doing this you can extends zend_view and implements all additional methods you d like to have - this way you don t loose the features of zend_view

801477
post	get
shown_players appears to have the right value within get because the html generates correctly but it is empty within post

801491
post	get
that s why you can t create a varable in get and use its value in post

801553
filesystems	fat
if you need the capabilities they also have a fat filesystems a peg graphical ui library usb device and host and tcp ip available for additional license fees

801669
mouse	keyboard
or it could even be hooked to mouse or keyboard events so that when the user doesn t move the mouse or isn t using the keyboard the timer counts down until it reaches the log off time

801682
mousemove	keydown
probably it would be simpler to just update the timer based on the mousemove or keydown events on the form itself

801703
onclick	onsubmit
answering prashant s comment digg are adding an onclick handler to the or possibly an onsubmit handler to the form which builds the neat-looking search url and redirects the browser to that url and then returns false to prevent the from submitting the form itself

801728
put	get
i tend to put utilities into one or a few bigger assemblies but work with namespaces to get a clear structure among them

801791
width	height
spacing between nodes can be found by finding the maximum height of the tree using some constant width for the deepest nodes and doubling that width for every lesser depth so that the width for any depth 1 + maxdepth - currentdepth deepestwidth

801795
int	chars
when in doubt look at the source theres no magic in string it just uses primitives like int and chars just like any other class

801803
datalist	objectdatasource
when i try to run databind on my datalist to enhance objectdatasource wired to getofferphotosaccphototableadapter in .xsd file i get the error translated

801831
int	chars
2 int int chars

801988
hex	binary
if the compiler in question is the mspgcc it should put out an assembler listing of the compiled program together with the binary hex file

802071
int	double
this has the benefit that it also handles cases with mixed data types like when minvalue is an int and value is a double

802073
hide	show
i want to show hide certain parts of a view based on authentication-status or roles

802074
jsf	seam
is it some or all of the following seam ofcourse jsf ejb3 hibernate spring inversion of control container

802074
jsf	seam
jsf - essential for seam to really make sense afaict - i recommend focusing on facelets as a primary way of creating jsf pages

802074
stateless	stateful
seam takes care of stateful session and conversation scoped beans generally part of your presentation logic tier and spring is best for the stateless context such as interfaces to back end services such as databases and any soa clients

802074
jsf	seam
i ve found seam + jsf facelets + hibernate + spring to be quite a good combination for creating uis over jbpm and also on another project for delivering content pages though that is not really what seam is for

802113
.nettiers	codesmith
i use a code generator codesmith with .nettiers template to generate all the dal code

802155
sorting	filtering
sorting and filtering and wcf have nothing to do with eachother

802155
sorting	filtering
so you have to implement sorting and filtering yourself as in most cases

802191
unsigned	short
with these definitions and assuming unsigned short 16 bit and int 16 bit and unsigned long 32 bit note that the size of int is important

802191
unsigned	short
but it s unnecessary as the presence of one unsigned long in the calculation will cause the other to be automatically promoted from short to long size

802199
jsf	seam
jsf is a prerequisite for using seam

802201
post	put
i put the code in a blog post mock and stub for linq to sql

802224
salt	md5
alternatively you could salt prepend some secret string your code and then calculate md5 of it

802318
folder	directory
instead it will use a folder under your eclipse workspace directory workspace .metadata .plugins org.eclipse.wst.server.core tmp0

802339
width	height
area width height

802426
width	height
ideally i want to be able to mimic the drodpown list behaviour in that the list of options is drawn floating and is not constrained by the usercontrols height and width nor even the parent forms boundaries

802502
jsf	seam
seam is a meta-framework that combines the ejb3 and jsf frameworks and wraps them with a form of dependency injection

802504
subtract	add
when i check in my code making the methods alphabetical it updates the hierarchy above so that subtract becomes method 1 and add becomes method 0

802536
getter	setter
for good encapsulation you might want getter and setter

802569
executable	upx
i asked a question about the con s of using upx on delphi executable here on so a while back and i got some great responses

802586
pull	push
and these operations are by design nondestructive so you can push pull when you go grab a coffee if your central repo is lagged. another nice thing is that it comes batteries included the builtin gitk is a good enough history viewer

802602
getter	setter
the simple setter getter in our example aren t too persuasive

802611
put	get
i believe if you put it inside cdata tags you ll get the whitespace

802617
public	protected
it doesn t have public and protected either except by naming convention

802620
public	protected
when you check out the class you can specify the order that you like best alphabetical public protected private etc

802652
subtract	add
here s a version of add and subtract that work on any instantiation pattern

802655
updatepanel	scriptmanager
when you call scriptmanager the control parameter must be a control that is within an updatepanel that will be updated

802656
int	chars
int is a value type but checked it again with a chars pointer local to main and obtain similar results

802702
button	checkbox
for example you could create a style for control objects and then apply it to multiple types of controls button textbox checkbox etc

802705
width	height
i probably don t need to set width height enabled and send the hide message on the splash screen

802800
min	max
short min -32768 max 32767

802800
min	max
int min -2147483648 max 2147483647

802800
min	max
unsigned long min 0 max 429496729

802863
jsf	seam
they do work together of course - here is relevant tutorial developing portlets using jsf ajax and seam

802871
udp	tcp
for example it s pretty common to deploy dns services by udp or tcp on port 53

802913
bmp	png	bmp	tga	png	tga
there are at least two decoders in hackage stb-image partial implementation of jpeg png tga bmp psd decoders with a really simple api and pngload pure haskell loader for png images

802968
jobs	cron
- look promising for scheduling of jobs without cron access

802970
boost	stl
libs used stl wxwidgets boost asio cryptlib

803041
outputstream	inputstream
getstreamstohostnamed port inputstream outputstream

803052
xmltype	clob
in my current project we save off the xml used in an xmltype or clob and allow other applications to access the data and xsl templates to generate documents via a web service

803052
super	implements
this was an after thought of the original design that was super easy to implements due to our decision to use xml xsl

803083
int	double
i think that this is an error caused by the limited precision above all because using double instead of int

803097
g++	gcc
the following macros are defined in my version of gcc and g++

803170
pop-up	dialog
in my winforms application i need to pop-up a little custom dialog that stays on the screen for x amount of seconds and then disappears

803170
invokerequired	begininvoke
this of course means that i have to do the whole if invokerequired begininvoke dance which isn t really a problem

803196
post	get
with this code no function called forever with setinterval and you make the difference between close and refresh popup post get

803200
hide	show
add one to the pop up form and start it as soon as the form is show then hide the form on the tick event

803215
move	drag
the user won t be able to move any of the application s windows and if the user drag other windows over the top of it and off again you ll end up with an ugly mess while the ui waits to repaint itself

803216
sorting	filtering
i can then bind the ordersview along with supporting sorting and filtering to a list in wpf

803217
perforce	svn
my first choices would be svn or perforce but the team has a few people who really like vss -

803218
getter	setter
i have no property compiler directive no synthesize so no getter and no setter

803226
recvfrom	datagram
if you friend receives the udp datagram using something like the recvfrom system call the address parameter will receive the ip endpoint information to respond to

803330
spaces	delimiter
thus in contrast with other solutions it is possible to specify every delimiter and not just a spaces -- in this case 8 of them

803395
width	height
flexible width s are really nice but not as critical as the height

803430
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
in terms of running debugging i use firebug on firefox and opera safari ie8 s built in js debuggers

803441
google-chrome	safari
if you re using a webkit based browser safari or google-chrome then you can use the web inspector

803483
implements	extends
so here you are only saying that s1 is something either object or some class extends object that implements serializable

803485
multicastdelegate	delegation
further a delegation reference can with some restrictions see below reference multiple methods called multicastdelegate

803485
multicastdelegate	delegation
the restrictions for a multicastdelegate are that the method delegation signature should not have any return value void and the keywords out and ref are not used in the signature

803485
multicastdelegate	delegation
once the signature complies the delegation is automatically a multicastdelegate

803537
versioning	upgrade
edit i personally think that if the team is not able smoothly to upgrade from versioning 1.0 to 1.1 on the same time on dev - smells like bad design and mix in the responsibilities on what should be on the app layer and what on the db server

803544
qtp	loadrunner
you also set up other qtp and loadrunner scripts to run if a script fails

803580
post	get
to replicate this it is really no different than replicating a normal get or a normal post like i showed above

803587
min	max
you can t specify a min max bound for it

803591
implements	extends	int	double
you might have to create an interface iinfinity and have k extends iinfinity and iinfinity to have a method getinfinityvalue and then wrap extends int double bigdecimal etc in a class that implements iinfinity .

803643
nsimage	nspopupbuttoncell
_defaultindicatorimage | - nspopupbuttoncell _coreuidefaultindicatorimage | + nsimage imagenamed | + nsimage _coreuiimagewithname | + nsimage _coreuiimagewithbasename state backgroundstyle

803689
post	get
there s a post on msdn blogs that shows how to get around this reasonably easily

803700
nginx	lighttpd
it s simple and nginx is even more ridiculously fast and lightweight than lighttpd

803700
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
a common setup at least in the ruby and python web world is to run nginx in front of lighttpd or apache

803701
ubuntu	linux
to clarify i am running my tests under linux ubuntu 7.10

803714
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
if you are running debian ubuntu or possibly other gnu linux distros there should be examples of this type of completion in your etc bash_completion.d directory

803719
put	get
that said i was able to put together a decent flex-building environment using emacs and some third-party packages to get everything running under linux

803773
folder	directory
it automatically rewrites requests to point to a folder called public_html within the user s home directory the web server must have read access up the tree to this folder

803778
post	get
as noted below you should not print get and post data back to the page without sanitizing it first

803851
actionscript	mxml
it uses actionscript mxml as its underlying languages

803887
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome don t support onbeforeunload and onunload seems to be too late

803917
pull	push
out of the blue i can t push or clone or pull with git

803927
starttls	smtps
for example when a client connects to an smtps server and issues the ehlo command the server will list its capabilities which might include support for the starttls command

803940
hide	show
now i want to have a jquery code that show only 3 items after each header and hide the rest to make the list shorter and more usable

803963
udp	tcp
blocking certain networks have protocol priorities so your udp packets may be dropped in favor of allowing tcp traffic through

803965
put	get
makes perfect sense to me so i took the components nodes out of the .wxs file and put them in a separate file but when i attempt to compile the project in visual studio 2008 i get an error for each componentref stating it s an unresolved reference to symbol ... in section product ...

803982
stdout	stderr
also interesting was that i could not for the life of me capture stdout or stderr correctly with any of the freopen or dup2 tricks

804005
installation	upgrade
our installation was an in place upgrade from sps2003 so the database names and ssps were a little goofy

804013
google-chrome	safari
this works perfectly for me in both google-chrome and safari

804023
opera	safari
however in opera and safari for windows i am confronted with the following big-nasty-exception

804087
toggleclass	each
i tried using a toggleclass function to set the class of a li element to active so that it would be yellow but no dice so i ve resorted to resetting the css each time

804129
implements	extends
to answer the core question your own interface that implements a public clone as mmyers wrote and require that c extends that as well

804130
ssl	https
suppose that moments after ssl connection is established client surfs to some other url and shortly there after it again requests via https the original page one with which it has ssl connection established

804134
getter	setter
this looks reasonable but if neither the setter nor the getter uses autorelease the go on to do something part will likely crash because oldvalue has now been deallocated assuming nobody else had retained it

804178
fast-forward	merge
if done correctly the subsequent merge from your branch to branch b can be fast-forward

804184
boost	stl
i believe this is one of the parts of boost that is going to be included in the next version of c++ at which time it will become part of the stl but right now it s a free 3rd-party library

804200
width	height
false resizable false closed false width 300px height null expandedheight 0 index -1

804209
queue	fifo
if you click on use you will also find collections.aslifoqueue deque is already a queue but it is fifo rather than a stack

804254
opera	safari
the background-size property is only supported in newer versions of safari and opera

804254
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
using this code will cause the image to stretch in css3 enabled browsers newest opera safari and possibly firefox

804265
move	drag
basically the issue is i have a flash movie which contains a text box and if the user clicks in the text box and drag to select highlight text and they drag outside the flash movie and release the mouse then the flash move doesn t receive the mouse release event and even though the mouse is up moving the cursor around the page continues to change the selected text within the flash

804311
getter	setter
i changed the supportticketcategory property to old school getter and setter and it worked...syntax sugar for loss

804348
ecj	javac
i don t claim to easily understand those complex generic types but if you find some code that compiles in javac and doesn t in ecj the eclipse compiler then file a bug report with both sun and eclipse and describe the situations cleary best if you also mention that you filed both bug reports and mention their respective urls although for sun it may take a while before the bug is publicly accessible

804348
ecj	javac
i tried to compile the sample code with javac javac 1.6.0_13 and ecj eclipse java compiler 0.894_r34x 3.4.2 release and javac complained loudly and failed to produce any .class files while ecj only complained about some unused variables warnings and produced all the expected .class files

804358
division	multiplication
the binding class has events called format and parse which you can use to perform the division the format event takes a value from the trackbar and formats it for the text box and the multiplication the parse event takes a value from the text box and scales it for the trackbar

804374
put	get
i want to get all mouse clicks on my application but i don t want to put a listener in every child component neither use windows mouse hook

804374
put	get
on flash i could put a listener on stage to get all the mouseevents on the movie

804385
paradox	dbase
back in those days the desktop database market was dominated by dbase and its variants and paradox

804403
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
this means referring to the win32 documention on wm _lbuttondown wm _mousemove wm _lbuttonup etc instead of the conventional mousedown mousemove and mouseup events

804404
typedef	struct
in that hypothetical code window is actually a typedef for a pointer to struct

804409
post	get
then you join with the post to get the information about those post

804414
sorting	filtering
extendedbindinglist is just something simple i threw together to implement sorting and filtering and some basic state persistence

804518
mouse	keyboard
save as uses the actual href value whereas selecting the link otherwise can be intercepted keyboard mouse down and up click to set the location to something else

804527
prng	random
edit added benefits of this method over uuid include extra security in the prng dev random and shorter passwords similar shortfalls

804537
jar	manifest.mf
case 2 ear contains all the application jar files on the root manifest.mf has the classpath specified manually

804560
verilog	vhdl	verilog	hdl
hdl s like verilog and vhdl really seem to encourage spaghetti code

804560
verilog	vhdl
most modules consist of several always verilog or process vhdl blocks that can be in any order

804587
vsto	add-in
i am designing a shared add-in using vb.net 2008 and vsto that has to fire up when any ms office app is started

804602
imperative	declarative
really you re just listing all the fields that need to be transferred so it closely approaches declarative programming instead of imperative

804603
udp	tcp
i m looking for a way to efficiently send receive messages over a tcp ip or udp socket stream connection

804631
ceil	floor
you can force rounding in a specific direction by using floor or ceil

804672
width	height
the child usercontrol has a set of images and basically i need to know if they have fully loaded inside the parent usercontrol since i need their dimentions for a method not just height and width

804695
free	malloc
you should allocate the data on the heap with malloc and explicitly free it with free

804710
vim	emacs	vim	textmate	emacs	textmate
the advantage of knowing emacs or textmate or vim my personal preference or any generic editor is that the skills you acquire in that editor apply regardless of what platform you re writing for

804721
ubuntu	linux
i want to know if oracle enterprise linux is the only one linux os where oracle can be installed or we can install oracle even in redhat ubuntu etc

804738
ubuntu	linux
this applies equally well to oracle where every oracle installation i ve ever used has been on solaris or a linux variant primarily red hat but also ubuntu

804755
int	boolean
a boolean isselected property a property called length which returns a timespan and a rating property which is a short int

804760
disk	ram
the office where i should programm doesn t have an internet connection at all and the hardware is a few years old intel celeron 2.63 gz 512 mb ram 80 gb hard disk

804769
addition	multiplication
you can do it in 3 lines using basic math - in my example i used multiplication but simple addition would work also

804777
for-loop	arrays
in the for-loop i is used for going through an arrays

804778
innodb	myisam
if you start a transaction add or modify data in some innodb tables add or modify data in a myisam table and then you have to rollback your myisam change cannot be removed

804824
rss	feed
it s explicitly designed to fetch and update rss atom feed

804824
rss	feed
matching entries can be difficult in lame rss feed that don t include unique guids for each entry

804826
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

804829
lxml	beautifulsoup
lxml is supposed to be much faster and efficient and can do much more than beautifulsoup

804856
outputstream	inputstream	bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
you should rather look out for in-memory implementation of outputstream inputstream such as bytearrayoutputstream with its tobytearray method or the bytearrayinputstream with the byte constructor

804881
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

804936
children	parent
be warned with using the first example if you have any children elements outside the parent element they will be hidden

804937
getter	setter
late addition i m so sorry i should have mentioned that a and b have roughly 50 methods each and all i want to do is add a single property to suba along with a getter and a setter

804975
getter	setter	inherited	properties
it will inherited the 50 methods from the parent a and you can add your additional properties to the child plus the getter and setter

805003
pull	push
at the very least you should make sure that you do not push to the currently checked-out branch but generally you shouldn t just shove your code into someone else s repository you should ask them to pull from you instead

805045

this server talks http with it s clients get and post via pyamf

805131
plink	prompt
hint you will need to set up the full public private key configuration for plink to work without an annoying password prompt

805150
mouseover	mouseout
all hover is doing behind the scenes is binding to the mouseover and mouseout property

805170
for-loop	loops
your loops is a perfectly ordinary for-loop but it no longer looks like one â it has two variables they re counting in opposite directions and one of them isn t even used in loops body â so anyone reading your code including you a week a month or a year from now when you ve forgotten the optimization you were hoping to achieve will need to spend extra effort proving to himself or herself that loops is indeed an ordinary loops in disguise

805179
mp4	h.264
i ve also read that flv s in particular have problems with audio video syncing so if you can upgrade to flash player 9 which supports mov h.264 and mp4

805187
innodb	myisam
in fact the reason to use innodb over myisam is that it will do row locking instead of table locking

805200
int	chars
however even though it contains that chars 4 you cannot add to an int without using some function to convert the string to an int type

805253
mouseleave	mouseenter
unbind the mouseenter and mouseleave events individually or unbind all events on the element s

805421
glut	glui
p.s - i did find out about glui that provides such entities but i am not allowed to use anything other than glut

805430
mouseleave	mouseenter
i d like to avoid having to use specific mouseenter and mouseleave events for all controls with a tooltip

805431
width	margin
incidentally rather than setting the text width tw to some number of characters smaller than your window you could instead set the margin you want to leave on the right side of the window like so

805438

i get the following in including macports bash tab completion to zsh

805497
jquery	scriptaculous
jquery mootools yui scriptaculous or prototype

805500
iboutlet	ibaction
that said i m not sure what you mean about losing iboutlet and ibaction references since that information is part of the xib and the class you are using in the xib not the project

805522
put	get
you also get to put all the dirtiness-checking in one place so it doesn t pollute the rest of your code

805557
pop-up	dialog
i need to pop-up my own dialog instead of default iexplorer dialog iexplorer run or save dialog window when we trying to load a file from net

805617
versioning	upgrade
in theory dtexec 2008 should also be able to run the package it should upgrade it on the fly to ssis 2008 format but there might be bugs and incompatibilities between the versioning

805692
titlebar	window
then put thumbs titlebar etc on the grid to simulate window behavior

805736
hash	md5
i would also note that in most implementations of md5 it s possible to add data into the digest function a chunk at a time and then ask for the hash at the end

805761
rss	feed
maybe you ll even want something that s not html at all like an rss feed

805788

in wpf the expanded event is on the treeviewitem itself whereas in windows forms there are several expansion events on the treeview and no events on treenode

805868
google-chrome	safari
i did not get this error in safari internet explorer or google-chrome

805879
versioning	upgrade
also if you may want to upgrade to the latest versioning i.e rails 2.3

805884
hide	show
the stoptimer method will stop this internal timer causing any displayed tooltip to be show modally until the hide method is called or the parent form is minimized hidden or closed

805892
getter	setter
and the compiler magically creates a getter and setter where the setter may just look like that

805897
client-side	server-side
you need to add server-side actionscript to handle the recording and the correct client-side actionscript to your media player.

805938
translation	localization
for translation of the resources you should look at a localization tool for instance passolo

805941
free	malloc
it is valid also with c malloc free memory functions

805998
listbox	icollectionview
i am using a wpf listbox which is databound to an icollectionview to display a list of items that can be filtered

805998
listbox	icollectionview
using the icollectionview s filter method i filter the items in the listbox based on the string that is entered in the text box which is assciated with the listbox

806104
getter	setter
i also use getter and setter for almost all of my member variables which i define private protected most of the time because setting one value triggers changes in other values very often

806104
getter	setter
one downside of creating g s is the vast amount of ugly stupid code that accumulates over time if you define getter setter even for attributes that do not trigger changes elsewhere

806121
getter	setter
i ve used the second version usually for database models in codeigniter and particularly during early development in combination with custom php5 getter and setter methods to allow you to overload the class dynamically

806135
boost	stl
with arrival of stl and development of boost parsing text happened to be extremely easy with c++

806135
boost	stl
now i use c++ with stl boost

806151
hash	md5
the hash is meant to be used for caching so i was thinking of md5 or sha1

806157
cfstring	nsstring
so for example you can create a cfstring and then send nsstring messages to it or you can create an nsarray and pass the array to cfarray functions

806163
google-chrome	firefox
it seems firefox ie7 and google-chrome don t care

806177
post	get
when you do not go through the server-based proxy service you can use only http get or post methods

806183
children	parent
be careful of children brought up by other than their natural parent

806192
width	height
oddly enough removing the width and height properties from the span allows you to click on the image

806249
gtk	cairo
as flexible as this solution is it requires a very deep knowledge of gtk cairo and everything else involved

806297
extjs	smartgwt
all three of these libraries are based on existing javascript component libraries extjs for gwt-ext and ext-gwt and smartclient for smartgwt

806316
ssl	https
your web service must be using https with the attendant ssl certificate

806319
hide	show
then show and hide them non-modally as you do a mouse-enter or -leave event

806376
mouse	keyboard
i know how to simulate mouse and keyboard events but they act as if the user did them so they will affect the window that is active

806379
getter	setter
like i understand synthesize actually is generating the getter and setter

806384
translation	localization
note a localization tool only manages translation not the original language

806410
mouse	keyboard
this class is used to generate native system input events for the purposes of test automation self-running demos and other applications where control of the mouse and keyboard is needed

806429
boost	stl
i am already experienced with template usage stl boost poco and writing template classes methods

806444
nsstring	nsdata	cfstring	nsstring	cfstring	nsdata
essentially it boils down to the fact that you can cast between corefoundation and nextstep classes of the same name cfstring - nsstring cfdata - nsdata cfdictionary - nsdictionary.

806454
width	height
you would get the right width height values from xml

806458
hash	salt
note that a good password hash function not only includes salt it also applies the hash function several thousand times

806463
memcached	apc
maybe a memory cache like apc or memcached see also this comment to the session_set_save_handler function

806464
pascal	delphi
it s free it s totally easy to use it s open source pascal delphi it can install your apps in a fraction of a second it just works

806473
int	boolean
will give you a boolean true if the context item is an int false otherwise

806481
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in particular ones that are lightweight can display images and fast like google-chrome safari 4 or firefox was pre 1.5 - although it s not a prerequisite

806482
getter	setter
synthetize can be seen as a macro that creates the getter and setter methods

806483
width	height
q jqmodal go form qblh width 781 height 400

806498
versioning	upgrade
the obvious solution is to upgrade the server or downgrade my development machine so the versioning numbers to match

inherited	base-class
adding an abstract method to a base-class that is inherited in the second dll

806533
sharepoint	spsite

hi i want to pop-up my own dialog on save button of file download dilaog of iexplorer

806572
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in particular ones that are lightweight can display images and fast like google-chrome safari 4 or firefox was pre 1.5 - although it s not a prerequisite

806631
inherited	properties
i think your best approach would be to inherited each control and set its default display properties

806664
getter	setter
the use of getter and setter makes since on the properties that need to be changeable to the calling code

806664
getter	setter	public	protected
the getter setter pattern doesn t make sense with public properties obviously but it does with protected and private properties which may need some validation or to be sanitized

806753
mouse	keyboard
to relieve pain - i ve never had pain from the keyboard but i get tendinitis from the mouse

806764
mouse	keyboard
anytime you re about to use the mouse forcibly stop yourself and look up the keyboard shortcut for that operation

806774
mouse	keyboard
as long as you can t reach for the mouse without thinking about it then you will find that it is easier to use keyboard shortcuts instead

806774
mouse	keyboard
essentially you want the mouse to be an option but the keyboard to be a better easier more convenient one

806795
vim	emacs
switch to vim or emacs for code editing or use viemu if you really need the intellisense

806822
fgets	fgetc
reading input from stdin is a little trickier but all it really involves is essentially using some of the file reading functions fgets fgetc fscanf and passing in stdin as the file path or php stdin depending on how new your version of php is

806904
put	get
if you forgot to put int bands in foo.obj you d get a linker error and have to go resolve it

806907
put	get
if you are not using votive then you can put the wix xsd into visual studio xsd repository to get intelisense

807010
mouse	keyboard
i know how to simulate mouse and keyboard events but they act as if the user did them so they will affect the window that is active

807033
range	max
if the reult so far is between max 7 and max-1 then the result will be uniformly distrubuted in that range

807058
hide	show
having or hide in the load event will cause your form to show briefly as there is time between when it becomes physically visible and when the load event gets fired in spite of the fact that the documentation says the contrary

807068
superclass	subclassing
what the tech lead is likely thinking is that the factory pattern is to replace a constructor in the same object not to return subclassing or perhaps only return subclassing from a superclass not from an unrelated object

807082
shadowing	named
if it refuses to compile because of one variable shadowing another of the same named it isn t a real c compiler

807092
caliburn	prism
i ve also seen mention of prism composite application guidance and caliburn

807156
disk	ram
it may be physical ram or virtual memory paged away on some hard disk

807216
slug	permalinks
i would store the slug in the database for the simple reason that slug usually form part of a permalinks and once a permalinks is out in the wild it should be considered immutable

807252
implements	extends
basically you create a class which extends the jplugin class and implements the method with this header

807260
httphandler	httpmodule
you can write a httpmodule to grab all the the axd js files from the response combine them into one and send them to the client s browser through a request to an httphandler

807289
client-side	server-side
there s another library out there specifically for asp.net mvc applications that provides both server-side and client-side validation called xval

807310
mouse	keyboard
you ll see your productivity drop during the learning curve but jump way up after as you save a lot of time by not moving your hand of the keyboard to use the mouse

807336
profiling	debugging
whilst the profiling is v cool - it doesn t help debugging when the system throws an exception

807385
for-loop	arrays
i m trying to get an if statment that says if my points arrays at i initialized in a for-loop is equal to the x and y of a circle which is set to smallcircle.x and smallcircle.y

807387
width	margin
assuming margin 0 auto then the element should be centered but the width is left as-is--whatever it is calculated to be disregarding any margin settings

807388
getter	setter
property declares getter and or setter

807401
inherited	properties
they have no common properties which is why they have no need to inherited from some base class

807442
folder	directory
somewhere under var maybe or just a folder that s set to in one person s home directory

807465
redhat	fedora
redhat is one of the easiest distros for installing oracle but there are some differences between the different versions of redhat and the different versions of fedora core too so search for the right step by step document of you don t have any experience in the setup process

807472
cldc	midp
as with all generic javame vm s you will not be able to access internal api s hardware which is not accessible from within the standard cldc midp libraries the javavm you are using supports

807494
havok	physx
it d still be my pick after the big 2 havok and physx

807577
for-loop	loops
if this is the only thing your for-loop is doing you can write the whole loops like this

807647
submit	submission
to get around the d property problem in the object that has to be returned by the submission web method handle the click event of the submit button and push the data to the server by directly calling your web method

807812
implements	extends
the custom controls extends one of the wpf control base classes and provide additional functionality through code so all the added logic and representation must be implements inside the code

807864
udp	tcp
c# and c++ both support tcp and udp network connections in many flavors

807866
pop-up	dialog
however when the user first runs the app a sql authentication dialog box pop-up asking the user for a username and password to the requested database

807871
edifact	x12
i m looking for at least one sample file each in edifact and x12 that show

807871
edifact	x12
the edifact one should include the data wrapped in uno unp segments and the x12 one needs to use one of the binary segments bin or bds

807892
for-loop	loops
the issue is that if i call it once i get a random string if i call it again in a for-loop for example i get the same string for the entire execution of loops

807896
int	double
interlocked.exchange only works on reference types there are different overloads for int long intptr float and double

807949
calloc	malloc
calloc is like malloc but initializes the allocated memory with a constant 0

807963
free	malloc
malloc only allocates some memory free deletes memory allocated by malloc

807963
calloc	malloc
calloc does the same thing as malloc and also zeroizes the newly allocated memory

807963
free	malloc
as other posts have pointed out malloc free is part of c++ to be compatible with c

807966
realloc	malloc
the main difference between new and malloc i can recall is that you cannot reallocate memory allocated by new using realloc

807966
calloc	malloc
calloc allows you to initialize the memory block you allocate while malloc does not

807969
calloc	malloc
calloc is the same as malloc except for it clears memory to all bits zero

807970
free	malloc
malloc free + family

807970
free	malloc
malloc free family is the c way to allocate and free memory from the heap

807970
calloc	malloc
calloc is the same as malloc but also initializes the memory

807970
free	malloc
data cannot be allocated with malloc and free with delete nor delete

807979
put	get
the above is a breadth first search which is considered the best for huffman trees since items that are in the source more often are higher up in the tree to get better compression however i can t figure out a good way to keep track of how we got to a particular node without backtracking using the head pointer i put in the node

807991
ienumerable	ienumerator
i cannot come up with an implementation of ienumerable that would not be able to supply an efficiently cloneable ienumerator vectors linked lists etc

808026
for-loop	loops
you have to loops over the data with a normal for-loop and then you can modify the collection but you must be careful to correctly update the current index if you insert or remove elements

808065
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
perhaps you ought to use svcutil.exe or wsdl.exe to generate proxy class files

808111
button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
add button adds one checkbox two textboxes and one dropdownlistfor to a new line on my page

808111
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
the controls that are created dynamically all need to fire the same event when checked for checkbox also for selected index changes for dropdownlistfor

808122
haskell	scheme
to understand c# and f# sequences you need to look at lists in haskell not lists in scheme

808159
free	malloc
the only reason to do so that i can think of would be a poorly constructed api which expected you to pass in malloc d memory because it would be doing the free

808167
free	malloc
if the memory is to be released by free in your or someone elses code it s pretty darn required to use malloc

808203
cvs	svn	perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
try cvs svn or even something paid like perforce

808247
dictionary	map
i d use some type of a map dictionary maybe and keep track of the insertion order yourself as the actual data

808348
getter	setter
for some reason in other types of programming languages like java i have no problem with using setter and getter for every single variable but when i m programming in php probably because it is so flexible it feels kind of like a waste of time

808355
implements	extends
try extends picturebox to implements your interface

808361
implements	sealed
if the class you re interested in creating an interface for is not sealed then your could create a new class and inherit from the non-sealed class implements the interface

808361
implements	sealed
if it were sealed and i don t think picturebox is you d probably want to build a wrapper class that implements the interface that you re interested in and contains a picturebox control exposing only the members that you re interested in

808365
getter	setter
the point of getter or setter is that you can still add logic to your modifications of the field in one place instead of everyplace you want to modify or retrieve the field

808369
sorting	filtering
this means we re limiting the functionality a fair bit no drill down sorting advanced filtering and only one table worth of data

808389
getter	setter
using them you can easily merge all getter setter function in only 2 functions

808396
post	get
for the auto-login to the .net app assuming it s asp.net i would have the vb6 application login process write a session guid to the database and use it as a get or post variable when building a link to the .net application

808399
accessor	properties	subclass	accessor
the main problem with not using properties accessor is that if you find out you ever need to change a field to a properties later on â to make it a computed properties in a subclass for instance â youâ ll break clients of your api

808399
getter	setter
this arguably makes using getter and setter mechanically fairly easy

808423
getter	setter
if you access these variable in your script lots of time and if you update yoru class often you should use setter and getter because but if you dont this when you improve your class you have to update all files which uses this variable

808470
free	calloc
you are free to write a wrapper over new or even use calloc but most of the time for non-pod objects this doesn t make much sense

808487
implements	extends
the port class i am instantiating extends com.sun.xml.rpc.client.stubbase and implements javax.xml.rpc.stub and com.sun.xml.rpc.spi.runtime.stubbase

808490
getter	setter
i am probably not going to get many upvotes on this one but personally getter and even more so setter feel like a code smell to me

808490
getter	setter
but yes property like getter and setter are a step up from a dependency on a field directly for this very reason

808514
width	height
in that case s is the fractional component of the total width of the quadrilateral at t t is likewise the fractional component of the total height of the quadrilateral at s

808516
maven	pom.xml
but isn t the whole point of dependency management that maven sees b goes to the b pom.xml file where it sees the dependency on a and so it should go build a automatically

808569
mouse	keyboard
i should mention that the selectedindexchanged event fires properly on when an item is selcted via keyboard or mouse input

808626
vim	emacs
of course vim and emacs is available for everything

808667
firefox	safari
also besides the firefox extensions you have the safaritidy plugin for safari which will check all your tags

808688
post	get
the obvious thing to do is get the eventqueue and post events to it

808688
opera	safari
someone claimed yesterday the opera and safari do their own thing and don t give the required permission to untrusted code

808693
put	get
i would suggest rather then arguing against it being installed suggest that they put in place the correct exclusion rules so databases and processes which are extremelly unlikely to get viruses aren t scanned

808701
ironruby	ironpython
and here is a page dedicated to an example answering your very question albeit in a generic dlr-centric way -- this would allow you to host ironpython ironruby or whatever dlr languages you want to support

808716
nginx	lighttpd
have a light weight http server for static content nginx or lighttpd

808850
hide	show
so when javascript was first released a technique was needed to hide the code from older browsers so they wouldn t show it as text in the page

808862
uilabel	uibutton	uiview	subviews
what you might want to do is override the touchesbegan withevent method of the uiview that contains your uibutton and uilabel subviews

808884
post	get
i m not sure we ll get this functionality in wix v3.5 with burn but it is on our list for burn post v3.5

808889
glut	sdl
i have never used glut but i know that many people will say sdl is better

808932
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
are not longer really that much in use i try to use features which work in all those browsers firefox 2 ie 7 google-chrome opera

808939
int	double
by flat i mean the most complex property you can have in a business object is a string and a number int decimal double

808963
subtract	add
i am looking for a function that will add or subtract a distance from a longitude or latitude value

809016
pop-up	dialog
when the input file get focus it should be read only or the browser should pop-up a dialog to choose some file

809118
int	chars
under 200 rows perhaps 15 fields mostly int with a couple of 20 chars varchars

809170
hash	salt
to do it properly you could send a secure hash of your bid + a random salt

809235
hide	show
basically i have a detailsview dependent on what query it is i have certain boundfields i d like to show or hide

809244
integer	unsigned
is better because 0xffffffff assumes that unsigned int is a 32-bit integer

809248
inherited	subclassing
if you look at c++ the compiler can do all sorts of fancy stuff like generate subclassing via recursion probably compute a fractal inherited graph as well as computing the numbers of pi on the fly

809281
multiplying	add
multiplying max-bid by a rather large random number if you want to use base64 encoding in the last step max-rand should be 2 24 max-bid -1 and min-rand perhaps half of that then add a-bid

809307
uilabel	uifont	uilabel	uitextview	uifont	uitextview
now in your application you can simply call uifont fontwithname customfontname size 15 to get the custom font to use with your uilabel and uitextview etcâ

809309
hide	show
so i don t just want to hide and show and panels

809313
post	get
in addition set io statistics on to get an idea of how many reads your query will generate i especially love azder s post

809317
kerberos	ntlm
i have done this and even restarted firefox and when i browse to the above sites on our lan i still get prompted for username and password and even when i supply them and the web page is loaded i have some code in the app which displays the authentication method in effect and it is still ntlm not kerberos as when ie is used

809380
memcached	apc
content delivery networks intel ssds sprites combining images to save requests page compression gzip deflate memcached apc bytecode cache for php minifying and merging of multiple css and js files conscious handling of http status codes not changed separation of static and dynamic content different servers domains step-by-step loading via ajax important content first .

809432
vim	emacs
the editors komodo edit emacs vim and epsilon give you the power to define almost any kind of syntax highlighting

809439
bitarray	bitset
if you re using c# you have a bitarray class with the necessary operations and in java you have a bitset class

post	get
if you want an event fired after the page has loaded this is usually called a post back and there are some specific ways to get that event fired off in asp.net if you look at say the button control and its on_click event

809466
vim	emacs
vim and emacs are fast and have lots of features including syntax highlighting

809488

if i don t get a resolution before then i ll post the answer back here once i get it

809500
pop-up	dialog
the link needs another attribute target _blank and the next page will appear in a pop-up dialog

809501
gif	png	tiff	png
if you have the original image as jpeg png tiff gif or any other sampled image reduce the original file size with whatever tools you have then convert to eps using sam2p

809502
put	get
if i put the jpg in it s own directory then i d have to read that directory and just get the one and only file in it and use that in the xsl

809546
extjs	qooxdoo
i ve heard and used some of the libraries like extjs qooxdoo jquery ui dijit

809577
rss	feed
i m trying to do a curl call to an rss feed from a wordpress i m not using simplexml_load_file because it s forbiden by php.ini to do such calls so i m trying to get the xml via curl so far it works for any url but not for wordpress rss feed even if they are on the same server

809598
min	max
avg count sum min max grouping

809616
stdout	stderr
the reason why your program hangs is that the read function waits for the daemon to write something to its stdout stderr

809616
stdout	stderr
if the daemon including the child process of your program and also the child process forked children who keep their stdout stderr doesn t write anything and there is at least one process holding the writable end of the pipe open read will never return

809699
nsstring	nsdata
property lists are similar to json and can only store specific types of data -- nsstring nsnumber nsdata nsdate nsarray nsdictionary

809737
ironruby	ironpython
i d be interested to hear from anyone that has had success writing tests for a .net project in ironruby or ironpython

809744
joomla	phpbb	wordpress	phpbb	wordpress	joomla

809755
codeigniter	kohana
codeigniter and kohana a codeigniter descendent are ok but also loosely mvc

809765
rss	feed
there are many rss feed that contain invalid xml usually because they were hacked together on the server side using html templates by somebody who didn t understand xml

809845
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
be advised that in mysql identifiers are case-insensitive on windows but case-sensitive on linux

809857
folder	directory
1 you try to move the directory folder

809857
folder	directory
if abcde is an existing directory it will move folder into abcde

809943
subtract	add
that is to say the decision to add or subtract a tet s contribution is only questionable when the tet wasn t going to contribute anything anyway

809946
gif	png
i ve just had a go at loading jpeg png and gif

809951
put	get
you can put a sql join condition which returns all the votes on comments made by the current user for this object if you get no rows the user hasn t voted

809968
mousemove	mousehover	mousemove	mouseleave	mousehover	mouseleave
why not subscribe to the mousemove events in the mousehover event then unsubscribe in the mouseleave event

809968
mousemove	mouseleave
the reason for removing the mousemove events on mouseleave would allow you to only receive events while the mouse is over your control

809977
hide	show
edit forgot that the show hide animations happened asynchronously so you need to use a callback on the fade out to trigger the rest.

809982
yourkit	jprofiler
then you can take advantage of jprofiler yourkit etc

809991
cassini	iis
it works just fine on my local machine cassini and iis 7

810013
for-loop	arrays
edit oh i see when you re referencing the arrays in the for-loop it doesn t know that the arrays has prodid and name indices

810051
free	malloc
again this is how it s often implemented not how new delete malloc or free are required to be implemented

810066
mouseleave	mouseenter
okay in response to your comment basically you have to unbind the mouseenter and mouseleave events before you use scrollto

810068
mouse	keyboard
no windows are shown no response to mouse or keyboard including ctrl-alt-end

810069
switching	screens
screens is acting as a terminal emulator inside a terminal emulator and it s just not possible for screens to switching the scrollback buffer in terminal.app whenever you switching between screens

810106
inherited	properties
i also like to use enum value chaining when there is a concept that spans multiple classes in an inherited hierarchy such as enums representing fields properties in a class

810111
pop-up	dialog
to do that go to c c++ - additional include directories press the ... button and in the pop-up dialog press macros

810120
mouse	keyboard
and lets you keep your hands on the keyboard more instead of jumping from keyboard to mouse all the time

810177
boost	stl
the library is written in c++ using stl and boost libraries

810193
addition	multiplication
well we know it is the first one because of precedence - the binary multiplication operator has higher precedence than the binary + addition operator and is resolved first

810194
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have a main view that manually creates a uiviewcontroller not a uinavigationcontroller and adds that controller s view as a subview

810197
inherited	properties
this class is inherited by another class d that adds another public properties

810201
int	chars
your enemy constructor should actually call the int int int chars base constructor to set the sym member

810202
pascal	delphi
delphi free pascal

810223
int	double
to do it just put your int double floats etc

810275
post	get
i imagine that page load would be slow if you have cascading drop-downs and your initial page load populates one value that causes a post to get the next list set that value another post to get the next list again and so on

810296
getter	setter
getter and setter are just syntactic sugar for get_ and set_ methods

810306
post	get
if the .bat file is there but you still get an ioexception opening it from you .java application then please post the code snippet triggering the ioexception and please give a full listing of file.zip get the listing by extracting file.zip to c testdir and running dir s c testdir in the command line

810330
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
i can t say what it would take to generate thumbnails and use them as icons but there are several extensions that makes use of graphicsmagick imagemagick to render thumbnails

810409
haskell	sml	haskell	ocaml	haskell	scheme	sml	scheme	ocaml	sml	ocaml	scheme	erlang	sml	erlang	ocaml	erlang	scheme
after looking at scheme erlang haskell ocaml and sml i ve settled on either haskell or standard ml

810409
haskell	sml
both haskell and sml have pattern matching which makes describing a recursive algorithm a cinch

810409
haskell	sml
essentially sml and haskell are roughly equivalent

810422
hide	show
i understand how to hide and show elements i dont know how to make its toggle status be persistent throughout the site

810450
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
that s why releasing linux programs in binary always screwed up unless bound to some distro like ubuntu debian or rh

810455
micro-optimization	benchmarking
edit see bottom of post for benchmarking on different micro-optimization of the method

810491
textmate	notepad++
simply run the files through the handy online textmate theme to notepad++ styler tool

810495
nullreferenceexception	objectdisposedexception
mostly objectdisposedexception and nullreferenceexception

810511
x86	64bit
this is possibly in addition to giving the source code to them. most statically linked binaries work on most linux distributions of the same architecture + 32-bit x86 statically linked binaries work on 64bit amd64

810511
ubuntu	debian	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	debian
if the .so file works only on debian ubuntu and red hat because you don t have time time to port the file to more distributions you ll most probably upset your suse and gentoo users and more

810550
pop-up	dialog
the main problem i am having is suppressing the save as dialog that the microsoft xps document writer pop-up

810550
pop-up	dialog
i can make those calls on the xps document writer fine but when it come times to complete the printing the xps writer pop-up the save as dialog box

810568
google-chrome	safari
but the same button is not showing up in safari google-chrome webkit

810570
jikes	javac
if you are using ant as build system you can easily switch between jikes and javac

810574
jikes	javac
jikes was very compelling in the jdk 1.3 days when the javac compiler was awe-inspiringly slow

810612
short	base
in short you ll create the base vm copy it s virtual hard drive to a safe place then manually generate new vms using the initial hard drive as a base

810618
queue	fifo
a fifo fifo structure is known as a queue which is what you need for the ability to pop the oldest items off the back

810625
pseudo-class	visited
you can use css to style the a visited pseudo-class

810634
hash	md5
basing the hash either md5 or sha on the time makes it guessable if the user knows roughly when the directory is generated

810636
folder	directory
iis can often put you in a temporary directory so it may have copied all your files over to this temp folder but none of the subdirs so there simply are none

810657
integer	unsigned
the fact that i m using floats shouldn t matter since they can be considered as unsigned integer after inverting the sign bit

810701
versioning	upgrade
obviously you could always start in 3.0 and when you really need 3.5 upgrade your project to the newer versioning by that time that could also be versioning 4.0 ofcourse

810707
translation	localization
but whenever i write localization code in php and have to translation some strings primarily in russian i have to open notepad to translation all the entries

810815
versioning	upgrade
then i don t need to upgrade my jquery to newer versioning with the risk that the website doesn t work well anymore

810843
pascal	delphi
any modern pascal variant delphi will let you create dynamic runtime sized arrays

810872
mp3	ogg
i am looking for a library to read meta data from compressed and uncompressed audio files mp3 ogg etc.

810920
post	put
or your languages equivalent on the post value of the output of webhtmleditor before you put it into the database to ensure that it will not throw up any errors in the sql query

810950
vsto	add-in
the add-in does not use vsto technology and supports excel xp and higher

810984
int	chars
also to add the chars at a certain index of a string can be retrieved by using the charat int method and the unicode code point can be retrieved by the codepointat int method

810995
quicksort	heapsort
for those interested sort uses an introsort quicksort which switches to heapsort when the recursion reaches a certain depth and stable_sort uses a merge sort

811073
freepascal	fpc
there s fpcunit an implementation to xunit for freepascal i m not sure if it s compatible with dunit but i read at fpc fourms they are doing improvement to make it compatible with dunit

811137
inherited	properties
should i create a class that inherited from a membershipuser and extend it with my own properties and methods and save this in a seperate table

811155
ironruby	ironpython
and if you don t like using vb or c# you could even branch out and use ironruby and ironpython as well and pick up some new languages along the way

811157
firefox	safari
silverlight requires only the silverlight player which is available for ie firefox and safari and works on windows and osx and is much smaller than the full .net framework in terms of download size

811200
firefox	safari
ie 6 7 8 firefox 3 safari

811221
hash	md5
in php you could do it with one line with an md5 hash on a string of length 20 - 500 it should be pretty fast

811248
jtextfield	jfilechooser
however i would like to add the ability for a user to drag-and-drop a file onto this jtextfield and have it place the file path of that file into the jtextfield instead of always having using the jfilechooser

811264
public	protected
also if start is protected you will have to create some sort of public method that calls it

811266
set	bag
on my supportticket class i have an ilist supportticketnotes property and have it mapped as a bag probably really should be a set but that s not important at the moment

811275
width	height
if you don t specify any width or height to the canvas it automatically uses all the available space

811275
width	height
in that case just remove the hardcoded height width values and the canvas will resize to fit the container

811275
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
you might need to use actualheight actualwidth instead of height width in the drawing algorithm after this though

811275
actualheight	actualwidth
actualheight actualwidth return the values that the layout container will give your canvas so these represents the values the canvas is drawn with

811277
addition	multiplication
multiplication addition and bitwise rotating would be much better

811279
disk	ram
d if you really want to minimize the ram used maybe you want to use your disk sort the words you can use the disk if dont have enough ram and create a temporary file with the words one after another that would do for sequential access

811292
for-loop	arrays
this however comes at the cost of computing the hash in constructor of binary objects by traversing the arrays with for-loop -

811361
integer	unsigned
i want to set a fourcc value in c++ an unsigned 4 byte integer

811370
hide	show
the complexity of when to show hide things when to process input from which fields is way too much

811375
entity-relationship	diagram
maybe this can help you entity-relationship diagram building software

811392
getter	setter
in java we have something called javabeans properties but that is basically a instance variable that follows a certain naming pattern for its getter and setter

811478
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i am a newbi in iphone development.i want to build an app which will have a uiviewcontroller first which will have a button.now on clicking the button it shud load a uinavigationcontroller

811478
uiview	subviews
i know how to build a navigationcontroller project from window-based app but i am having a tough time doing navigationcontroller as a subviews of uiview

811479
set	bag
in your course object you need to set the cascade option on what i presume will be a bag or similar with a one-to-many inside

811515
put	get
when i put print statements before each value i get blanks in both cases but if the print statements come after the increment has been applied i get a value of 1 depending on how many ipv6 resources the organization has

811544
pascal	delphi
the class was mostly focused on programming with pascal so delphi was a good next step

811550
put	get
the internal form is an object having get and opt methods for accessing the values by name and put methods for adding or replacing values by name

811586
google-chrome	firefox
works in ie firefox and google-chrome as far as i can tell

811636
getter	setter
properties are shortcuts to getter setter methods that look just like an instance variable

811691
folder	directory
the other per-application folder contain shortcuts to the executable in that directory

811702
set	bag
many valued end the set or bag

811704
crossover	mutation
i have had some success increasing the diversity of population by setting mutation and crossover from a couple of the genes from the parent chromosomes

811704
crossover	mutation
the smaller reproduction chromosome had a sensible fixed rates for mutation and crossover

811704
crossover	mutation
as an aside i tend to do both crossover and mutation for each child

811734
validationsummary	customvalidator
my problem is the validationsummary never shows the message from customvalidator

811797
firefox	safari
firefox on mac indeed understands it but safari does not

811800
treemap	treeset
treemap treeset

811801
sml	curry
sml has what you call implicit curry syntax as well

811801
haskell	sml
essentially sml and haskell are roughly equivalent

811801
haskell	sml
i like using haskell much more than sml but i would still teach sml first

811801
haskell	sml
because sml is eagerly evaluated the execution model is far easier to comprehend and debugging via printf works a lot better than in haskell

811801
haskell	sml
while your class likely wouldn t use them anyways haskell s typeclasses are still an extra bump to get over -- getting them to understand the a versus a distinction in sml is tough enough

811832
cvs	svn	perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
cvs svn perforce git all adhere to this

811832
cvs	svn
this was a confusing situation in cvs which svn fixed by allowing options specified in any order

811833
children	parent
i d like the ability to have an arbitrary level of nesting children of the same parent element

811836
kde	gnome
that would be the standard controls on windows cocoa on the mac and on linux it should ideally use either gtk or qt depending on the desktop being gnome or kde

811845
put	get
however when i try to put the object into the database i get

811856
multiplying	add
pick a number between 9 and 99 and multiplying it by 9999 then add your bid

811856
multiplying	subtract
to unseal it divide by 9999 subtract the part to the left of the decimal point then multiplying by 9999

811857
strlen	substr
strlen substr etc

811926
int	chars
int memcmp const chars cs const chars ct size_t n

811937
junit	testng
testng is much friendlier to this paradigm than junit though

811951
boost	stl
i have a small single-threaded c++ application compiled and linked using visual studio 2005 that uses boost crc program_options and tokenizer a smattering of stl and assorted other system headers

811974
wtl	atl
i want to add support for searching for local outlook contacts to my atl wtl app

811990
versioning	upgrade
it will run fine side-by-side with your upgrade versioning vs2008

812014
rss	feed
rss feed

812027
width	height
my current approach is to set font size as a function of the number of text characters and the text components height and width but i can t find the right coefficients to make this work nicely

812035
integer	unsigned
i ve now changed the methods to take and return uint unsigned 32-bit integer instead - this is also in greater accordance with the c++ rotl and rotr functions

812049
width	height
most require some structure list constant width height items

812079
width	height
what i am trying to do is show a window that does not explicitly have a height width both values omitted or set to auto

812161
gentoo	linux
i use python 2.5 for all my development work but only because it s the version that happens to be available in gentoo linux s package repository

812185
getter	setter
i am not sure but i think that if i call self.myinstancevariable then it uses automatically getter setter but if i would call directly myinstancevariable foo for example then i would bypass any getter setter which would be really really reeeaaallly bad

812185
getter	setter
like you see you must use self.instancevariablename in order to use the getter and setter or you do the call in brackets works too

812185
getter	setter
from the outside when you call someobjectpointer.someinstancevariable it will automatically access the getter and setter yep i tried that out too

812202
getter	setter
if you directly use the variable bypassing the getter setter you could create bugs

812202
getter	setter
the getter setter may be responsible for retain and or releasing the object as well as other things

812202
getter	setter
if you are aware that you are bypassing the getter setter and take the right precautions there is nothing wrong with accessing the variable directly

812255
persistent	transient
that s useful in scenarios where the state is effectively transient - webforms relies on it by default for control state - but the only way for it to actually persistent across page loads is by forcing a postback each time a request is made to the server

812255
post	get
although they can be forewarded to another page as part of a get query string or post request viewstate the browser will not by itself associate them with requests to separate pages nor will it update these states when returning to a previous page

812255
client-side	server-side
however hacks to make them work cross-page aside this per-page attachment generally makes cookies or server-side session state indexed by a client-side cookie more appropriate for holding state that is specific to a given user or session but not specific to any single page

812259
getter	setter
the only circumstance under which i would consider explicitly calling the underlying member variable directly thus bypassing the getter setter is when i have written the getter setter myself and know exactly what it is and isn t doing and 99 of those times is when i m just initializing the member in my constructor

812266
width	height
inside the overridden onitemschagned method reset the height width dependency properties on the popup using the clearvalue dp method

812266
width	height	min	max
you can clear the max and min height width properties if you are worried about those too

812350
soa	osb
on the other hand if you are looking for soa based integration osb or alsb should be good enough

812352
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
linux windows solaris freebsd

812354
terminate	timeout
you might want to consider using poll instead of take which will allow the processing thread to timeout and terminate when it has waited for a while with no new input

812384
wordpress	phpbb
as for database setup you might consider writing a setup form within your website that can be called once to initialize the database based on user input think about the setup process from popular open-source projects like wordpress or phpbb that perform a wizard-type function

812393
implements	modifiers
if the class actually implements the interface but does so explicitly and places access modifiers on the concrete implementation all you need to do is get that object in the context of the interface itself and you can use it

812402
cvs	svn	perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
there are several major source control libraries of which svn also called subversion is one cvs git hg perforce clearcase etc are others

812419
inherited	properties
the bold entries in intellisense are the members directly implemented on the class with the inherited properties and methods shown in a regular font

812457
asterisk	pbx	voip	sip
the asterisk pbx is an open-source telephony server that implements a number of voip protocols including sip

812475
mouse	keyboard
i m trying to write a game with support for joypads as well as mouse keyboard

812492
stdout	stderr
one of them is my trusty old exec 2 1 which in the bourne shell permently knots together stderr and stdout for the duration of the script so that logging will capture everything good and bad

812500
stdout	stderr
you can print the errors and standard output to a single file by using the 1 command to redirect the output for stderr to stdout and then sending the output from stdout to a file

812521
stdout	stderr
to redirect the stderr output of the script to stdout

812529
min	max
say i get 1000 member index numbers back now i want to split them into 10 equally sized groups by a max and min member index

812592
bazaar	git
i use bazaar so this might be a slightly different answer than a git user would give but

812616
google-chrome	firefox
if you try this code it looks smooth for handle 1 and 2 but not others in firefox 3 but still looks jumpy in google-chrome

812618
getter	setter
in objective c a property is an instance variable which can take advantage of an overloaded dot operator to call its setter and getter

812633
width	margin
add a 20px margin to the right of #test and increase the width of the dialog

812672
width	height
it is a server side report and the width is set to 11 inches and the height is set to 8 inches

812672
portrait	landscape
however when i display it in the report viewer control of my windows application it appears in portrait mode not landscape mode like it should

812687
portrait	landscape
i believe there is a report property you can set on the rdl that allows you so specify portrait or landscape

812701
getter	setter
also the property name ivar name and getter setter names can also all be different so you may find cases where it doesn t look like self.myinstancevar

812701
accessor	properties
also just as a side note you may or may not know this already but there s no point to synthesizing a properties if you re just going to write all the accessor methods anyway

812711
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
click here to see what i m talking about this looks best in firefox google-chrome safari

812711
put	get	post	put	post	get
that documentation gives examples of interacting with the system using http verbs such as get post put delete

812711
post	get
i have built html forms that have method post or method get and the request is sent to whatever is specified in the action attribute action someresource

812726
post	put
so you may have to use a post instead of put

812735
kerberos	ntlm	kerberos	ldap
there are settings for openid facebook connect ldap ntlm kerberos etc

812758
solaris	aix
we use mlton to compile our sml code to native code running on windows linux solaris aix and hp-ux

812764
typedef	struct
either remove the typedef keyword or create an object of type struct person somewhere in your code

812796
put	get	post	put	post	get
you can t put using an html form the spec defines only get post for forms

812796
put	get	post	put	post	get
however any http api should allow you to put in the same way that it allows you to get or post

812797
put	get	post	put	post	get
put and delete are likely to require that you use ajax and make xmlhttprequests since the form tag only supports get and post verbs and links only make get requests

812797
opera	safari
haven t tested in safari or opera

812829
multiplying	add
the cents are integers and you can freely add them together and multiplying by other integers

812842
pop-up	dialog
pop-up a dialog and tell the user they re screwed and exit the program

812849
folder	directory
however when i try to import the service namespace using the same name as the directory under the app_webreferences folder it doesn t recognize the name and gives me an error if i try to import it

812865
feedparser	beautifulsoup
the acceptable_elements attributes come from feedparser and beautifulsoup does the work

812874
gridview	linqdatasource
if your database is sql server and you re uzing .net version 3.5 i recommend using a simple gridview with a linqdatasource

812876
width	height
i have written a jquery extension that does the centering of a modalpopup which is called from an overridden ajaxcontroltoolkit.modalpopupbehavior._layout method based on the width and height of the iframe s parent so that it looks centered even though the iframe is not in the center of the page

812881
post	put
replace the method string of post with put

812892
launch4j	jsmooth
edit you could also use an executable wrapper such as jsmooth or launch4j instead of a batch file

812931
width	height
also in the example in this tutorial it reads the array in a way that is not streight-forward to me as it seems to work on a 5x3 height width y x cols rows structure instead of a 3x5 width height x y

812935
post	get
typically once uri s get unreadable because they are too long it s time to use a post request instead

812937
folder	directory
a great example which is sort of close to the situation i m working on is filesystem explorers windows explorer which show a hierarchy of folder directory and a list of objects within them

812961
getter	setter
i ve been trying to get my head around getter and setter and its not sinking in

getter	setter
i ve read javascript getter and setter and defining getter and setter and just not getting it

812961
getter	setter
what a getter and setter are meant to do and

812993
getter	setter
getter and setter are just general concepts that do exactly what the name says get a variable object and set a variable object

812993
getter	setter
i don t use getter and setter much but there are some good uses for them for example when you need to abstract out the way a variable is stored accessed

812995
viewdidload	viewwillappear
viewdidload and viewwillappear are out of the question because i don t know what s in the datasource to the picker yet

813002
getter	setter
defining getter and setter

813034
uiview	subviews
place this wherever you initialize the uiview that contains your uipickerview as a subviews

813051
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
my issue is the consistency between ie and firefox google-chrome safari

813099
getter	setter
if we re talking strictly about php here and not about c# java etc where the compiler will optimise these things i find getter and setter to be a waste of resources where you simply need to proxy the value of a private field and do nothing else

813099
getter	setter
on my setup i made two crappy classes one with five private fields encapsulated by five getter setter pairs proxying the field which looked almost exactly like java code funnily enough and another with five public fields and called memory_get_usage at the end after creating an instance

813099
getter	setter
the script with the getter setter used 59708 bytes of memory and the script with the public fields used 49244 bytes

813099
getter	setter
in the context of a class library of any significant size such as a web site framework these useless getter and setter can add up to a huge black hole for memory

813099
getter	setter
i wouldn t use it for this if i had the choice but having said that php is not imposing any insurmountable restrictions on us and when i refactored the class library to use public fields instead of getter setter the whole shebang ended up using 25 less memory per request at least

813099
getter	setter
when you need to migrate a field to a getter setter or a getter setter to a field they can make the process transparent to any dependent code

813099
getter	setter
say we have an object which was developed using fields instead of getter setter and we want to rename a field called field to fieldwithbettername because field was inappropriate or no longer described the use accurately or was just plain wrong

813099
getter	setter
getter and setter methods in php are good if the setter has to do something or if the getter has to lazy load something or ensure something has been created or whatever but they re unnecessary and wasteful if they do nothing other than proxy the field especially with a few techniques like the ones above to manage interface changes

813114
freebsd	linux
also i have access to linux and freebsd systems no windows sorry

813152
skype	voicemail
skype has a voicemail feature which sounds perfect for this and i suppose you would need a skypein number as well

813168
gridview	objectdatasource	gridview	sqldatasource	sqldatasource	objectdatasource
i am not using a sqldatasource or an objectdatasource so what is the proper way to delete a row from the gridview and the underlying data in the database

813169
post	get
to get that number i could either hold it in the post record and add subtrack when a comment is added or deleted or i could use the sql to calculate the number of comments using a query each time a user hits the page

813211
configure	libtool
ideally you ll want to use gnu autoconf automake and libtool to create configure and make scripts then distribute the library as source with the generated configure and makefile.in files

813212
addclass	removeclass
its better to use toggleclass 2 in 1 instead of addclass removeclass

813218
getter	setter
if you re referring to the actual js getter setter feature eg

813227
getter	setter
getter and setter really only make sense when you have private properties of classes

813267
post	put
i put every post request through mysql_real_escape_string and when i add a string like that 70s show it gets stored as in the mysql db

813277
inherited	subclassing
the only issue i ve had is with model inherited you always have to define the manager in model subclassing just objects querysetmanager in the subclassing even though they will inherited the queryset

813350
pop-up	dialog
i think the problem is that you are moving the pop-up and calling focus before the dialog is fully created

813424
folder	directory
this includes public folder in the user s directory

813463
microchip	avr
another note meanwhile microchip pic bought avr but i assume that for the first few years that won t affect the productlines much

813487
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

813543
xna	slimdx
basically i have checked out xna and some of slimdx promit which has lots of structs

813622
hide	show
you might consider using the hide show methods as well

813626
turbogears	cherrypy
what other frameworks are out there to consider cherrypy turbogears ror ...

813635
filtering	grouping
then you filtering out the xx strings grouping on the grouping number and filtering out the empty grouping

813646
haskell	sml
much as i love haskell here are the reasons i would prefer sml for a class in discrete math and data structures and most other beginners classes

813668
haskell	scheme
operating systems have been written in standard ml scheme and even haskell

813692
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
both git and bazaar has good support for svn

813695
versioning	upgrade
while one of these transitions is going on all the distros upgrade at their own pace you ideally want to release libs with abis supporting the full range of gcc versioning in use by your users

813755
int	double
i m able to work the examples but he doesn t explain exactly why he s using a class in that way nsnumber instead of int or double for example

813760
cpu	processors
regarding os - you still need processors that runs instructions and compiler that translates language into cpu instructions

813772
rss	feed
also i d highly recommend looking at feeder for constructing your sparkle rss feed

813773
mp3	wav
they are a sip provider and there are many libraries for sip in python - so you could set up a python application to login to your sipgate account pick up and incoming calls and dump the sound to a wav mp3 whatever

813824
inherited	properties
just inherited the old class and stick a tag properties in there

813836
int	double
as such it provides both primitive types like int and double and objects

813840
executable	upx
virus scanners that look for unknown viruses can flag upx compressed executable as having a virus

813845
freebsd	solaris
if you are using a macosx solaris or recent freebsd system you can throw a little dtrace at it

813851
treemap	treeset
treemap treeset

813864
post	get
i m pretty weak on linq to sql but i don t think you can t avoid 2 lookups since you re still going to need to subquery to get the count the sql generated would still have the subquery which this similiar post seems to validate linq version of top percent

813874
int	double
i m able to work the examples but he doesn t explain exactly why he s using a class in that way nsnumber instead of int or double for example .

813874
int	double
nsnumber is a much more useful type than a primitive type like int or double as it is often used in conjunction with other objects you ll run into as you program in cocoa

813874
int	double
for example in order to package a number as a value into a resizable array like an nsmutablearray or an associative array an instance of nsdictionary you need to turn the number primitive int double etc. into a serializable or archivable object â an nsnumber

813874
int	double
that s not to say you can t or shouldn t use int or double variables

813909
inherited	properties
you should inherited from classes that set common properties and create new classes when you define properties that could be used elsewhere

813933
bazaar	git
the python core development team just decided to switch from subversion to mercurial after a long discussion c period where git and bazaar were also considered

813968
width	height
edit given your goal and your statement that you have raize components already i should also point out that trzsizepanel handles resizing of the panel and useful events like oncanresize to determine whether you want to allow resizing to a particular new width or height

813984
doc	rtf
if the latter is what you want you could use rtf which is somewhat easier than the doc format

813993
ubuntu	linux
i ve done light rails development on both osx and linux ubuntu and i found the differences to be almost imperceptible in terms of ruby and rails.

813993
ubuntu	linux	vmware	virtualbox
a low hassle alternative for setting up a unix environment for rails development is to run one of the easier to use linux distributions like ubuntu or fedora under virtualization software like vmware virtualbox virtualpc etc

814055
happy	alex
happy yacc alex lex

814109
postgresql	mysql
i use the navicat clients for mysql and postgresql and am happy with them

814192
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
override the paint method to draw the sizing grip and override the mousedown mouseup and mousemove methods to add resizing functionality to the control

814251
implements	extends
in you case you ve said to be a valid t a class must implements comparable the keyword is extends but in practice that means extends or implements .

814251
superclass	subclassing
actually to cover more complicated situations where a subclassing s implementation of comparable is done by a superclass the more general form would be

814251
comparator	comparable
but without the implements comparable even if the compiler knows there s a method student.compareto it doesn t know that that comparator is the comparable.compareto

814277
free	malloc
generally in objective-c memory must be managed manually via either old c style malloc free or via the reference counting system of retain release

814376
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
in safari google-chrome opera and internet explorer tested in ie7 and ie8 this will return the following

814404
pop-up	dialog
alternatively the preview could be on a dialog that pop-up when you double-click

814444
button	checkbox
i have a gridview that displays items details i added two template fields one is a checkbox and the other is a textboc what i want is simply to check all the items the customer wants to buy and write down the quantity in the textbox when i click on a button i should check all rows in the gridview and when the checkbox is checked then i should compare the value in the textbox with the value in a databound field of the gridview called quantity and then carry on my order function.

814459
firefox	safari
the best way to do browser compatibility in general is to start with completely standards-based clean semantic markup that works in for example firefox 3 and safari uses xhtml and an xhtml doctype

814464
x86	64bit
it failed to run in x86 mode on my 64bit desktop

814466
x86	64bit
on x86 there are some special cases where two registers get fused when doing 64bit integer computations

814509
move	drag
i would like to know what event occurs when user move an email from a folder to another one with drag and drop or with move to folder option

814530
set	bag
depending on how you ve created your class and your mapping i think this is the only way since a set and bag mapping represent un-ordered collections in nhibernate

814578
put	get
you should get a more detailed stack trace by sending the .pdb file for that particular release to the user to be put next to the .exe and having them reproduce the crash

814603
vim	emacs
emacs vim nano

814612
vim	emacs
if you install and use either of vim or emacs you will have a text editor that can be used on any major platform now and in the future and most of the minor ones too

814629
emacs	aquamacs
from the emacs variants my personal favourite is aquamacs because it tries its darnedest to mitigate the os x vs

814647
jsr168	jsr286
jsr168 jsr286 compliant portals make it possible to create portlets in separate projects war files and to dynamically load these into a portal page

814743
lisp	smalltalk
given those things it s hard to justify spending a lot of time on languages like lisp and smalltalk although they are interesting and perhaps educational to look at

814764
vb.net	vb6
this can be done with any language which supports com delphi vb6 vb.net c# c++ ...

814773
post	put
don t put these dates on the form so they aren t set in the entity when you post the page

814811
actionscript	mxml
from a programmer s viewpoint the big difference between flash and flex is not so much which ide application you use for programming but whether you program in actionscript as only or use the flex framework and mxml to program your applications

814811
actionscript	mxml
i would say pure actionscript is better for programming whether you use flash ide or flex ide is not that relevant and mxml is better for non-programmers to combine the components programmed in as

814905
facade	mediator
all updates are effectively done on new copies that must go through some sort of mediator or facade that only updates the local in memory copies with the updates after updating across the cluster or the minimum number of members across the cluster for data consistency

814905
facade	mediator
terracotta again for java solves a lot of this for you - just update the memory - terracotta is your facade mediator here

814905
put	get
if i get time later i will tidy up maybe put some more detail in fix spelling grammar etc

814924
put	get
to get access to the lifecyclelistener i had to put a public static method that would execute the actions desired

814929
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
full js support via browsers firefox google-chrome safari ie

814929
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
selenium webdriver - full support for javascript via browsers firefox ie google-chrome safari opera

815002
qspinbox	qpushbutton
i have an app with a qpushbutton and a qspinbox

815034
salt	md5
3 use an update query to update each row s new column with an md5 of the unencrypted password while using a 32 byte or larger salt

815047
memcached	apc
so you could for example be using apc for increased execution performance while using memcached for cache storage

815048
memcached	apc
memcached is a distributed caching system whereas apc is non-distributed - and mainly an opcode cache

815049
radiobuttonlist	requiredfieldvalidator
if all the radio buttons are part of the same radiobuttonlist you can use a simple requiredfieldvalidator

815062
int	boolean
the qspinbox setvalue expects an int and converts the input boolean to 0 or 1 as the case maybe and your spinbox increments by only 1 unit

815120
mouseleave	mouseenter
with jquery events if you want the event to apply to new elements you would use the .live method however jquery 1.3 doesn t support blur focus mouseenter mouseleave change submit events as live events

815128
onsubmit	onblur
you could just call the forms onsubmit function through an onblur handler

815143
width	height
in a grid every cell in a column has the same width and every cell in a row has the same height typically anyway

815176
hash	md5
hashlib is new for 2.5 so if you must use an earlier python your hash choices are the older md5 and sha modules.

815238
pop-up	dialog
for example if you want to do a lookup you can pop-up a dialog rather than navigate away from the current page

815239
width	height
setting the initial-frame-alist with appropriate height width

815261
pop-up	dialog
when i set the returning respond type to json firefox will pop-up a dialog asking how i like to handle the returning json object

815297
hash	salt
solution use a user salt to make hash input more complex and over 50chars so that they will never be able to generate a table way to big for strings that size

815306
wordpress	phpbb
it s very possible to gain access to local files through exploits in php programs so keep any third-party applications you re running on their latest versions especially very widespread programs like wordpress and phpbb and do whatever you can to ensure that your server is running the correct versions of its services php apache etc.

815313
hash	md5
my first attempt at this was by using md5 hash

815355
rainbowtable	hash
the only thing that i have come up with is that you can re-hash a hash several thousand times and increase the time it would take to create the final rainbowtable by a factor of 1 000.

815378
int	chars
classes are very complex and mostly very large types compared to value types like structs or basic types -- int chars etc. since stack allocation should be specialized on the efficiency of program flow it is not serving an optimal environment to keep large objects

815379
super	implements
for admin or other super accounts implements a second mean of verification limit logins to certain ip ranges use client-side-ssl certificates etc

815381
hash	md5
if you did want to use a hash md5 would be my first choice as well 16 bytes followed by sha-1 20 bytes

815382
folder	directory
2 try copying the whole directory to your iis s root folder usually wwwroot common error that iuser iwam does not have rights to read the other folder

815386
hash	salt
solution use a user salt to make hash

815390
postgresql	mysql
mysql or postgresql which are

815412
hide	show
i would still like to let the user show and hide the toolbar but i do not want them to be able to select a different display mode small icons no icons etc

815454
free	malloc
any os which supports fork will also automatically free allocations from malloc when a process exits regardless of how it does so including termination

815454
pthreads	fork
but those environments aren t pthreads and won t support fork

815482
width	height
following is the last function called in my .emacs files it sets the height and width of the screen it does work on both emacs 22 and emacs 23 on debian and mac os x

815482
width	height
set the height and width numbers according to your screen

815562
mouse	keyboard
this lets me share one mouse and keyboard across the two machines and the clipboard is also shared across the machines

815588
width	height
i believe the problem is you aren t setting a width and height for the image somehow redundant for embedded images

815588
width	height
if you specify an image you must explicitly set a height and width of the image or else it will not appear

815588
width	height
if you define a width and a height for the image proxy in your example it will probably work

815609
titlebar	window
the wm_ncactivate message is sent to a window to change the state of its non-client area border and titlebar to inactive or active

815622
hash	md5
i d like random-looking ids md5 hash but i also want them to be small

815622
hash	md5
the basis of an id is an md5 hash of the following string user-email-address | latest-counter-value

815622
hash	md5
the resulting md5 hash is then truncated initially to four characters

815622
hash	md5
md5 hash for new ids will now be truncated at length characters rather than four characters

815657
mouse	keyboard
when i m home it s attached to a 21-inch monitor and a full keyboard and mouse

815657
vim	emacs
however with screen and emacs or vim if you swing that way you can have a fully-fledged development environment anywhere with internet access

815694
phpmyadmin	heidisql
heidisql similar to phpmyadmin

815726
put	get
actually it s not even clear how you get the data in the first place but i assume it s gdirections.getsteps or something similar. so then when the load event happens you can create the new window then put the steps data in it

815744
versioning	upgrade
the msi file seem to work ok it installs it uninstalls it upgrade when i increase the versioning number etc

815761
feedback	review
thus far we ve had 3 full security review for the gallery 2.x products and 1 security review for the gallery 3.x product in that case we did the review while was in alpha because we wanted feedback about vulnerabilities as soon as possible

815831
subclass	abstract-class
the abstract-class doesn t even know if it gets a subclass

815888
siteminder	openam	opensso	openam	opensso	siteminder
it s a shame your client wants to use ca siteminder - the open source openam formerly known as opensso does this pretty easily

815896
hide	show
i ve changed it for hide show so i don t have to use live also in the first function

815925
inherited	properties
there is also another option for this trick which uses no inherited and an attached properties if you d like

815932
implements	extends
but if you have a hierarchy like yy extends xx and xy implements yy the compiler can infer the correct method to call

815971
chunked	transfer-encoding
as for the content length you can try just leaving this value off or try to figure out a way to use transfer-encoding chunked you can t jsut send this header you need to format the data specially for it

816008
strtol	atof	strtol	atoi	atoi	atof
for the secondary question look for atoi atof strtol 0 strtof functions

816011
bash	zsh
i m not familiar with the zsh syntax but in bash you can press ctrl-z to pause the currently running job and return to the command line and resume a job with fg n where n is the job number you want to resume

816028
swt	swing
consolidated and java usually don t go together but aside from that there is pivot thinlet swing and swt

816053
strtol	atof	strtol	atoi	atoi	atof
as for converting a string to an integer float in addition to atoi strtol atof strtof etc

816080
jsf	tapestry
some web frameworks like tapestry and jsf java server faces are a little more like html views with extra tags

816094
freemarker	velocity
freemarker or velocity are the solutions to use if you simply require template based rendering

816094
freemarker	velocity
at its most simplistic and clearly this will not scale for large systems you can have the same servlet service all requests and choose a velocity freemarker template and populate the required context and render the template

816170
ilist	ienumerator	ilist	icollection	ienumerator	icollection
icollection ilist or ienumerator

816170
ilist	icollection
if the caller is allowed to modify the collection use icollection or ilist

816234
postgresql	mysql
i am aware that mysql and postgresql 1 do not have that concept so i am interested in finding out of there is an open-source sql database that does have the concept

816325
opera	safari
kaleidoscope opera others maybe safari not shows lots of pieces moving around and i found inspirational

816329
draggable	droppable
for example i used it to bind draggable and droppable to some dom elements which will be added through ajax

816339
mouse	keyboard
i am able to reproduce keyboard and mouse interaction from the browser to the remote machine

816386
typedef	struct
i suspect that it s impossible without the struct because c requires types to be defined before they are used and there s no opaque syntax for typedef

816432
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd
you could try to do something nuts like perhaps trying to get the openbsd userland to run on a netbsd kernel with freebsd ports but you d be on your own and it certainly wouldn t be hardened

816441
rss	feed
i needed to add a crossdomain.xml file to my website so that an embeddable flash widget can access its rss feed

816450
post	get
i will post the c# code when i finally get it working

816456
post	get
in asp.net mvc controller methods can be decorated to accept on specific http methods get post get

816463
int	chars
it s derived from a class with variables int x int y and chars sym

816499
try-catch	exception-handling
try wrapping the stream insertion character in a try-catch block and tell us what if any exception-handling it throws

816534
post	get
as an aside you should change every variable from a get or post such as

816553
rss	feed
i havo pipes join feed based on certain criteria and have it generate a compliant rss feed that i then process with universal feed parser

816576
ramaze	camping	camping	ruby-on-rails
i would like to use a lighter framework than ruby-on-rails sinatra ramaze camping but am concerned that by doing so i will not be able to use a lot of shared libraries that have been tailored to ruby-on-rails in the form of plugins

816604
prng	random
if you d prefer never to wait and are satisfied with possibly-lower-quality randomness use dev urandom instead -- it s a non-blocking pseudorandom number generator that injects randomness from dev random whenever it is available making it more random than a plain deterministic prng

816651
implements	extends
just extends windowadapter rather than implements windowlistener

816652
children	parent
on the parent element although this could have unwanted side-effects if the parent has other children

816676
mouse	keyboard
both machines run synergy sharing the keyboard and mouse across machines so i can easily switch between the two

816743
sorting	grouping
you are sorting the grouping instead of sorting the invaders and you are using take with a random number that can be zero so that it may return an empty result

816743
sorting	grouping
this works for grouping the invaders by x coordinate sorting them by y coordinate picking a grouping by random and getting the invader with the highest y coordinate

816744
getter	setter	public	protected
to address what bevan suggested in vb.net you can declare a property as having a public getter and a protected setter as follows

816751
bazaar	svn
the standard procedure for this is something like this forgiving the svn syntax i ve been using bazaar lately

816760
width	height
you can wrap it in a simple html file and set the width and height attributes on the tag though

816795
division	multiplication
you need integer division and multiplication

816799
put	httpverbs
both are strongly typed so there s no real difference there and the httpverbs enum includes delete head and put which aren t in the mvc contrib version

816820
spaces	delimiter
i want to use spaces as a delimiter with the cut command

816832
width	height
this will resize the image to 120 pixels in width and 240 in height

816901
folder	directory
in this folder we have components directory such as

816945
prepare	execute
prepare an insert statement and execute it multiple times

816961
tcpdf	fpdf
on we use tcpdf which is based on fpdf

817004
foldable	unfold
that way when you resize the top panel your foldable one to be shorter fold or taller unfold the layout manager should expand or contract the bottom panel to fit

817006
width	height
just import qd link with sdl.lib sdl_ttf if you want text then screen width height to set up line x1 y1 x2 y2 to draw a line pset x1 y1 to draw a point print x1 y1 bottom|right text to print text

817010
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
side note you will want to change your image to a png jpg or gif as bmp is not a fully supported web browser image format

817023
inherited	properties
i haven t done an enterprise mvc app yet but i figure i would probably make a base class that inherited controller and defines those extra properties

817060
geany	gedit
currently i m experimenting with gedit and geany but would be willing to switch to a similarly- or better- featured editor if it had this capability

817096
codeigniter	cakephp
someone told me about cakephp and codeigniter

817114
pop-up	dialog
using wmi you can get the eject drive dialog to pop-up using

817118
codeigniter	cakephp
the popular php frameworks like cakephp codeigniter zend framework symfony follow model view controller mvc design pattern which separates business logic from user interface also making the code cleaner and extensible

817121
hash	md5
you will not come across an accidental md5 sha1 sha2xxx hash ever

817121
hash	md5
every path name on every machine in the entire planet has a different md5 sha1 sha2xxx hash

817135
junit	testng
i m using junit 4 i can t use testng

memcached	apc
i m not sure memcached would really help you out so much but its worth adding as is apc for your php cahcing and i would at least architect it to be able to be load balanced - check out ultramonkey for some good documentation on how to get that going transparently you ll need to ensure that any user session that comes in doesn t store its session data in a per-host way

817154

817173
put	get
this should get the .dll into your output directory so that your application can run and just including the file in the project should put it in the project directory so that the designer can find it

817183
multiplying	modulo
if y requires 32 bits then you need to do 32x32 multiplying and then 64-bit 32-bit modulo or you need an algorithm that circumvents this limitation

817267
rss	feed
your web app could publish an rss feed but your desktop app will still have to poll the feed every 10 s

817278
inherited	subclassing
this approach is a lot more brittle since the junit4 internal runners are unstable and can be changed from release to release but it has the advantage of being able to be inherited down a class hierarchy and be overridden in a subclassing

817282
subclass	accessor
then i could subclass the networkmanager override the buildconnection method and add an instance variable plus an accessor for the created connection

817285
free	malloc
to me the current level of concurrency language support is roughly equivalent to the memory management support in c not integrated but some things can be delegated to the os malloc free

817285
free	malloc
i wish some language would come up with a suitable abstraction that either makes the threads + synchronization model easier or that simply completely hides it for us just as automatic memory management make good old malloc free obsolete in java

817295
for-loop	arrays
a traditional for-loop is most appropriate when you already have an arrays or list of things you want to process

817327
xslt	xquery
i use and recommend xquery over xslt

817344
ubuntu	linux
on my linux box also with a core 2 duo and ubuntu int is 32 bits and long is 64 bits

817355
bazaar	git
finally an option that doesn t have a huge drawback use version control particularly one of the distributed ones where you don t have to send your changes to a remote server - git mercurial darcs bazaar etc all have textmate integration also

817363
int	chars
the token_unicode field would contain the int unicode sequence used to referr to this chars

817434
equals	tostring
and this would create a bean private fields default accessors tostring hashcode equals etc

817439
equals	gethashcode
the tag class implements equals and gethashcode and uses the name property as the only signature property

817463
integer	unsigned
or using some portable libraries that offer that support as an example with ace ace_uint64 will be an unsigned integer type of 64 bits regardless of the compiler os architecture

817506
ubuntu	debian
there are packages available for ubuntu debian and bindings in a bunch of languages including perl python ruby.

one of those usercontrols has focusable true and keydown keyup handlers and i want it to have the focus as soon as my window opens

817651
freebsd	linux
if you re on unix linux mac os x freebsd windows under cygwin etc. i recommend the gnu compiler collection gcc

817683
inline	inlining
if the compiler isn t inlining both operations then either poke it until it does or find the implementation for your architecture and inline it yourself

817747
salt	md5
fingerprint is some md5 encrypted string with a salt ex

817760
folder	directory
you can verify you have done this correctly by looking in your install directory for a folder named include

817761
mouse	keyboard
all keyboard mouse event processing needs to be delegated to the parent jpanel

817770
accessor	properties
these dto classes would be simple poco -style classes that just contained properties get set accessor no methods

817819
error-handling	exception-handling
regarding error-handling the execute method might just throw an exception-handling to communicate errors.

817838
action-filter	onactionexecuting
in action-filter i set this value in tempdata in onactioexecuting and i remove it in onactionexecuting

817860

it works well in google-chrome firefox ie8 an opera.

817887
hide	show
the problems show when i click on a different link that s supposed to hide the first div and show another

817932
subclass	abstract-class
in addition to jon s answer i d like to mention that abstract-class still go well with composition if you keep the subclass tree shallow

818021
draggable	droppable
if set to invalid revert will only occur if the draggable has not been dropped on a droppable

818021
draggable	droppable
used to group sets of draggable and droppable items in addition to droppable s accept option

818021
draggable	droppable
a draggable with the same scope value as a droppable will be accepted by the droppable

818049
mbunit	nunit
testing mbunit or nunit

818060
opera	firefox
note code needs to be compatible across different browsers...ie ie firefox opera etc

818091
gridview	objectdatasource
it was using a .xsd file to talk to a stored procedure that narrowed the results sufficiently though no paging and feeding them into a gridview via an objectdatasource

818117
cruisecontrol	teamcity
i have historically used cruisecontrol which has worked just fine but i also heard good things about teamcity

818168
postgresql	mysql
if you chose sqlite or mysql or postgresql does not really matter in the column index point though

818191
accessor	properties
the properties accessor syntax

818191
accessor	properties
in your case for a properties retain properties that has been synthesized the accessor will release the old object and retain the new one

818204
post	get
you need to have session.use_trans_sid enabled to have php accept a session id passed by either get or post

818210
range	min
here is a simple example for getting a min value from a table based on a range whose bounds are defined in two other tables

818210
range	min
this uses t2.value and t3.value as the bounds of the range to find the min in

818255
stdout	stderr
in a unix shell if i want to combine stderr and stdout into the stdout stream for further manipulation i can append the following on the end of my command

818265
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stdout to stderr by doing

818265
stdout	stderr
redirects stderr to an unspecified file appending redirects stderr to stdout

818273
integer	unsigned
to get rid of the warning you should use a static cast to an unsigned integer

818284
stdout	stderr
here is one way to remember this construct although it is not entirely accurate at first may look like a good way to redirect stderr to stdout

818312
stdout	stderr
to answer your question it takes any error output normally sent to stderr and writes it to standard output stdout

818312
stdout	stderr
2 1 simply points everything sent to stderr to stdout instead

818320
inherited	subclassing
because linq-to-sql supports inherited for discriminated tables etc it expects an exact match to a known entity type - not unexpected subclassing

818346
apache	nginx	passenger	thin
this means they can be served by your front-end web server apache nginx etc. faster than if they were to go through mongrel thin or phusion passenger

818356
post	get
if you still have issues can you please post the error message you get that would help.

818368
stdout	stderr
that construct sends the standard error stream stderr to the current location of standard output stdout - this currency issue appears to have been neglected by the other answers

818368
stdout	stderr
you can redirect any output handle to another by using this method but it s most often used to channel stdout and stderr streams into a single stream for processing

818368
stdout	stderr
note that that last one will not direct stderr to outfile2 - it redirects it to what stdout was when the argument was encountered outfile1 and then redirects stdout to outfile2

818423
post	get
avoid using _request which is too vague it includes get post and cookie values and use the _post or _get if those are what you really mean and do check with

818424
datamapper	activerecord
i d recommend datamapper for orm not only it s way faster than activerecord but it s also very modularly built and plugins are actual gems that you can easily install

818435
rss	feed
there exists an rss feed with over 1000 items

818435
rss	feed
i want to create a yahoo pipes rss feed that returns a subset of the feed s items specified by the index of the first and last item

818435
rss	feed
for example i could pass in first 500 and last 600 and the pipe will return an rss feed with only the 500th through 600th itemd in the source feed

818546
width	height
i do not know how to solve it i have set 100 or auto height and width on

818584
modula-2	oberon
porting wirth s modula-2 compiler or oberon compiler should be easy

818584
modula-2	oberon
here s my bottom line on modula-2 and oberon

818584
modula-2	oberon
ada does not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath with modula-2 and oberon

818667
udp	tcp
i think c# does provide a raw socket class but if you try to emulate tcp ip and udp and spoof addresses not belong to you re host it actually drops you re packets

818672
post	get
as you go and get stuck or confused or lost post questions here

818770
datarow	bindingsource

to combat this i like to define a directory structure with my own bin etc and other folder so that everything can be self-contained

818854
jruby	mri
some gems target specific platforms mongrel there s a mri one and a jruby one

818854

819031
folder	directory
apart from the normal project bin debug folder output is also copied to an external directory to set up the main loader program

819034
jquery	scriptaculous
you can use the drag and drop functionality offered by jquery ui and scriptaculous instead of using multiple listboxes

819086
camping	ruby-on-rails
one issue that comes up when you use other frameworks like sinatra camping etc is that ruby-on-rails gives you a proven structure for your files in the your application

819109
google-chrome	firefox
i have developed my site with firefox and firebug plugin but when i deploy it to other browsers ie google-chrome the console window appears at the bottom of the screen very annoying

819148
jobs	cron
i am totally new to the subject of cron jobs so i have no idea where to start learning about them

819159
ilist	ienumerator
system collections generic ienumerator this method is probably inherited from ilist class

819163
children	parent
just for your information i just did a quick investigation of the difference between validate and revalidate and it seems to be that validate will the layout for the component the method was called on and its children while revalidate will go all the way up to its highest parent and then perform layout changes and such to all its children

819167
jobs	cron
cron jobs is a mechanism to automate tasks in linux operating system

819167
jobs	cron
good luck with cron jobs

819174
jobs	cron
one more thing to note is that you ll have to make sure that the user running your cron jobs has read-access to the zend framework library path otherwise php can not read the zend framework files

819184
httphandler	httpmodule
create httpmodule or httphandler to handle any url request and 302 redirect them to the maintenance page

819190
firefox	safari
an example firefox and safari webkit seem to use margin 1em 0px for p elements

819224
jobs	cron
you may also be intersted in how to store cron jobs with zf

819266
vpn	lan
if your deployment is entirely within your company s lan or vpn this isn t an issue

819314
post	get
this is more of a pie-in-the-sky comment than a real answer to your question but i thought i d post it to get people thinking

819327
int	chars
int is usually bigger than chars â more suitable for calculations but not so suitable for byte-level manipulation

819368
google-chrome	safari
this messes up the layout in google-chrome and safari

819416
width	height
i need a solution for auto-adjusting the width and height of an iframe to barely fit its content

819416
width	height
the point is that the width and height can be changed after the iframe has been loaded

819426
folder	directory
now delete all the folder and files inside that directory

819427
put	get
note bundles have get and put methods for all the primitive types parcelables and serializables

819554
rss	feed
i have a problem with an rss feed

819554
rss	feed
i generate my rss feed dynamicly and it looks like this

819638
uitableview	uisearchbar
it has a uisearchbar and a uitableview

819639
rss	feed
for software security and especially web application security owasp moderated appsec news is a great rss feed

819684
jsf	wicket
i wonder what advantages and disadvantages have modern frameworks jsf wicket tapestry.. over old plain jsp

819688
boost	stl
so you couldn t use the stl boost etc

819688
ostream	istream	stringstream	fstream
you couldn t even use the standard iostream class and derivatives like stringstream fstream which inherit both from istream and ostream

819744
disk	ram
sometimes it takes up to 2-3 seconds but i m attributing it to my database server several years old laptop with 3gb ram and slow disk

819796
ironruby	ironpython
i like the type-safety i get in my production code with a statically-typed language like c# but for my tests i would be happy to use a dynamically-typed language ironpython or ironruby to avoid all the explicit casting

819813
width	height
properties describe object qualities or characteristics color height width etc.

819835
inherited	properties
to be able to do this we make sure the license plate number is a properties in the most general class in the inherited line probably the vehicle class

819851
gentoo	debian
other suggestions would be debian and gentoo

819871
udp	tcp
the port is open on my router both tcp and udp so that is not the issue

819893
struts	wicket	wicket	seam	jsf	wicket	jsf	seam
i ve used cgi php jsp struts spring mvc 1.2 bea workshop jsf seam spring mvc 2.5 and wicket in that order

819893
jsf	seam
you need another framework on top of both of them to really solve the problems as seen with seam framework which makes jsf usable

819905
mvvm	delegatecommand
it uses the delegatecommand for commanding and it should be a great starting template for you mvvm projects

819911
spweb	spsite
yet another update - based on your comment it looks like site may be a spsite instead of a spweb

819911
spweb	spsite
note that the openweb method can take no parameters which works fine if the spsite was instantiated with the full url to your spweb

820028
httpsession	sessioncontext
we use it in a java ee environment to pass user identity to classes that are not java ee aware don t have access to httpsession or the ejb sessioncontext

820030
des	aes
this is orders of magnitude faster than des aes etc. i do as many rounds as i can in 3ns which is only about 6

820064
pop-up	dialog
it turns out that to achieve what i wanted the easiest way is to set focus to something in my pop-up dialog and to set the tabnavigation property to keyboardnavigationmode.cycle

820077
postgresql	mysql
it may additionally support other databases mysql postgresql etc since our development environment often requires switching between different databases

820176
memcached	apc
you could also use objects that have been loaded in session or in cache apc memcached before

820213
vb.net	vb6
i ve done lots of c# and vb vb6 and vb.net plus java and a few other things over the past 10 years or so just never had a requirement for c++ until now

820228
multiplying	add
with product you multiplying - i just want to add them

820322
outputstream	inputstream
warning nsstream may not respond to +getstreamstohost port inputstream outputstream

820334
put	get
the problem was that i ve put my class into sun.java.awt package to get access to package protected members without putting it into rt.jar and exception was thrown hen calling imagefetcher.class

820351
moq	nmock
rhinomocks nmock and moq cannot do this because these libraries are simpler

820473
width	font-size
the javascript animation effects tend to want to change a couple predefined values like width or font-size

820473
width	text-align
in order to transfer from picture 1 to picture 2 using the float or text-align methods i must remove the floating text-align then set the width of the bar color but that doesn t work if i want to keep the javascript overhead minimal for such a simple task

820526
boost	stl
optimally this map should use only stl and or boost constructs

820589
google-chrome	safari
safari google-chrome etc

820629
versioning	upgrade
they will be forced to upgrade or maintain parrallel versioning of the project file

820630
typemock	nmock
the most common references seem to be rhinomocks nmock and typemock

820644
profiling	debugging
the provisioning profiling contains a list of devices that are allowed to run or debugging your code

820649
installation	upgrade
upgrade to 1.7.1 or follow these instructions to fix your 1.7.0 installation

820694
put	get
we have some feature branches that can get put on ice for a few weeks at a time

820709
spweb	spsite	sharepoint	spsite
in particular if you get an object reference to the spsite or spweb from the current context and try to dispose of it either with a using clause or try finally you ll get object reference error from the sharepoint stack

820709
spweb	spsite
the right way to do dispose of your sp objects spsite spweb etc is to instanciate a new sp object as opposed to using the context to get it from a site using a url

820727
int	double
the second and fourth tokens are numbers hence you will need to convert these from string to int or double

820744
openmpi	mpich
you mention that you are using openmp - you shouldn t actually need to use mpirun or mpiexec as you would with mpich or openmpi programs

820744
openmpi	mpich
openmp works in a fairly different way than message-passing libraries openmp uses multiple threads within the same process but mpich and openmpi use multiple processes

820791
doc	rtf
i think i can use the rtf generation to create a doc-readable file that can then be edited using doc and re-saved

820791
doc	rtf
however i believe the formatting in rtf is limited compared to doc

820819
int	chars
the standard mandates very few limitations on chars and int

820829
keydown	keyup
you have to use keyup event not keydown .

820861
getter	setter
there you have it -- all of the advantages of externally-generated getter setter functions with none of the mess

820861
getter	setter
this ability to painlessly incorporate future changes is actually the main reason people use getter setter functions instead of public members in the first place

820879
hex	binary
the transformation between binary and hex text formats can be done quickly and efficiently with lookup tables but anything involving decimal text format will be more complicated

820883
migrate	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
while you may not merge from the custom versioning to the head its that likely code in the mainstream head that you might want to migrate into your custom branch to upgrade the custom versioning

820919
uiview	subviews
the documentation says that the clipstobounds property of uiview will clip the drawing to the bounds or more precisely that the subviews can t draw outside of the bounds of the superview

820928
keydown	keyup
on keydown you can use this to enable the translucency and on keyup you can disable the effect again

820991
post	get
your assumption is correct the url is not expected to be modified in subequent post backs and you need to parse the query string only on the get which happens the first time the page is loaded

821054
hex	binary
let s think about half of task for a moment - converting from a string-ized base n to unsigned long where n is a power of 2 base 2 for binary and base 16 for hex

821072
mouse	keyboard
most of the time when you re doing data entry modification you don t want to drop your hands off the keyboard to move the mouse to the submit update button especially with large volumes of data to work with

821080
width	height
place the content inside a wrapper tag such as a div and set the div with a fixed width height and style of overflow hidden to ensure that a particularly long word doesn t force out the width of the cell

821096
width	height
also your svg tag may need width height attributes see svg spec

821123
hash	md5
you can do an md5 hash of both files to determine if they are identical

821140
tostring	string.format
while you could call string.format i think it s easier to just call tostring on it

821163
children	parent
you create a book parent with 10 pages children

821187
width	height
i know that i can set the height and width on the datagrid but i don t want the user to have to use the scroll bars on the datagrid as it has a few hundred records

821349
radiobuttonlist	onclientclick
this cannot be done in the same way as a radiobuttonlist for a dropdownlist the correct attribute event name is onchange instead of onclientclick

821363
nspopupbutton	nsformatter
i want to use an nsformatter subclass to format the contents of an nspopupbutton i m using to display a list of choices

821391
.nettiers	codesmith
our dal uses codesmith to generate code from .nettiers templates which creates these datarepository classes that contain all the methods for crud type transaction to the datasource

821402
pop-up	dialog
ie8 has a feature that pop-up a dialog box that informs me when a web page stops responding that s a bit annoying when debugging as it steals focus from visual studio

821421
width	height
you can set the width and height properties to percentages for example a width of 100 would cause the image to stretch across your page

821434
int	chars
if your memory allocations are made in terms of sizeof tchar you ll probably be ok but if there is code where the original programmer was assuming that chars were 1 byte each and they used int in malloc statements that s hard to do a global search for

821494
post	get
2009-04-28 16 41 15 post forecast currentlineitems - 443 domain username xx.xx.xx.xx 302 2009-04-28 16 41 15 get shared error - 443 - xx.xx.xx.xx 401 1 0

821583
spaces	delimiter
the problem is that and are on different places in the text and sometimes glued to other text therefore the empty spaces as delimiter doesn t help me

821584
subtract	add
so as others have noted add a day then subtract the smallest time quantum a tick and you get the last possible time for the current day

821667
unsigned	short
and also the specific problem i am having is that i have a class which has an unsigned short array where the last space of the array changes if i do this

821670
integer	fractions
you will get a fractions result so feel free to convert the result to an integer with to_i

821675
domcontentloaded	onload
on domcontentloaded you ll have to check each image for complete to decide whether to add them immediately to the document or wait for the image s onload listener to fire

821714
pop-up	dialog
must be completely transparent to end user user must not have to change their printer settings and then change them back or deal with a save as dialog and then open the file they saved - it needs to just pop-up

821740
for-loop	loops
a touch more info i m open to all sorts of answers array_sum a for-loop a foreach loops

821811
min	max
can t use max or min because order is significant

821815
unix	bsd	unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	bsd	solaris	aix	bsd	aix
nevertheless acls not necessarily posix.1e acls are supported at least optionally in all the main variants of unix linux bsd macos x acl hp-ux aix p107ff solaris

821816
google-chrome	firefox
also this works in google-chrome in addition to firefox

821836
accessor	properties
basically if you say nonatomic and you generate the accessor using synthesize then if multiple threads try to change read the properties at once badness can happen

821836
accessor	properties
of course if you implement your own accessor rather than using synthesize i think these declarations do nothing except express your intent as to whether the properties is implemented in a threadsafe manner

821846
hash	md5
the issue is php s md5 function by default returns the hex variation of the hash where c# is returning the raw byte output that must then be made text safe with base64 encoding

821862
hide	show
on my control i want to show or hide some rows of a table

821862
hide	show
the text of both labels are show on the page lbltohide does not hide

821864
min	max
count min max elimination every execute

821869
range	minimum
the documentation says the default range for the spin button has the maximum set to zero 0 and the minimum set to 100

821879
min	max
to fix it just interchange the min and max values you are currently useing when you call setrange

822032
g++	gcc
it is also not present on alternative stl implementations like gcc s libstdc++ for mingw -w64 as of version g++ 4.8.x

822033
client-side	server-side
dividing them into groups you could have them take different approaches server-side client-side database supported etc. approaches to this

822079
firefox	safari
another thing might be that firefox ignores the windows proxy whereas ie and safari likely use the default windows proxy settings - control panel - internet - connections - lan settings

822194
accessor	properties
in addition to what s already been said about threadsafeness non-atomic properties are faster than atomic accessor

822202
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
it s available in ff3+ ie safari opera google-chrome

822244
vb6	vba
this is to put us on notice that vba vb6 for that matter will at some point be a thing of the past

822245
wordpress	phpbb
from keeping applications wordpress phpbb etc up to date and patched to actual attacks like sql injection and cross-site scripting

822262
try-catch	exception-handling
when i surround this with a try-catch block and breakpoint on the catch if the exception-handling was thrown the file would already be deleted from the disk

822295
width	height
if it s not true colour you can create a new true color image of the same width and height and copy the old image over

822334
qmail	exim
the default mtas will work fine sendmail qmail postfix exim etc.

822339
rar	zip
i am trying to batch extract some rar s that are in some zip in some directories

822341
spaces	delimiter
you probably want to require some kind of delimiter spaces quotes depends on what you re doing and disallow some characters inside urls probably the same characters and or any characters that aren t allowed in urls

822363
int	chars
using int arithmetic where is the i th chars of the string n is the length of the string and indicates exponentiation

822375
setinterval	settimeout
the eval function and its relatives function settimeout and setinterval provide access to the javascript compiler

822381
spaces	delimiter
the problem is that for uses spaces as the default delimiter

822407
nstextfield	nstableview
assuming your nstableview s columns are bound to an nsarraycontroller you can bind the value of the nstextfield label to your array controller s with controller key arrangedobjects and with a key path of count

822446
onclick	onsubmit
if so i d recommend dropping the submit mechanism and using a button type with an onclick handler and not submit button w a onsubmit handler.

822451
rss	feed
i am making an application iphone app which gets information jokes from an rss feed then populates the tableview

822454
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works in every browser firefox safari google-chrome except ie7 and ie8 with example input text like this

822454
google-chrome	firefox
however surprisingly to me at least this does not work in firefox and google-chrome

822454
google-chrome	firefox
the same tests passed 100 on firefox and google-chrome

822469
unix	bsd
i was wondering if there are any small bsd or unix releases

822513
rss	feed
a simple example for pulling in rss feed data is the seismic xml example on the apple developer samples site at

822547
google-chrome	firefox
note needs to be compatible with most brosers ie6 ie7 firefox google-chrome

822570
google-chrome	firefox	versioning	upgrade
probably the best way would be to detect the user s browser user-agent string and redirect them to a page asking them to upgrade or download a different browser such as firefox or google-chrome if they are using an old versioning of ie

822575
multiplication	modulo
it s fast too since it doesnt involve multiplication or modulo

822607
getter	setter
the basic idea is you would decide on some convention to tell your perl script when to generate a getter or setter

822607
getter	setter
given code like this i could write a script to look for comment lines consisting of the comment get or set on the line s before a member variable declaration and then replace them with simple setter getter

822607
getter	setter
instead scan each line individually and if you find an appropriate comment line push something that says i need a getter setter onto a stack then when you see the associated member variable pop things off of the stack and generate the code

822646
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
if you use the underscore prefix for your ivars which is nothing more than a common convention but a useful one then you need to do 1 extra thing so the auto-generated accessor for the properties knows which ivar to use

822669
public	protected	inherited	subclassing
basically you want public or protected variable to be declared in foo since these are the variables that subclassing inherited from their parent and therefore seen in baz

822676
getter	setter
if you want to be able to somehow tag your member variable and have getter and or setter skeletons automatically generated for you than a ide macro seems more appropriate

822708
rss	feed
or you can drink from the firehose and follow the rails project on github and you may even get a rss feed for that

822752
haskell	ocaml
i am wondering if i should continue to learn ocaml or switch to f# or haskell

822786
16-bit	64bit	unsigned	short	int	chars	int	boolean
java has always made a distinction between the scalar types which are not classes boolean true false chars unsigned 16-bit short signed 16-bit int signed 32-bit and long signed 64bit

822828
free	malloc
this will work if you and the user agree to use the same allocation like malloc free

822833
public	protected
in java there is the same public protected and private scopes that exist in other places like c++

822833
public	protected
note however that if you don t specify whether something is public protected or private it s none of those things

822845
haskell	ocaml
haskell and ocaml are both mature languages with strong implementations

822845
haskell	ocaml
both ocaml and haskell are being used to write lots of different kinds of programs not just compilers and ai or whatever

822871
postgresql	mysql
i don t know if the null-out-the-source-blob trick is possible in mysql or postgresql

822884
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
if it matters i m primarily interested in this under debian or ubuntu linux

822893
firefox	safari
there are plenty of new browsers out there that don t support javascript or don t support it well and they can be just as important as the latest safari or firefox

822929
vmware	esx
we run sharepoint and sql server on separate vms on vmware esx in our datacenter

822968
webclient	httpwebrequest
the credentials property is not available on the webclient or httpwebrequest

822999
ostringstream	std
this string of course can be built up by sprintf or std ostringstream or what have you

823006
uiview	subviews
add it as a subviews -- you and the uiview owns it

823021
passenger	webrick
the reason for all of the server restarts isn t necessarily because your webserver webrick mongrel phusion passenger is flaky but because when your rails app has started up there are certain things loaded into memory load paths initializers environment data

823051
haskell	ocaml
ocaml and haskell have been surving well for a number of years which bodes well for their future

823051
haskell	ocaml
perf i don t have enough first-hand experience with haskell but based on second-hand and third-hand info i think ocaml or f# are more pragmatic in the sense that i think it is unlikely you ll be able to get the same run-time perf in haskell that you do in ocaml of f#

823051
haskell	ocaml
tooling i don t have enough personal experience to compare but i think the vs integration with f# is superior to anything you ll find for ocaml haskell today and f# will continue to improve a bit here over the next year

823051
haskell	ocaml
if you know a big long-term project you want to use it for one may stand out but i think many of the skills will be transferable more easily between f# and ocaml than to from haskell but also more easily among any of these three than with say java

823115
mouseout	mouseenter
i was using jquery and ended up hooking into mouseenter and mouseout instead of the events you are using

823151
width	height
try to set the width and height of the control to the dimensions of the image and set the scalecontent property to true

823159
width	height
this will add scroll bars to the div if the inside content grows past its set width or height

823166
children	parent
this means that the second child array you have in children of the parent node is not the same array that you add grandchild to but a copy of it

823174
mousemove	mousedown
i could not add mousemove event after mousedown with

823178
getter	setter
ie the getter is the setter as you only want to cache it when it is used once.

823186
maven	m2e
i m trying to share multi-module maven project using m2e plug-in from springsource tool suite 2.0.0 to subversion server subversive plug-in for eclipse

for the most common framework exceptions such as argumentexception and invalidoperationexception

823246
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in safari google-chrome i imagine firefox 2+ and konquerer and probably others you can do it in css by using border-radius

823255
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in safari google-chrome firefox 2 ie 8 and konquerer and probably others you can do it in css by using the border-radius property

823274
debian	linux
here s what happens when i compile the very same source code with gcc 4.3 on debian linux

823276
children	parent
what i was thinking to do is to extract interfaces for httpcontextextensions and httpclient make a children for each one and implement the interfaces delegating to the parent and then using the interfaces in my code

823302
g++	gcc
the files will be compiled with the objective-c++ compiler so things will behave more like g++ than gcc but since that s what you want it probably doesn t count as a surprise

823338
haskell	ocaml
haskell and ocaml both have very consistent stories about operator overloading

823359
int	chars
function load_data int int returns a chars

823380
config	ini
the zend framework contains a config parses that parses files that are written in the ini format zend_config_ini it sounds like this is what you are using

823380
config	ini
the ini format is specialized to provide both the ability to have a hierarchy of config data keys and inheritance between config data sections

823381
object-pascal	delphi
of course the downside is if that you don t know delphi which is object-pascal you have to familiarize yourself with a new language

823401
multiplication	exponent
exp has to perform several multiplication to arrive at its answer whereas log only has to convert the mantissa and exponent to base-e from base-2

823405
versioning	upgrade
but then when i create a new versioning of the library my framework installer has to carry both the old and the new library to make sure upgrade don t remove the old library that might be in use by some application

823473
portrait	landscape
im having a modal view displayed on top of tab bar controller the orientation of tab bar controller and my modal view is currently in portrait mode i need to only change my modal views orientation to landscape mode

823503
fgets	fgetc
use some of the file reading functions fgets fgetc fscanf and pass in stdin as the file path or php stdin depending on how new your version of php is

823649
getter	setter
generally it s a good idea to keep the actions of setter or getter for that matter to a relatively small set of actions

823705
mouse	keyboard
i m trying to find a way to programatically get set the default osx system keyboard shortcuts hotkeys found in the system preferences - keyboard mouse - keyboard shortcuts tab

823790
google-chrome	firefox
this only works in ie in firefox and google-chrome it doesn t work

823831
uiview	subviews
if you add a uiview as a subviews of the main window it will cover the entire ui

823850
versioning	upgrade
if not will i have two versioning of vs 2008 or will professional upgrade web developer

so divu stores result of division in lo and remainder in hi while multu stores result of multiplication in lo lower 4 bytes and hi higher 4 bytes

823941
put	get
you can see where i put the extra echoes in too see the value of the variable and i get the previous screenshot

823946
awt	swing
swing components once displayed should only be accessed from the awt event thread typically using swingutilities.invokelater

823959
mbunit	nunit
in order to test orm mappings one strategy i ve used that has saved hours of work involves using a row test approach in unit tests like the rowtest attribute in mbunit or nunit

823968
post	get
or do i get a chance to intercept this response to the user - instead of increasing the max size on the iis and thus spending bandwith on receiving this file i just want to identify this post as being too big and sending an apropriate response back to the user

824033
n-gram	words
for example the vector space is surely comprised of words and phrases words n-gram

824040
opera	firefox
i have that work in firefox 3.0.10 without problem but the same substring statement doesn t work in opera 9.60

824085
pop-up	dialog
in that case ie office pop-up a couple of login dialog if the user cancels out of these the document opens as expected but you really don t want the user to have to cancel a couple of dialog to open your documents

824160
profiling	debugging
that is necessary for the profiling to profiling my code while in debugging mode the result

824173
versioning	upgrade
i have not upgrade from 2.1 to the newer versioning so i can only talk about the relatively old 2.1 from 2001. â

824178
post	get
the rest way to do it will be to create the image with a post request and then load it with a get request

824241
cvs	rcs
because cvs at beginning was a set of scripts around per-file rcs version control system commits and other operations are not atomic in cvs

824241
ready	each
each developer can have its own repository or better repositories private one in which he she does development and public bare one where she he publishes that part which is ready and they can pull fetch from each other repositories in symmetric fashion

824246
post	get
i ve read a couple of post on this issue but still can t seem to get mvc working on iis 6

add all the numbers you are given up using your favourite big integer library and subtract that total from the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 2 32-1 as obtained from the sum of arithmetic progression formula

824397
button	checkbox
in vista most of the shell s yes to all dialogs actually work this way - there s no additional button saying yes no to all - there s a perform chosen action on all items checkbox instead

824405
pop-up	dialog
it looks like you want a simple model dialog a dialog which pop-up and doesn t allow the user to do anything else until it s closed

824409
google-chrome	firefox
i went to options- connections and unchecked all checkboxes disabled file- capture traffic went to ie and disabled fiddler addin went to connections and removed all proxies and still all my pages on ie and google-chrome firefox is fine go through fiddler

824432
versioning	upgrade
i think the killer question is whether your app will survive long term if you never upgrade the platform language versioning

824477
folder	directory
then at the directory where your jar is located there should be a lib folder with the required jars

824603
set	bag
regarding set bag semantics

824603
set	bag
a bag is a generalization of a set

824618
implements	extends
it sounds like you might want to extends the tree class and override some of the methods to implements your special functionality

824628
move	drag
and when i do drag it i want a second shape to move at the same time

824628
move	drag
the problem is that i have not found a move drag event

824690
range	infinity
you cannot set the property to unlimited or infinity or anything like that but you can use the maxvalue of the data type you are using integer.maxvalue decimal.maxvalue etc. which will give you as far a range as possible without incurring overflow errors

824704
post	get
alternatively code to conditionally redirect to the same page on another site could create another virtual site with compression disabled but need to pass all parameters get post

824809
polymorphism	specialization
a data type that can appear to be of a generalized type a list with elements of arbitrary type is designated polymorphism data type like the generalized type from which such specialization are made

824815
mouseover	mouseout
the first function of hover is a mouseover and second function is mouseout

824828
getter	setter
by default these two methods return only public getter and setter risking a nullreferenceexception in a case like this but passing true as above makes them also return private ones

824837
post	get
for iis 5.1 only i setup the .resource extension in iis website properties home directory tab configuration button add to work with get head and post

824837
post	get
edit i changed the post to get and in all 3 cases it submitted the data correctly so it is not a form problem

824863
switching	screens
however i find that if i perform a lot of activities and then switching between views i end up with a blank screens and my view is not drawn

824870
mbunit	cruisecontrol.net
that said if you are using only visual studio and will be doing ci builds using cruisecontrol.net or teamcity i d recommend using mbunit or nunit.net

824895
gridview	objectdatasource
i am using an objectdatasource with a gridview to get data from my orm class but i cannot get it to order by properly

824928
jboss	glassfish
a servlet container eg tomcat or a full-blown application server eg glassfish jboss

824930
jboss	glassfish
you can get started with a simple servlet container ie tomcat rather than a full blown application server eg jboss glassfish

824949
rss	feed
i m trying to find a library that can read a given rss atom feed and that can guess its format and abstract it as a list of items

824949
rss	feed
the idea is to build a simple rss reader that could take any feed

825061
clang	llvm
note anyways that the llvm crew also builds an own complete c c++ obj-c compiler called clang

825061
clang	llvm
so if someone says compiler llvm he really either means llvm-gcc or clang

825062
getter	setter
you might also want to look into targetnullvalue which make a certain value equivalent to null if you set targetnullvalue 5 and your user enters 5 your setter will get null and if your getter supplies null the binding will display 5

825100
submit	submission
accordingly there seems to be no consensus on whether for a submit button will stop form submission or not

825100
onclick	onsubmit
this might end up requiring the button s onclick set some state that the form s onsubmit inspects but if i can just return false then that s great

825100
submit	submission
i have had no luck finding any sort of authoritative resource as to what browsers actually do when you interact with their elements what the default action is whether the onclick handler for a submit button fires before or after the form submission dispatch etc.

825157
profiling	debugging
that is why it is a good idea to profiling in both debugging and release modes

825157
profiling	debugging
if release mode only shows function foo using 80 of the program time you can use the debugging profiling to see that function bar which was inlined into foo is using 60 of foo s time

825183
submit	submission
setting will keep the submit button from submission the form but it will not keep the form from being submitted

825200
button	checkbox
for checkbox radio button dynamic content i would expect these to be dynamic yet predictable

825213
jboss	glassfish
a servlet container eg tomcat or a full-blown application server eg glassfish jboss

825218
google-chrome	firefox
for firefox and webkit based browsers although beware google-chrome has bugs in this area use their css border-radius based styles for native rounded corners

825249
atan2	sin	cos	sin	cos	atan2	cos	exp	pow	sin
the methods which require fdlibm semantics are sin cos tan asin acos atan exp log log10 cbrt atan2 pow sinh cosh tanh hypot expm1 and log1p

825263
folder	directory
or is there some way i can change the working directory to the user s root backup folder so i can simply specify relative file paths

825274
filtering	grouping
you can then use the filtering property to filtering by grouping user etc.

825278
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
the getvalue function not included here is a clumsy solution it checks for various types textbox dropdownlistfor checkbox etc. and gets the string value from the appropriate property textbox.text dropdownlist.selectedvalue checkbox.checked etc.

825282
width	height
this draws a textured rectangle with width w and height h

825313
mouse	keyboard
you can alleviate this problem a little by removing the mouse keyboard and the screen and only access the buildserver through rdp or something similar

825345
versioning	upgrade
if that s not the answer you can always try to upgrade your rails versioning to 2.3 and see if the problem persists

825367
post	get
take a look at this post to get an idea about how this can be implemented

825406
try-catch	exception-handling
unchecked exception-handling are a good way to notify your clients about exceptional situations including illegal pre-conditions and yet not burdening them with the need to wrap calls to your api with try-catch blocks which most of the time basically serve no purpose other than debugging tracing etc

825413
listview	gridview
now things have changed and the datagrid has been replaced by the gridview and or listview

825445
listview	gridview
i d say that you should investigate the gridview listview to see what they can do but ultimately if you and your customers are happy with your own code and it works for you does everything you need it to then there s no need to change just because there is something else out there

825505
subtraction	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
there are similar operator for subtraction multiplication division power and others

825552
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
in the application i m working on i ve been trying to use the savefiledialog and openfiledialog for their customary purpose saving and opening files.

825554
hash	md5
i am in the process of trying to user md5 hash of the urls instead but in the meantime i was just wondering if there was a way i could check on the length of a string stored in a variable

825624
mouseleave	mouseenter
or two manually setup mouseenter mouseleave events to handle your hover style

825697
getter	setter
it s not a solution rather workaround - but you might try generate equals then use encapsulate field refactoring to replace all field acceses to use getter setter it works inside class also

825700
post	get
you just need get and post versions of your action

825704
inherited	properties
you could do this by creating a new class that inherited from form and has a field properties constructor for your person

825710
textarea	textbox
how can i select all textbox and textarea e.g

825734
mouse	keyboard
there are a couple of things you can do to improve your keyboard mouse usage ratio with eclipse

825742
margin	height
wrap them around your content and use negative margin s and background positions to get the right effect that spans the height of the fluid content

825746
cos	sin	cos	exp
ieee doesn t specify the output of math functions sin cos exp ...

825787
versioning	upgrade
i don t need to have the compatibility with older versioning once it is upgrade

825793
installation	upgrade
upgrade don t exist for installscript projects but there are no windows installer restrictions to keep you from running multiple installation simultaneously

825941
prepare	execute
in the past i ve used the sqlite3_exec function to execute sql statements instead of the harder prepare statement api

825961
getter	setter
to use your example the iaccount interface you describe exposes getter and setter on the account object

825963
filesystems	ntfs
in ntfs if your filesystems is set to compress the final file might be smaller than what your actual file might be

825969
kde	gnome
my intention is to find out if the switch user under kde gnome has a similar api call i can monitor with freepascal

825991
ienumerable	iqueryable
i m going to assume if it s iqueryable it is also ienumerable

825997
button	checkbox
the togglecontrols function to disable enable all the controls inside the table this means all textboxes button checkbox radio button and dropdowns looks like this

826045
getter	setter
adding interfaces is really useful for design patterns like strategy and visitor but in those cases i don t carbon copy the getter and setter of the domain classes

826052
inherited	properties
inherited from game and override the methods you intend to use in your tests to return canned values or shortcut calculations for whatever methods properties that you need

826077
awt	swing
of course their might be some libraries that are specifically designed for java gui stuff like swing or awt

826096
post	put
however the login progess is a long process as there are many things that have to be initialized and checks to be made i have only put a few on here as it would make the code to long to post

826103
folder	directory
based on this directory structure and what you ve shown so far the service class would go in a myproject.services.service folder under the myproject.services directory

826103
folder	directory
the customerservice class would go in a myproject.services.service.support folder under the myproject.services directory

826104
uiview	subviews
then you could itterate through an nsarray myarray containing the uiview adding them as subviews in order of depth

826107
post	get
do it the same way everyone else does it pass around db-generated tokens between sites with get or post then validate those tokens back to a web service that talks to the db directly

826146
recv	epoll
experimenting i ve found that epollhup only happens in conjunction with epollerr the reason for this may be the way python interfaces with epoll and lowlevel io normally recv would return a -1 and set errno to eagain when nothing is available on a non-blocking recv however python uses nothing returned to signal eof

826146
recv	epoll
it seems that epollin and a recv that returns an empty string is indicative of the other end having closed the connection however using an older version of python before epoll were introduced and plain select on a pipe i ve experienced that a read that returned did not indicate eof just a lack of available data

826220
post	get
having it set up to insert into common cms editors will probably get a large number of people to post it unknowingly

826261
lisp	scheme
learn lisp or scheme

826309
put	get
here the requirement is to get the sum total of all the digits in the cells in column c and put the value in the corresponding cell in column b in my example - 1 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 1 2.5

cvs	svn
tortoisesvn works with putty to do the ssh thing--sorry if this doesn t totally make sense i m a total svn newbie i always used cvs

826373
collabnet	svn
so i downloaded the client from tigris.org--which actually redirected me to a place called collabnet which had me register a username and password just to download the svn client--still don t know what that was all about

826381
try-catch	exception-handling
while i am not sure of a way to check withing creating the object you can still get around the security exception-handling by using the javascript try-catch block

826403
photoshop	fireworks
fireworks is my preferred tool but photoshop s also more than up to it

826463
pull	push
git allows you to push pull aka commit update to from an svn server too but gives you more leeway on the side

826480
int	double
the property tag is always outputting an int even when the evaluated value is a double

826510
int	double
you re doing int arithmetic because your inputs are int not double two divided by four is zero for int

826521
svg	vml
however this guy did it using vml for ie and svg for other browsers see scaled circles section

aptana	radrails
i m trying to get into rails development and am using aptana radrails as a plugin to eclipse winxp

826551
post	get
going through the same exercise with another dbms selected in the new project screen worked just fine and i have been able to hack through things to get my project switched over from mysql to sql server by installing the ms jdbc driver and getting the ado.rb file copied into my ruby install ala this post

826567
for-loop	loops
so most of the time in the for-loop is spent creating strings assigning them to a variable and then overwriting them the next time through loops

826614
versioning	upgrade
after your database can track what versioning # it is on - it can do sql upgrade automatically

826632
allocator	stl
i haven t written c++ code with a custom stl allocator but i can imagine a webserver written in c++ which uses a custom allocator for automatic deletion of temporary data needed for responding to a http request

826635
allocator	stl
as i mention here i ve seen intel tbb s custom stl allocator significantly improve performance of a multithreaded app simply by changing a single

826694
cos	sin	cos	exp
as noted by steve schnepp the output of math functions such as sin cos exp etc

826755
calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	malloc
background we have overloads for malloc calloc free and the various variants of operator new and delete and the linker happily makes stl use these for us

826781
many-to-one	one-to-many
the only other way i can think to force it to audit is to convert the relationship to a one-to-many from person to personaddress one-to-many from address to personaddress and create another class element for personaddress that does the many-to-one mappings back to person and address

826790
yacc	bison
if you use a tool such as bison yacc for c or antlr generates a number of languages but uses java you won t have to worry much about parsing

826807
yacc	bison
use yacc or bison or the equivalent for writing the descendent recursive parser

826887
cvs	svn
this is the primary advantage of switching from svn or cvs to a distributed system like git

826908
rss	feed
i created a simple rss reader and wrote javascript to get the feed using google s api then dealing with that javascript object because it came back as json

826908
hide	show
i then developed some javascript to hide show div tags

826910
rss	feed
it could use rss to monitor feed and let you know when new questions are asked with your tags

826923
hash	md5
the previous suggestion to use an md5 hash is a good one although you have to prevent that from becoming a performance problem in and of itself

826966
onmousedown	onmouseup	onclick	onmouseup	onclick	onmousedown
as others have said you can use mouse.cursorpos or the getcursorpos function but you can also just handle the onmousedown or onmouseup event instead of onclick

826987
getter	setter
you can define the access modifier per property and independently for the getter and the setter

827042
freebsd	aix
my guess is that they don t have an aix or freebsd also not there machine around to do it

827049
post	get
use the hidden field on form post to get the id of the employee

827178
vim	emacs
if you plan you configure anything in a unix based system likelihood is you going to be editing a fair few config files therefore you ll want to learn a terminal based editor of which vim is one of the best sorry emacs

827178
vim	textmate
no need to post i need a textmate alternative for insert os you ll have vim instead

827210
perl	tcl
that which applies to perl does not necessarily apply to python nor does what applies in tcl apply in java or lisp or .

827224
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i have a flash movie that runs fine in firefox opera safari but not in ie

827227
ant	maven	maven	cobertura
metrics tools such as cobertura find bugs build tools such as maven and ant

827294
for-loop	arrays
and then use a for-loop to put the id attributes into another arrays

827300
width	height
set width and height to 2000

827353
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
firefox safari opera etc

827386
chown	chmod
your users will also need to chmod and chown the files appropriately

827406
haskell	ocaml
haskell currently list 144 jobs on indeed ocaml list 12 and c# list 26 000

827406
haskell	ocaml
these numbers are not perfect but i bet you that once f# ships it won t be long before it blows past haskell and ocaml in the number of job listings

827465
salt	md5
put a salt md5 with the user s agent + remoteip + your salt in the user s session and make it verify on every page load that the correct md5 is in their cookie

827479
margin	height
create an empty margin that runs the height of the page

827495
google-chrome	firefox
now the pure css one works well in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

827495
google-chrome	firefox
it is my understanding and the behaviour of firefox and google-chrome that this should not be the case because the left divs are block level elements that floats should basically ignore

827512
multiplying	modulo	int	double
write a little helper function which takes the double float and returns an int precision by multiplying by 1000 and then doing modulo 10 100 1000

827522
width	height
there is an outer box with a fixed height and width with the overflow set to hidden

827527
hash	md5
i am trying to copy a file get a md5 hash then delete the copy

827557
rss	feed
i have a class to represent an rss feed and in this class i have a method called seturl

827563
pull	push
i initially would like to push and pull with a subversion server

827567
inherited	subclassing
described here jaxb inherited unmarshal to subclassing of marshaled class

827588
wtl	atl
from unmanaged c++ you can use either native win32 api mfc or atl wtl

827588
wtl	atl
atl wtl is a lightweight c++ template library which started as a c++ wrappers for com and later adopted some ideas from mfc thus sharing the same classes names for support of win32 windowing

827588
wtl	atl
the atl windowing support was later split into wtl which was then released as open source

827594
haskell	ocaml
in contrast both ocaml and haskell are being developed in extremely unproductive directions

827594
haskell	ocaml
this has been killing ocaml for several years now and i expect haskell to follow suit over the next few years

827594
haskell	ocaml
most former professional ocaml and haskell programmers already moved on to f# credit suisse flying frog consultancy and most of the rest will doubtless migrate to more practical alternatives such as clojure and scala in the near future

827594
haskell	ocaml
haskell has fewer industrial users than ocaml and although it does have multicore support it is still being developed in a very unproductive direction

827594
haskell	ocaml
nobody has ever succeeded selling libraries to ocaml and haskell programmers and i am one of the few people to have tried but f# libraries already sell in significant quantities

827594
haskell	ocaml
ocaml is specifically designed for writing theorem provers and haskell is specifically designed for researching haskell

827594
haskell	ocaml
f# was designed to address all of the most serious practical problems with ocaml and haskell such as poor interoperability lack of concurrent garbage collection and lack of mature modern libraries like wpf in order to bring a productive modern language to a large audience

827613
innodb	myisam
note also by default windows installations use innodb tables while ubuntu installations use myisam tables

827623
put	get
all the url variables get variables are put into the php variable as an array

827630
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
table names using myisam at least on windows are case-insensitive whereas it s case-sensitive on unix linux

827686
put	get
when i start the application without debugging i get an exception i put the info that i get from the exception here

827711
hide	show
php - defining something like hide works well other variables could be production or dev - large slabs can then be hidden and show together with one simple variable change

827722
codeigniter	kohana
i guess we re gonna keep this project as a codeigniter one and move to kohana as soon as our next project comes

827724
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
now since you ve changed the display mode from block implied to inline any padding margin width or height styles you applied to li elements will not work

827750
ceil	floor
mike s approach is reasonable but you can compute the number of digits directly using the log10 function and use either floor or ceil to verify that you in fact have an integer value

827778
width	height
presumably it comes from dimension the length width height of something

827787
switching	screens
for example open preview and choose file grab timed screens then switching back to the iphone simulator and hold the mouse button down on the row in the table view until the screens flashes

827808
codeigniter	kohana
see kohana s documentation - migrating from codeigniter

827808
codeigniter	kohana
kohana has changed substantially since forking from codeigniter

827859
haskell	sml	haskell	ocaml	ocaml	sml
sml ocaml haskell and f# use type inference algorithms based upon hindley-milner whereas scala has only local type inference like c# 3 and requires many more annotations to compile

827859
ocaml	sml
sml ocaml f#

827859
haskell	scheme
haskell mathematica and scheme

827859
haskell	sml	haskell	ocaml	ocaml	sml
sml ocaml f# and haskell allow closed sealed algebraic types to be defined to strengthen static typing by conveying more specific constraints implicitly

827859
haskell	sml	haskell	ocaml	ocaml	sml
ocaml and f# also allow open sum types whereas sml does not and haskell requires an elaborate workaround described by oleg kiselyov

827859
ocaml	sml
pattern matching is very fast in sml and vanilla ocaml but has unknown performance in f# due to active patterns and even unknown asymptotic complexity in mathematica

827859
lisp	scheme
f# lisp and scheme allow code

827859
haskell	sml	haskell	ocaml	haskell	scheme	sml	scheme	ocaml	sml	ocaml	scheme	lisp	sml	lisp	scheme	erlang	sml	erlang	lisp	erlang	ocaml	erlang	scheme
sml haskell 2010 common lisp and scheme are standardized languages whereas ocaml erlang f# and mathematica are proprietary

827895
post	get
but this passes a get request and chances are that you ll need a post

827913
vim	emacs
either of vim or emacs folding meets this need for me

827941
post	get
session_start creates a session or resumes the current one based on the current session id that s being passed via a request such as get post or a cookie

827947
post	get
if this is true then you should probably be using a get view rather than post

827954
accessor	properties
for example the windows token role provider has a lot of members that throw notimplmentedexception the token role provider is a read-only provider for ad so all of the properties set accessor throw exceptions

827960
yacc	bison
i ve not used bison but yacc allows you to override the error handling and i would hope the equivalent gnu tool was at least as powerful as our old unix clunkers

827961
equals	gethashcode
the dictionary will use gethashcode to determine if two lists are possibly equals and the equals method to determine if they actually are in other words the hash code is fast but could give a false positive but never a false negative

827961
equals	gethashcode
use your existing hashing algorithm the xor for gethashcode then just comare the two lists explicitly in the equals method

827981
range	minimum
at a bare minimum you will have to look at every line in the file up to and including the first one outside your range i m assuming the lines are in date time order

828010
hide	show
you can create a set of all possible controls in the same area of the parent window and show only the relevant one and hide all the others

828010
hide	show
when the user causes the control change you hide the active control and show the new relevant

828019
put	get
i also created a restful controller plugin to direct the different types of requests put get etc.. to the right controller action

828053
debian	linux
i m compiling some code which uses libcurl on a debian linux system

828066
min	max
convert your min max dates into seconds since epoch

828073
jboss	glassfish
the source is available for jboss glassfish oracleas

828092
division	modulo
in python and ruby signed integer division truncates towards negative infinity and signed integer modulo has the same sign the second operand

828092
division	modulo
however in c and java signed integer division truncates towards 0 and signed integer modulo has the same sign as the first operand

828229
objectdatasource	detailsview
detailsview with an attached objectdatasource in my case objectcontainerdatasource

828266
division	subtraction
believe it or not client side languages are actually quite capable of doing subtraction and division etc

828302
auto-generate	edmx
we created a edmx file which contains auto-generate entities

828330
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome seem to support this property as well

828376
readonly	temporary
the create temporary table and the drop table work fine with the readonly flag - if i comment the insert line it runs fine- but whenever i want to insert or delete from that temporary table i get the error message

828398
postorder	inorder
but i think inorder postorder pre-order is difficult

828482
post	put
i m gonna piggy back on your post if you don t mind since mine seems to be less active and you already put your rep on the line

828558
textchanged	keyup
validating will fire when the user is finished typing and moves focus from the textbox so if you need to do on the fly checking you could handle the textchanged or on of the keypress keyup event handlers instead

828558
min	max
if its asp.net you could use a combination of regularexpressionvalidator to account for comma seperation 1 decimal point etc... and a rangevalidator to set the min max values for a float

828614
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
ado.net is a big topic - but the keywords to search for here are sqlconnection sqlcommand sqldatareader etc

828631
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
it s much more difficult in 2.0 until you get your rythym down as previous poster i d recommend sqlconnection and sqldatareader etc

828730
postgresql	mysql
plenty of those firebird postgresql sqlite mysql to name a few

828747
javassist	cglib
to offset the conflict i followed some notes i found online about excluding cglib and javassist which hibernate my jpa impl uses

828916
width	height
i extended the shape renderer to always return a rectangle of the correct width and height and positioned it half a bar to the left of where it was supposed to be

828960
maven	m2e
as far as i can see flex builder only lets you use an absolute path so it can t see the maven dependencies even when using the m2e plugin to add maven support

829011
button	checkbox
then either the various radio button checkbox etc for your configuration settings

829047
min	max
you could do statistics as well calculating min max variance and number of threads users running

829047
wan	lan
the the server software can - if able to do so - use it s hardware as it will in the final setting where clients will run in a lan or wan

829082
jython	jacl
you can script websphere administrative tasks using jacl or jython

829156
submit	submission
when i am submission this form in view i need to know which submit button was pressed - i have many of them assigned to single form

829183
put	get
in short use loop which divide number modulo 10 to get reminder each digit and put it into array

829213
equals	gethashcode
if you take this approach you should make it immutable and override equals gethashcode as is appropriate for a struct

829227
ant	maven
ant or maven

829234
slideup	slidedown
you could slidedown slideup or use animate and define your own

829285
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
if malloc calloc realloc

829312
memcached	apc
if everything works use apc or memcached instead of files files usually work great but apc memc are faster

829312
memcached	apc
this technique works with memcached or apc too

829364
onreadystatechange	onload
it would appear the answer is use onreadystatechange in ie and onload in other browsers

829442
hide	show
it looks like you need hide show some html elements based on the user selection

829444
organization	naming
subsequent components of the package name vary according to an organization s own internal naming conventions

829455
udp	tcp
i have rule set up to drop udp tcp packets with matching strings

829560
onmousedown	onmouseup
the alternative is to handle the onmousedown and onmouseup events yourself

829574
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is all running on firefox which is currently a requirement for the users though it works fine in safari and google-chrome as well

829616
postgresql	mysql
for postgresql and mysql it s the limit keyword

829636
profiling	debugging
i know js debugging and profiling are part of it

829638
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql

829665
mouse	keyboard
after reinstalling the multiple ies i use i find that now i cannot focus on input fields either with the keyboard or mouse

829689
next	except
is there a statment like exit for except instead of exiting the loop it just moves to the next item

829704
chmod	mkdir
mkdir and chmod in a simple shell script should be sufficient

829761
inherited	properties
case and quote have a lot of similar properties so i also have a propertyobject abstract base class that they inherited from

829786
move	drag
for example when there s a box in the screen and the user clicks on it to select it it needs to get handles at the corners and in the center so that the user can move the mouse over such a handle and drag it to enlarge or move the box

829855
hash	salt
as a general rule all passwords should be hash and each password should have a unique salt

829856
hash	salt
the reason for a salt is so that a given generated attempt at a hash match is only useful for a single row of your users table in the db

829857
hash	salt
simply said use a cryptographically secure hash algorithm and some salt for the passwords that should be good enough for 99.99 of all use cases

829868
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
if malloc calloc realloc

829898
getter	setter
that s an example for dynamic getter and setter methods it allows you to execute behavior whenever an object property is accessed

829902
disk	ram
these upper limits would be defined by the amount of processing required too many and the game slows to a crawl or the amount of ram present too much and you could start frequently paging to disk which would seriously degrade performance

829903
hash	salt
a 128+ bit user-level salt random regenerated you make new salt when you make new password hash you don t persistently keep the same salt for a given user

829903
hash	salt
methodology that is somewhat different hash algorithm how many hashing iterations you use what order the salt are concatenated in something from both any standard implementation guides like these and from any other password storage implementation you ve written

829953
put	get
i put the jar on the jvm classpath and get this error

829987
x86	64bit
it s ok to be platform specific x86 32-bit 64bit

829995
xslt	xquery
xml xsd xslt xquery

830017
post	get
the controller behind it creates the object and adds it to the model on get and processes the changes on post submit

830017
put	get
i say magically because even though i put the parent object into the session on get i still never explicitly loaded the referenced object so it should be null or an empty proxy or whatever happens

830020
width	height
the only way i was able to do it with css is if i specified the same height and width to the image as the div

830020
width	height
therefore the javascript sets the same height and width as the parenting div of the image element

830090
hash	salt
for this reason i suggest that attached to each password a version number that tells you what scheme you used salt length which hash how many times

830090
hash	salt
the stored info is cost salt hash where cost is how many times the hashing has been done

830146
pull	push
i m going to need to push and pull files from a sharepoint site that is not hosted by my company it is external

830188
width	height
apply height and width directly since you know the tables size

830193
put	get
you ll need to use the sharepoint lists web service for metadata and get put for uploads

830193
put	get
assuming there is no metadata required and the sharepoint library is being used like a file server you can do most of what you want with put get but you will probably need a call to getlistitems to find the urls to download

830202
installation	upgrade
and even if the user elevates during installation administrative rights are still required for an upgrade using the automated air upgrade system since an upgrade is essentially behind the scenes an uninstallation of a .msi package followed by an installation of another .msi package

830238
chunked	transfer-encoding
using fiddler i was able to determine that the response is coming base as transfer-encoding chunked

830303
rss	feed
when i encountered such problem for rss feed i just called strip_tags before cutting my string

830320
inherited	properties
i am assuming properties doesn t also inherited from propertyobject

830320
inherited	properties
given that these tables properties case quote and message leads to a table per concrete class or tpc inherited strategy which i generally don t recommend

830347
firefox	safari
i have only been experiencing this problem in firefox safari and ie7 didn t have this mouse wheel scrolling problem

830401
post	get
there s also tutorials on the jquery site regarding their json functions for get and post

830520
post	get
i am trying to post data back to the server and get a dataset back

830551
inherited	properties
or you could play around with implementing the read only properties in an inherited child class but that may introduce all sorts of type issues

830579
put	get
what i want to do is get the html from the editor and then put it into the

830652
udp	tcp
you can also open a tcp or udp socket on localhost if you need to support multiple clients connecting to a central server

830683
explode	implode
explode on spaces sort the array implode then do the levenshtein

830693
serializable	deserialization
i have to implement iserializable in a derived class to do some custom serializable deserialization but the parent class is marked as serializable

830776
getter	setter
getter and setter are vastly easier to debug especially if you institute safeguards that throw a runtime exception if the object isn t properly populated

830785
uiview	uiwindow
the uikit reference says uiview is a superclass of uiwindow but despite of this parentage a uiwindow actually manages uiview

830785
uiview	uiwindow
yet i couldn t see why they do the reverse let uiwindow be the parent of uiview

830798
superclass	subclassing
i m guessing this is due to the fact that the controller superclass does not know of the existence of the subclassing s methods

830807
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have tested this in windows xp with the following browsers firefox 3 safari ie6 ie7 and google-chrome

830856
post	get
the params hash contains a collection of all get and post variables

830860
prefuse	flare
if you re willing to use the flash flex actionscript air development platform then take a look at the flare library from the prefuse project

830889
nswindow	nsresponder
in mac os x the parent class of nswindow is nsresponder

830889
uiview	uiwindow
in iphone os the parent class of uiwindow is uiview

830889
uiview	uiwindow	uiview	subviews
uiview objects are arranged within an uiwindow object in a nested hierarchy of subviews

830889
children	parent
parent objects in the view hierarchy are called superviews and children are called subviews

830892
cpython	ironpython
for example cpython beats ironpython hands down start up time

830892
cpython	ironpython
cpython executes a basic hello world nearly instantly 100ms where ironpython has an startup overhead of 4 or 5 seconds

830894
stdout	stderr
there is no way to redirect stdout or stderr for a service other than to handle those streams inside your service yourself

830909
width	height
enable2d caches the current modelview projection matrices and replaces the projection matrix with one normalized to the screen the width height of the screen and restores the identity matrix for modelview

830911
boost	stl
my current target platform is windows but i prefer to use stl and boost where possible to keep my code platform independent

830935
children	parent
i d like a query that given list mycontrols that contains all above controls with parent and children properties set as approriate can be parameterized with panela1 and return textboxa1 textboxa2 panela2 listboxa1 and listboxa2

830939
listview	gridview
i m tried something similar in wpf using a listview with a gridview and i cant seem to make it work

831031
children	parent
tablea is the parent table and tableb is the children s table it s something like a parent should have 1 or more children and each child can have only 1 parent

831039
children	parent
the parent don t depend on the children

831064
daemons	systemd
on the file systemd i have the entire repos dev tree checked on locally to dev and have created three eclipse workspaces one each in dev crontabs dev daemons and dev tools

831074
width	height
ie has in the past also had the issue that it took height and width to mean height-min and width-min thus still allowing boxes to resize eventhough they had specific limits set

831102
loops	if-statement
i could put the remaining code of loops in an if-statement

831208
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a simple page with a gridview that is bound in the aspx code to an objectdatasource

831210
pop-up	dialog
yes as long as the user grants your application privileges via the dialog that pop-up then java webstart will have access to the file-system and will have permission to use runtime.exec

831223
updatepanel	ascx
i have an updatepanel in an ascx page using .net 3.5

831300
xslt	xquery
is it available in .net 3.5 4.0 or are they stuck with xslt 1.1 and pushing xquery and linq

831310
cakephp	kohana	codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	kohana
i would look at zend cakephp codeigniter or kohana

831384
inherited	properties
i didn t realize this but you can already just set all those properties on the hbox and the labels inside it inherited them

831396
superclass	subclassing
here s an analogy with oo programming 1 define a superclass 2 define foo and bar as subclassing of it

831407
mbunit	nunit
if you are using mbunit or nunit for running your tests then you can use the rowtest and row attribute to pass in different values to the test

831450
post	get
i was able to add two instance methods to my post model that simply return nil when you try to get the previous post when viewing the first post or the next post when viewing the last post

831482
move	drag
i think i can handle the actual updating of the control but i m having trouble finding the from and to indexes of the item that has been move via drag drop

831519
aggregate-functions	sum
i want to take an ado.net datatable and perform the equivalent of a sql select query with aggregate-functions such as sum on some columns and group by set for the remaining columns

831540
src	attr
also keep in mind attr src will only return the src of the first img even if you have many

daemons	launchd
sql full-text filter daemons launchd mssqlserver

831586
width	height
also don t forget to close your src string which you re missing and that the src attribute may not be the last in the tag - for instance border width height etc

831592
put	get
my first thought is to put a try catch block around the kill call and log the exception you get if there is one

831620
many-to-many	one-to-many
a lot of blog applications use tags with a many-to-many relationship instead of categories with a one-to-many relationsip because it makes more sense to see an article as related to possibly many tags than to see an article as contained within a category

831623
dom4j	xom
i like xom more than dom4j for its simplicity and correctness

831653
spaces	linefeed
spaces 32 linefeed 10 carriage return 13

831723
ubuntu	debian
while i can easily find the binaries for the latest version of subversion 1.6 i can t find the binaries for ubuntu or debian

831746
post	get
activerecord sometimes tries to insert a 0 value into the id and i get errors such as can t find post with id 0 etc.

831751
onfocus	onblur
so you could have sounds on initially turn them off when onfocus is triggered and turn them back on when onblur is triggered

831826
width	margin
you can also add a left margin of at least 250px the width of the left_div to the right_div that way there will always be space for the left_div next to the right_div

831828
width	height
i have an ie6 absolute position div that i want to be full screen 100 width and height

831833
postgresql	mysql
s3 mysql postgresql sql server simpledb couchdb others

831857
decltype	auto
next c++ will get auto with different semantics than current auto and will be able to do that together with decltype to get the type of an expression

831861
puts	gets
however the blocking queue internally synchronizes so that when drainto is called puts and see note below gets will block

831861
puts	gets
note as of java 7 a separate lock is used for gets and puts

831910
postgresql	mysql
i think postgresql is a very viable alternative to mysql

831944
width	height
setup width 200 height 200 startx none starty none

831951
cout	ofstream
then just write to the ofstream like you d write to cout

831960
boost	stl
if you can use an external but very standard library boost s serialization may be of great help to you -- especially if you re looking to dump the contents of stl containers not obvious if this is what you want to do from your question

831986
innodb	myisam
innodb does however it does not support foreign keys to myisam tables for obvious reasons

832017
vim	emacs
emacs or vim cross-platform

832028
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
svn or a modern dvcs git mercurial or bazaar

832028
vim	emacs	vim	notepad++	vim	textmate	emacs	textmate	textmate	notepad++

832036
post	get
i should be able to upload pictures and videos to my favourite social networking account and also post get updates from thems change status make comments and similar stuffs

832086
gif	png
if you re lucky it ll be encoded as jpg png or gif and you ll be able to pass the bytearray directly to source on the image and flash player will already know how to interpret it

832111
filtering	grouping
i haven t been able to find an attribute in either the feature.xml or element.xml files where the custom print action is defined that would allow me to filtering the visibility to a grouping

832115
cpu	processors
on sparc at least you have psrinfo to show you processors information which run on its own will show you the number of cpu s the machine sees

832133
memcpy	memcmp
i am particular interested in the functions memcpy and memcmp and how to get these functions as fast as possible

832147
width	height
stage.stagewidth and stage.stageheight will refer to the full width and height of the stage

832200
memcpy	memcmp
glibc 2.8 does not use sse for memcpy or memcmp at all in x86 or x86_64 - it uses some hand-written assembly which avoids anything not supported on all cpus of the family

832213
post	put
what would post put and delete mean in this context

832226
memcpy	memcmp
if you compile with the highest optimization settings memcpy and memcmp might be replaced with intrinsics by the compiler and never call glibc at all

832229
richfaces	icefaces
seam + icefaces or richfaces if you need some of the robustness in exchange for the widgets is a different kind of approach but is also effective

832236
post	put
you would simply not allow post put or delete on that resource

832245
content-length	content-type
check the headers from the server especially content-type and content-length it s possible that your clients don t recognize the format of the binary file and hang while waiting for bytes that never come or maybe they close the underlying tcp connection which may cause iis to log the win32 status 64

832269
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uiviewcontroller can be grouped by uinavigationcontroller or uitabcontroller both of which add navigation elements to navigate between different uiviewcontroller

832269
switching	screens
for example tab controller draws tabs at the bottom of the screens so you can switching between views

832269
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
have a look at uinavigationcontroller uiviewcontroller and maybe uitableview

832273
profiling	debugging
you can also view the script profiling with a gui and debugging interactively works with eclipse and notepad++

832290
folder	directory
adding files to a folder within the virtual directory should not lead to a re-compile unless the folder is bin or app_code

832318
versioning	upgrade
dude upgrade your jvm first to the latest versioning

832350
post	get
post get data might be the

832359
min	max
if you re constantly looking up the min max value of a set then use a heap data structure which provides o 1 lookup to get the min max value and o log n lookup on any other value

832362
joystick	keyboard	hid	keyboard	hid	joystick	mouse	joystick	mouse	keyboard
if you want to use a gamepad joystick or any hid other than the keyboard and mouse then iup won t directly help in any case

persistence s3 mysql postgresql sql server simpledb couchdb others

832391
trac	mantis
i have used both trac and mantis on real projects and can recommend both

832392
mantis	bugzilla
we started by rolling our own a bunch of years back in lotus notes... then we switched to bugzilla then to mantis and finally to jira

832450
lisp	scheme
ruby is an obvious possible target as is scheme or lisp

832463
pull	push
when push comes to shove or even pull then i use wireshark because sometimes you really really need to know what s going on

832469
getter	setter
it would require a little more engineering on your part to manually line everything up but through the use of getter and setter the behavior will be transparent outside the class

832474
bmp	png	bmp	ppm	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
latest check in message states that they are for native encoding decoding for bmp png ppm and tiff encoding only

832481
lisp	scheme
i grew up on lisp and scheme and love them both

832481
lisp	scheme
it s got the functional beauty of a lisp or scheme well not quite but almost and it gives you some ability to dive into oop topics as well as hook into the .net framework for ui stuff if you want to spice things up

832483
post	get
when i first started doing web development ten years ago the conventional wisdom was to always favor post over get for forms and to have the application on the server side require post for form submission for precisely this reason

832483
post	get
browsers send get requests all the time like in the aforementioned img tag example but they only send post requests in certain circumstances specifically forms with the method attribute set to post

832486
pop-up	dialog
i want to create a link where when i click on it it will download a file to a specific location the desktop on the user s computer basically the save link as... dialog will pop-up with the desktop as the default location

832495
post	get
vanilla ajax calls use get or post and it is completely up to you how to handle them

832495
put	get	post	put	post	get
rest uses the verbs get head post put delete

832495
post	get
you want to use post over get when you are worried about csrf not xss

832495
post	get
a good rule of thumb is always use post and only use get if you are absolutely sure you want to share that data with other sites or the data is not sensitive

832496
post	get
the point isn t to prefer get over post the point is to use get where the request doesn t affect the data on the server and post where data is modified

832496
post	get
for example a search form will often use get while a create x form will usually use post

832498
libjpeg	libpng
in the past i ve directly used libpng and libjpeg directly to do this

832499
post	get
use get requests for getting a resource and post for posting one to the server

832499
post	put
post or put are designed for that

832512
post	get
there are situations when you should use post rather than get but avoiding xss isn t one of them

832512
put	get	post	put	post	get
and in fact rest advocates would actually say that you shouldn t just use get but that you should use post put and delete for the corresponding crud operations

832512
post	put
use post or put or delete if feasible and appropriate for write requests

832564
ati	nvidia
nvidia and ati especially are good resources for documents on this topic

832579
ssl	https
also if i negate the https and just use http i receive a 403.4 forbidden stating i am trying to access a page which has been secured with ssl so i m pretty sure that side of it is working

832581
post	get
however post vs get does prevent web accelerators and scrapers eg google bot from modifying your site

832581
post	get
they only go to get links and thus if you don t want to have your site deleted a la daily wtf post on this make sure that delete this item isn t a get

832581
put	get	post	put	post	get
get does not post a form thus is limited to whatever you can put in a url which is not much

832586
aptana	radrails
i use aptana radrails for my ruby on rails ide

832606
post	get
the already-given answers really do answer your question - no prevention of xss is not a valid reason to prefer post over get

832606
post	get
it s just as easy to inject code into a post request as into a get

832614
affinity	processors
microsoft s sysinternal s psexec s -a flag can set processors affinity on windows xp

832627
actionscript	mxml
you can easily solve your problem by declaring your service in actionscript instead of mxml

832644
versioning	upgrade
basically the question is what is the upgrade strategy for biztalk server applications from one versioning of application to another not biztalk server itself - which also another question upgrading to 2009

832651
puts	gets
when its time for your process to perform a contentious activity it gets with wait the single message from the cookie queue when contentious work is complete it puts the cookie back on the queue

832654
implements	extends
to do this extends zend mail transport abstract implements the _sendmail method which is where you will drop your zend mail object into the mail queue and pass the instance of your transport object to the send method of your zend mail object or by zend mail setdefaulttransport

832658
microsoft.build	msbuild
if you need to write code that creates modifies and runs msbuild files the microsoft.build

832682
ant	maven
it is amazing though that both ant and maven choose xml as their langauge to express build recipes with

832701
put	get	post	put	post	get
heck i ve a restful system that has various collection resources that allow get to fetch the collection and post to append a new resource to the collection and possibly other collections at the same time which then points to the newly created resource elsewhere whereas other resources support get put for updates and delete

832711
maven	pom.xml
i can take that same person and show them a maven pom.xml and they will not have any idea what is going on

832711
ant	maven
at the end of the day you cannot consider project startup with ant or maven a factor it s really the total cost of ownership

832776
inherited	properties
seems like you have covered most things here so the only thing i can think of is inherited properties sheets

832787
vim	emacs
most popular editors include eclipse vim and emacs

832797
post	get
i should have probably used get but used post i guess because in the event that js isn t available the regular form works just as well

832854
integer	radix
right now i convert the string containing the decimal number to an integer ignoring the radix point for now load it into st 0 and divide by the correct power of ten to account for the radix point

832886
division	exponent
off the top of my head i m tempted by the notion of constructing the mantissa part counting the number of digits and setting the exponent directly instead of doing division

832924
allocator	stl
console guys care about every allocator and if you are doing a multiplatform title you get into the wonderful world of different platform s stl implementations behaving differently and having different bugs although this situation has certainly improved in recent years

832924
allocator	stl
game developers also like to manage their own heaps and allocator and this can be difficult to deal with with stl

832969
int	boolean
boolean resync_to_start j_decompress_ptr int

833020
hide	show
you can observe uikeyboardwillshownotification and uikeyboardwillhidenotification to determine when to show and hide this toolbar and where to place it on the screen

833088
accessor	properties
imo you should be using the properties accessor whenever possible

833103
accessor	properties	getter	setter
i always use the properties accessor because the i am safe in case i add logic in the getter or setter in the future knowing for sure that no code bypasses it

833136
accessor	properties
if you are worried about the performance overhead of calling properties accessor when they just go directly to the field don t

833136
accessor	properties
it s better to stick with properties accessor because a you can be very consistent in all of your code which makes it more maintainble and b you get the benefits pointed out by others here

833154
udp	tcp
i don t know about throttling tools for tcp much less udp

833213
width	height
this is the width and height of the div in which the map has to be displayed

833231
postgresql	mysql
it can be configured to work as stand alone main memory database or as a transparent cache to mysql postgresql oracle databases

833241
jdom	xom
here is also 5-part artima interview with author about xom where they talk about what s wrong with xml apis the good the bad and the dom a design review of jdom lessons learned from jdom and finally design principles and xom

833271
openssh	jail
a google search on openssh jail led me to sshjail for openssh

833283
installation	upgrade
from this point on you need to figure out the methodology for the subsequent database installation upgrade and repairs

833332
jstl	taglib
there isn t one built into jsp or jstl but the request taglib from the jakarta project provides an isuserinrole tag

833350
verilog	vhdl
in the past i have had quite a lot of experience with formal verification although it was for hardware components vhdl verilog

833377
post	get
since this is a client-side api i did the following on the server side check for a custom session cookie holding the time offset value and if it s not available reload the page only during get and not post calls with some javascript logic added to generate the time offset and save it in the cookie

833414
setinterval	settimeout
if you re looking to scroll smoothly you could use basic javascript settimeout setinterval function to make it scroll in increments of 1px over a set length of time

833491
children	parent
the divs can have an infinite number of children and i want to be able to drag and drop all of the .maindiv s within their parent box so i have used this

833510
bindparam	bindvalue
i m wondering what the declaration of the data type in bindparam or bindvalue is used for.

833526
int	chars	int	double
the struct consists of 11 shorts 6 int 76 chars 7 floats 1 double totally adding to 158 bytes

833538
listview	gridview
i am using a listview instead of a gridview in 3.5

833542
ceil	floor
that returns a fraction which i m guessing you ll want to round in some way with ceil round or floor

833615
put	get
sun put quite a lot of effort in performance improvements in all aspects jvm as well as default libs and i see no reason why you would get it better

833641
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in firefox this seems to be working fine - but safari opera google-chrome all had issue

833645
versioning	upgrade
i have recently upgrade a project of mine from one of the beta builds of mvc to the full versioning

833654
profiler	visualvm
use a profiler i like visualvm identify the bottleneck and fix it

833738
int	chars
denote operator int as f operator ostream const chars as g

833745
int	chars
simply casting from int to chars only works if you want iso-8859-1 if you re reading bytes from a stream directly

833763
getter	setter
the packing problem i worked around by having getter and setter for the fields storing them in the array of byte of the class

833763
getter	setter
if setter getter are inlinable then not an option for me d6 it could be fairly cheap even

833774
folder	directory
easiest way perhaps not the best is to determine the root folder of the directory tree you are after then upon each file take the path relative to that folder and store it as another column path in the db table

833825
ubuntu	linux
check to see if you have multiple jvms present in linux you almost certainly do since ubuntu probably comes with a non-sun version and be 110 sure that you re using the expected version to compile

833838
vim	textmate
i m now switching to vim from textmate

833871
direct3d	directx
with direct3d 10 they ve split many of the functions that were in idirect3d9 relating to for example adapters into the directx graphics infrastructure dxgi

833910
vim	textmate
vim is very different from a number of other editors including textmate in this way

834032
kde	gnome
ubuntu depending on the variant comes with network managers for kde its the knetworkmanager and gnome is gnome-netstatus-applet

834069
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome and ie8 do not have this problem so it s a ie6 7 bug i suspect

834069
background-color	transparency
i thought about using a background-color transparency on the thead th.sorted but ie6 7 just paints the body background it looks like it cuts a hole in the other layers between the body and the th

834104
glassfish	weblogic
according to oss fast infoset tools implementations are already available on several platforms including microsoft .net and .net cf sun glassfish bea weblogic

834113
disk	ram
one straightforward way to sidestep the problem is to put all the source code on a ram disk

834135
profiling	debugging
so first i generated debugging version of application retaining the debugging information then generated release version and used shark to profiling and then used file symbolicate option and selected the debugging version of application from debug-iphoneos

834153
submit	submission
defenses include things like requiring the client to request a one-use token before their can submit data by generating a hidden input when the form is served up to stop third parties using their own form with malicious data and submission users to your site with js

834181
vsto	add-in
you can do as above and create yourself an add-in using vsto

834228
width	height
render all the textboxes as children of a div with fixed height and width and set oveflow property to auto

834239
width	height
i want my customized keyboard in iphone with height and width that i want

834243
folder	directory
look for app_data folder inside your application root directory

834270
folder	directory
on a successful build i wish to copy the contents of the output directory to a different location under the same base folder

834270
folder	dir
i want to copy the output dir contents to the following folder

834284
folder	directory
if none of the targetdir or other macros point to the right place use the .. directory to go backwards up the folder hierarchy

834290
jdom	dom4j
however it is available anywhere and if you settle on it you don t run into the i like dom4j i like jdom i like stringbuffer arguments that come from third-party libraries

834359
mockups	balsamiq
i ve used balsamiq mockups and have been real happy with it

834377
getter	setter
you can do that in the control s init event to make sure you have child controls through the whole lifecycle or you can do it whenever you need a reference to one of the child controls - in the getter setter of a property of your control

834395
igraph	networkx
i saw networkx and igraph but didn t see a way to output to ascii

834405
width	height
width and height are not

834513
ubuntu	linux
server os a linux distribution ubuntu is probably the most popular

834513
ubuntu	linux
most of the remainder use linux again often ubuntu and a variety of text editors

834677
pop-up	dialog
we can t use a timeout to close the pop-up because there s typically a dialog asking the user how to handle the file before downloading it and there s no way of knowing how long it will take the user to handle this dialog

834677
post	get
i could not solve the problem without appending the form data to a url for a get instead of a post and i have to set the site as trusted in ie this is an enterprise app so that s a reasonable request to make of the users

834677
content-disposition	content-type
in the response to the form url the request headers include content-type application octetstream and content-disposition attachment

834680
drawrect	layoutsubviews
you may not want to call layoutsubviews all the time from drawrect due to the performance hit involved in completely recreating a complex view hierarchy but you could at least figure out specifically which of the subviews need to be resized redrawn based on the passed cgrect and modify just those

834855
google-chrome	firefox
note i m certainly interested in super-powerful edit-your-whole-workspace-at-once ide features but i m also interested in simple but elegant ui s like firefox s find bar or google-chrome s find tab

834865
public	protected
of course the easy solution to this is to always call the protected virtual functions rather than their public variants replace b with bimp in the above snippet

834932
post	get
and sending post get via http is what i thought of as the simpler albeit insecure way to do it

834936
wtl	atl
atl is not very feature-rich but there is a good extension called wtl

834938
children	parent
this is a recursive function which prints out the tags of parent elements and the tags + contents of elements that have no more children

834998
post	get
kind of confusing because i really need to catch the submit of a particular form to get the correct post values therefore the selector of the form must be unique

835022
actionscript	mxml
first the mxml files are compiled into the equivalent actionscript classes

835046
config	ini
you can easily import config data as an ini file using the functions parse_ini_file or parse_ini_string

835083
daemons	systemd
many applications do not depend on syslog 3 and it is usually possible to stop and restart the syslogd daemons without detrimental effects on the systemd s operation much unlike csrss.exe

835084
config	ini
since php is not a compiled language though i don t see much real benefit to using ini or xml config files in php

835101
hide	show
trace is easy to show hide and includes quite a lot of extra information but doesn t appear to have any kind of persistence backing it

835161
put	get
i put trace logs and the code does seem to get executed i even replaced self dosomething with a sleep 2 but the intermediate loading view is never displayed

835241
post	get
sounds like all you need is something like libcurl which is an http library and will let you do get post etc

835259
hide	show
i am trying to show and hide a few form fields depending on the value of one of my select fields

835353
hash-collision	key
when hash-collision occur the hashtable dictionary calls equals to find the key you re looking for

835362
firefox	safari
while it works great on firefox i couldn t get it working smoothly on ie or safari

835382
hide	show
then in jquery dependent on the select-menu s value you can show hide these fieldsets

835382
hide	show
alternatively you can prefix each fields name with a meaningful prefix and then hide show according to that attribute

835479
postgresql	mysql
hosting providers will provide sqlserver mysql and postgresql but i can t even think of one that has oracle hosting

835626
sorting	filtering
this query will use the index on actif to avoid sorting and the index on profil_perso to find and filtering out the non-visible parrain s

835648
min	max
as a side note i believe that the answers do demonstrate that it could be a good interview question as long as the emphasis is not on the ability to remember trivia about the data type overflow and its implications that can be easily spotted during unit testing or the way of obtaining max and min limits can easily be looked up in the documentation but rather on the analysis of various ways of dealing with the problem

835658
redmine	trac
on top of version control which has been mentioned a few times already you should also look into a project management tool such as redmine or trac

835722
nant	cruisecontrol
for larger projects you will need something like nant or msbuild and cruisecontrol or teambuild

835727
for-loop	loops
to get the lowest value change the i for-loop to 0 to sizeof tbyteset - 1 and the if test in the j loops to if b shl j and 80 0

835729
put	get
the weird thing is that i ve been able to get the exact above code to display the texture in a program of its own yet when i put it into my main program it fails

835739
sharepoint	spsite
if you can offer any insight on other sharepoint objects spsite etc pertaining to my question or provide a link to further reading on this topic i would be very appreciative

835740
stateless	stateful
for instance in jboss seam the framework relies heavily on your knowledge of scope and stateless and stateful session beans where in symfony there is no such concept sort of

835755
extjs	mootools
when looking at extjs i don t get the feeling that it s meant for the same things as jquery and mootools

835755
extjs	mootools
whilst jquery and mootools help with the general workings of a site extjs seems to be focussed on tables and storing data plus manipulating it

835764
post	get
see this blog post for a discussion on how to get what to do about it

835769
ubuntu	linux
i just installed oracle on my amazon s virtual ec2 linux ubuntu server

835770
rss	feed
i vote for rss feed from other sites

835794
extjs	mootools
extjs is a full-fledged widget library while jquery not jquery ui and mootools are javascript frameworks that help with dom manipulation etc

835808
getter	setter
if you have some nice instance variables in your class such as an uiscrollview scrollview2 for example then why should you bypass the getter and setter by relinquishing a

835853
getter	setter
i used to bypass the getter setter too until i figured out that the bindings doesn t work when directly accessing the variable

835853
getter	setter
in other words key-value coding only works when accessing a property with the getter setter functions

835860
put	get
you put the neat stuff like a bubble dialogue box saying what it is and how to get directions to there

835878
keydown	keyup
the previewkeyup previewkeydown keyup and keydown events all fire on the textbox but alas no text shows up in the textbox

835898
int	chars
replace the first chars of that int s part of the string with a nul 0 - this terminates the combined string immediately after the course name

835918
getter	setter
if you bypass the getter or setter objects watching the value won t get the message

835960
ubuntu	linux
i need to get it working on linux rhel and ubuntu

835964
daemon	cron
the second sendmail instance runs a separate queue and its queue_mode is set to daemon or cron say every minute

836003
firefox	safari
it works in firefox safari but it does not work in ie for some reason

836006
children	parent
take an extreme case - say you have a dual core machine and you have a tree where each parent node has 4 children

836012
width	height
this is really fast because the jpeg de-compression can skip a lot of the data to fill a bitmap of only an eighth of width and height

836026
free	malloc
obviously memory that malloc allocates with mmap is free with munmap

836069
stdout	stderr
you can then watch for both stdout and stderr with channel.recv_ready and channel.recv_stderr_ready or use select.select

836095
inherited	properties
yeah it s because i m using a class for my properties profilecommon that inherited from profilebase

836137
google-chrome	firefox
in the meanwhile i still stick with firefox over google-chrome for the simple reason that firefox is i non-profit and has a ii huge addon community

836142
folder	directory
i would like to also create a folder in the layouts directory of the 12 hive and place a couple files in there

836169
pull	push
instead i need to keep one item at a time from each stream in memory and at each step compare the current item from each stream push the minimum onto the final stream and pull the next item from the appropriate source stream

836189
free	malloc
ms-dos heap managers often allowed using free memory until the next call to malloc

836189
free	malloc
new and delete in that era called malloc and free

836216
gif	png	width	height
the only solution i ve imagined so far is to make a png or gif image with 1px height and a very large width depends on your project could be like 1x2000px and do something like this

836251
getter	setter
a common jquery convention is to have .foo or .foo selector act as a getter and .foo value or .foo selector value act as a setter

836254
vb6	vba
i ve verified in vb6 that the code will in fact save some text to a file so if outlook actually runs the vba script it should be able to do the same

836278
super	implements
super simple to implements

836294
spweb	spsite	sharepoint	spsite
if you want an insight on performance with sharepoint objects you should read about spsite and spweb disposing

836366
packets	multicast
as far as i understand with multicast you d always know which interface the packets are received on since you always bind to a specific interface when joining a multicast group especially with ip4 where you bind to the interface via one of it s ip addresses

836410
children	parent
i would go with the idea of having a main table representing your parent and auxiliary tables representing the children

836445
post	get
then send the request to the function which you should be able to call by querying a php file with get or post request like that xmlhttp.open get myfunction.php true

836452
post	get
if you run into any problems down the road post your questions here and i m sure you ll get the answer you re looking for

836465
dictionary	map
another approach could be to have an application variable that contained a map or dictionary of locked items

836465
dictionary	map
so when one user hits edit add an entry to the appvariable map or dictionary with the key set to the primary id of the field being edited

836465
dictionary	map
the only real downside is 1 you would need to create one application level dictionary or map for each table that you want to lock unlock

836473
haskell	ocaml	haskell	scheme	ocaml	scheme
i m tired of seeing functional-programming advocates show how quicksort can be implemented in one line in haskell ocaml f# scheme etc

836485
unix	solaris
also a basic understanding of unix is not hard to achieve i have found my way around solaris ubuntu and os x coming from a windows background - a few simple tutorials should get you up and running

836485
g++	gcc
for writing small school projects there is not much you need to know cd ls mkdir make gcc be sure to use g++ for c++ projects - that has bitten me on my mac before...

836497
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu especially isn t really that hard to use but the lack of a real ide for development usually throws folks off

836535
builtin	isinstance
if you do want to make a special-case for an argument being a string use the isinstance builtin and compare to basestring which both str and unicode are derived from for example

836586
stdout	stderr
error messages should be written to stderr aka console.error and normal output to stdout aka console.out

836641
pthreads	fork
first install cygwin this provides unix like environment for windows with pthreads api that mingw doesn t provide for example fork

836678
ienumerable	iqueryable
first off iqueryable implements ienumerable so that is why you are potentially seeing both

836710
profiling	benchmarking
it s pretty much the same process as any other optimization profiling experiment benchmarking repeat

836743
profiling	benchmarking
benchmarking optimization software with performance profiling

836766
cvs	svn
i ve worked with vss cvs svn and tfs

836773
rsa	dsa
imagine some one breaking in to the database and stealing those private keys gifs or rsa dsa keys

836790
kerberos	ldap
they could for instance be authenticating against kerberos ldap nis or any other number of sources

836805
gson	xstream
i attempted to use the gson library but it cannot deserialize concrete objects when i only have it expect generic super classes xstream and jettison handles this because type information is baked into the serialization

836805
xstream	jackson
i looked at the jackson java json processor but when you were reading in objects from a stream you had to specify what type of object it was unlike xstream where it will read in any object because the serialized xstream json contains class name information

836835
multiplying	add
i have previously been using my own subclass of array i call it numericarray with added functions such as sum mean add multiplying etc

836847
postgresql	mysql
dblinq supports many other databases mysql postgresql firebird

836856
addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication
also addition is faster than multiplication and multiplication is faster than division

836856
addition	multiplication
so with all of that in mind you should be able to simplify the most inner loop using primarily addition and multiplication of integers

836860
int	chars
if you really need the chars index from the string you can deduce it by counting newlines int the string and adding the column

836875
versioning	upgrade
in versioning 1.35 boost foo was upgrade and new member was added so boost foo from 1.33 and 1.35 are

836955
jobs	cron
combine this with a cron that starts jobs as they are scheduled even if they are scheduled to run at the same time and that solves the problem you described as well

836958
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you can do it by adding a .htaccess on the index or doing the configuration in the httpd.conf

836976
maven	m2e
you can execute the maven targets off the right-click run as or debug as menu and even manage custom goal execution using the maven build... shortcut -- this is all similar to m2e

836976
myeclipse	m2eclipse
if you decide you want to use m2eclipse complete you can navigate to window preferences myeclipse maven4myeclipse and check the enable all m2eclipse features checkbox

836980
addition	multiplication
for me it s the same as when you do not use parenthesis for when doing multiplication and addition in the same statement because the language documents that the multiplication operations will get carried out first

837009
folder	directory
we have a folder where our app will be potentially reading writing and creating deleting files on and while we can default to a safe location we allow the user to select a different directory

837013
disk	ram
my machine has 4gb of ram and fast disk

837061
folder	directory
i m not sure how to solve it but the reason is becaus iis is treating it as a directory which it is and doesn t have any knowledge about how to pass the folder to the asp.net isapi filter and trigger the .net handler

837067
disk	ram
i don t have the privileges to create a ram disk but perhaps something along those lines

837134
public	protected
a similar question could be asked for widening access parameters - eg overriding a protected internal method with a public method something which java supports iirc

837158
implements	extends
creating user-defined type that extends null paradigm with additional notavalue value might be an answer but i need some more guidance on how to implements it

837174
public	protected
re making a protected internal method into a public method

837214
ubuntu	linux
i agree with others that if you install something like ubuntu linux it s not that hard to learn

837221
getter	setter
course as soon as you want to do something like validation in the setter this doesn t work and you have to go back to writing setter and getter and declaring a backing variable

837277
sorting	filtering
you probably want to improve filtering or sorting capabilities of your application

837283
firefox	safari
a quick test on firefox 3 and safari 3.2 shows that an input field that is missing the name attribute but has an id attribute is not submitted

837285
x86	64bit
visual studio is x86 until at least the 2010 release comes around update this is still an issue in vs2010 there is no native 64bit cassini support

837285
x86	64bit
the first solution was to load oracle x86 in 32-bit more x64 in 64bit mode we did this by replacing the assembly reference when running under 64bit via the web.config like this

837308
implements	extends
the second one allows you to extends the number of preferred suppliers over time and you can still internally implements these as two seperate methods

837337
implements	extends
write it yourself extends implements

837460
try-catch	exception-handling
to prevent an exception-handling in a handler from propagating to the event generator the answer is to manually invoke each item in the multicast delegate the event handler inside of a try-catch

837466
hash	salt
just store a salt hash instead and use that

837466
hash	salt
for example your cookie could contain the username and a salt hash of database password hash + ip address range

837469
lisp	prolog
this may be an impossible task but i m trying to stay away from lisp or prolog and i m looking for examples that would be directly applicable to game development

837490
cgpoint	cgrect
why not just an id based on the tag and the coordinates cgpoint or cgrect

837602
textarea	textbox
discovered in the comments on the tredosoft site that installing ie8 breaks textbox textarea in the multiple ie browser

837646
pop-up	dialog
a very simple approach would be to add javascript to your page to pop-up a new browser window dialog something like this

837664
feedback	review
we would perform what we called code design review in-house which involved a group of individuals who independently looked at the product on their own and asked questions and or wrote comments against the product to provide the author with feedback from the team without the pomp and circumstance of a formal inspection

837714
post	get
this post - custom query with castle activerecord had a good example about how to achieve this but i can t seem to get it to work

837748
ssl	https
do i just need an ssl certificate installed into our web server and simply access the wcf service via https and possibly be able to just use basichttpbinding

837761
versioning	upgrade
this has a great sections on side by side versioning and leveraging msis for upgrade

837762
firefox	safari
they work fine in ie8 firefox safari etc but not ie7 and ie6

837788
width	height
in my app if the user wants to resize the image a new form pops up and asks the user to input an new width and height for the image

837789
getter	setter
i d like the model to write and fetch the resource from the file system so i naturally want to override the getter and setter to do this

837841
post	get
i will update this post as i get good tips for good techniques for showing of your work creativily

837855
win64	windows
one source of complexity is that the win32 and now win64 api is a subsystem that lays on top of the windows nt native system

837866
hash	md5
i m not saying ignore the issue and like i said this doesn t really have much bearing on whether or not you should use md5 sha1 or whatever to hash your passwords but i do get tickled slightly pink every time i read someone getting a bit too upset about plain text passwords in a database

837931
mouseover	mouseout
i tried unbinding on mouseout and rebinding on each mouseover

837931
hide	show
i eventually needed to add a tools row to each item and show hide on mouse over out

837976
subtract	add
no matter what every ace should be counted to sum value as 11 then when the total sum has reached over 21 subtract 10 from hand but the thing is you must make sure you keep a count of how many times you subtract 10 and how many times you add 11 an ace

837976
subtract	add
add 11 subtract 10 - must always be satisfied

838024
post	get
i get the same error described in this other so post

838032
hash	md5
hence i do recommend that you use a stronger hash function than md5 here

838032
hmac	md5
i also recommend that you use hmac instead of just md5 m+t+p because hmac has been designed for the situation that you describe and has accordingly been analyzed

838054
bazaar	git
source code management software such as bazaar git mercurial or subversion might be useful

838071
g++	gcc
you can have multiple versions of gcc on your box to select the one you want to use call it with full path instead of g++ use full path usr bin g++ on command line depends where your gcc lives

838119
implements	extends
another key issue i want to consider is the flexibility ease to extends the platform either sharepoint or connections to implements customize the functions i mentioned above

838121
hash	salt
send the hash of the software + a random salt along with the score

838121
hash	salt
the random salt should change every time the hash is generated current sys time or something like that

838131
uiview	subviews
you can either add myview as a subviews of the current view using uiview addsubview if you are going to have a done button or something like that on myview to remove itself

838131
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
or if you want the user to be able to navigate back to the main view like in mail notes etc the most common way to do that would be to add a navigationcontroller to your window and using pushviewcontroller animated to present your views

838137
width	height
i was wondering if there was a way to determine the height width of a browser

838143
wan	lan
clients from a slow lan or wan link

838157
superclass	subclassing
in particular problems are likely to appear with instances of a subclassing or superclass

838167
serializable	deserialization
create a property that would implement serializable deserialization map that property to the desired column in hbm

838182
inherited	properties
i ve found in the past that you can use a style to set properties on a usercontrol from xaml without inherited

838187
ilist	icollection
hashtable.values is an icollection - but you need ilist to bind data

838192
getter	setter
a keyword like â œrestrictedâ where this field could only be accessed from its getter setter

838210
blackfish	interbase
we also primarily use interbase and blackfish sql as our databases but most ms-centric shops would prefer some flavor of ms sql

838210
trac	bugzilla
then you also need an issue tracking system like jira fogbugz bugzilla trac which can be used with subversion or something else

838211
int	chars
i know that the chars is converted into an int but i am trying to limit anything other than pure int getting through the function

838212
try-catch	exception-handling
in general a try-catch is used to catch exception-handling as illustrated in the following code

838225
int	chars
no it s impossible because java itself upgrades the chars to an int if it can

838225
int	chars
you could make an overload of your function that takes a chars parameter instead of an int which might throw an exception but that won t stop anyone from casting the chars to an int and calling the int version

838225
int	chars
there is absolutely no difference at all between the chars constant a cast to an int and the int 65 so it would be completely impossible to distinguish the cases

838225
int	chars
i would argue that explicit casting is not passing a chars it s the caller converting a chars to an int then passing the int

838235
int	chars
unless your int are confined to a range that is outside the range of a chars then you cannot do this since you cannot tell whether a value 64 is an int or a chars

838243
put	get
if you take the square root of both sides you get x 2 but now you must put in the plus or minus sign to make sure you aren t missing any possible solutions

838256
int	chars
the casting of chars to int will occur at compile-time so it won t be possible to determine whether a chars was passed in or an int was passed in

838256
int	chars
in order to illustrate let s examine the source code and the resulting bytecode of a program which has a somemethod int which is called by passing an chars and int

838256
int	chars
therefore at runtime it won t be possible to find out whether the method argument was either an int or chars as the casting is performed by the compiler

838258
vim	emacs
i am looking for an equivalent of the bufdo vim command in emacs

838298
yourkit	jprofiler
use one of the many good commercial profilers jprofiler yourkit ...

838330
accessor	properties
now when inside the implementation if you want to access the instance variable directly you could just use _label but to go through the properties accessor methods which take care of retain releases and a bunch of other book-keeping tasks you would use self.label

838340
int	chars
the fact that you use the type chars instead of the type int is because you want a number that is 16 bits instead of 32 bits

838341
unix	aix
suggestions for unix aix platform + gcc are also invited

838416
wan	lan
svn is faster because it was meant for wan as opposed to vss which is for lan

838424
hash	md5
collisions in the compression function do not imply that collisions in the hash function exist but we can t find collisions for md5 unless we can find collisions for its compression function

838489
int	chars
asking why the individual chars of a string are not mutable is therefore like asking why the individual bits of an int are not mutable

838500
webclient	webrequest
you can assign the proxy property of your webrequest or webclient object to a webproxy object that has the required settings applied

838616
equals	tostring
it could be done via reflection as some libraries already create the tostring or equals methods

838623
passenger	thin
app server mongrel thin passenger for dynamic requests

838648
int	boolean
the main difference with c c++ is that c c++ allows you to mix int and boolean whereas java doesn t

838648
int	boolean
but i think it s bad practice to use int as boolean anyway

838720
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer congruent to the

838768
trigram	fuzzy
one of my favorite methods for fuzzy string matching is trigram matching

838818
inherited	properties
this is because the ul li elements have inherited the zero-margin properties

838876
multicastdelegate	delegation
if you want to guarantee that each event handler gets called in the class that raises the event then you ll need to iterate over each delegation within the multicastdelegate and invoke it individually within a try-catch block

838922
postgresql	mysql
late answer but there is a new open source software for asynchronous master-master replication of postgresql also works for mysql

838925
getter	setter
if i want to read this xml into a java object i would be creating a java bean called personbean with getter setter for the attributes as

838950
children	parent
much like in a parent - children relationship

839113
getter	setter
the problem is that the property is public - because of the public getter - and it is writeable - because of the private setter

839116
subtract	add	int	chars
if you need to compare add and or subtract time only values think about the possibility to use a int to store the time value and then to convert it to chars when displaying the result

839118
inotifypropertychanged	icommand
suppose i have a ui-ready model for example implements inotifypropertychanged i use the presenter to bind this model to a view presenter knows an interface of the view keeping my code-behind as small as possible handling only bindings model and commands properties or methods or events for controls that don t have icommand and in this case immediately being delegated to the presenter

839158
post	get
so when i start the vb.net app it just simple calls the p.php get but post doesnt work

839165
nfa	dfa
lookahead - have speculative transitions use an nfa instead of a dfa

839180
public	protected
the following will return non-zero if there is at least one property with a protected or public setter

839180
public	protected
note the check for getsetmethod returning null no setter and the test for isprivate not public or protected rather than ispublic public only

839199
implements	extends
if it seems feasible at all you can implements what you need for your plugin and then hand the result over to the eclipse community to extends

839211
uitableview	uisearchbar
i have a uitableview with a uisearchbar at the top of it

839219
mouse	keyboard
in mac os x you can look in system preferences keyboard mouse modifier keys

839310
alloca	malloc
new on stack instead of heap like alloca vs malloc

839349
ant	maven
i know that i can run ant form maven but if theres a maven plugin doing it i d prefer that one

839352
post	get
how would i get that to show the last post title as well

839387
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	redhat	fedora
if you re using a linux flavor you ve probably got a package management system thinks .rpm for fedora redhat or .deb for ubuntu debian

839387
ubuntu	debian
you could roll your own packages for company specific software create a repository perhaps only available on the local network and then your setup could be reduced to a single bash script which would add the company repo to etc apt sources.list debian ubuntu and then call a command like

839391
post	get
i m trying to get into unit tests for a biztalk application i m working on following the example in michael stephensons blog post and seemed to be getting somewhere

839407
int	chars
to a binary file the compiler will usually leave an unnamed unused hole between the chars and int fields to ensure that the int field is properly aligned

839495
union	distinct
note that union filters out duplicate rows like distinct

839544
addition	modulo
the answer is that for modulo addition of 1-bit values 0+0 1+1 0 and 0+1 1+0 1

839604
inherited	subclassing
the definition of subclassing is that it extends another class and inherited the state and behaviors from that class

839634
superclass	subclassing
in oop theory class cannot be its subclassing or superclass

839661
google-chrome	firefox
tested this in google-chrome 1.0 firefox 3.0.10 and ie7

839664
superclass	subclassing
for my understanding the superclass is always smaller less complex then the subclassing

839665
int	chars
to configure your program using command line arguments declare your main function like int main int argc const chars const argv and use a loop to go over the arguments in the argv array

839668
put	get
and to get the start address it will work thought the whole virtual memory space to find a hole which could put the chuck of mem to be allocated

839738
jquery	scriptaculous
most commonly this can be accomplished using any popular javascript library such as jquery or prototype scriptaculous

839741
superclass	subclassing
one of the benefits of object oriented programming is that subclassing can be used in place of their superclass

839770
qpainter	qwidget
also it s unnecessary to call qpainter begin and qpainter end when you construct it using a qwidget parameter

839774
superclass	subclassing
in your example the size of the subclassing doesnâ t matter because you are allocating memory for the big fat subclassing on the heap then you store the pointer to it in a pointer to a superclass

839848
put	get
i have seen reports that show mysql to be faster for some simple scenarios put to single table get from single table

839848
disk	ram
my experience is that any perceptible slowness in a website is due to one of 1 insufficient hardware for the db simply not enough disk i o or enough ram or 2 complexity of database needs related to necessary contention for what you want to get done

839939
firefox	safari
i have checked this in firefox and safari only

839944
put	get
like you in the preview pane i get bogus values even though my xml file may contain actual data along with the schema but when i actually run the crystal report i get the expected out put

839967
spaces	delimiter
alternatively the below might be better if spaces is being used as a delimiter

840061
interpreted-language	compiled-language
there is no way in hell an interpreted-language can beat a compiled-language at runtime speed

840070
hide	show
i am using jquery to hide and show my forms but this should not be an issue

840085
pop-up	dialog
i have checked it does add the values to the orderstatus parameter but when the report runs the crystalreports dialog pop-up and asks me to enter values for the orderstatus parameter

840100
viewdidload	viewwillappear
do whatever you re doing in viewdidload in the viewwillappear method instead - your image property will be set when pushviewcontroller animated calls viewwillappear

840123
appdata	denied
my application vb.net sometimes throws an access denied exception when attempting to delete files in the appdata folder and i m not sure why

840138
put	get
i need to get a part of the text that is stored in that column and put it into a different column on the same row

840303
temporary	tablespace
note that ms sql unlike oracle cannot swap recursion stack into temporary tablespace so you may experience troubles when generating large datasets

840352
int	double
the issue was related to casting converting double to int

840370
client-side	server-side
to achive this you can use the jaxwsserverfactorybean server-side and jaxwsproxyfactorybean client-side classes provided with cxf see this page for sample code

840373
bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	bazaar	perforce	perforce	cvs
git is used for version control of files much like tools such as mercurial bazaar subversion cvs perforce and visual sourcesafe

840383
g++	gcc
in gcc g++ compile with -s

840433
atoi	atof
you could use atoi or atof and then check if the value returned by this function is not 0

840437
xna	slimdx
that has since been wrapped into microsoft xna which is probably not a good fit for you but the mdx wikipedia article recommends something called slimdx that might be okay

840440
move	drag
i m not using drag since the mc doesn t move with the mouse all the time but rather using onmousemove to update the mc location according to _xmouse _ymouse and some other calculations

840540
profiling	debugging
the development environment requires a mac but you can get the entire ide + tool chain + excellent debugging and profiling tools for free

840546
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in firefox 3 google-chrome ie6

840568
vim	emacs
its windows style ui is probably quite quick to learn for most people compared to vim or emacs anyway

840571
rtp	rtsp
it currently supports a v capture and playback in a wide variety of data types as well as streaming via rtp and rtsp

840584
margin	height
if that element has vertical padding or margin itâ s added to the height of the block according to the css specification see the visual formatting model for absolutely positioned non-replaced elements

840596
xapian	whoosh
check out haystack search - a new model based search abstraction layer that currently supports xapian solr and whoosh

button	checkbox
this is produced by an html page which i have created the one with checkbox and a create button

840638
post	get
i also know the mysql code to link with the database but not how to code to post information to the database from the web pages via php handling to the database or get information from the database

840697
post	get
in defence of rest it closely follows the principles of http and addressability read operations use get update operations use post etc

840706
rss	feed
sitemap based on rss feed submitted

840706
rss	feed
annotations sucessfully submitted based on the rss feed

840730
git-svn	svn2git
using svn2git might produce better results than git-svn if you have tags or branches.

840758
post	get
approach 2 use custom fields for the separate content sections for a single post number of disadvantages here but it might be more straightforward to get something quickly.

840765
youtube	vimeo
our website lets people add videos by submitting a url - usually one from youtube or vimeo

840802
stdout	stderr
stderr and not on stdout as i would expect

840802
stdout	stderr
i would prefer to have the errors emitted on stdout rather than stderr

840803
hash	salt
i have some problems to understand why you include a salt since a salt is commonly use to avoid that an attacker precomputes hash of dictionaries

840803
hash	hmac
i m not sure why you want to hash the message before computing the hmac

840847
ssms	sqlcmd
while sqlcmd.exe is the best way ssms also has a sqlcmd mode where you can execute a sqlcmd script

840854
sharepoint	spsite
you need to identify what object in the sharepoint object model the directory is for example is probably a spsite with in the site you can have a directories that are spfolders splists spdocumentlibraries etc

840854
splist	spsite
you will need to identify what kind of object you are trying to add spfolder spsite splist spdocumentlibrary ect.

840888
interpreted-language	compiled-language
how does code written by one language particularly an interpreted-language get called by code written by a compiled-language

840985
strtol	atof	strtol	atoi	atoi	atof
instead of using functions like strtol atoi atof

840985
int	chars
you could define your own function which has parses chars by chars of the string and builds the output int

840989
int	boolean
so the best approach here is either to use a wider type than int number or pass some flag boolean value to function as well as int to indicate actual value absence

841083
vim	emacs
it can be integrated with visual studio emacs vim and others and can format just the selected lines or with git svn to format some diff

841084
hide	show
one idea would be to apply the floating style via css then you could select on the class name and do a show hide as necessary

841096
qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel
i have a qtreeview hooked up to a qabstractitemmodel which typically has thousands of nodes in it

841119
submit	submission
this one works partially - if no drop down is selected it will display the error message but that doesn t stop the form from submission it just displays the error text while the form submit

841135
wav	riff
seems like a combination of open ... rb struct module and some details about the wav riff file format probably better reference out there will do the job

841182
accessor	properties
i have to disagree with jaredpar on this the get accessor of the handle properties calls createhandle if the handle is not yet created you can check with reflector

841218
for-loop	loops
so the for-loop inside getcompanies won t loops over anything since total is still set to 0

841226
tolower	toupper
i ve read that it s unwise to use toupper and tolower to perform case-insensitive string comparisons but i see no alternative when it comes to linq-to-sql

841226
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
the ignorecase and compareoptions arguments of string.compare are ignored by linq-to-sql if you re using a case-sensitive database you get a case-sensitive comparison even if you ask for a case-insensitive comparison

841261
ienumerable	iqueryable
to that extent ienumerable and iqueryable do the half right thing tm but they are clearly inferior in their concepts of iteration and much more to what you can do with stl retain control and so on and on but otoh they have better metadata and hence a better cleaner model

841319
google-chrome	firefox
i now support firefox and ie but google-chrome fell out because of it

841337
post	get
for the sake of testing i simplified the process by removing all post data and the success callback function but i still get different results

841342
tolower	toupper
as you say there are some important differences between toupper and tolower and only one is dependably accurate when you re trying to do case insensitive equality checks

841342
tolower	toupper
he says string.toupper â use toupper rather than tolower and specify invariantculture in order to pick up os casing rules

841352
erlang	lisp
if you think this approach would work well you could try xlloop - this allows you to easily write excel functions in java python ruby perl r lisp erlang

841364
nsbezierpath	appkit
unfortunately there s no way to just ask for each element like there is with appkit s nsbezierpath

841537
post	get
similar to a previous post you can get the same issue if you delete an entry

841542
implements	extends
third my threads should implements runnable instead of extends thread see so question below

841561
children	parent
you would do this with a combination of parent and children

841573
codeigniter	cakephp
the main ones i ve heard of are zend cakephp symfony codeigniter and one or two other ones i can t recall the names of right off the bat

841589
range	minimum
you can have large minimum or maximum values in your interval with range if their difference is small

841603
hide	show
or perhaps use collapsiblepanels from the ajaxtoolkit to hide and show the upload form

841642
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
ed also istr many desktop environments like gnome kde xfce and even cde supporting some sort of save session on logout thing

841740
udp	tcp
the raw data can be found at proc net tcp proc net udp etc

841762
width	margin
if you want to center an element you would give it a width and set the margin 0 auto like this

841800
post	get
the get request is considerably simpler than a multipart post request

841817
typedef	typename	typedef	struct
you do not need typedef for struct or classes the typename will automatically be available in the namespace

841833
min	max
the bearing to the latitude min max appears to be a function of the latitude of circle-center and circle-radius sphere circumference 4

841840
post	get
but unfortunately if you follow the link to my question and then read his blog post a little carelessly you might get the impression that he is dismissing the empty delegate technique

841901
folder	directory
when i drag a folder onto the nstableview it calls adddirectorytolist - which recursively loops over all files contained in this directory calling addfiletolist on each

841985
client-side	server-side
so if you use javascript to disable the html element in the client-side onclick event the input element will be disabled when the browser assembles the post request the server won t be properly notified which element raised the postback and it won t fire server-side click event handlers

841996
ant	maven
iirc it supports the ant syntax as well as the foo maven syntax

841997
wtl	atl
the ddk samples are generally written to be free of dependencies on things like mfc atl wtl and the like

842054
children	parent
which i need to split on the minor-group element while retaining both its children and direct parent and put all that for each minor-group in an external file

842089
superclass	subclassing
creating a subclassing should mean more than just a convenient way to call superclass methods

842089
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
you should use inherited when subclassing is-a superclass both structurally and functionally when it can be used as superclass and you are going to use that

842139
stdout	stderr
it allows you to redirect stdout and stderr to files

842147
width	height
they re all the same width maybe 400px or so but different height

842147
width	height
they re all the same width but different height

842175
perl	tcl
another benefit to tk is the fact it works with tcl perl python and ruby and others so you aren t stuck with a particular language

842175
perl	tcl
for more on tk with tcl ruby and perl see

842198
qcodo	qcubed
qcubed a branch of qcodo is under active development and has been since nov 2008

842198
qcodo	qcubed
qcodo and qcubed are fantastic frameworks

842214
nullpointerexception	classcastexception
the problem with that is that if you did all that to avoid the nullpointerexception now you re going to simply replace it with unexpectedobject exception or classcastexception or what not

842238
cpu	hyperthreading
hyperthreading is a way of multiplexing a cpu between multiple threads - there is only one real cpu but it is visible to the operating system as two cpu s and thus two threads can be scheduled on it

842322
hash	md5
the code i used for generating the necessary md5 hash is up on my github repository in the commoncrypto subfolder

842346
children	parent
just access the parent and then the children

842358
pow	sqrt
math.sqrt is probably just the c implementation of sqrt which is probably related to pow

842399
opera	firefox
however when i use ... datatype json ... the browser opera and firefox so far but i ll bet it s universal asks to save open the results of the request

842419
addition	multiplication
no if you have ever taken a parsing or compiler course you would understand that this is like saying addition and multiplication is overhyped for math problems

842422
quicksort	heapsort
copy the list to an array and use heapsort or quicksort then copy it back

842446
stdout	stderr
if you want them to instead echo to stderr you can pipe stderr to stdout with the construct

842476
getter	setter
whenever i try to write tests i only end up testing basic stuff that i probably shouldn t be testing in the first place getter setter but it doesn t look like the objects have anything else

842492
mouse	keyboard
you could easily set up a few bodies with initial masses positions and velocities and use the keyboard or mouse to adjust the properties then start simulating

842503
int	chars
let s try to build a function taking a pointer to a function taking nothing and returning int and returning a pointer to a function taking a chars and returning int

842570
folder	directory
in the example below i would like to have the logfiles stored in the logs folder under the current directory

842585
min	max
how much ram it is currently consuming not how much is reserved or its max or min

842586
stdout	stderr
so now we have something that actually outputs to both stdout and stderr so we

842605
post	get
so in essence you were telling rails to expect a post when it was receiving a get

842610
interpolation	splines
one can look at this as primarily a smoothing problem using a filtering tool to smooth the data only afterwards to interpolation using some variety of interpolant perhaps an interpolation splines

842610
interpolation	splines
finding a local maximum of an interpolation splines is an easy enough thing

842619
system.in	system.out
long answer in java all console operations are handled through input and output streamsâ system.in is an input stream and system.out and system.err are output streams

842645
post	get
but when you change it to post it will then map a get to users login to the default which is the users controller and show action for a user with an id of login - which is not what you want

842660
int	chars
this give you the automated hex-to-ascii on the side as well as the various chars int decodes at the bottom

842665
implements	extends
if i create a base class and it extends an interface there is an explicit contract defined for every method in the interface the base class must implements said method

842665
implements	extends
let s say i create a base class which extends vbox and implements the interface

842665
implements	extends
thus any class which extends the abstract class would then be required to implements the methods therein

842665
implements	extends
so i could create a base class which implements interface and extends the vbox and inherit from it and i could insert code in those methods which need to be extended

842680
sorting	filtering
sorting filtering highlighting for tables trees and lists

842715
folder	directory
after analyzing websvn i found out that they use the svn export directory functionality to download the source to a local folder and then zip the directory on the fly

842801
min	max
why min works while max does not give any results

842802
client-side	server-side
server-side can also be more flexible in rendering as you can access data sources which you don t have on the client-side

842826
pygtk	gtk#
it is designed with language bindings in mind and allows create nice language bindings pygtk ruby gtk2 java-gnome gtk# and more

842837
width	height
you ll need to run it height x width times

842875
put	get
you can put this call in a loop and read until you get the number of bytes you re expecting

842922
pdcurses	ncurses
given that you seem to want a textual interface i suggest taking a look at the portable version of ncurses pdcurses

842945
ssl	https
you can have a basichttpbinding and still assign transport-level security https with ssl to it

842951
viewdidload	viewwillappear
take the code that sets the button up in the viewdidload method and move it into viewwillappear

842969
hash	md5
md5 sha1 and many other hash functions are also using this davis-meyer construction and hence they are in principle based on a block cipher

842984
set	bag
if you remove the id column but don t wipe out duplicates you end up with a bag of rows not a set

842988
innodb	myisam
one thing to remember is that while innodb concatenates the primary key of the table to each index myisam does not

843014
notepad++	gedit	kate	gedit
then open log.txt in your favorite gui text editor kate gedit notepad++ specifying iso-8859-1 or utf-8 in the open dialog

843035
freebsd	linux
this happens only on windows not linux or freebsd

843077
hide	show
then in your code where the property value is changed you ll to find the menu item you wish to show hide using the linkage i described above

843080
cairngorm	flex
until recently i have been using cairngorm as a framework for flex

843097
post	put
in order to execute those post build actions you will need to put them in a batch file and then add the appropiate command to invoke the batch file in the post build event dialog

843102
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
each browser let us not forget google-chrome safari opera ... has its own plugin extensions mechanism

843116
punctuation	words
the separation into sentences separation into words removal of punctuation and so on will be the hardest bit but i ve already shown you some simple initial rules to follow

843131
cairngorm	flex	cairngorm	puremvc
i m not in favor of using any mvc framework cairngorm puremvc in flex code

843162
fgets	getline
don t use c++ stl strings and getline or c s fgets just c style raw pointers and either block read in page-size chunks or mmap the file

843165
freemarker	velocity
velocity or freemarker are incredibly flexible and versatile

843225
versioning	upgrade
there is a project called push up the web which advises all users to upgrade to newer versioning of their browsers

843267
rss	feed
i need to have a complete list of feed provided by all of sites or list of sites which have rss feed on their site

843268
switching	screens
i want to write a small program that given a time in minutes as input sleeps in the background for that time and then forces a return to the switching user screens equivalent to the winkey+l combination or logs off a user may be another user logged in on the same machine

843268
switching	screens
i prefer just a return to the switching user screens rather than actually logging off

843313
getter	setter
that is the purpose of your getter and setter

843331
rss	feed
you ll never be able to get a complete list of all rss feed on the internet

843331
rss	feed
your best bet would be to see if any of the big rss aggregators offer lists of feed they know about - but that is commercially important information so i doubt they ll be giving it away and certainly not for free

843332
mouseleave	mouseenter
with jquery events if you want the event to apply to new elements you would use the .live method however jquery 1.3 doesn t support blur focus mouseenter mouseleave change or submit events as live events and it s change that you will want to use

843333
csv	tsv
it can output in several formats yaml json csv tsv and of course regular text

843345
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
if you have synthesized the accessor for your properties with the synthesize directive they will take care of releasing the ivar that is backing the properties when the properties gets reassigned

843378
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
first you never want to subclass uinavigationcontroller or uitabbarcontroller

843397
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox seems to support -moz versions of some of the properties and safari google-chrome -webkit versions

843400
button	checkbox
get an outlet to your button you want to toggle and then create an action method that your checkbox points to that toggles the hidden property of the original button based on the check box status

843403
post	get
urllib2.urlopen does an http get or post if you supply a data argument not an http head if it did the latter you couldn t do readlines or other accesses to the page body of course

843410
weka	orange
of the many available toolkits i suggest to take a look at orange scipy both python or weka java

843445
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
within the game there are many cells internally just normal table cells with a non breaking space to stop them collapsing in firefox i could stop the collapsing in ie safari and opera with css but for some reason it didn t work in firefox so i resorted to non breaking spaces with either a solid background colour or a background image

843445
google-chrome	firefox
at the very least in firefox and google-chrome but preferably cross browser

843452
int	double
the memory management and allocation for records is the same as for the basic types ie int double

843454
google-chrome	safari
for google-chrome and safari couldn t find a reliable source yet

843469
inherited	properties
inherited and set its doublebuffered properties to true change the designer code to use that new type

843525
cpython	ironpython
again garbage collecting is specific to the implementations so cpython jython and ironpython will have different behaviours most of these being documented on the respective sites manuals code etc

843561
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu has all of it packaged but they re the only linux distribution i know that does

843604
children	parent
the purpose of the query is to get all the immediate children of a given parent node

843632
accessor	properties
i think that an properties is an instance variable that has accessor methods but i might think wrong

843650
django	turbogears
if you want to get a quick glance at a nice web based orm framework i suggest django or turbogears

843650
django	turbogears
i usually prefer turbogears but django seems to be more smooth at the moment

843691
rss	feed
the problem in the php code you ve presented appears to be in the part of it that constructs the youtube rss feed url

843691
rss	feed
once i had fixed up getting the rss feed url it quite happily fetched the feed pulled a youtube url out of it and got the video id

843729
inherited	properties
they are lightweight capable of having properties and methods but they do not support inherited there are some issues with functions that return records

843730
width	height
rpttype caseinfo report top 10 left 10 width 1000 height 750

843733
qcodo	qcubed
qcubed and qcodo are used by us in 3 projects and these ones are the cleanest and easiest to maintain projects we ever had

843733
qcodo	qcubed
qcubed community is much stronger at the moment so you might want to check in qcodo forum for your answers on basic problems but post on the qcubed forum

843738
post	put
i m looking for data mining tools for a project and in line with that i have put up another post in so

843739
getter	setter
a property is a friendly way of implementing a getter setter for some value with additional useful features and syntax

843739
getter	setter
a property can be backed by an instance variable but you can also define the getter setter to do something a bit more dynamic you might define a lowercase property on a string which dynamically creates the result rather than returning the value of some member variable

843739
getter	setter
when you assign to or read from myobject.propertyname you are really calling setter getter methods on the object

843739
getter	setter
the synthesize line tells the compiler to generate these getter setter for you using the member variable with the same name of the property to store the value or othervarname if you use the syntax in comments

843739
getter	setter
along with synthesize you can still override one of the getter setter by defining your own

843739
getter	setter
the naming convention for these methods is setpropertyname for the setter and propertyname or getpropertyname not standard for the getter

843739
nsmutablestring	nsstring
it is good practice to use copy for nsstring because a caller could pass in an nsmutablestring and change it out from under you

843746
boost	stl
go for stl boost www.boost.org

843786
int	boolean
instead boolean values are stored as int 0 false and 1 true

843826
hide	show
show and hide sql errors

843857
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
but once you start doing this it s probably best just to use an ordinary for-loop anyway unless you can t because the collection only implements ienumerable and not ilist icollection of course

843869
mouse	keyboard
a programmer who is typing into a code window can generally use a keyboard accelerator much faster than taking his hand over to the mouse to right click

843953
client-side	server-side
there it explains how to use json both server-side and client-side from within a web-app

843961
nginx	lighttpd
have a look at nginx lighttpd and varnish for some popular high performance http servers

843978
icefaces	woodstock
woodstock is dead and the icefaces guys are on the way to offer a migration path

843978
icefaces	tomahawk
for a more independent use have a look at tomahawk and icefaces

843978
icefaces	tomahawk
icefaces allows to integrate tomahawk components although the skinning is not really compatible

843990
hash	md5
if the number of images is not huge then a cryptographic hash like md5 should be sufficient

843995
hash	md5
md5 hash wouldn t work if the images were different formats png jpeg etc had different sizes or had different metadata

843996
int	chars
the idea is that the caller would provide a range of chars and the function would interpret the chars as an int value and return it leaving begin at one past the last-used chars

844000
content-disposition	content-type
maybe you need to set the content-type as text plain or remove a content-disposition header

844004
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the code works perfect in firefox google-chrome safari

844006
opera	firefox
unfortunately all browsers i tested ie8 firefox 3.0.10 opera 9.64 switch based on my local language settings to

844006
textmate	jedit
the same happens if i manually generate the html file using utf-8 tested with textmate respective jedit although both editors display the content correctly

844075
uicontrol	uiresponder	uiwindow	uiresponder	uiview	uiwindow	uiapplication	uiwindow
if you have common event handling code why not declare a category on uiview or uiresponder which you will then be able to access from all of your uiview or uiresponder subclasses including uiapplication uiwindow and uicontrol

844087
mutt	thunderbird
then do the same with your favorite mail client recommended mutt because thunderbird is slow in strace

844139
librsvg	cairo
you can do this with using cairo librsvg python bindings

844159
rss	feed
i think the reason some databases use xml is because it s such a widely-used format especially for things like rss feed

844201
inherited	subclassing
one great feature of objective-c is that class methods are inherited by subclassing

844270
nunit	mstest
ideally i could use nunit or mstest which everone is familiar with

844282
accessor	properties
as a note this example obviously assumes 10.5 using properties but you can do the same thing in 10.4 using accessor methods

844286
typedef	struct
typedef struct mytype1 mytype1handle

844314
uicontrol	uiresponder	uicontrol	uibutton
for instance in cocoa-touch the inheritance tree of uibutton is uicontrol uiview uiresponder nsobject

844314
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
also proper use of inherited requires that the implementer of the subclassing has a deep knowledge of the superclass

844314
superclass	subclassing
in addition implementation details of the superclass often leak through to the subclassing which is a big pain in the for framework builders

844339
inherited	properties
i tried to do this with inherited all sorts of ways but still need to be able to do new properties and have it set the value to null until a type gets selected when the appropriate kind of type gets selected

844348
for-loop	arrays
use a standard c for-loop and start and work backwards through the arrays

844419
versioning	upgrade
one for an upgrade from versioning .-1 etc

844494
width	height
be sure to preload the views within one screen size distance from the current view because the user can potentially scroll one screen width or height distance in one gesture

844519
tapestry	wicket
beyond ones already suggested i would recommend checking out tapestry and wicket many developers like them

844536
erlang	lisp
i ve recently been learning about functional programming specifically haskell but i ve gone through tutorials on lisp and erlang as well

844568
post	get
i want to get the post data instead of get

844569
haskell	sml
you will be gobs more productive especially if you pick a functional language that also has algebraic data types and pattern matching caml sml haskell

844627
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
then inside touchesbegan touchesmoved etc it checks if it s interested in the event and either handles or passes it on to the inner components

844627
touchesmoved	touchesended
note that it is uiscrollview that receives all touchesbegin touchesmoved touchesended and touchescanceled events from cocoatouch because its hittest tells it to do so

844627
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
you won t be able to send touchesbegan to uiscrollview later because you cannot store the touches argument it contains objects that will be mutated before the next touchesmoved event and you cannot reproduce the old state

844627
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
so you have to pass touchesbegan to uiscrollview immediately but you will hide any further touchesmoved events from it until you decide to scroll horizontally

844627
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
no touchesmoved means no scrolling so this initial touchesbegan will do no harm

844627
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchescancelled	touchesended
given that you always forward touchesbegan you also have to forward touchescancelled and touchesended

844627
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchescancelled	touchesended
you have to turn touchesended into touchescancelled however because uiscrollview would interpret touchesbegan touchesended sequence as a touch-click and would forward it to the inner view

844627
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
if that does not work either or results in sloppy visuals you have to override touchesbegan touchesmoved etc and not forward diagonal movement events to uiscrollview

844640
jms	jta
really i m most interested in ws-security and jms support possibly jta

844640
glassfish	weblogic	jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish
would it be a wise decision to go with lightweight tomcat which i m experienced with or would i be better off with a server that implements the full java ee stack such as jboss weblogic or even glassfish

ubuntu	linux
ubuntu does have this option so many linux distributions probably do

844645
public	protected
i believe that will work if the plot3d rotationchanged signal is public or protected

844678
superclass	subclassing
i ve seen this format used instead of writing a concrete superclass that subclassing extend

if i could do that it would allow the code to possibly be ported over to other browsers safari and google-chrome in particular

844747
int	boolean

844753
int	chars
my node is a struct comprising of the variables freq int and word 128 chars

844760
put	get
i think that using that would have certainly cleared up the java.util.stack problem but it can also lead to very deep class hierarchies in order to put ensure that classes get only the methods they are supposed to have

844785
getter	setter
property is just saying there will be a getter and or setter method for that property name

844794
width	height
you need to identify the shape a user has clicked on and then change its width and height based on how far the user has dragged this could be determined by subtracting the original x y from the new x y coordinates

844797
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchescancelled	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchescancelled
just be sure that 1 the events you send to content view don t bubble back to uiscrollview through the responder chain make sure to handle them all 2 respect the usual flow of touch events touchesbegan than some number of touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended finished with touchesended or touchescancelled especially when dealing with uiscrollview

844911
folder	directory
each directory or folder is a namespace

844919
multiplying	add
hence one can determine if an integer is divisible by 3 by counting the 1 bits at odd bit positions multiplying this number by 2 add the number of 1-bits at even bit posistions add them to the result and check if the result is divisible by 3

844953
single-quotes	double-quotes
the markup rules refer to a limited subset of csharp syntax rules declared in codegrammar.cs - those are a subset because spark only needs to recognize enough csharp to adjust single-quotes around strings to double-quotes match curley braces etc

845010
daemons	systemd
on a unix systemd such a script should really run as a daemons - have a look at the pear system_daemon package to see how that can be accomplished simply

845066
cpython	ironpython
i am however no cpython guru and can get so much more out of ironpython than cpython as i can easily leverage the .net platform on which i am far more at home

845162
int	chars
that says even though memp is a pointer to chars i want you treat it as a pointer to int and put this int where it points.

845165
int	chars
cast pointer to int not unsigned chars again

845169
ostringstream	std
alternatively you could use templates and std ostringstream or boost lexical_cast for a very flexible version

845260

edit2 for non-uml diagrams sounds like dia is a good open source alternative to visio

845269
listview	gridview

845427
postgresql	mysql
regardless of whether you use sequences like in postgresql and oracle or if you use another mechanism like auto-increment of mysql

845470

since you defined d as always having 1 column then the for-loop is unnecessary since it will only loops once

845583
hide	show
i have the code below that hide and show the navigational bar

845663
tripledes	aes
tripledes is a very good option but you can also consider aescryptoserviceprovider aes which is a modern symmetric cipher

there are manipulators for hex and decimal dec but unfortunately not for binary

845720
hex	binary
as far as hex binary - those are just representations of integers

845760
inotifypropertychanged	icommand
look closely at using icommand inotifypropertychanged the observablecollections

845760
listbox	icollectionview
by using icommand and icollectionview you could expose enough control where a designer could construct a listbox to show the animals and a menu to show the filter list

845797
jstl	taglib
yes it s well known that the uri for taglib changed between jstl versions 1.0 and 1.1

845933
floating-point	integer
and for square specifically you might as well just multiply the numbers together yourself floating-point or integer

845935
superclass	subclassing
they re both a type conversion but they are different kinds of type conversion casting is usually between related object types a downcast from a superclass to a subclassing whereas a marshalling might be for example from an object graph to plain-text representation

845955
jar	war
if what you are deploying are packaged components dll jar war ... it is wise to organize the code library as a collection of packaged set of files

845955
jar	war
that way you will develop directly with the -- dll jar war .

845979
int	double
with n being an int because it doesn t know which of float double or long double version it should take and you would get an ambiguity error

846036
vbscript	jscript
i ve been hunting for a modern replacement for jscript vbscript

846038
int	chars
for example the int 1245427 which is 0x1300f3 should result in a string of length 3 containing three chars whose byte values are 0x13 0x00 and 0xf3

846063
integer	unsigned
usually you d pack such an integer into a full 32 bits a c unsigned long and use but skip the step

846079

846271
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
safari firefox and opera render roughly 6 pixels of unwanted bottom padding on the container div

codeigniter	cakephp
you might however feel more in control with a framework such as the zend framework cakephp or codeigniter

846304
postgresql	mysql
if you want this to be portable betwen postgresql and mysql you can use postgresql s contrib for connect by and wrap the query into a stored procedure with same name for both systems

846356
innodb	myisam
if you re using innodb tables for acid or just because at more than 30 million rows myisam tables tend to get crappy yes a straight one-table select is probably faster than in pg

846356
postgresql	mysql
as i said postgresql is far superior and i hate mucking with mysql s bizarre bugs and i think that overall postgresql performance is probably better than mysql for any even slightly complicated query

846378

mixing swing and swt isn t the best thing to do but if you have no options it s not a terribly difficult beast to slay

846968
swt	swing
keep all dialogs in swing don t use a mix of both if there is no reason to use naming conventions to differentiate between swing and swt components etc

846968
swt	swing
make sure you re well aware of the way that swing and swt components are handled by the os jvm before you start tackling any complex ui issues

ubuntu	debian
but comes with pacman a software package manager which is as-good-as apt-get ubuntu debian if not better

847180
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
you have a choice of installing many desktop managers such as awesome dwm wmii fvwm gnome xfce kde etc

gif	png
can anyone please confirm whether or not cr supports transparency and if so how you do it we are not limited by the type of image to insert - png gif etc

847230
cpython	ironpython
now in cpython the signal module is a built-in as far as i can remember it could possibly be that ironpython has not implemented it in fact a quick google and look on ironpython s site leads to this ironpython and cpython differences read it in particular the extension modules part

847247

versioning	upgrade
the easiest way to resolve is to upgrade your versioning of java to the one used by the jar

847739
width	height
set the containing div s width and height to 100

847739
width	height
set the silverlight control s width and height to 100

847752

at first i though of handling sizechanged event and save height and width but i think there must be easier solution

847794
draggable	droppable
i use this plugin in order to draw lines from a draggable to a droppable like i show it here

847808
addition	multiplication
in essence matlab implicitly expands the scalar into an array of the same size as its partner in the addition or multiplication and then performs the operation

847848

848027
debian-based	linux
it s standard for debian-based linux distributions but according to this page it can be added really easily to any other

848039
for-loop	loops
the scope of the variable in the test of the while loops is wider than the scope of variables declared in the header of the for-loop

848088
post	get
i ve looked at a number of post nyman s was the most helpful but obviously still don t get it

848091
debian	linux
edit server is a debian linux box running php5 through suphp

848149
for-loop	loops
compilers that optimize using loops unrolling will probably only do so in the for-loop case

848161
subtract	add	division	subtract
a crc is simply division just like you learn long-hand division in grade school except that add and subtract are replaced with xor

848165
inherited	subclassing
this being said my impression of adc s emphasis against subclassing is not putting forth a case for designing an application s class hierarchy without inherited but instead to point out that in the new way of doing things ie osx there are in most cases more appropriate means to go about customizing standard behavior without needing to subclassing

848177
maven	pom.xml
realizing that maven is configurable and you can override the defaults in the super pom.xml i m attempting to determine if i should change the layout to support specific tools that are in house or attempt to make those tools recognize the maven layout

848230
onchange	onblur
however using onblur won t necessarily tell you about changes in the textbox and onchange s browser coverage is spotty at best

848246
vb.net	jscript.net
one option i considered was to compile the javascript or java source using the .net compilers jscript.net or j# use reflector to output as vb.net then finally downgrade the vb.net code manually to vba giving me a pure vba solution

848319
google-chrome	firefox
much like google-chrome does and the new firefox 4 will do

848364
openbsd	linux
edit whilst this seems to be true for openbsd according to the man page the linux man page differs considerably and so getsockname after accept on linux is almost certainly unuseful

848400
ubuntu	linux
i m happily running ubuntu linux in a vmware box hosted on xp

848454

put	get	post	put	post	get
one thing i see is that we don t need representations for every resource and we don t need to support all operations get put post delete on all resources either

848894
put	get	post	put	post	get
http provides methods to get post put and delete a resource

848894
post	put
now product 12 is a resource you most likely also want to accept html mime types on to display said product but for a uri like product 12 reviews 14 you don t need an html counterpart you just want your consumers to be able to post to that url to update put delete delete their own review

848896

getter	setter
an event doesn t expose the field and its value - it just exposes a subscription method and an unsubscription method in a similar way to how properties just expose a getter and a setter

849040
getter	setter
in scenariomaster i would declare a set or list with public getter setter like

849062
twos-complement	ones-complement
the problem states 32-bit signed integers but doesn t specify whether they are twos-complement or ones-complement

849080
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
another way to do this is using oo inherited put functionality that s common to both versions in a superclass and then create separate subclassing which define the specializations of the superclass for each of your versions

849080
superclass	subclassing
you can then build your superclass es as a shared library and build each specialized subclassing in separate assemblies which reference the common shared library

849130
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
but my friend said that first there was apache + bunch of mongrels and then lighttpd and then nginx and now passenger and it seems endless.

849155
button	checkbox
all i want to do is require that a checkbox is selected and a radio button but i don t care which one is required

apache	nginx
previous approaches including running a suite of mongrels required lots of setup surrounding starting stopping and recycling listener processes that passenger handles transparently or via simple apache or nginx configuration options

849219
lisp	scheme
paredit sounds like it would handle the parenthesis part of your need with the caveat that it was designed for common lisp and scheme

849311
put	get
it appears you are under the mistaken impression that if you put one control on top of another you ll get the behavior of both combined

849368
pull	push
i think your best answer is to have once machine that everybody does a push pull to if that s at all possible

849377

851976
free	malloc
there are lots of ways in which malloc free can store the size of the memory area

852011

rss	feed
i have started debugging my rss feed because it has some strange characters in it the missing-character glyph

852260
rss	feed
the reason i believe our rss feed is having problems is because users are copy pasteing ms word documents into a textarea on the site and our php pages are using the iso-8859-1 charset which is incompatible with the special windows-1252 encodings for things like bullet points and smart quotes used by ms word

852267

width	height
by using the above code textarea won t be visible but there will be blank space in your document having the height and width of the textarea

852432
put	get	post	put	post	get
it seems obvious and easy to map crud operations on a resource orientated restful service using http to operations such as put get post delete but how should operations that query for multiple resources be mapped - using a new operation called query or still use get that returns a collection of resources

852448
onclick	onsubmit	submit	submission
for that particular scenario you might want to experiment with different event properties as browsers act differently the onlick is for the button the onsubmit is a form event so naturally if you return false for the onclick that does not mean the on submit is not going to take effect you should handle the onsubmit separately or delegate submission to the submit button by return false onsubmit and let the onclick handler have form.submit also try it with multiple submit buttons to understand how it works

852500
postgresql	mysql
so storing 1 000 000 000 rows in postgresql will require several gib more storage than mysql depending on which storage enginge you use in mysql

853042
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
compared to ienumerable and icollection ilist performs much better for large or dynamic lists because it provides an indexer allowing us quick random access

853042
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
in addition ilist allows sorting grouping and filtering

853042
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
it supports sorting and grouping but not traditional filtering

853541
width	height
you can use the thumb control inside the usercontrol like you are doing and just adjust the height width of the usercontrol based on the delta of the thumb

853541
width	height
you should probably size the height width on that thumb as well

853624

854605
uiview	subviews
assuming you re adding the uiimageview as a subviews of the uinavigationbar view you can use the uiview method initwithframe to choose a specific cgrect to draw the image view within

854622
updatepanel	scriptmanager
the scriptmanager would output scripts only for controls which are being updated children of updatepanel that is

854631

prefuse	jung
see for a list of implemented algorithms also compared with jung grapht prefuse jbpt

854903
filtering	grouping
the problem we want to bind a hierarchicaldatatemplateâ s itemssource property to a collectionviewsource to perform grouping and filtering

854912
hash	md5
in short since md5 is a 128bit hash you need 2 64 items before the probably of a collision rises to 50

854920
versioning	upgrade
we had to upgrade versioning of that to work with the new ide framework and when we moved from vs2008 from vs2005 some our ssis package projects didn t open correctly because we are still on sql server 2005 so definitely check any dependencies you have on your 2003 ide with any 3rd party apps you may be running

854961
hash	salt
the hashing function also pseudo randomly sprinkles the salt amongst the hash string

854961
hash	salt
the hash checking function reverses the salt sprinkling and then the actual hash check takes place

854961
hash	salt
now i m aware that unique salt for each password hash good but also that having the logic to hash the passwords and create the salt stored in a db function might bad

854983
folder	directory
app is a module directory so the default and ecommerce folder create modules within zf

854986
hash	salt
edited answer because i misread the article initially and thought he was just mixing the salt together with an unsalted hash

854986
hash	md5
if the site is one with public registration the attacker could repeatedly register accounts with known passwords then use the known md5 hash for those passwords to reverse-engineer the password scrambling algorithm

854986
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
if you want to store your passwords really securely get away from md5 and even sha1 and move towards a salt slower hash function

854996
hash	salt
secure hash and salt for php passwords

855006
implements	extends
bear in mind that i implements functionmapper not extends stdcallmapper

855007
hash	salt
this seems for me to just add obfuscation not any more security to the as chad birch pointed out misunderstood salt hash method

855014
hash	salt
basing the salt on the password eliminates the variability that defeats rainbow tables and trying to hide it in the hash password field is just pointless

855017
post	get
it s a bit involved to post but shows how to get maven to copy the native libs to a directory which you then point your java.library.path at

855051
pop-up	dialog
when a button is clicked to view one of the records in the gridview a pop-up window in the form of a modal dialog opens allowing the user to edit the fields

855063
cassini	iis
maybe the cassini server from microsoft or a variant of cassini from ultidev which is implemented by the same technology as used when you debug asp.net or a web service from within visual studio without iis

855067
implements	extends
frameworks aside to implements a cross-browser compatible site i recommend that you initially target a standards compliant browser like firefox and then only after it is working extends support to less standards-compliant browsers like ie6

855121
int	double
for example in the ini file i might have some double int or string type values preceded by the tag name of the value

855125
ilist	icollection
the only difference between the il generated for doone and modified dotwo is that the callvirt instructions for add get_item and get_count use ilist and icollection rather than list itself

855128
jar	manifest.mf
the problem is being caused by a jar file whose manifest.mf file contains a value for the extension-list attribute that tomcat doesn t like

855128
jdom	xerces
tomcat expects this attribute s value to be a space-separated list of extension names see the manifestresource source but it appears one of your jars has the comma-separated list dom4j-core jdom xml-apis xerces junit instead

855138
printf	getchar
each app was a simple printf followed by a getchar

855148
hash	salt
salt before you hash

855148
hash	salt
you can even store your salt right next to your hash passwords and feel pretty darn confident

855181
put	get
i thought this would work but no matter what number i put in for the stack frame the closest i can get is init

855201
accessor	properties
rather than doing the expicit release and set to nil if your accessor have properties associated with them yoc and do the following as a more concise method

855235
crypt	hash
the crypt function in php uses whatever hash algorithm the underlying operating system provides for encrypting the data - have a look at its documentation

855268
codeigniter	cakephp
see if you like it if not try codeigniter zend or cakephp or django or merb or..

855269
crypt	hash
update originally i wrote the php crypt function does not look like a standard hash

855302
hash	salt
i wanted to try out the article from msdn itself how to use forms authentication with sql server 2000 to hash my password but i found out that the function they used to create salt string is returning 3 more length than it is supposed to return

855320
profiling	instrumentation	profiling	debugging
logger debugging s c com c++ easily with rich symbolic info hooks profiling flexible instrumentation

855371
width	height
this is similar to how a browser cannot continue with page layout unless img tags have width and height information -- if the included javascript generates content then the browser can t continue with layout until it knows what is there and how big everything is

855397
int	double
for instance dates are actually int that represent a julian date double are actually int and you have to divide them by 10 number of decimal places on the data dictionary of that specific item and so on

855418
uiview	subviews
what you might want to do is override the touchesbegan withevent method of the uiview or subclass that contains your uiimageview subviews

855481
jquery	nyromodal
i am using the jquery nyromodal plugin within asp.net

855491
put	get
if you put an index on userid username you ll have a covering index - so you won t ever need to go to the table to get the username anyway

855491
put	get
if you put your clustered index on userid you ll get a clustered index seek - which will end up at the row data anyway

855496
collabnet	svn
i installed the collabnet install of svn 1.5.5 and it was running fine with tortoisesvn 1.6.1

855510
actionscript	mxml
each mxml file is a full fledged actionscript class

855537
put	get
it might be possible if you can t get touch events from a subclassed uitextview to put a transparent view layer over the top of the text and get touch events from that then you would only have to figure out a way to turn this on and off for editing

855562
stdout	stderr
additionally it s a good idea to close stdin stdout and stderr but i m not sure how to do that in php

855563
pull	push
try git pull first then git push

855621
hide	show
1 use javascript to show and hide parts of the form

855627
folder	directory
make sure your folder permissions are set so that a directory listing is allowed then just point your anchor to that folder using chmod 701 that might be risky though

855628
stdout	stderr
but he doesn t change his working directory to nor does it look like he closed open file descriptors i m not sure how this would work in php so that he s not connected to the stdin stdout and stderr of the original process

855635
udp	tcp
beyond that if the normal tcp socket mechanisms don t fit your application then generally you need to fall back to using udp and building your own protocol features on the basic send receive properties of udp

855658
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
opera safari and google-chrome can not be convinced to open a file link in a page served over http

855662
aptana	radrails
it appears that netbeans and aptana radrails are the most common adopted ide s for ruby on rails development but both needs the java runtime environment to run

855672
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
you ll want to provide the touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended methods and they ll get called if the user taps the image

855685
aptana	radrails	komodo	aptana	komodo	radrails
komodo edit is one of the best ides i ve ever used and it has rails support although maybe not as good as aptana radrails

855702
postgresql	mysql
i m confident creating schema and optimizing queries in ansi-sql for sybase ms sql server mysql or postgresql

855761
vb.net	vb6
after reading the first two answers i realize it is more accurately a microsoft.visualbasic.collection which appears to be a class introduced for compatibility between vb6 and vb.net

855780
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
malloc calloc realloc free

855789
spaces	delimiter
given that any two people are as likely to disagree as agree on the amount of white spaces and indenting that makes the code readable i d suggest that whitespace is a poor choice of a contextual delimiter

855801
subtract	add
and then overload all operators so that you can only add subtract types with the same parameters and the you sum the parameters when doing a product

855815
pdfsharp	itext	pdfsharp	itextsharp
pdfsharp is good so is itextsharp the java port of itext one of the first pdf libraries around

855823
vb.net	vb6
while i haven t seen a head-to-head comparison of the vb6 collection vs vb.net dictionary i would expect them to be similar since the underlying algorithm is essentially a hashtable either way

855835
put	get
trying to get parameters from a put request using httpservlet#doput

855856
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
look at tutorials regarding uiviewcontroller or viewcontrollers in general they will have discussion about uitabbarcontroller

855885
vb.net	vb6
if you are using vb.net you are not using vb6 collections

855885
vb.net	vb6
the vb.net collection is functionally equivalent to the vb6 collection but they are not the same

855885
vb.net	vb6
has a comparison of the various .net collection types with the vb6 collection including the vb.net collection

855898
free	malloc
you re unconditionally calling free without checking if the malloc succeeded so if the malloc failed and p is a null pointer then you re calling free null

855911
free	malloc
if you re doing stuff in between the malloc and free you could be overrunning a different array by accident and corrupting your own stack

855944
keydown	keyup
although you marked this as the correct answer note that you should use the keyup event rather than the change event or the keydown

855951
free	malloc
if you are running on x86 you could just run your binary under valgrind and it would gather all this information for you using the standard implementation of malloc and free

855961
integer	unsigned
this is the actual line which sets the ctypes value to an actual c unsigned integer

855964
hash	md5
the purpose of salting a string is to scramble it in a way a bit more personal and unique than an md5 hash will do

855964
hash	md5
it will achieve the result either way which is to make the md5 hash generated not correspond with a rainbow table for easy cracking of passwords

855978
hash	salt
it doesn t matter when you digest the salt prefix postfix infix all produce different hash but achieve the same purpose of defeating rainbow tables or other pre-hashed dictionary attacks

855981
submit	submission
if you know that there is problem that is specific to a particular version of firefox and you want to prevent it you either check for the issue when someone submit the field before you save it you remove it from the data after its saved but before you load it or you check for that version of firefox and prevent users with it from making a submission on your site which i wouldn t recommend

856037
apache	nginx
if you re planning on running it for production or non-development mode another option is to do away with apache and go with something lightweight like nginx

856050
disk	ram
in my bootloader asm code i want to load my kernel and kernel entry into the ram from cd-rom not from hard disk or floppy disk and lets assume that we know where the kernel located exactly on the cd-rom sector number

856099
button	checkbox
while rendering the view page based on some condition in the controller action i want to disable all the controls textbox checkbox button etc present in the form in a mvc view page

856150
mvp	presenter
some people though are not quite as happy with the implementation because it has a 1 to 1 relationship between presenter and views and strictly speaking this isn t how mvp is meant to be

856150
mvp	presenter
is the need to have mutliple views to a presenter the primary goal of mvp

856153
public	protected
i personally test protected parts too because they are public to inherited types.

856170
mvp	presenter
the idea behind mvp is decoupling presenter from views so that you can switch the view more easily if you need to for example supporting both web application and a desktop application but that doesn t mean you have to make it dynamic

856234
ssl	https
https is http hypertext transfer protocol plus ssl secure socket layer

856249
firefox	safari
if you are developing for firefox safari you can always check with firebug developer console as they show the loading sequence of files

856260
division	addition
you re much more likely to get an improvement by exiting from the loop early so either store new r in a variable and compare with old r or store x r in a variable and compare that against r before doing the addition and division

856268
post	get
requestmapping has an obvious filter for whether somebody used a get or a post but i don t see any inherent support for all of the useful logic simpleformcontroller provided

856270
.nettiers	codesmith
for for a scenario such as .nettiers i d stick with codesmith for the time being

856278
folder	directory
since the wrapper dll only works with the native dll when they are in the same folder the native dll should be copied to the output directory of project a

856311
jquery	nyromodal
using jquery at the start of the page i set all of these hyperlinks to become nyromodal modal hyperlinks

856316
hash	md5
can t you just use a simple one-way hash like md5 sha-1 on the string

856347
accessor	properties
in your first snippet instead of theconnection try assigning to self.theconnection to make sure the properties accessor methods are called

856469
inherited	subclassing
overriding is used in inherited to change the implementation per subclassing

856626
firefox	safari
the first in mozilla browsers eg firefox the second is newer css3 browsers and the last in safari et al

856627
easymock	jmock
that s good but if the tests are too slow you might want to consider using mock objects via a framework like jmock or easymock to replace real db connections with fake ones

856630
getter	setter
in general getter and setter break encapsulation because the data is exposed to the world

856761
children	parent
the query selects all the children that satisfy a certain criteria that belong to parent that satisfy another criteria

856852
altera	xilinx
i d avoid gate counts with fpgas here s some 4-input look-up-table estimates most of my experience is with xilinx but it ll be similar for altera and others

856896
google-chrome	firefox
using this code solved my problem and it worked in every browser internet explorer 7 firefox 3 and google-chrome

856959
memcached	ncache
further googling turns up a number of solutions ncache sharedcache velocity memcached

856971
converter	multibinding
you can use multibinding and define a converter that will join the two or more collections into one

856997
converter	multibinding
maybe you can use multibinding with a converter that will create an object for you.

857031
int	chars
am i right in thinking that it s checking for deleted chars in both words the int j i representing the length of words because a lower value will represent deleted chars

857034
addition	multiplication
this will allow you for example to do vector addition and matrix multiplication and for large arrays it is much faster than python lists

857070
integer	unsigned
the program requires an input of an arbitrary large unsigned integer which is expressed as one string in base 10

857070
integer	unsigned
the real challenging part is the arbitrary large unsigned integer

857073
multiplication	exponent
for a table lookup you can extract the mantissa in 0.5 1 and exponent from the input using a function like frexp then normalize the mantissa in 64 256 using multiplication by a suitable power of 2

857075
min	max
i m trying to get the jquery slider to have set values to slide to as opposed to every number between the min max amounts

857110
integer	unsigned
the real challenging part is the arbitrary large unsigned integer

857155
ant	maven
i need to specify a certain directory which the maven ant tasks should use as repository

857276
readonly	temporary
c windows microsoft.net framework v2.0.50727 temporary asp.net files root 24f69041 8efa8a35 app_web_p7uswgud.2.vb 43 error bc30154 class views_home_list_aspx must implement readonly property isreusable as boolean for interface system.web.ihttphandler

857281
google-chrome	firefox
browsers firefox ie google-chrome all show the same errors cleared cache too

857365
put	get
to get the full image path i figured out that i needed a multibinding to put the two together and have sucessfully created one

857383
spaces	delimiter
in that case just use the spaces character as the delimiter

857439
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
with other browser firefox opera google-chrome etc. we can use

857463
for-loop	arrays
it needs one less local variable uses a while and not a for-loop and uses arrays assignment instead of the function call push

857496
mouse	joystick
while they are more often used to handle touchscreen event they also map to mouse joystick clicks on emulators

857530
int	chars
since sql server doesn t support named constants chars is far more descriptive than int when used in stored procedure and views as constants

857530
int	chars
i guess the question is will there be cases where chars 4 is problematic and since the database is pretty small i m not too concerned about slight performance hit like using tinyint versus int but more afraid of code maintenance problems

857540
maven	pom.xml
i have a maven project using the swing application framework and would like to inject project information from the pom.xml into my application s global resources to avoid duplication

857541
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
pro if you have many branches you ll be pushed to adopt a modern dvcs my experience is with mercurial but i hear git or bazaar are also good rather than stay with a traditional centralized system like say svn

857563
hide	show
this method is nice to show and hide toolbars which got already activated via the addon manager but does not work for deactivated addons

857596
ant	maven
pass the necessary maven properties to ant and create an ant build script which modifies an application properties file or the spring context configuration directly

857603
cvs	svn
where i work we ve decided to move the files in svn after the import from cvs

857603
cvs	svn
cvs has limited history capabilities with moving while the svn repository can be rolled back to see what it looked like at any time

857603
cvs	svn
what we ve done is move the module from cvs into svn as is

857608
freemarker	velocity
if you just want a cross-platform replacement for m4 you can invoke velocity freemarker or another template library from ant

857614
int	chars
my reasons for choosing an int over a chars include

857650
serializable	deserialization
one issue is that even if it doesn t break during serializable deserialization you could be throwing away data - meaning that you can t successfully round-trip data back to the caller

857661
width	height
imagemagick is able to resize images to a specific height or width while maintaining the original aspect ratio of your picture

857674
switching	screens
earlier when we were using the ie6 browser then the text area was displaying properly on screens but after switching over ie7 browser we have seen that after filling up 20 lines a active scroll bar start displaying with text area and only 19 lines are displaying in text area and 1 line is hiding in scroll bar and to check that 1 line we have to use the scroll bar

857710
button	checkbox
generally button like this either do an action or indicate a status checkbox options etc

857758
post	put
edit you might want to put this in a wrapper see isaac s post as it s currently a private api

857806
button	checkbox
i am using two button select all and deselect all for selecting all checkbox and deselecting all checkbox

857820
put	get
i m a bit surprised that i even have to put a timer in my viewmodel since it seems like that is a function of inotifypropertychanged it seems redundant but it was the only way i could get the xaml ui to constantly once per second reflect the state of my model

857822
int	double
because you are making a mathematical calculation try parsing the values into double int before you subtract them

857827
button	checkbox
i assume your select all and deselect all button are using javascript to set or unset all the other checkbox in the form

857867
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

857870
versioning	upgrade
the working copy has been subjected to too many svn versioning upgrade or whatever cleanup can t repair

857900
isnull	nullif
in my opinion using isnull nullif is faster than using case when

857900
isnull	nullif
i rather the isnull nullif

857975
google-chrome	firefox
tested and working on firefox 3 google-chrome 1 and ie 6 7 and 8

858024
awt	swing
the parent logger of that logger the root logger will not get any log messages from your application but will receive messages from other parts of the jdk such as swing or awt

858028
min	max
you can also add the min and max values

858055
filesystems	ntfs
on a journaling filesystems like ntfs there is actually no way to securely erase a single file without wiping all the free space on the drive

858058
hide	show
just create divs on top of each other and show hide them using show and hide

858077
unification	inference
for info the reason i m asking is because i know that type inference also involves this unification algorithm and i d like to understand it

858090
post	get
ultimately the browser must make a http post get request of its own accord

858097
width	height
i think you only care about the height so i left the width 0

858128
width	height
we had a script to preprocess the build files which substituted the width and height into a file name splash_240x320.bmp or whatever

858128
portrait	landscape
to support screen rotation on n92 z8 etc we still needed portrait and landscape versions of some images since flipping aspect ratio doesn t give as good results as resizing to the same or similar ratio...

858162
opera	firefox
this works admittedly only tested on firefox 3.x.x and opera 9.x both on ubuntu 8.04

858162
opera	firefox
link to working example tested under firefox 3 and opera 9.x

858174
coalesce	isnull
or you need to use isnull coalesce is not null or is null in your where if one of the values you are testing can be null

858182
sorting	filtering
look at glazedlists for filtering sorting etc

858233
stateless	stateful
when i change the stateful bean to a stateless bean everything works fine except of course that the state is not preserved

858253
datamapper	activerecord
and if you are not obsessed with activerecord you can also use datamapper s imap adapter

858268
mvvm	delegatecommand
so that leaves in the wpf mvvm toolkit 0.1 project form the wpf team themselves you have a delegatecommand which also looks like an interesting way

858278
submit	submission
the aim is to avoid accidental submission just because if a developer does accidentally submit a large file trying to then get it back out the repository is an afternoon where no-one can do any work and has to fix up all local branches they have

858343
lxml	beautifulsoup
in particular you will want to look at the python answers beautifulsoup htmlparser and lxml

858391
hash	md5
the theory is that md5 creates a different hash for each input

858427
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	centos	freebsd	debian	freebsd	netbsd	ubuntu	openbsd	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	freebsd	solaris	netbsd	debian	centos	centos	solaris	openbsd	solaris	openbsd	centos	openbsd	debian	openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	redhat	fedora

858430
realloc	malloc
this often comes up if one of the threads is inside malloc realloc and your current statement tries to allocate some memory

858437
int	chars
this is how you can use it i ve replaced chars with int to store some values in for example but works the same with chars

858451
jsf	seam
i ve got an jsp tag that i would like to use in my jsf seam application

858455
width	height
having multiple storyboards 1 each for each menuitem with multiple keyframe animations x y height width in one .xaml is not sitting well with me

858473
post	get
ispostback is the usual way to determine get or post

858481
pop-up	dialog
if it s newer you could pop-up a friendly dialog box asking the user to upgrade

858481
vb.net	vb6
i would suggest upgrading from vb6 to vb.net for the following reasons

858500
hide	show
on a button click i want to hide one and show the other

858514
put	get
the expression tree you get represents the expression that you put in the lambda

858525
pbkdf2	salt
you can specify the password salt iv and plaintext as well as the number of rfc 2898 iterations to use in the pbkdf2

858546
hide	show
alternatively you could wrap the table in a div and show hide the div with your usual method

858549
client-side	server-side
you need to access the clientid property of the .net control server-side to get it s real client-side id

858581
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
or using oracle s oracle data provider for .net odp.net instead of the microsoft oracle driver system.data.oracleclient

858583
rss	feed
rss atom feed are not html so you cant use html entities in them

858592
strdup	malloc	free	strdup	free	malloc
this has the disadvantage that for example strdup will still use the old malloc and a free may crash the program

858593
subtraction	addition
to solve this problem one could use xor instead of addition and subtraction

858597
folder	directory
yes i have created the logs directory under my application folder

858610
subtract	add
if you absolutely must remove leading zeros from the output you can subtract 10 11 do the math mod 10 12 - 10 11 and then add 10 11 back again

858661
bash	zsh
this works in bash and also zsh

858681
comparator	icomparer
it irritated me that linq gives me an orderby that takes a class implementing icomparer as an argument but does not support passing in a simple anonymous comparator function

858681
comparator	icomparer
this class creates an icomparer from your comparator function.

858708
stdout	stderr
this will work even when prints to stderr which would confuse oli s answer and keeps stdout stderr which farzy s answer doesn t

858768
postgresql	mysql
but if the software needed to work with many different databases - oracle postgresql mysql sql server and db or if the test db at work was down for refreshes a lot i d probably write the pure unit test that existed totally in isolation

858768
getter	setter
i find using terms like unit extensively then getting a definition-weenie about it leads to people doing things like mocking out the filesystem or mocking getter and setter - activity that i find unhelpful

858771
width	height
thus green div should have height equivalent to red div and width as 90 of the width of red div

858778
folder	directory
cannot remove folder text-base the directory is not empty.

858857
addition	multiplication
but if you don t need to do any addition or multiplication then you could keep 64-bit value as 4-character strings as javascript uses utf-16

858864
wordpress	joomla
if you re using a third-party cms wordpress joomla etc and you re not a programmer you re going to have to get someone to watch for the offending text and strip it out

858978
ienumerable	iqueryable
why is it that the foreach clause doesn t work or isn t available for use on iqueryable ienumerable result sets.

858978
ienumerable	iqueryable
is it something to do with the deferred execution s of ienumerable iqueryable collections

858979
openbsd	linux

opera	safari
in addition if you ever want your greasemonkey script to work in non-gm environments such as opera s gm-esque user scripts or greasekit on safari it ll help not to use gm-unique constructs such as require

859188
bazaar	git
i am going to look at mercurial and bazaar as well as git though

859226
vb.net	vb6
this is probably why for example microsoft s style guidelines recommended that vb6 programmers put a type prefix with variable names but that vb.net programmers do not

859230
unsigned	short
this way you need to remember just 3 unsigned short integers in memory

859274
pop-up	dialog
fyi the reason i am trying to do this is because i am writing an eclipse plug-in and i would like to pop-up dialog that are not modal to the ide but that are modal blocking to my ui logic

859303
width	height
the bonus is that although i specified the height width above this technique will work for dynamic re-sizing not relying on fixed-width sizes of images or it s as fluid as your design can allow it to be

859323
swt	swing
but again i don t see how this could help you since eclipse uses swt instead of swing

859424
cifs	smb
the problem in the ruby script might be that there is no dns name resolution on your network this is often hidden if you usually share stuff between computers with smb cifs because that has it s own name discovery protocol

859449
arraylist	treeset
but i also know that the right choice between treeset hashset or linkedlist arraylist is crucial for performance and always using vector and arrays can t be right

859459
bonjour	avahi
if you run bonjour on your windows systems and avahi on your linux systems you can do away with the need to determine each system s ip address

859497
google-chrome	firefox
your code actually works in google-chrome but won t work in firefox and off the top of my head i m going to say it won t work in internet explorer either which is generally not friendly about modifying native objects and functions

859518

859588
versioning	upgrade
bear in mind that you can buy upgrade editions of vs and upgrade from the express versioning or even eclipse

859589
post	get
today i implemented a session token authentication system for my web api http get post rpc style following this plan

859643
dateadd	datepart
finally this code is t-sql so you ll probably need to convert the datepart and dateadd to whatever the equivalent is in sqlite

859645
recvfrom	datagram
just send the datagram containing its name then use recvfrom - or equivalents - to catch it at the other pcs

859688
ready	each
if you have two teams building two components each may need to mock the other s component so that they have something the mock against which to test their own component before their component is deemed ready for subsequent integration testing and before the other team has delivered their component against which your component can be tested

859747
affinity	processors
now that i know one core is slower than the others i can get accurate benchmark results by setting the processors affinity to the same core for all runs

859747
addition	multiplication
floating point multiplication and addition

859747
affinity	processors
when i explicitly set the processors affinity then my application does not slow down on core #2

859747
affinity	processors
however if it chooses to run on core #2 without an explicitly set processors affinity then the application runs about 10 slower

859747
affinity	processors
that explains why my simple test cases did not show the same slowdown as they all explicitly set the processors affinity

859747
affinity	processors
so it looks like there is some process that likes to live on core #2 but it gets out of the way if the processors affinity is set

859747
affinity	processors
bottom line if you need to have an accurate benchmark of a single-threaded program on a multicore machine then make sure to set the processors affinity

859762
int	boolean
assume active is a boolean field tiny int with 0 or 1

859780

860055
post	get
i have looked at this post as well and get how to do it but my limitations with css are haunting me

860069
width	height
width and height sounds like properties that are only relevant to the view part of your project and should thus be stored within it

860069
getter	setter
when developing in java which i quite rarely do... i tend to set up a class named settings in which i store whatever i need as private fields with getter and or setter where it s needed

860106
webclient	httpwebrequest
the inbuilt code webclient wcf httpwebrequest etc all make use of the winhttp configuration to obtain proxy configuration

860112
junit	jmockit
so i loaded up jmockit 0.9.7 and junit 4.6

860145
content-disposition	content-type
setting the content-disposition and content-type headers should do it but you might also need to call response.clearheaders to clear other headers that have been set

860192
implements	extends
you ll most likely extends abstractlistmodel to get the listener registration and implements getelementat int and getsize

860200
equals	gethashcode
i have seen several solutions that provide base class with id and id-based gethashcode equals

860200
equals	gethashcode
i do not see a equals gethashcode benefits either since the identity map implementation should guarantee that reference equality is the id equality anyway

860203
pop-up	dialog
in aptitude the menus are correctly outlined in line drawing characters but not the are you sure you wish to exit pop-up dialog

860210
skip-lists	tree
binary tree skip-lists vs

860351
public	protected
protected - base class s public members will be protected

860353
public	protected
there are three accessors that i m aware of public protected and private

860353
public	protected
the same happens with public private and protected inheritance

860363
public	protected
it s essentially the access protection of the public and protected members of the base class in the derived class

860363
public	protected
with public inheritance the derived class can see public and protected members of the base

860389
mouse	keyboard
it controls the keyboard mouse pointer grabs a set of gtk.gdk.screen objects

860395
public	protected
when inheriting you can in some languages change the protection type of a data member in certain direction from protected to public

860396
serializable	deserialization
for storing the actual search i ve often serializable the nspredicate instance for the query into either a data property handling the serializable deserialization myself or into a transformable using the default nsunarchivefromdata transfer property

860405
hash	md5
since i don t feel like writing my own hash function and md5 is available my current approach is to use the first 32 bits first 8 hex digits from an md5 hash

860406
apache	nginx
if you are not tied to apache for something else i would also try nginx with phusion passenger

860406
apache	nginx
if you re concerned about memory usage you should see a smaller footprint from nginx than apache and the lastest version of passenger will download compile and install nginx for you with minimal headaches

860424
hash	md5
of an md5 hash just as random as any

860425
hash	md5
you should therefore be safe to use just the first 32 bits of an md5 hash

860509
strlen	substr
all answers so far seem to do loads of unnecessary work strlen calculations string allocations substr etc

860552
boost	allocator
as to your question about a generalized callback you can use a boost function but that essentially uses virtual functions under the covers it may not - but at least a similar concept so the performance difference you are looking for won t be there in fact boost function will probably be slower because of heap allocator

860623
daemons	systemd
the gradual increase in memory consumption lets the daemons clean up the systemd without killing my app

860676
opensuse	linux

860679
getter	setter
i had to fill in the getter and setter of your class and containing structure but this is tested working code

860681
jar	manifest.mf
you might want to check the manifest.mf file of the ejb s jar to verify this

860721
folder	directory
you put it in your c python26 lib site-packages directory under your own folder

860768
mp3	wav
i wrote a front end that invokes sox with lame to translate the wav files into mp3 s then uses soundmanager2 a flash javascript tool on the client side to play them back

860768
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
so far works great with ie firefox safari and google-chrome on windows and firefox and safari on macs

860787
instances	transient
if the instances is transient when it is first attached to the session your type does not need to store its db id in a field

860788
put	get
you specified c++ as tag maybe use a filestream std ifstream for input from file and the global getline function to get it line by line and put it in a std string for further analysis manipulation

860813
mp3	wav
flowplayer supports mp3 playback i know maybe not wav but you could definitely couple it with ffmpeg to do some quick transcoding depending on your setup

860819
punctuation	words
check for sentence ending punctuation that follow words that don t start with uppercase letters

860834
keydown	keyup
it watches for virtual key messages and when it recognizes a keydown keyup combination it adds character messages

860861
disk	ram
if you re prepared to relax the requirement of 8mb ram for 6 million songs or to go to disk for example by memory mapping you could generate the sequence from 1..n at the beginning shuffle it with fisher-yates and whenever a new song is added pick a random element from the so-far-unplayed section insert the new id there and append the original id to the end of the list

860963
addslashes	multibyte
basically the way the attack works is by getting addslashes to put a backslash in the middle of a multibyte character such that the backslash loses its meaning by being part of a valid multibyte sequence

860963
addslashes	multibyte
addslashes can be tricked into creating a valid multibyte character

861008

861097
floor	sqrt
the algorithms for this should be trivial start with p floor sqrt a and count down until mod a p 0

861101
folder	directory
installutil.exe lives in the framework folder somewhere in your windows directory

861277
executable	upx
executable image compactors like upx are not recommended for dlls in particular and for executable that may have many instances running because the in-memory decompression acts like relocation in preventing the in-memory image from being shared between multiple processes

861280
datalist	repeater
what i d do is get your list in alphabetical order and then rearrange such that when you use the datalist repeater default ordering it s in your desired format

ant	maven
i think maven gets a bad rap because it imposes structure on your project whereas other tools such as ant allow you to completely define the structure any way you wish

861412
ant	maven
agreed also that the documentation is bad but i think primarily the bad rap that maven gets is because people are so used to ant

861425
hide	show
you ll need to write dom traversal code to find elements in the form event binding code to bind functions to the events for the form elements this differs between ie and non-ie and then use the style.display property for sub-elements to hide or show them

861426
button	checkbox
what you will probably want to do is just have an onclick event handler on each checkbox or radio button and when that is clicked then create a new div and populate it with the extra information or if that information was already populated and was just hidden using css then have the event handler make it visible

861511
rss	feed
sharepoint is what we use mostly it s pretty well integrated into office for sharing docs with check in and out plus you can create wiki s document lists with rss feed etc it s....usable

the new dynamic keyword in c# is part of this it uses mechanisms from the dlr to help interoperate with dynamically typed languages and object systems such as com automation objects ironpython ironruby etc

861682
serializable	deserialization
however this imposes a lot of work on you both on the client side creating the message object you basically have to manually create the xml that makes up the generic message as well as the server side since you can t rely on the nice xml serializable deserialization anymore

861687
folder	directory
the system32 directory is always in the path so putting the unmanaged dlls there always works but i would recommend adding some other folder to the path and then adding the dlls there to prevent polluting the system32 directory

now server-side languages can only prevent the latter two non-persistent and persistent as the first only takes place on the client-side

862072
post	put
delete and put are not supported in forms built with html 4 but if you are using javascript to communicate then you ll be fine but you might want to expose create and delete operations via post as well possibly passing in the post payload

firefox	safari
firefox safari cancel these requests and allow navigation to another page

862192
xfs	ntfs	hfs+	ntfs	filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs+	filesystems	xfs
since we are developing filters not a new filesystems the behavior should be the same as the underlying filesystems ntfs hfs+ xfs

862192
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs
so the tools need to check not only basic operations open read write close dir but also os and filesystems specific features like resource forks on hfs streams on ntfs security attributes etc

862209
getter	setter
the obvious way to allow editing of a position is to build a viewmodel which has getter and setter as well as a toposition method to extract the validated immutable position instance

hash	md5
i intend to use a hash function like md5 to hash the file contents

862377
treemap	treeset
a treeset and a hashset also do it since they are backed up by a treemap and a hashmap so there is no penalty in doing so actualy it should be a minimal gain

862388
folder	directory
so there seems to be a few questions asking about removing files directory matching certain cases but i m looking for the exact opposite delete everything in a folder that doesn t match my provided examples

862470

862612
post	get
i need to post the xml data which i will get from the database to a url like .

862635

862886
nexus	artifactory
standardized artifact management especially in conjunction with nexus or artifactory

862886
jar	war
it s a minor point but the fact that maven embeds details like the version number inside the jar or war not just in the filename by default is tremendously helpful

862975
width	height
then you can either reformat images such that the point you re interested in is in the center of the image which you can calculate easily client-side with only the width and height or send the co-ordinate with the image

863012
width	height
when creating pop-ups you can only set width and height

863012
width	height
but since the pop-up was created it means you can change the height and width of the window when the pop-up loads

w3 standard event but firefox and safari have included support for it

863280
opera	firefox
so far it s working in firefox and opera but it doesn t seem to work in ie7 or 8

863294
ubuntu	debian
it works on ubuntu debian 5 and mac os x

863344

you can also get more details in this blog post

863436
post	get
whenever a post or get occurs i do that via jquery.load and insert the partialview into the dom

863467

asp.net will get the data from the viewstate and put it in place

863480
width	height
itâ s as simple as searching for width â œxâ height â œyâ and replacing it with width â œyâ height â œxâ

863491
tapestry	wicket	tapestry	seam	wicket	seam
and i think you d be better off for now bypassing more ajaxy type frameworks like tapestry or wicket or the more end to end solutions like seam as overcmpolicating the issue

863495
width	height
note width and height must be fixed for overflow to work

863527
post	get
params is a special rails hash that contains the post get parameters passed to the controller method being executed

863527
post	get
will return a string that has the html-safe value of the post get parameter chat_input

863543
children	parent
you can then programatically produce the set children from the set of childlinks perhaps in the getchildren method of the parent class

863699
inherited	properties
see the dependency properties information section of the maxheight which does not inherited parent s value and fontsize which does propagates as you describe

863699
inherited	properties
properties value inherited

863699
inherited	properties
an element can inherited the value of a dependency properties from its parent in the tree

863699
inherited	properties
properties value inherited behavior is not globally enabled for all dependency properties because the calculation time for inherited does have some performance impact

863699
inherited	properties
properties value inherited is typically only enabled for properties where a particular scenario suggests that properties value inherited is appropriate

863699
inherited	properties
you can determine whether a dependency properties inherited by looking at the dependency properties information section for that dependency properties in the sdk reference

863741
x86	64bit
your msil project runs as 64bit on an x64 machine so for now your solution of making your builder x86 is probably the best although in the future msbuild itself may work around this

863745
inherited	subclassing
i don t think subclassing is the way to go when its just common functionality you want to get into your objects and not a real inherited situation

863757
google-chrome	safari
however on safari and google-chrome the appear on the far left of the page

863789
children	parent
so class hierarchy parent with children child1 and child2

863810
post	get
finally params is a method in rails that gives you access to get and post parameters

863810
post	get
it s actually wrapping a hash get and post parameters are symbolized to reduce memory symbols are only defined once whereas a string like foo is a new object every time.

863810
post	get
so params chat_input retrieves the value from the previous request s get or post parameters and in your case it looks like it s just displaying and sanitizing them

863842
put	get
the main reason to have a get set wrap around a private var is to be able to put logic around the access

863857
pecl	pear
php has both a pecl extension and a pear package that can do geoip lookups

863866
accessor	properties
the solution proposed by my co-worker was to refactor the name of the stuff properties to allstuff and add a properties stuff that has a get and set accessor and use the new stuff properties in the operator override

863867
postgresql	mysql
edit the rdbms will be probably postgresql maybe hope not mysql

863891
inherited	properties
anywhere outside including inherited classes should get and set the properties but within the declaring class i say it s ok to assign the private member

863898
width	height
i ve had a look and one of your stylesheets set the height and width for #logopic

863898
width	height
try the real height and width of the image in there instead

863905
post	get
the next option is the one that john saunders referenced in his post and that is to use a service such as earthtools to look up a location and get the timezone information

863964
post	get
sorting this out should probably be being done in code in a feature reciever in the page layout feature if i ever get around to writing this i ll post it somewhere.

863973
accessor	properties	getter	setter
if i have to add code to the properties i still only use the field inside of the properties accessor and use the getter and setter everywhere else including the constructor

863992
post	get
a much better solution would be to post your data instead of using a get

864074
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

864081
firefox	safari
i ve made a simple site with a centered box followed by two-columns and it displays fine in firefox 3 and safari 3 but not in ie7

864102
getter	setter
there are certain conventions around getter and setter

864102

note that using xargs like this has issues with spaces in filenames as xargs just uses whitespace as a delimiter

864444
put	get
before you get angry with c out please consider that the output often is something a user has put in there - potentially with some unwanted code

864513
put	get
jmp target_address won t work i am guessing so they just put it as bytes to get around this issue

864527
direct3d	directx
that s also why other directx wrappers exist slimdx comes to mind as a much more direct direct3d wrapper

864534
prepare	execute
if you re only going to execute it once a prepare statement will take longer because the database engine has to do all the setup for a prepare statement then insert the values then have it floating around in a cache until the engine decides to flush it

864561
put	get
same thing except have the windows batch job get the files instead of having the aix script put them

864579
implements	extends
since icoolengine extends iengine any object implements icoolengine can be treated as if it s an iengine without all the icoolengine -specific methods of course

864611
min	max
instead once you have decided on your step size you could potentially set your min and max like this

864616
short	base
with our code base we have created complicated applications for customers in short time frames

864651
profiler	visualvm
visualvm nor the netbeans profiler

a space inbetween selectors finds all children of the parent node recursively

865002
dependencyobject	freezable
cannot use a dependencyobject that belongs to a different thread than its parent freezable

865026
put	get
you can also use the get method to put the count in the url so that you dont have to write the count to a file or database

865057
client-side	server-side
another option might be to have client-side code populate a hidden form field with the filename which you would then have server-side

865108
implements	extends
except that it extends javax.swing.filechooser.filefilter instead of implements java.io.filefilter

865188
mp3	wav
nothing too complex just some basic processing and then output the result in either mp3 or a format easily converted to mp3 such as wav

865256
boost	stl
now if you intend on learning go for the best start quickly with stl basics and jump into boost libraries right away

865276
dia	visio
it s a general purpose svg editor so you re free to be more creative and expressive in your diagrams than with dia or visio both of which i ve used

if you are on a nix environment you can use cron jobs

865399
memset	strncpy	memset	memcmp	memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	memmove	memcpy	memcmp	memcpy	memset	strncpy	memcmp	strncmp	strncpy	strncmp	memset	strncmp	memmove	strncmp	memcmp	strncmp	memcpy	memmove	strncpy	memmove	memcmp	memmove	memset

865402
integer	unsigned
size_t is an alias typedef for an unsigned integer

865432
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
the documentation says that the supported formats are bmp gif exig jpg png and tiff

865443
cgpoint	cgsize	cgpoint	cgrect	cgsize	cgrect
because a cgrect contains a cgpoint and a cgsize you use one set of braces for the cgrect then another set for each of cgpoint cgsize

865448
trie	tree
i did this not too long ago to implement a binary trie based map the key was an integer and each level on the tree was a bit position

865448
implements	extends
to implements a set you extends abstractset and supply implementations of size and iterator

865448
put	get
you will want to also implement get and put since the default map is unmodifiable and the default implementation of get iterates through the entryset looking for a match

865466
stateless	stateful
shall it be stateless or stateful

865466
wan	lan
are clients co-located in the same vm appserver or remote in the same lan or even in a wan

865469
inherited	properties
the child b usercontrol would inherited this datacontext and could therefore bind it s controls to the same properties as a uses

865478
selecteditem	selectedindex
you can try combobox s selectedindex or selectedvalue to tell the selecteditem

865508
versioning	upgrade
my advice is to perform a new update upgrade in order to catch a new versioning that may resolve this problem

865574
960.gs	fluid
css frameworks such as 960.gs go for overall fixed maximums but there s also much to be said for fluid widths in general

865599
shadowing	named
you re shadowing a ivar named with the function argument

865599
uitableview	nsindexpath
in - uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

865626
bindparam	bindvalue
i tried the same thing with bindvalue and got the same result so the behavior you are seeing is not limited to bindparam

865648
addclass	removeclass
in regards to whether or not addclass and removeclass can handle these

865651
post	put
weâ d probably have a better chance of helping you if you put some actual code in the post

865655
division	multiplication
division and multiplication by integers seems to work out of the box

865661
spaces	delimiter
i d hate to reinvent something that was already written so i m wondering if there is a readword function somewhere in the .net framework that extracts words based some text delimiter by white spaces and line breaks

865672
post	get
alas your question can t be answered ajax requests have nothing to do with browser history and if you loaded some dynamic content with them then the user clicked the browser back button the previous page is loaded this which was loaded with an ordinary get or post request which corrupts the sequence you display content in

865693
google-chrome	firefox
for some reason the onkeydown event is not firing in firefox or ie but it works fine in google-chrome

865696
daemon	cron
since you explicitly state that you don t want to use cron the only other way to do this without something analogous to cron is to set up your script as a daemon

865732
strtol	atoi
aside from f scanf which has been sufficiently discussed by the other answers there is also atoi and strtol for cases when you already have read input into a string but want to convert it into an int or long

865732
strtol	atoi
strtol is recommended because it allows you to determine whether a number was successfully read or not as opposed to atoi which has no way to report any error and will simply return 0 if it given garbage

865735
unsigned	short
if the given image is n x m pixels big then the image is n x m x 2 bytes big each pixel is an unsigned short and it s a greyscale image

865754
prepare	execute
when using mysql from jdbc -- at least as of a couple of years ago when i last looked into this -- there is pretty much zero difference between prepare statements and single-use statements because the mysql jdbc driver saves prepare statements on the client side when you execute the prepare statement it fills in the values as text and ships it over to the database engine

865809
addclass	removeclass
i don t think addclass or removeclass can handle these kind of classes

865865
hide	show
when ischecked is true you move the rectangle to one of the sides show the on word and hide the off word

865891
hide	show
or do i show hide the already existing html

865907
hide	show
i think it depends on what you re planning on displaying if it s images then i d be tempted to hide them on page load and then show on hover but if it s just a block of text then i d probably be tempted in appending to the dom and then removing on hover out

865960
rss	feed
following on kevin s suggestion of rss feed you might want to check out yahoo pipes

866048
spweb	splist	spweb	spsite	splist	spsite
yep iterate through each spsite spweb splist contenttype and display where it is used

866051

i can t seem to figure out how to stream the outputstream into the returned datahandler any other way than to create a temporary file write to it then open it back up again as an inputstream

866056
mouse	keyboard
i m trying to work with copysymbolichotkeys but i m not sure that i m using it correctly as it lists commands as being reserved even though i do not see it listed in the keyboard shortcuts tab-pane of the keyboard mouse system preferences

nlb	iis
i have two iis servers running using nlb

866136
serializable	deserialization
that data now has to go through serializable deserialization boundaries

with semantics similar to foreach in other languages x gets referenced to each element in the container so that the function actually double each value inside the int vector

866298
postgresql	mysql
i don t know if you use php or not but i ve found that addslashes works relatively well for mysql but bombs fast in postgresql

866299
struts	wicket
in a webapp using spring mvc struts faces wicket whatever you are going to have a lot more control over everything but also be responsible for implementing more stuff

866314
gif	png
animated png images apng have been around for quite a while in an attempt to add this functionality of the gif format to png images

866314
opera	firefox

i recently tried to get access to a serial communication using a bluetooth usb dongle

866609
cldc	midp
we targeted midp 2.0 cldc 1.1

866610
required	placeholder
alternatively call cache.add with a placeholder object for each of the required dependent keys without first checking if they exist with a get and use an exception handler to swallow the exception thrown if it already exists.

866622
setinterval	settimeout
also something similar to setinterval would be nice where it calls the callback every n seconds but that can be implemented using settimeout

866629
spaces	delimiter
comma spaces delimiter our own system

866658
clang	llvm
use llvm clang static analyzer

866663
onmousemove	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmousemove
while i agree that library is the way to go the answer you want is onmousedown onmousemove onmouseup

866663
onmousemove	onmouseup
in the onmouseup event you d clear your draggedobject variable and stop handling onmousemove

866694
post	get
this blog post helped me get it working

866716
keydown	keyup
use glutignorekeyrepeat to only get physical keydown keyup events

int	boolean
to get the int boolean values out of the dictionary you d do the following

866749
width	height
aspectratio is width height

866753
rss	feed
there may be times when you want to save an article object without updating your rss feed -- you might import an archive of articles at some point

866756
int	boolean
first off if your dataset only consists of 3-digit int then a simple array of 1000 boolean will be much more memory effieicnt than a map

866856
pop-up	dialog
recording the test seems to work except there s nothing in the log when the dialog pop-up but they don t play back properly

866914
pop-up	dialog
i can t interact with a pop-up dialog

866943
disk	ram
i ve read the database speed comparison page at and i must say i was surprised by the performance of sqlite but since those benchmarks are a bit old i was looking for a more updated benchmark sqlite 3 vs mysql 5 again my main concern is disk performance not cpu ram

866955
mouseover	mouseout
it has some buttons made up of images with mouseover mouseout events on them in javascript and a bunch of embedded .net usercontrols

866955
mouseover	mouseout
when the mouseover mouseout events fire i change the images src to something else simple rollover effect

867031
accessor	properties
the synthesize directive on properties generates accessor methods for properties so we don t have to do it manually and because

867031
accessor	properties
so when you define your properties as you did above nonatomic copy and then use you re actually calling generated accessor that will make a copy of the new variable as opposed to just assigning it

867035
accessor	properties
in the implementation of ovaldrawdocument i m trying to use the auto-generated properties accessor for ovals like so

867086
try-catch	exception-handling
this is because most of the exception-handling metadata gathering such as getting a stack trace etc. only really happens on the try-catch side not on the throw side

867107
ant	maven
you could also do all this by hand using maven or ant

867140

there are often ways to avoid this but if you re really worried about the cost of comparisons i d go with something like mergesort or a heapsort

867241
difftime	mktime
not necessarily the best way but if you wish to use what s available on the system difftime and mktime can help -

867249
expression-blend	silverlight

octal	decimal
there is an octal syntax prefix your number with 0 decimal syntax and hexadecimal syntax with a 0x prefix

867442
getter	setter
it would be nice if i could have a method which would take as a parameter method calls to setter and getter and call this for all fields but unfortunately this is not possible with java

867442

16-bit	64bit
the obvious ones are pointers and pointer-diffs for different architectures but also floating-point types 16 32 or 64bit depending on the exactness checksums 8 or 16-bit depending on speed and some other non-obvious stuff

867488
bash	zsh
take a look at shflags which is a portable shell library meaning sh bash dash ksh zsh on linux solaris etc.

867506
uiview	calayer
i m doing animation on the uiview by adding calayer objects to the view s layer and animating these layers

867515
pascal	delphi
- maybe this could be adjusted from php for delphi pascal

867537
profiling	debugging
in some circumstances you can also use wct it s usually implmented by debugger s or profiling however it can be used from any code as the usual debugger requirement of being the thread which has the debugging port open is not a pre-requisit

867576
multiplying	add
also think of any non-negative number multiplying it by two then add one tack a binary one on to the end

867602
int	chars
ideally i d like to get an int or a chars where each bit is random and independent but other solutions are also possible

867654
filesystems	hfs+
knowing that time machine uses heavily the features of the underlying mac filesystems hfs+ looking into rdiff would make sense

867664
quad	shading
either by hooking into each polygon s shading as they render or by doing a single full-screen quad in a second pass that just reads each pixel converts to grayscale and writes it back

867694

even when i explicitly set the width and height at the right moment the size doesn t stick

867965
next	except
it is fine for my data except that the recommended table has a sku field i need also however i cannot put it next to recommended.productcode and have the query still work

867975

i would recommend a version management tool like svn cvs sourcesafe because it helps you understand what you did when and why and gives you more control over your code go back branch merge etc

868026
postgresql	mysql
also php first or mysql postgresql first

868030
stdout	stderr
it uses different colours for commands and program stdin stdout stderr

868834
perforce	svn
one conversion to perforce and two to svn

868849
qabstracttablemodel	qabstractlistmodel
i believe that both qabstractlistmodel and qabstracttablemodel handle the parent portion themselves leaving you free to just worry about the data you want

868855
config	ini
for example if an application has simple config requirements and has strict startup time goals registry entries or a simple ini file may be a faster startup alternative

868858
folder	dir
so you could have your c++ project pointing to the main folder then create a java project in a different dir and then use the above mechanism to compile all the java source

868866
webclient	networkcredentials
webclient and networkcredentials shoudl solve that for you examples

868968

apache	nginx
i want nginx to handle all static files and apache to process all dynamic stuff

869090
free	malloc
consider changing the buffer code to a file static or a malloc free

869201
hide	show
my only solution there is to duplicate the fields in another section and hide show the appropriate section based on logic

869215
post	get
later i will get a chance to look at the bouncycastle librarys to be able to test this and will post more code if necessary

869309
g++	gcc
i use gcc g++ on linux and since my install is in spanish my native language gcc prints warnings and errors in spanish

869309
g++	gcc
i ve googled for this but every language topic about gcc and g++ refers to programming language not human language

869340
children	parent
these rownumbers let it take 10 parent even if that s really 50 records due to each parent having 5 children

869350
google-chrome	firefox
in terms of how to get the buffer to send you can use a number of framebuffers to render to and set up the framebuffer code to start a timer when a change is made and while changes are occurring send periodic changes when enough time has gone by since the last change not sent yet send an update probably shorter time than the first value and also probably include some sort of strobe that forces an update that can be invoked on certain occurrences if you can for example get a page-load-completion indication from the browser which you can with a little work in firefox by changing the google-chrome etc

869350
rdp	remote-desktop
for examples of other solutions look at remote-desktop protocols and programs like vnc rdp windows remote desktop etc - that s effectively what they re doing again with fancier compression and damage-region tracking

869365
firefox	safari
this appears correctly in safari and firefox but not in ie

869368
post	get
if you can t get to the forum and need the additional code leave a comment and i ll post the missing pieces

869449
put	get
if i put the common functionality in a base class that inherits from the common ancestor i get a class which makes no sense to instantiate so i made it abstract

869478
innodb	myisam
make sure your tables are innodb because it won t work on myisam tables

869516
xslt	sgml
you might not like xslt for its verbosiness or functionalness but it s damn helps that your template is xmllint-able xml and your output is a good sgml xml

869532
hash	md5
with a 128 bit md5 hash that s 16 bytes per hash or only about 1.6mb of memory + overhead

869541
mouse	keyboard
this still allows the indicator to appear when focused by keyboard but hides when mouse activated

869560
cublas	lapack
follow up lapack is a full featured library for dealing with all kind of linear algebra stuff and it s damn efficient at this there are also gpu based libraries such as cublas which runs on nvidia gpus using cuda

869568
hide	show
you can code your own solution with a div containing an input field and a button and some javascript to show hide the div

869576
openinventor	coin3d	openscenegraph	openinventor
openscenegraph is popular coin3d free for non-commercial use is an implementation of the openinventor spec any of them would probably fit your need as it doesn t sound like you need any cutting-edge support

869597
int	double
but an implicit conversion happens from double to int

869672
folder	directory
i created a winform that would do the following create a new local user account and add them to a group create a new directory under our ftp server s base directory create a new virtual ftp folder so that a user could map a connection to the folder and finally give the new user full control of the new directory and because the directory was a virtual folder the new user has full control via ftp

869687
prng	random
the downside is of course that these numbers are not random at all which depending on what you are using the prng for may or may not matter

869699
ubuntu	debian
if you have shell access and it s an ubuntu debian machine just do

if you really want to replace all your tdatetime variables with this you probably need to overload some other operators too add subtract explicit ...

869876
getter	setter	super	implements
are implements using the getter and the setter of the super class

869908
strtol	strtod	nsscanner	nsnumberformatter
you ll then want to use either strtol strtoul strtod nsscanner or nsnumberformatter to convert the input to numeric types

869927
post	put
i have a need to do raw post put a var requests to a server and accept the results from that page as a string

width	height
i would like the height width of a remote image

869997
getter	setter
change all the getter and setter to access the array

869997
getter	setter
then create a generic getter setter pair that use an index as well as a getter for the compare flag

869997
getter	setter
as you already have getter and setter any other code using this class should continue to work unchanged

869997
getter	setter
if there is no other code using this class then throw away the existing getter and setter and just do everything with the array

870008
ftp	telnet	tftp	telnet

870033
width	height
the height and width of an image are attributes inside the image file and you need to retieve the file to be able to access them

870033
width	height
in the event of a large image you can try something like start fecthing the image to your server and as soon as you start receiving data and know the format of the image wait until you receive enough from the image to look at the height and width information and stop the transfer

870033
width	height
if by chance you control the server where the images are you are better of writting a small script hosted in that server that given an image file identifier returns the height and width for that image

870044
cpu	affinity
i d suggest setting the cpu affinity to the slow core and see if it s just as fast that way

870044
cpu	affinity
setting zope s cpu affinity to any cpu fixed the problem

870046
cpython	ironpython
i have done this with pretty much every reflective mechanism that exists in the python world cpython on python api s and com api s using makepy jython for java api s and ironpython for .net api s

870080
union	distinct
also a union all takes longer than a union distinct

870102
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
to prevent these things in google-chrome opera firefox etc

870118
post	get
besides if you are doing anything more complex than loading some x html into an element you should probably use one of the more powerful jquery ajax methods get or post or ajax

870126
put	get
on an aside this so question in a roundabout way asked if there is any way to get eclipse to put the + symbol on the new line when it splits a string for you

870133
versioning	upgrade
there might still be corporate environments where they won t upgrade for a while because they have legacy web apps that depend on the browser versioning or just won t spare the manpower to coordinate an upgrade

870137
move	drag
the objects are nodes and edges represented in datatemplate s with thumb and polyline objects and i want to be able to detect clicks and drag on the itemscontrol in order to move the nodes and edges

870160
put	get
i asked how to do this before but it seems i needed to put more code to really get an answer

870160
rss	feed
i have a reddit type site and i am trying to create a rss feed this is the code but i get a fatal error uncaught exception exception with message query failed

870174

if there is any way to get eclipse to put the + symbol on the new line when it splits a string for you

870231
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
ie8 is available or even google-chrome firefox safari etc

870237
width	margin
since a page can have margin for it body element so styling a div to the width of its body element won t do

870253
waitpid	fork
in unix terminology i want to fork exec waitpid and getrusage

870334
cfstring	nsstring
cfstring and nsstring cfarray and nsarray are both examples

870369

i ve implements a deskband taskbar toolbar using the bandobjectlib extends explorer with band objects using .net and windows forms from codeproject modified with support for the ideskband2 interface which allows the start menu in windows vista to retain transparency when my deskband taskbar toolbar is enabled

870412
versioning	upgrade
there is no script that has the straight final versioning even deploy on a clean db does the deploy via a series of upgrade steps

870479
post	get
update ok the issue was that the browser doesn t post to get an image it gets so now my script sends a get string and it all works wonderfully

870480
min	max
so on each sample of the call stack it updates the function-level timing info but all it does with the line-number info is keep track of min and max line numbers in each function which the more samples it takes the farther apart those get

870513
width	height
if the css for the width and height were expressed as percentages rather than absolute values you could adjust the width by adjusting the iframe

870518
codeigniter	cakephp
this is the way libraries like codeigniter and cakephp handle the same scenario

870536
testdriven.net	xunit.net
we use testdriven.net with xunit.net for testing

870581
move	drag
the requirement is for the ui to perform a drag move if the server returns ok and no-op if the server returns an error

870599
folder	directory
there s also a cache folder in the ide directory

870611
qapplication	qcoreapplication
qcoreapplication s constructors require and qapplication inherits from qcoreapplication

870623
google-chrome	safari
if you try to send an ajax request a jsonp request or even a window.name request on unload safari and google-chrome run the code but the server never sees the request

870623
firefox	safari
this code and ajax and window.name creates a request for test.html in firefox and ie7 but not safari

870650
inherited	subclassing
unless you are doing some really funky inherited hierarchies and you shouldn t it is enough to know that the lookup order is left to right depth first and all subclassing of a class are searched before that class is searched

870673
hash	md5
more useful than checksums if you really need the extra application-level assurance would be a sha-n hash of the data or md5 etc

870693
nant	cruisecontrol
i ve wrestled with so many nant scripts cruisecontrol config files in the past i m almost blind from angle brackets

870735
ready	each
we have done this with cruisecontrol.net nant nunit and various power shell scripts it was pretty time consuming but each morning we come to work to find a fully compiled deployed exported and tested set of biztalk solutions ready for the test team

870744
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter mouseleave

870881
nant	psake
make a simple build script using whatever you want cmd nant rake psake ... that

870882
folder	directory
i created the directory structure as suggested with folder for logs

870898
put	get	post	put	post	get
imo there is hardly a need for a framework simply use the servlet api and implement the request methods you need aka post get put delete head

870938
margin	height
each one actually has the entire text of #page inside but the top margin is set neagtively the height is fixed and overflow is set to hidden so only the proper amount appears.

870938
firefox	safari
and it works great except for this while safari and firefox on the mac work perfectly ie and firefox on windows add an extra page

870955
mouse	keyboard
i just noticed last week that my keyboard has a right-click button between alt and ctrl on the right side so no mouse needed to mouse to a specific test

870977
jboss	glassfish
it scales differently you ve got the possibility of handling much larger loads but it s also totally different than running your own web app server glassfish tomcat jboss etc. and coding using standard java tools

870987
hebrew	turkish
the fontdialog class in c# has a property allowscriptchange that lets the user select the script western hebrew arabic turkish etc

870994
put	get
i really am starting to get what rest is about and getting into the guts of http and rooting for html5 put delete support

871088
width	height
for instance height and width can and should be grouped together because whenever users specify one they are used to specify the other

871137
int	chars
no more work needs to be done because the find method will return the page #123 automatically since the ruby to_i method will return the int that starts the string and ignore all chars starting with the first non-numerical chars

871187
smartsvn	tortoisesvn
svn on windows is dreadfully slow tried tortoisesvn smartsvn command line svn an update can take in the upwards of 5-8 minutes and it is only updating 10 small files

cpython	ironpython
so i can easily switch the interpreters from ironpython to cpython and vice versa

871225
firefox	safari
in safari 4 and firefox 3.5 you can determine the progress of an xmlhttprequest as follows

871235
jar	war
any project is responsible for building and then versionning its set of files to be delivered jar war ear ...

871276
getter	setter
your title getter and setter should save the value in a _title variable to be used later for the assignment in commitproperties

871276
width	height
override the measure function and update measuredwidth and measuredheight to be the maximum width and height values of the main label and it s child

871276
width	height
override updatedisplaylist and use setactualsize on the child label to set it to the required width and height

871321
post	put
i think one of the most important things you can put in place to facilitate this are tests to ensure that everything still works post refactoring pulling out into separate modules

871322
restrict	shared
we have a server application that we want to restrict non-users from triggerring it off from other machines or even by double-clicking from any shared

871330
post	get
some of the requests will be get s and others will be post s

871330
post	get
everything works for get but i am having difficulties getting the url parameter value for post s

871338
post	get
i assume from the things that you have tried that you know how to get a handle to your main window but if you don t just leave a comment and i will post a snippet for that

871354
pow	sqrt
operator and sqrt pow etc

871372
union	distinct
also a union all takes longer than a union distinct

871375
superclass	subclassing
the superclass and all the other subclassing continue to work unchanged

871375
superclass	subclassing
it is very expensive to add a new operation on things you have to add a new method declaration to the superclass and potentially add a method definition to every existing subclassing

871376
post	get
for post you will need to use something similar to below to get the individual parameters

871412
sorting	filtering
according to msdn the valuetype property is used when filtering or sorting the columns with respect to the contents of their cells. so i would be sure to set it for any column that allows sorting

871417
imperative	declarative
using a container is mostly about changing from an imperative scripted style of initialization and configuration to a declarative one

871422
put	get
i can put data into the amazon simpledb service and i can get it back

871434
hash	salt
for example one can argue that a cryptographic object providing methods to encrypt decrypt hash or get a salt value is a service provider but many group this functionality into a utility class with static methods like cryptoutil.encrypt ...

871452
cvs	svn
i m also a 10+ year mostly happy user of cvs though i also like git and with time will come to prefer it though most of the projects i work on currently use cvs or svn and we can t seem to get the bureacracy where i work convinced to let us punch a git-hole through the firewall

871458
imperative	declarative
either you encapsulate that complexity in imperative code or else in declarative code

871462
division	modulo
you can either using integer division and divide it by two and inspect the remainder or use a modulo and mod it by two and inspect the remainder

871520
webkit	gecko
webkit and gecko seem to behave similarly enough when it comes to javascript anyway

871533
webkit	gecko
when i need to look something up i use the mozilla developer network as gecko and webkit seem to be heading in roughly the same direction

871577
move	drag
i have a designercanvas derived from canvas that i can add uielements to then drag drop move group and move them around

i want to interpret enter key as tab key in whole my wpf application that is everywhere in my application when user press enter i want to focus the next focusable control except when button is focused

871773
queue	fifo
a relatively recent paper on lock-free fifo queue is this search for further papers by the same author s

871802
boost	stl
i m not particularly familiar with the boost libraries so there may be a more standard way to do this but i think you can do what you want with iterators and the stl transform function template

871867
post	get
sessions would be the only good way you could also use get post but that would be potentially insecure

871919
width	height
found out why in my method ratio it should take height and width and i put and i put 2 hieghts instead

871931
hash	salt
passwords store only a salt hash un-reversible of your passwords and compare with a similarly salt hash of an entered password

871968
ubuntu	linux
note i am using ubuntu and i am all-together new to anything linux

872018
direct3d	directdraw
those flags toggle the opengl pipeline turn of using direct3d and disable use of directdraw respectively

872035
google-chrome	firefox
the problem s cause must be earlier when oquestion.achoicerand gets assigned you think it s assigned to an array and apparently ie and firefox agree with you google-chrome is telling you that it s null instead

872055
opera	firefox
if it doesn t find that it looks for mozilla without compati or opera in an attempt to determine that the browser is firefox or opera

872083
post	get
if you want to get a notification from paypal with transaction details you have to enable ipn post

i ve had a look at differents java frameworks such as jsf stripes struts2 tapestry wicket and spring

872176
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
it s implied and in fact many case tools would show you the inherited method as part of the list of the methods of the subclassing when clicking on the class at looking at its properties and some case tools even have the option of showing also the inherited methods in the diagram

872197
ant	maven
maven and ant are both build tools while maven also handles dependencies for you

872210
width	height
and have the debugger output width and height i get the results in decimal however in the directx sample the result is in hexidecimal both are actually accurate when i convert the hexidecimal to decimal it seems to be appropriate

872231
mouse	keyboard
as my drawing function is called from inside the paint event handler of the form mouse and keyboard events are handled only after the whole triangle is drawn which can take quite a while

872315

what i don t understand is how i can use the navigationbarcontroller from within my tableviewcontroller and e.g - void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

872501
qcodo	qcubed
the ease of use ability to quickly build complex applications and the true oo approach qcodo now qcubed uses makes it the best framework for my purposes

872505
integer	unsigned
on a 64 bit system printing this value ip_int will display an unsigned integer since we ve removed the high bit

872522
post	get
except if you use something like sessions cookies or get post variables

872522
post	get
get and post

872553
rss	feed
the example uses an rss feed xml as the source but it should get you going

872558
pull	push
i m getting confused with regards to scope and gc as i have a custom movieclip-extending class slide which i create instances of within a loop and push into an array but afterwards the items are null when i pull them out of the collection

872663
subtract	add
let s say your coworker monkeypatches the fixnum class and redefines the + method to subtract instead of add

872722
exponent	addition
but it is a proposed addition with a 5-bit exponent and 10-bit fraction

872722
integer	fractions
if you want accuracy to the ones place as in you can represent each integer the answer is fairly simple the exponent shifts the decimal point to the right-end of the fractions

872730
submit	submission
not only are you going to restrict the submission only to people with js enabled people expect to have a submit button to their forms

872743
multiplying	subtraction
just two multiplying and a subtraction plus a function call to round are quite economic and the code is quite readable too

873108
mbunit	nunit
nunit or mbunit

873188
dlsym	dlopen
if you want to dynamically link you use dlopen dlsym to resolve unix .so shared library entry points

873212
post	get
make sure you are using get and post correctly because that is the simplest kind of security hole on many websites

873233
int	chars
byte short chars or int

873299
vim	emacs
if you have the time i d recommend learning a serious text editor like emacs or vim

873310
codeigniter	cakephp
take a look at cakephp codeigniter and or zend framework

873356
g++	gcc
the idea is to compile the cpp files using g++ and the c files using gcc then link them together

873367
floating-point	integer
for floating-point integers i ll give my answer in terms of ieee double-precision every integer between 1 and 2 53 is exactly representable

873374
g++	gcc
the easiest way to avoid undefined symbols while linking is to link with g++ not gcc

873374
g++	gcc
the link error may go away if you run all your gcc and g++ commands on the same system no matter the old or the new one

873401
width	height
you can also add a height and width to the error message

873417
inherited	properties
check that the codebehind properties in the page directive points to the .cs file and that the inherited properties points to the correct class name in the .cs file

873473
goto	break
ie i suppose goto could be used as an improv break

873508
versioning	upgrade
id like to use it for testing with older versioning of .net but it wont let me install the upgrade versioning

873508
versioning	upgrade
it just wont install to an empty vm because its an upgrade versioning

873510
inherited	properties
because properties inherited from hashtable the put and putall methods can be applied to a properties object

873541
onchange	onblur
onblur fires when a field loses focus while onchange fires when that field s value changes

873541
onchange	onblur
in firefox tabbing out of a changed field will fire onchange then onblur and it will normally do the same in ie

873541
onchange	onblur
however if you press the enter key instead of tab in firefox it will fire onblur then onchange while ie will usually fire in the original order

873541
onchange	onblur
you can t assume that either the onblur or the onchange will happen before the other one

873546
implements	extends
and it has to extends plain hashtable instead of because generics were implements in the downwards-compatibe way via type erasure so once the compiler has done its thing there are no generics

873610
width	height
i am making a photo gallery script that involves displaying an image in fixed width height box

873620
execvp	fork
then i create a new process with fork and execute that command with the associated arguments with execvp

873621
put	get
so to get zip-archive mode fully working on windows you will just need to find a windows version of command-line zip unzip and put them into a directory that is in your path see unzip package at

873654
equals	gethashcode
these seem naturally contradicting when a mutable object because if the state of the object changes we expect the value of equals to change which means that gethashcode should change to match the change in equals but gethashcode should not change

873654
equals	gethashcode
to sum up what i ve learned from this is that the only way to achieve all goals and to avoid possible quirky behavior in edge cases is to only override equals and gethashcode based on immutable fields or implement iequatable

873691
inherited	properties
unfortunately if they were to retroactively make properties inherited from then the following previously valid code would stop working

873691
inherited	properties
what s now appreciated by most educated observers is that properties should never have inherited from map at all

873692
equals	gethashcode
if you want the lookup not to use the gethashcode or equals method of the class you can always provide your own iequalitycomparer implementation to use instead when you create the dictionary

873709
serializable	deserialization
you mention serializable deserialization which is important because referential integrity is lost in that process

873709
equals	gethashcode
these are the fields you should use when overrideing gethashcode and equals

873709
equals	gethashcode
note that gethashcode and equals should work together

873709
equals	gethashcode
gethashcode should return the same value for two objects if they are equals

873711
organization	naming
apple s document organization assumes that you start at the beginning and establish a strong basic understanding of the frameworks patterns and naming conventions

873730
caanimation	nsanimation
there s a way to do it with nsanimation on mac but there s no equivalent that i know of in caanimation

873744
getter	setter
you instantiate a new object and user getter and setter to store your data and instead of writing sql in your page code you create functions in the objects related to the query

873744
put	get
you get all the data you need and then put as little php in the display basically just echoing the variables you got in the action controller with the exception of some for loops and if statements for conditionals

873791
postgresql	mysql
not only you need php extension s dlls in order to add mysql and postgresql support to php

873791
postgresql	mysql
you also need mysql and postgresql native libraries

873791
postgresql	mysql
make sure you have mysql and postgresql client installed and their dlls into some locatable place

873799
put	get
if the goal is to get the image specific to selected option and if you want to put your own image name instead of picture +id i would modify like below

873863
int	boolean
when a method is called a block of memory is pushed onto the top the stack that memory block has space for all primitives int float boolean etc and object references of the method which includes the method parameters

873890
postgresql	mysql
the problem here is that apache has loaded php but php was not able to load its extension mysql postgresql ...

873895
portrait	landscape
i d like the view to fill all the landscape space...and for text to fill use this space rather than wrapping as much as it does in portrait

873963
portrait	landscape
if itâ s too large in landscape and you use landscape often just make it all smaller and occasionally zoom when in portrait -

873975
ubuntu	linux
i want this setup to work on linux more specifically gnome under ubuntu but i do occasionally use other distro window manager so solution on the level of x is appreciated

873975
joystick	keyboard	hid	keyboard	hid	joystick
this foot pedal does not register itself as keyboard or even joystick but as a hid device with usagepage 12 usage 3

873975
hid	keyboard
i notice that the latest ubuntu can detect and use the favorite keys on the microsoft natural keyboard which also register as hid device

873975
hid	keyboard
for those not in the know the microsoft natural keyboard registers as both a regular keyboard and a generic hid device

873978
google-chrome	safari
en-us applewebkit 530.5 k html like gecko google-chrome 2.0.172.8 safari 530.5

873978
google-chrome	firefox
i just tested this with mozilla firefox and google-chrome and it works in firefox but not google-chrome

873978
google-chrome	firefox
edit 2 - so it seems that the reason it was working on firefox but not google-chrome was because firefox displays the html as its received while google-chrome waits for the connection to close before doing any rendering

873980
post	get
i use the above django shortcut from generic views where you can specify post save redirect get in your case

873986
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome s limit is different than firefox s

873987
post	get
ok i have an in template function that get s submitted via method post

873988
super	self
it s a self contained library that s a multithreaded http web server and has a super simple api yet complete

873995
chunked	transfer-encoding
but since i don t know the file size iis seems to be buffering the output until a certain limit is reached packet size or time i don t know then sends a packet with transfer-encoding set to chunked

874032
strncpy	calloc	strncpy	malloc	calloc	malloc
as to your comment on strncpy not nul-terminating the string which is true if you use calloc to allocate the string rather than malloc this won t be a problem if you allocate one byte more than you copy since calloc automatically sets all values including in this case the end to 0

874032
calloc	malloc
not that there s anything wrong with saying sizeof char - it clearly shows your intention and provides symmetry with calls to calloc or malloc for other types

874032
memcpy	strncpy
also i would use strncpy or memcpy rather than strncat

874032
memcpy	strncpy
plus strncpy and memcpy will probably be a wee little bit faster more efficient than strncat

874070
ubuntu	linux
cross platform it should be runnable on xp vista osx and common versions of linux such as ubuntu and kubuntu

874070
folder	directory
for windows xp and vista i had to copy qtcored4.dll qtguid4.dll qtsqld4.dll and mingwm10.dll to distribution directory this was debug code and i copied the qsqlited4.dll to a folder named sqldrivers in the distribution directory

874092
postgresql	mysql
postgresql and mysql select column from table limit 10

874191
uitableview	reloaddata
i have a uitableview which is populated by an array i have a button on the navigaton bar which when pressed adds an item to the array and calls self.tableview reloaddata in the uitableview

874192
solaris	bsd
it has active ports to windows linux and mac os x and has been compiled for at least some bsd variant and solaris as well

874204
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
to avoid refresh problems in firefox and forever loading problems in google-chrome and safari set the iframe s src to about blank once you re done

874227
post	get
i m doing a get and post method for an android project and i need to translate httpclient 3.x to httpclient 4.x using by android

874273
postgresql	mysql
those extensions depend on native libraries which are provided by the mysql and postgresql binary distributions

874278
post	get
when i m trying to call an ascx with jquery post i get

874318
equals	gethashcode
irrespective of the object type it will simply call the gethashcode and equals methods to allow it to put the value in the right bucket and retrieve it again

874350
installshield	orca
i m somewhat familiar with orca the tool to manipulate .msi files as well as full blown installer applications like installshield but i would like to make this using only raw visual studio and other available open-source tools

874424
opensuse	linux
tested with latest jdk 6 unter linux opensuse kde3

874427
post	get
you can do either get or post transactions too

874449
ubuntu	linux
the standard linux archive app that comes with ubuntu was used for gzipping

874559
subobject	instances
which is fine as all the custom objects only have a single instances anyway examples of subobject are the ui the tools the shared data etc.

874569
post	get
most often people choose to send data over to the server with post or get which is basically a method to transfer name-value pairs inherent to http

874579
onkeyup	onmouseup
if you don t want to do that the events you re likely looking for are onkeyup for arrow enter on the options and onmouseup for clicking on the options events

874589
put	get
when i put the table into editing mode there is a white line to the left of the reorder control that i can t seem to get rid of

874617
x86	mips
the core files might be little endian arm or big endian mips and the program to analyze them might be running on a little endian host x86 or big endian powerpc

874632
children	parent
in general the focus line will have a tree of parent and a tree of children

874635
int	double
i created a converter to convert from double to int

874660
int	double
you are attempting to cast not convert from double to int which won t work

874662
google-chrome	firefox
because some of the properties used in css are specific to firefox and google-chrome

874668
affinity	processors
set the testâ s processors affinity to run on one processors core only

874701
int	double
you want to convert but you are doing casting from double to int

874712
firefox	safari
if i remember correctly it works in firefox ie safari

874766
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
i am unsure if you can set it in a web.config file but what you can do is inherited from the grid view set the properties in the constructor and use that new subclassing

874785
tapestry	wicket	jsf	tapestry	jsf	wicket
you shoud start by using a normal web framework like wicket jsf tapestry gwt etc.. later if it turns out your servers preformance is cpu-bound you might ocnsider rewriting the most often used parts of the apllication that way

874815
stdout	stderr
capture stdout or stderr or potentially both either together or separately

874837
free	malloc
they re fairly simple wrappers around malloc and free

874851
hide	show
you could create ide macros to show hide your tool windows though

874865
stdout	stderr
you can try flushing stdout from the sub-process or using stderr or changing stdout on non-buffered mode

874871
google-chrome	firefox
my code works perfectly fine in firefox and internet explorer however it just dies in google-chrome

874937
inherited	properties
even if you inherited from the dropdownlist you cannot add this properties because you have to add it to the listitem control

874977
innodb	myisam
for mysql performance you should probably choose myisam over innodb as the storage engine provided your definition of optimal doesn t include most reliable

875003
post	get
you ll need to run a background thread to do the work and you ll then need to periodically post back to check the value of say session variable to get your current progress

875033
getter	setter
in actionscript 3 you can create getter and setter using the get and set keywords meaning you create a method in the class and access data through a property of an instance of that class

875033
getter	setter
is there an equivalent of actionscript 3 getter setter in java as in

875041
getter	setter
as3 getter and setter are an ecmascript thing

875042
getter	setter
in java the only option you have without exposing the internals of your object is to make your own getter and setter as you have in your example

875042
getter	setter
so as in your example the field name would have getname and setname methods as their corresponding getter and setter respectively

875045
getter	setter
the get and set patterns though are so established in java culture that you ll find strong ide support for them eclipse will make them for you automatically and if you re working in something that uses the expression language first made for jsps el then you ll be able to use the property notation to access getter and setter

875068
strncmp	strcmp
this uses strncmp instead of strcmp thus ensuring that no more than three bytes are compared

875093
getter	setter
i would consider not having the getter or setter as they don t do anything in your case except make the code more complicated

875093
getter	setter
here is an example without getter or setter

875094
bmp	png
it supports a load of file formats such as bmp jpg png pdf svg etc etc

875115
expressionengine	joomla
depending on what you re trying to achieve expressionengine is decent for a small site and joomla is pretty good for small to mid size

875159
for-loop	loops
if you loops using a regular for-loop and loops over it backwards you can remove items as you go

875170
sorting	filtering
this kind of repository pattern adds some conditions filtering sorting command .

875198
width	height
first create a div with the width you need put some characters in and request its height in pixels

875263
portrait	landscape
that explains how to achieve automatic rotation from portrait to landscape and back again without using interface builder and without having to deal with manually implementing complex transforms

875335
client-side	server-side
it ll allow you to target client-side apps server-side app and web apps via asp.net

875375
children	parent
i don t think uasort can help with this problem because you want to attach the children to the parent

875377
floor	sqrt
i have floor sqrt floor x

875395
getter	setter
also before adding setter and getter it might be a good idea to ask yourself why are you exposing the internal data of the object in question

875407
floor	sqrt
floor sqrt floor 2 floor sqrt 2 floor 1.41...

875417
haskell	scheme
a functional language haskell scheme

875432
getter	setter
they as the name implies allow variables to be retrieved and set - specifically they are called getter and setter

875434
lisp	scheme
scheme lisp and clojure are also acceptable

875442
floor	sqrt
obviously the outer floor is not redundant since for example sqrt 2 is not an integer and thus floor sqrt 2 â sqrt 2

875442
floor	sqrt
it is also easy to see that sqrt floor x â sqrt x for non-integer x

875442
floor	sqrt	ceil	sqrt	ceil	floor
it is easy to see that floor sqrt n â floor sqrt ceil n

875444
floor	sqrt
a sqrt x b floor sqrt x+d c sqrt x+d

875445
floor	sqrt	ceil	sqrt	ceil	floor
the inner one is redundant because the square root for any number in the interval x x+1 where x is an integer always lies within the interval floor sqrt x ceil sqrt x and therefore you don t need to floor a number before taking the square root of it if you are only interested the integer part of the result

875452
sitecore	dotnetnuke
as already given there are several content management solutions out there including sharepoint wordpress drupal dotnetnuke and sitecore

875474
floor	sqrt
if the inner floor were not redundant then we would expect that floor sqrt n

875474
floor	sqrt
floor sqrt m where m floor n

875474
floor	sqrt
floor sqrt n

875474
floor	sqrt
floor sqrt m requires that the values of sqrt n and sqrt m differ by at least 1.0

875474
floor	sqrt
thus for all values n the floor sqrt n floor sqrt n + 1

875485
daemons	launchd
according to wikipedia by definition a daemons should detach itself from the controlling tty so i think it s correct that no exception is shown and after all a daemons should keep working even if you close the shell that launchd it

875490
disk	ram
an impotant implementation detail might be what the api you use to access the index whether you store it in ram which the o s backs with the system page file and access it in-process using pointers and or store it on disk which the o s caches in the file system cache and access it using file i o apis

875500
webclient	ftpwebrequest
the webclient class doesn t allow that but ftpwebrequest does

875504
awt	swing
also you need to include the boilerplate to always access swing components on the awt event dispatch thread edt

875524
imperative	declarative
not all developers yet understand the difference between declarative and imperative programming

875530
post	get
i d like to give users the ability to get post in a random order by sending a get request with

875561
actualheight	actualwidth
- each has their verticleoffset and horizontaloffset properties binding to the actualheight and actualwidth of the child 2

875561
width	height
- topleft is offset negative the actual width and height

875561
mouse	keyboard
at the moment keyboard and mouse is locked captured by the first menu you focus on and the others are not available by hovering over them

875643
mouse	keyboard
suggestion with mouse or keyboard

875643
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works beautifully in ie6 ie7 ie8 google-chrome safari but not in firefox

875650
post	get
i am trying to get post a form to a hidden dynamically inserted iframe but in internet explorer the form submission opens in a new window

875712
getter	setter
and you may want to include getter setter for metadata and potentially attachments because they are a legitimate part of your domain an email

875717
put	get
crippling my machine without my express permission will get you put forever on the filter-with-extreme-prejudice list.

875757
debian	linux
i have a setup that builds linux arm i386 binaries and packages those into debs and maintains a debian repository from build results - run unittests and all kinds of stuff on the code

875789
g++	gcc
clarification at the moment we re using -d_reentrant and -lpthread i assume i can replace them with just g++ -pthread looking at man gcc it sets the flags for both preprocessor and linker

875801
daemons	systemd
but there s a tool called tcpwrappers which many systemd daemons also use - you know those hosts.allow hosts.deny files in your etc folder - they are part of tcpwrappers and can archive the exact scenario you described

875816
hash	md5
the md5 hash of wolfram alpha no quotes is

875886
width	height
in my flex project all width and height properties returns as zero

875915
hudson	phpundercontrol
after working for a long time with phpundercontrol we finally decided to switch to the hudson ci server

875971
uiview	subviews
what is happening is that when uitableviewcell shows the reorder control it also adds an empty 1 pixel wide white uiview to its array of subviews

875985
elementtree	beautifulsoup
invalid user submitted html content for example would need to be forced clean using something like beautifulsoup or elementtree

876048
put	get
note although when writing the question i didn t get any references to this question the current side-bar points it out so i ll put it here for reference either way the question is different but might be useful

876094
move	drag
however if user brings up right click menu by clicking on an area of the listview where there is no listitem showing below the last listitem then click the menu item the non-modal form shows up but the cursor seems to be stuck in a left button mouse down state in the listview the non-modal form is at the front but when i move the mouse it makes those drag area rectangles in the background listview as if the mouse button is being held down

876161
hash	md5
another method that would also shorten the string would be to calculate the md5 sha1 hash of the string concatenated with a seed if you wished

876166
implements	extends
if your object extends nsobject all you need to do i believe is to implements these example for person object

876166
implements	extends	nscoder	nsobject
they will serialize all the objects that they hold if objects implements nscoder interface - they do if they extends nsobject

876173
actionscript	haxe
i think you re referring to haxe which is an open source programming language very similar to actionscript

876214
svm	k-means
in map-reduce for machine learning on multicore chu et al describe algorithms that fit the statistical query model can be written in a certain â œsummation form â which allows them to be easily parallelized on multicore computers. they specifically implement 10 algorithms including weighted linear regression k-means naive bayes and svm using a map-reduce framework

876215
draggable	droppable
from what i ve seen about jquery apparently there is a way to make an element on my webpage draggable droppable or what have you

876218
appkit	nsapplication
appkit 0x95229630 nsapplication nexteventmatchingmask untildate inmode dequeue

876218
appkit	nsapplication
appkit 0x9522266b nsapplication run

876223
int	chars
also the sizeof operator tells you the size of an object type in terms of the number of chars s not the number of bytes octets so if you were on some weird system with a 16-bit chars and a 32-bit int then sizeof int would be 2 not 4

876229
preorder	inorder	preorder	postorder	postorder	inorder
provide the following operations insert remove inorder traversal preorder traversal postorder traversal

876239
stdout	stderr
to redirect both stdout and stderr to a truncated file i know to use

876242
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr to where stdout is currently going

876268
firefox	safari
this is the case with both firefox and safari

876286
lisp	scheme
scheme is also known to be able to handle this situation as well as give a tremendous advantage over your competition but scheme runs only on lisp machines

876297
post	get
when you post that this is what you ll get in php

876319
hid	keyboard
i have a small usb unitech barcode scanner which when plugged into the usb port works like a keyboard and the system both linux and win32 see it as a hid

876397
hash	salt
the usual way to store password is to use a hash function on the password but to salt it beforehand

876397
hash	salt
when checking if a given password matches a user you should concatenate the salt to the given password and calculate the hash function of the result string

876545
getter	setter
another solution which does not require static imports would be to create a complete applicationsettings class with fields getter and setter and pass an instance of this class to the constructor of the class that needs the parameters

876552
fadein	fadeout
i changed the fadein and fadeout to fadeto between 0.01 and 1.0

876553
allocator	stl
i understand that its not possible to call this function from c# using pinvoke because there is no way to marshall the stl string but my problem is that i cannot even write a wrapper without allocator a new array becuase the std string returned is not on the heap

876607
inherited	properties
the avm1movie object can use methods and properties inherited from the displayobject class such as x y width and so on

876632
int	double
i am interested in finding out what the best null alternatives are for the following data types in particular double float decimal datetime int long although others are more than welcome

876634
cvs	rcs
cvs is only a wrapper around rcs which runs the rcs commands over many files in a directory subtree rcs can only work on single files

876634
cvs	rcs
since cvs is based on rcs it can t version directories nor can it track renames

876634
cvs	rcs
cvs and rcs use the standard diff 1 command to create the diffs

876639
getter	setter
in objective-c the property and synthesize keywords automatically create the getter and setter methods for you

876674
config	ini
right now i would store the default currency code in an xml config file an ini file or the windows registry

876676
sorting	filtering
the collectionviewsource class can add sorting and filtering to any wpf items control

876680
switching	screens
i m in the process of switching from multiple tabs in iterm to one gnu screens session

876694
pthreads	fork
after all you will learn all you need to know about fork if you use pthreads anyway

876695
ubuntu	linux
how to set up a subversion svn server on gnu linux - ubuntu

876741
innodb	myisam
comparing myisam innodb and falcon on

876748
post	get
but you could post a new request to the server and add post or get peremeters

876751
innodb	myisam
switch to myisam database instead of innodb and use full-text search on this column

876774
pascal	delphi
delphi users might want to look at free pascal s paralel implementation of libchm since a pascal solution makes it easier embeddable

876809
post	get
the most common way to do this is to use php and jquery s post get ajax features to call on a page that has the php code used to insert into the database

876851
min	max
max - min + 1

876877
post	get
can you post the code your running to get that output

876895
rss	feed
iirc trac let lets you get rss feed for each person so you can have a feed of things assigned to you

876945
filtering	grouping
select settings under filtering keys grouping in here you can switch off repeating keys for that user on that machine

877027
chown	chgrp
in that case you ll have to handle it with more chown and chgrp function calls

listview	gridview
i want to have a combobox in the header cells of my gridview currently inside of a listview populated with the data from that column

877087
cvs	svn
vim 7 plugin useful for manipulating files controlled by cvs svn svk and git within vim including committing changes and performing diffs using the vimdiff system

877106
implements	extends	super	extends	super	implements
either write a class that implements runnable and pass whatever you need in a suitably defined constructor or write a class that extends thread with a suitably defined constructor that calls super with appropriate parameters

877115
implements	extends
you have a class that extends thread or implements runnable and a constructor with the parameters you d like to pass

877189
put	get
you could probably put a thread.sleep 15000 at the start of your main to get 15 seconds in which to connect to the application and start the profiling

877208
serializable	deserialization
if you have an object tree where there are no backwards links serializable and deserialization is simple

877208
serializable	deserialization
with a general graph the deserialization process needs to keep track of the identity of each object and use some form of mark-and-sweep algorithm to ensure that objects aren t de serializable twice

877224
rss	feed
if you wish you can subscribe to teamdev s rss feed

877254
jquery	nyromodal
im using the nyromodal plugin for jquery within an asp.net 3.5 webforms app

877292
ssl	https
note https support is only available if the socket module was compiled with ssl support

877299
i2c	spi
regarding spi i2c etc i haven t implemented any of them

877327
pascal	delphi
you can mix delphi pascal code with c++ code in the same project

877328
hide	show
i have tried to use the hide and show with no luck either

877330
int	chars
a lot of system types can be defined this way int chars string datetime etc

877334
jms	jta
generally speaking application server gives the administrator great tools to manage java ee resources data sources jms connection factories jms destinations jta transaction manager etc

877376
width	height
i m trying to limit the minimum height and width of a chrome xul window

877391
content-disposition	content-type
you could send a head request to that resource and check what content-type and content-disposition values are being sent back

877401
int	chars
the second parameter declared an int is cast to an unsigned chars

877515
ssl	https
ist of all the one thing i would like to point out here security.mode transport is used in case if your targeted service is hosted on https ssl which is not the case with your specified url

877541
width	height
with this optimal size i then check to see how many whole tiles i can fit into the width height

877614
width	height
in particular getscreendevices returns an array of graphicsdevice objects from which you can read the width height of the display mode

877628
hash	salt
do not store the passwords at all - just salt hash of them

877648
width	height
if your items are a consistent height but inconsistent width you can use a double div solution

877651
hide	show
they have their place but more often i choose a suitable maximum number of allowed controls put them all on the page initially and only enable disable hide show them as needed

877652
istream	getline
now i want to copy the contents of the streambuf into a string but it apparently only supports writing to char sgetn creating an istream with the streambuf and using getline

877655
int	double
you must implement a single method returning a type compatible with all of the implemented overridden methods in this case number int double etc

877692
int	double
the commented out case of methodb being implemented as returning a double however would not work while it would satisfy the contract of interfacea it would conflict with interfaceb which demands an int

877716
put	get
get and put in my applications

877726
pascal	delphi
owl mfc activex vb3 4 5 6 vb.net pascal delphi c c++ c#

877727
post	get
or this problem only happens for get and not for post

877735
int	double
double are there then int double int will get value 0

877757
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox	keydown	keyup
the only things you can really rely on are keydown events and even then not so much in opera and firefox -- safari and ie both provide keydown events during ime composition with a charcode of 229 and a keyup event with a charcode corresponding to the actual key that was pressed

877757
google-chrome	safari
there is a textinput event but that is only supported by safari and by proxy google-chrome should support it as well but it s not substantially better than standard events anyway -

877784
min	max
apply max flow and or min cut will give you a set of transfers

877808
content-disposition	content-type
if the problem is the batch file is being displayed in the browser you need to set content-type and content-disposition in the http header so the user is prompted to save or run the file rather than have the browser display it

877813
width	height
you probably want to use block elements for menus because the box sizing makes it simpler to even the height and optionally the width of the menu elements - inline elements can leave you with variable height and widths - simplifying the situation greatly

877823
imperative	declarative
i suspect you re trying to do imperative things in declarative land which means you think in terms of steps

877825
lisp	scheme
i don t know what your specific problems with xaml are and i haven t used it myself but i ve found that when using xml based technologies like xslt a little lisp or scheme experience can go a long way

877826
rss	feed
i am busy writing a simple adobe air app using html jquery and some jquery plugin to load rss feed

877828
touchesbegan	touchesended
what s even stranger is if i take the touchesbegan and touchesended out of stone.m but leave userinteractionenabled yes the beachview registers both touches itself but returns the stone as the view it touched the second time

877844
sqldatasource	linqdatasource
next to #region blocks i would say the asp.net idatasource implementations sqldatasource linqdatasource that force allow you to write data-access code directly into your aspx pages

877931
mouse	keyboard
glovepie - advanced input scripting mouse keyboard game controllers

877949
maven	pom.xml
i don t understand why datanucleus required maven to download datanucleus-core-1.1.3.jar since this is not referenced in the pom.xml

877964
addition	multiplication
although you might get away with a numeric support class which would provide addition and multiplication of the various boxed number types the amount of complexity you save will be very little compared with providing two or three primitive matrices and a couple of big-number ones particularly if you use a templating system eg ant s replace task or xslt to generate the source code

877969
post	get
without knowing all of the details and assuming you implemented the restful services properly your urlrequest might be calling the service with the wrong method post rather than get

877970
addition	multiplication
zero can be defined as the identity in addition or a zero in multiplication but without a generic definition of addition or multiplication a generic definition of zero is unlikely

878125
gridview	onclientclick
so i wanted to attempt to set the gridview s button s onclientclick event to be the onclientclickevent of that hidden button

878238
profiler	aqtime
however maybe you can try to find your leaks with a profiler like aqtime instead

878257
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
javascript has getelementsbytagname and getelementbyid not to mention jquery

878264
try-catch	exception-handling
saying this if you have utilised exception-handling handling properly in a fine-grained and task-specific manner in the rest of your program and handled the errors accordingly there rather than juist displaying a generic error box then a general try-catch for all exception-handling in the main method is probably a useful thing to have

878264
try-catch	exception-handling
one point to note here is that if you re reproducably getting bugs caught in this main try-catch then you either have a bug or something is wrong with your localised exception-handling handling

878359
addition	multiplication
there is no real good guarantee that the i values of the two threads are the same at the same time after all multiplication and addition probably will take different amount of times to execute and that means that one thread may need to wait for another for the i values to get in sync before comparing the a and b that corresponds to the dependent value i

878409
post	get
however i can t figure out how to actually get the utility - the attachment on that post seems to not actually be there

878479
switching	screens
i guess it prevents code that would exit the full screens if there s a switching to another window from working ever

878486
dictionary	map
the tree map design pattern python folks would call it an ordered dictionary is one variation of this design pattern

878486
dictionary	map
the hash map design pattern python folks would call it a dictionary is another variation of this design pattern

878506
swt	swing
we implemented this functionality by embedding a batik swing canvas into an swt composite see here

878600
jobs	cron
does crontab have an argument for creating cron jobs without using the editor crontab -e

878645
rss	feed
an rss feed of the last 15 errors from the log

878649
folder	directory
from a directory that only had folder in it

878685
folder	directory
from a directory where there are no files only folder and in fact the folder needed are imported right after

878779
post	get
we have forums on our website and daily we get 1000 s of attempts to post spam

878849
folder	directory
if you are worried about having too much to process you could try a sparse checkout with only the folder you need and then you could just commit the base directory or the subdirectories as needed without the overhead of the other projects

878981
post	get
also there are two common ways to send the data through post in the http header and through get as part of the query string the part after the question mark in a url

878981
post	get
example google search queries are sent using get but to log in to your gmail account post is used

878995
accessor	properties
obj-c 2.0 lets me declare properties in a category but the compiler refuses to synthesize accessor inside the category

879006
unsigned	short
unsigned short x

879034
set	bag
in this case you d mark the nodes and edges as being unordered which relates to a bag or set and unique which narrows it down to being a set

879049
glut	sdl
glut or sdl smfl etc does that work for you in a nice platform independent way

879109
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am using jquery 1.3.2 and the code that follows works wonderfully on firefox safari and google-chrome

879117
mouse	keyboard
glut is fast insufficient and terribly poor library and about only it does is that it initializes the opengl context and provides some primitive mouse keyboard input modules to get you ongoing

879186
disk	ram
fundamentally i difference between a mmdb and a oodb is that the mmdb has the expectation that all of its data is based in ram but persisted to disk at some point

879186
disk	ram
in this way an oodb can be slower even if the entire db fits in to ram and is properly cached simply because you incur disk operations outside of the log operations during normal operations vs a mmdb where these operations happen as a maintenance task which can be scheduled during down time and or quiet time

879200
folder	directory
you can copy the files into an appropriately named subdirectory directory of the data folder as long as it is the exact same version of mysql and you have retained all of the associated files in that directory

879201
colt	jama
colt does this already but i have found it is more complicated and more powerful than jama which may explain why simple functions are slower with colt

879201
colt	jama
jama doesn t support a fraction of the things colt can do which make make more of a difference

879235
ethernet	wireless
jitter will begin to shoot through the roof as some packets have to be queued or retransmitted collisions on half-duplex ethernet or wireless

879266
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
asp.net asp.net-mvc can generate html elements using html helpers for example html.actionlink html.beginform and so on

879285
freebsd	linux
this library works transparently with big- and little-endian elf files and runs just fine under linux despite its freebsd origins the usual . configure and make sequence is all you ll need to build it

879285
x86	mips
for grins i tried the reading a program header table example with minor modifications to get it to build on an x86 core file as well as a mips big-endian core file it appears to just work

879288
folder	dir
set svn ignore property on the root dir to ignore unneeded folder and never commit the root dir

879290
int	boolean
where b is a boolean and a is an int

879306
hash	md5
the hash algorithm like md5 takes a table of bytes of arbitrary length and converts it to a table of bytes of known length - the operation is not easily reversible and small changes to the input table cause unpredictable changes in the output table

879306
hash	salt
by introducing small changes in the input the results are change drastically so even if attacker knows the hash result and the salt it is very difficult to guess the input

879306
salt	md5
input + salt md5 output

879306
hash	salt
salting is not necessary here because you would have to publish the salt with the resulting hash so that the user can repeat the hashing operation

879380
linfu	spring.net
aye in the ioc world most tools spring.net castle windsor even linfu have methods that can take care of that for you so you define it one in a config and every time you get a copy from the container or whatever it comes preconfigured

879388
int	boolean
valid type arguments are any array boolean date numeric query string struct uuid guid binary int float eurodate time creditcard email ssn telephone zipcode url regex range component or variablename

879446
division	modulo
each time through the loop the modulo takes the last digit by returning the remainder from division by 10

879471
int	double
since you want it to take an int and return a double

879476
int	double
in this case you d have to make the functor the operator to return double and take an int as a parameter

879542
sorting	filtering
this is not a good idea for a number of reasons but for now let s just say that we should let databases perform a job they are really good at and that is filtering and sorting data

879558
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
the datavaluefield is common across checkboxlist radiobuttonlist listcontrol etc

879653
inherited	properties
there s no reason to duplicate methods and properties in an interface if you can inherited in this fashion

879672
post	put
also for the post you could append the id to the url and put the other params in json

879675
hide	show
depending on which row is clicked i want to show hide an accordion panel

879730
spweb	splist	sharepoint	splist
this usally occurs if i ask sharepoint to open an spweb or a splist that does not exist

879774
serializable	deserialization
edit found an excellent article on serializable and deserialization using datacontractserializer here

879802
folder	directory
for example if you create a group in in the project at the root of the project named foo this creates a reference to a container foo that is managed by the project settings it does not create a folder named foo in the root directory where your applications exists in the file system

879805
put	get
you put some very clear and simple to read code on a java - server and you get a full ajax javascript form

879834
cvs	svn	perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
all source control systems i know at least perforce svn cvs have a server component and a protocol of their own

879842
hide	show
if the value entered into the text field is not available in the select list show the add button and hide the remove button

879842
hide	show
if the value entered into the text field is available in the select list hide the add button and show the remove button

879842
hide	show
if the select list is empty show the add button and hide the remove button

879859
ant	maven
i would like to try using maven from ant for exaple to build my java se apps that needs all dependencies stored in or just because doing anything short of dependency management in maven is too damn hard

879869
cruisecontrol	luntbuild
we use luntbuild and are quite happy other alternatives exist as well cruisecontrol hudson quickbuild

879874
ant	maven
you might find the maven ant tasks useful

879931
terminate	timeout
if the read fails due to timeout you can then safely terminate the proxy without risking the health of your application

879943
post	get
that generates a get request instead of the post request generated by the jquery .post method -- but the action method parameters should be populated nonetheless

879950
opera	firefox
you can try various browsers in some order -- firefox opera etc etc

879973
public	protected
wire the timer s elapsed event to a public or protected internal tick event

879974
squeak	visualworks
it also depends of smalltalk dialect - in visualworks for instance tools supports overrides quite well while in squeak not so

879976
stdout	stderr
file descriptor 0 is stdin 1 is stdout and 2 is stderr

879989
firefox	safari
these images are not displayed in ie6 but are displayed in firefox safari etc.

880036
min	max
this page contains the following also validates against developer-provided constraints like min max valid days of the week etc.

880050
accessor	properties	subclass	accessor
how about creating your own subclass of propertyplaceholderconfigurer that would keep a reference to the its properties object and provide an accessor

880062
width	height
i m trying to write a regex expression to match the src width and height attributes on an image tag

880062
width	height
the width and height are optional

880066
post	get
as an alternative consider refactoring the rendering part into a separate auxiliary method def _render self and just ending both the get and post methods with a call to self.render

880081
put	get
i ve tried adding a runat server attribuite to each asp linkbutton tag but i get a runtime exception that controls can only be put inside a form tag with the runat server attribute

880084
folder	directory
i m guessing you ll need to create some symbolic links aliases in your root directory to the public folder of each application

880115
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
with asp.net asp.net-mvc you should use html.actionlink ... helper methods and the like

880116
tolower	toupper
noted that the entity framework recognizes toupper tolower and contains and some more - so i was to strict when i said that the entity framework does not recognize method calls

880116
tolower	toupper
further this query translates into charindex function calls using the collation of the column hence the search can be case insensitive without explicit toupper or tolower calls

880141
hash	md5
my current thought is to use a string with something like an md5 hash of the type name and member types and names

880173
profiling	benchmarking
i m with chas benchmarking and profiling your code first

880181
folder	directory
turns out you just plant the editors directory tree into your primary working folder or wherever and edit the include functions php to link the editor files to your own project files

880190
packets	pcap
pcap_sendqueue_queue - to add raw packets to the queue in pcap format

880217
children	parent
given the above tables i need to identify the parent whose children have the same records in column2 as parent s1 does

880304
hash	salt
when the user creates their password you want to create a hash of that password with some salt and store the hash

880310
postgresql	mysql
move to a real database such as postgresql or mysql

880319
sin	sqrt
if you successfully read a string pass that to a function name parser that uses string compares to generate a token that represents a call to sqrt or sin or whatever function you like

880359
profiling	benchmarking
if it is profiling your code and benchmarking your changes

880381
tabcontrol	tabitem
now i d like to specify that a given tabcontrol should add new items using closeabletabitem instead of tabitem

880391
put	get	post	put	post	get
i have the redirect working but the problem is that if i do a post put delete firebug shows my requests going to the test rig properly but i get a 301 redirect response and then a 2nd get response

880442
children	parent
nb based on matt s comment if one of your parent values was known you just wanted to list all the parent values with the same children as s1 then you can just slap and p1.column1 s1 on the end of this

880463
int	boolean
i m using a database with generic data strings int boolean etc...

880473
cos	sin	cos	sqrt	sin	sqrt
i thought a map of strings to function pointers might be a concise way to represent things like sqrt sin cos etc that take a single double and return a double

880517
stdout	fflush
fflush stdout

880527
pascal	delphi
if you must use native code then i would strongly suggest rad studio from codegear embarcadero it s a studio product that ships with delphi the object oriented language that evolved from turbo pascal and c++ builder if you are already familiar with c c++ then it s going to be very simple for you to pick it up

880562
cvs	svn
if you re looking for free alternatives or if you code in other languages other than php openkomodo is a really nice ide with almost all the features no svn neither cvs that you require the only con i see about openkomodo is that sometimes it messes my code indentation but then again i don t use it on a very regular basis

880570
udp	tcp
i used tcp in one project udp in the other one

880612
gtk	cairo
_why has written shoes mostly on top of cairo which is what recent versions of gtk use for widget drawing also so it appears he purposely stepped back to the core of ui design and created a different framework from the ground up for a solidly different reason than one would use gtk for

880635
mouse	trackpad
on my trackpad your code works perfectly fine but i guess thats because it s awfully hard to move the mouse between clicks

880673
post	get
i am making a new wordpress template and i want to just get in text format the list of tags associated with a post

880680
imap	nntp
since you noted that the isp requires authentication via pop-before-smtp you should look into using something like php mailer which can facilitate this kind of interaction - or roll your own using the php functions for pop which happen to be exactly the same as the ones for imap and nntp

880698
lxml	beautifulsoup
beautifulsoup is good but not super-fast and i believe lxml can offer the same quality but often better performance

880734
ilist	iqueryable
one last thing following is the code i used in aspx to retrieve the data in case of making the result tolist i change iqueryable to ilist

880758
lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml	elementtree	elementtree	beautifulsoup
if you want a faster option then use try catch to attempt an lxml or elementtree parse first then try beautifulsoup and or tidylib to parse broken html if the parser fails

880821
lxml	beautifulsoup
i ve found that even if lxml is faster than beautifulsoup for documents that size it s usually best to try to reduce the size to a few kb via regex or direct stripping and load that into bs as you are doing now

880825
post	get
i am using this code to get the tags in my wordpress post for a theme

880833
uiswitch	uibutton
uibutton doesn t do that and uiswitch is hideously ugly for all but the most utilitarian views

880955
firefox	safari
tested and working in ie8 firefox and safari win

880966
sorting	filtering
alternatively find a plug-in that has sorting accomplished but also generates simple markup so you can extend it with your own filtering

881011
factories	presenter
other frameworks that would do this include the patterns and practices web client software factories which offers a model view presenter approach

881045
mockups	balsamiq
in sketching or mockups tools such as balsamiq and wireframesketcher comic sans is used to give that sketchy hand drawn look

881112
pull	push
pull all commits from a branch push specified commits to another where

881128
post	get
i m not sure why you would get such an error when you attempt to call a method via reflection but a little googling came up with this forum post among others

881143
interpolation	splines
i have a nice cubic splines code but it is for interpolation only

881144
button	checkbox
i have a html form that contains text fields checkbox radiobuttons and a submit button

881145
min	max
lets you set min max

881157
disk	ram
for example data on disk can be corrupted due to ram losing power before the dma controller or hard disk

881161
submit	submission
while submission the form check if atleast one or more values have changed and then submit the form

881185
cvs	svn
i ve not tried this myself but friends have reported good success converting first from cvs to svn and then from svn to git

881187
button	checkbox
as pointed out in the comments this would allow the user to deselect all checkbox even if they chose one initially which isn t exactly like radio button

881188
button	checkbox
it has been designed this way and from a user perspective radio button mean select one and checkbox mean select many

881188
button	checkbox
user interfaces work because the metaphors used checkbox button the shape of the mouse pointer colors etc. are and behave a certain way

881211
interpolation	splines
generally for splines interpolation you use a variable t to interpolation over the line

881218
pull	push
subversion and git are both free and have a variety of different ways that you can connect and push pull checkin checkout data

881249
interpolation	splines
splines are usually used for interpolation of some unknown or complex function by using of some fixed data set

881249
interpolation	splines
if you want to have ability to evaluate your splines outside of interpolation range but leave it as piecewise-cubic function with the same values inside of interpolation range then you should extend splines range by some nodes and add some logic of evaluation values at the new nodes for example you want to have your splines be not only a continuous function but also have some number of first derivatives be also continuous functions

881271
opensplice	opendds
for example opensplice and opendds are both implementations of the omg data distribution service standard

881275
put	get
i ll pass this onto the team and see if we can get some more examples put online around this space

881292
datagridview	tablelayoutpanel
rather than use a datagridview how about using a tablelayoutpanel instead

881294
inherited	properties
all my controllers in my project inherited from a base controller which has a properties with my entity model

881329
mvp	presenter
yes shellpresenter is a presenter in the mvp pattern

881415
daemons	systemd
according to advanced programming in the unix environment by stephens and rago the second fork is more a recommendation and it is done to guarantee that the daemons does not acquire a controlling terminal on systemd v-based systemd

881435
children	parent
the result is that the parent process doesn t need to be aware of the forked children and it also makes it possible to fork long running processes from libs etc

881452
put	get
i then put these extracted folders in to another folder and zip it back and rechange the extension to the previous xlsm format i now try and open but i get an unreadable error

881456
post	get
assuming you have some magic way to get from a to an i d be interested in reading that blog post if you can cite it - then the closest you can do is probably something like

881483
folder	directory
if for some reason your breakpoints are not hit then go and delete your bin obj directory and also your mobile deployment folder some times vs gets stucked.

881554
getter	setter
you can then generate accessor getter setter methods by using synthesize

881554
getter	setter
important if you do not specify either synthesize or dynamic for a particular property you must provide a getter and setter or just a getter in the case of a readonly property method implementation for that property.

881636
equals	gethashcode
there s no simple way for a single lambda to express the information needed for both equals and gethashcode

881636
equals	gethashcode
and if you provide a gethashcode that returns different hashes for equals elements that will cause incorrect behavior

881661
outputstream	inputstream
where output is some outputstream where the encrypted data will be saved and input is some inputstream where the plaintext data will be read

881682
installation	upgrade
you should put all of your own plugins into vimfiles to make sure that when you upgrade your vim installation you don t lose any of the custom plugins or modifications

881682
versioning	upgrade
if you were to instead change vim72 syntax cpp.vim when you next upgrade vim these files would be overwritten by the new versioning and any changes that you made would be lost

i couldn t figure out what use some of the functions in the convert class had such as convert.todouble int convert.toint double until i combined them with array.convertall

882156
icomparable	compareto
i thought that it was only necessary to implement compareto when implementing icomparable msdn itself confirms this

882156
icomparable	compareto
the class is not implementing icomparable but and does impliment compareto as strongly typed

882167
dictionary	map
i m trying to map a dictionary containing lists

maximum value for an object of type unsigned short int

882234
post	get
you still have some work to do to understand it but if you post your own attempts you ll get a lot more help

882266
getter	setter
i don t think you can tell jpa which naming convention to use for getter and setter since it s a basic java beans concept

882318
ilist	iqueryable	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	iqueryable
if you return collections or instance and if you choose ienumerable iqueryable ilist list or whatever depends on your needs

if you want a no fuss way for the end user to kick off a program with multiple jar dependencies you may want to look at launch4j or jsmooth i prefer launch4j

882675
button	checkbox
clicking on checkbox or button doesn t do anything

882706
borderless	panel
the window is borderless and set to the exact size of the panel for all intents and purposes it is as if the panel is free floating

children	parent
with a rdbms you just have a table of terms which have parent and children ids

882785
stdout	stderr
after calling start you ll get a process object from which you can get the stderr and stdout streams

882785
stdout	stderr
especially the ability to redirect stderr to stdout which means you only have to suck down one stream

882788

882824
boost	stl
try stl boost and loki for a start

882850
folder	directory
is there a way to use the application s folder as the current directory

882916
action-filter	onactionexecuting
problem the action-filter onactionexecuting method is called after the one in basecontroller and not before

882926
integer	unsigned
i ve written this piece of code where i ve assigned an unsigned integer to two different structs

882930
rss	feed
subscribe to their rss feed and see what those colouring-in people get up to

882949
hide	show
you can use a javascript library to show hide that html based on if a user as silverlight installed

882954
integer	radix
my initial approach i converted each integer to its string format then added zeros to its right to make all the integers contain the same number of digits this was the messy step as it involved tracking etc making the solution very inefficient and then did radix sort

882978
graphics2d	bufferedimage
you can create a bufferedimage call creategraphics in case a graphics2d is expected and pass the result to the paint graphics method of the component that you want to capture

883000
int	chars
so in the first case the struct with the packed attribute there is an extra byte between the chars 3 and the int to align the int on a four byte boundary

883082
implements	extends
one convenient possibility is for a custom renderer to extends jcomponent and implements tablecellrenderer then in tablecellrenderer.gettablecellrenderercomponent you store the cell s state and return this

883177
imagemagick	libtiff
ghostscript and imagemagick convert should also be able to do this for you although libtiff is supposedly quicker

883289
serializable	deserialization
in need to serializable an object and it s possible that the assembly version changed while deserialization

883293
lotus	sametime
a lotus notes installation domino 7x which ends up trying to start a ibm sametime 7.5.1 chat client fails on some machines

it puts the command or for the sessionattributes any object in the session for the duration between the first and the last request most of the time the initial get and the final post

883367
int	double
however it is possible to perform typecasts so it is possible to cast a int type which are int values to a double type a floating type value

883376
cruisecontrol	teamcity
i don t know cruisecontrol since we re using teamcity but cruisecontrol should be able to perform a command line build just call make

883376
cruisecontrol	teamcity
oh and if cruisecontrol does not support a command line runner or project types other than java you should have a look at teamcity as a replacement

883411
hash	md5
then you hash that say with md5 though you might want to use sha256 to be more secure to get 593d5518d759b4860188158ef4c71f28

883411
hash	salt
when the user logs in append the random salt and then check if his entered password with the salt matches the hash in the database

883428
hash	salt
a salt is just a method that adds random bits onto a hash in order to complicate the process of cracking

883432
hash	salt
store the hash and the salt both as hex string base64 string or whatever you like in the database together with the user name and the other user information in the example the salt is just a plain string and the hash is base64 encoded

883432
hash	salt
firstname lastname salt hash

883432
hash	salt
if you want to verify the user password just take the user name look up the salt do the above again and see if the calculated hash and the one in the database match

883433
inherited	subclassing
for finer-grained testing of exceptions you need to roll your own with a try except else block you can do it once and for all in a def assertdetailedraises method you add to your own generic subclassing of unittest s test-case then have your test cases all inherited your subclassing instead of unittest s

883434
filtering	grouping
this should also address if a user applies a filtering on the report you may or may not have given them this option. on a field other than the grouping

883483
hash	md5
however there s one more problem and that s that generating md5 hash is fast

883483
hash	md5
so the next step is to find a slow hash function and use this instead of a fast one like md5

883490
hash	salt
a on account creation you get a username and password from the user you hash those together with your own salt and store the resultant string in your database like

883504
accessor	properties
doing magic in a properties accessor seems like my prerogative as a class designer

883510
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i ve built nib in interface builder that has uitabbarcontroller at top level and switches between uinavigationcontroller s

883519
hash	salt
secondly you should be salting every hash preferably with a different salt value

883519
hash	salt
i tend to hash the password hash the salt combine the two then hash again

883525
accessor	properties
a db read in a properties accessor would be fine - thats actually the whole point of lazy-loading

883530
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
accessors and mutators getter and setter are expected to be very light weight

883537
accessor	properties
it is just a good practice not to make properties accessor taking long time to execute

883539
width	height
the camera can see only a small portion of the world at a time about 5 width 100 height - the world is about 30 high by 1000 wide

883544
for-loop	arrays
even though arr is an empty arrays the for-loop assigns a valid value to i

883568
hide	show
i had issues with jquery and showing and hiding sliding table rows in the past in the end i had to get jquery to wrap the selected td in a div and then show hide that not nice i know but on a tight deadline it worked

883572
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
in applicationdidfinishlaunching i initialize uiviewcontroller using xib s but then manually create uinavigationcontroller add navigation controller s view to window and push first view to navigation controller

883602
width	height
i do a lot of slicing in photoshop and it s tedious to manually write an tag for each of them -- writing in the filename checking height and width writing the alt tags etc

883616
width	height
first i want to commend you on having width and height information in an image

883643
uitabbaritem	uitabbarcontroller
first it looks like you have your uitabbaritem s under the navigation controllers instead of directly under the uitabbarcontroller

883686
vim	emacs
cross platform you d be looking at something like emacs or vim neither of which are particularly friendly

883687
int	boolean
there are a specific set of types i am looking for int boolean date string

883688
children	parent
my database has 7 tables one is the parent feeds and the other 3 are the children public feeds private feeds generated feeds of an isa relationship

883710
textmate	bbedit
on the mac side i have always been a fan of both bbedit and textmate but much more so of the latter especially given its lesser price tag and more modern feel

883710
textmate	notepad++
on windows i d stick with either e which is basically a port of textmate to windows or notepad++

883710
notepad++	scite
you could also look at scite but like notepad++ it has no project org features

883784
unistd.h	string.h
the inclusion of stdio.h string.h and unistd.h is omitted the colorization hides the header inclusion code

883808
hide	show
when you click on a new page link hide all div s except the one you need to show

883814
getter	setter
setter methods like that are sometimes explained in more detail in the getter method the introduction text in class documentation or one of the documentation companion guides you see linked on the bottom left

883833
dictionary	map
i am a c# developer and i don t fully unterstand your code but i would use a dictionary to map between the type of an object and something else - i assume you return a enum value

883852
mouse	keyboard
basically you are redirecting keyboard mouse input via the flex app and using it to display realtime 3d activity using a standard movie component

883855
hide	show
if trigger 1 hide or show target 1 or scrolls down to it this method would have the added benefit of still doing something if javascript was disabled

883866
bazaar	git
subversion makes that case challenging but other revision control systems such as git mercurial and bazaar make that case easy

883886
equals	compareto
you see compareto method sometimes returns 0 which should be consistent with using equals

883889
rss	feed
hello i am using libxml to parse an rss feed and i am wondering if is possible to access the content within using dot syntax or just as easy

883932
children	parent
you could use a view to pre-join the children to the parent and to get a consistent result regardless of which child type

883947
ant	cruisecontrol
our c++ projects use scons instead of make and we simply call scons from the cruisecontrol ant script via the exec ant task

883971
imperative	declarative
data-binding for all its wonders is declarative and harder to debug than nice imperative stuff where you just set breakpoints

883989
opera	firefox
of course a good text editor revision control and firebug in firefox or dragonfly in opera are also essential

884010
post	get
if you ve used the same type of solution on an earlier problem you can go through the post from other users on the earlier question to get ideas for solving the problem in different ways

884013
lisp	scheme
going further afield tcl tool command language lets you embed an interpreter in c c++ code there are many embeddable lisp and scheme interpreters etc

884019
post	get
for example to get a list of all text nodes that are children of a post node

884037
subtract	add
note that if the start day is a weekday add days to move to the previous monday and if it is on a weekend subtract days to move to the next monday since you already missed this weekend.

884078
accessor	properties
second one thing you should know is that the default model binder requires that any properties you wish to set be available via public accessor

884106
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
personally i would ignore the runtimeexception because an unchecked-exception signifies a bug in the program

884112
range	max	range	min	min	max
a slider that is with two knobs that define a range in the min max values rather than just one

884182
filewriter	bufferedwriter
the finally tries to close from the outside of any decorated stream first so if you had a bufferedwriter wrapping a filewriter we try to close the buffereredwriter first and if that fails still try to close the filewriter itself

884203
mouse	keyboard
it does not really make sense to stop execution of a window as the window only handles events that are sent to it like for example mouse keyboard or paint events and ignoring them would make the program appear hung

884225
post	get
sanitising post get variables from

884244
ioexception	bufferedwriter
whilst bufferedoutputstream closes even on an ioexception from flush bufferedwriter closes correctly

884247
pull	push
i need to host a mercurial repository on a server so that a number of people can access it to both pull changes and push their own work

884250
text-align	font-size	width	text-align	width	font-size
.sifr-root text-transform uppercase color #ffffff text-align right width 484px font-size 20px font-weight bold

884298
factors	mean
note that is not going to be the deciding factors in how your app performs but that doesn t mean you shouldn t save a little ram now and then where you know you can

884341
implements	extends
in this particular case you should follow wilums2 s advice and extends mouseadapter instead of implements mouselistener

884346
downcasting	upcasting
surely if you ve got an then you re downcasting rather than upcasting

884367
hash	salt
also be aware that sometimes the answer text is salt with a value before it is hash so the same steps would need to be taken when validating

884381
hash	md5
as you mentioned since the answer is hash you will need to md5 hash the user supplied values

884383
nullpointerexception	indexoutofboundsexception
documented as throwing nullpointerexception and indexoutofboundsexception

884407
width	height
expanded event model when alpha visible width height scalex scaley x or y are changed an event is dispatched there is also the preinitialize initialize

884412
portrait	landscape
example the youtube app automatically goes to landscape to show a video and back to portrait to show the table view

884467
accessor	properties
they will avoid exposing public fields instead of exposing them through accessor or properties

884487
int	boolean	int	double
i dislike the fact that there is a differentiation between primitive native types int boolean double and their corresponding class-wrappers int boolean double in java

884562
exponent	modulo
you need to know the public exponent e often 65337 for rsa keys but other numbers such as 3 or 17 have been used and the modulo n which is the 512-bit number provided in the question

884599
min	max
if you don t know the order of the min max values

884600
firefox	safari
it works fine in safari but nothing appears in firefox

884624
pop-up	dialog
the solution was to open up the iis snap-in right-click and choose properties for the offending virtual directories and make up an application name under the virtual directory tab of the properties dialog that pop-up

884659
rational-numbers	base
in the special case where m are both powers of a common base or equivalently if log m p is a rational-numbers then m i will only have a few non-zero digits in base p near the front so we can safely output most of the digits we ve computed so far

884697
int	double
the problem here is that if both operands of an arithmetic operator are int then the operation is performed using int arithmetic even if it s part of a bigger expression which is of type double

884697
subtraction	addition	division	addition	division	subtraction
the addition and subtraction is okay because the types of a and b force them to be performed using floating point arithmetic - but because division binds more tightly than addition and subtraction it s like using the brackets above only the immediate operands are considered

884741
textinput	textfield
essentially what i m attempting to do here is re-implement tabbing by checking for the tab key on key_down event of each textfield and using that to move focus to the next textinput wrapping to the first textinput from the last

884845
apache	nginx
i am currently working on my wordpress blog which is hosted on a vps.net vps with nginx as front end to apache to serve static files while apache takes care of the php in fastcgi

884845
apache	nginx
this seems to be working great however i haven t yet managed to have nginx serve wp-supercache files as well which i would like for maximum performance i am not planning to completely replace apache with nginx right now because i ve got a virtualmin license and it does not support nginx

884845
apache	nginx
if apache is stopped in fact i can still get images stylesheets and javascript delivered to the browser by nginx directly

884845
apache	nginx
but if i try to surf the blog with pages cached for sure by wp-supercache with apache stopped all i get from nginx is a 502 bad gateway

884903
mouseup	mousedown
i would suggest changing to either the mousedown or mouseup event

884909
action-filter	onactionexecuting
in addition to what marwan aouida posted and suggested using an action-filter on the base class i don t think you re going to be able to create an action-filter that executes before the onactionexecuting overload on the base class

884951
hash	salt
edit the second wayne thoughtfully mentioned that you should salt your password before you hash

884955
hash	salt
edit always use salt for a locally stored hash

884955
hash	salt
windows continues to fail as far as brute forcing locally hash passwords because they do not salt by default

884969
hash	salt
on the server side you can do whatever you want with it preferrably hash and salt password before storing them in the database

885004
apache	nginx
it seems silly to run nginx through apache

885004
apache	nginx
set up nginx to serve up the php and dynamic pages itself and you ll have a much faster service and won t have the problem where apache dies and leaves your webserver nginx hanging

885007
mp3	wmv
you can use the ifilter interface which was design for windows desktop search there are already implementation of the interface for mp3 wmv jpeg

885123
nant	cruisecontrol
then simply get cruisecontrol to use your nant script

885127
inherited	properties
i would then inherited the propertygrid and override the onpropertyvaluechanged event in order to set the tag properties of the griditem to coincide with the pre-defined tagattribute

885135
postgresql	mysql
the first thing you need to decide is what dbms you will use mysql sql server oracle postgresql one of the object-oriented databases etc

885144
move	drag
i want users to be able to drag and move around the bg and finally they can generate final image

885166
postgresql	mysql
i d like to note that this does not happen on mysql only postgresql

885171
jruby	rubinius
also the jruby developers have indicated that they are willing to implement a rubinius bytecode emulator inside jruby if rubinius bytecode becomes a popular way of deploying ruby apps

885175
udp	tcp
regardless do the following for either your one udp socket or for each tcp client socket

885275
ant	emma
i have a problem with ant and emma a code coverage plugin it makes report but without source code

885285
listview	gridview
i have a listview with a gridview in it

885289
pull	push
i created a silverlight component and a wcf service both are communicating using a pollingduplexhttpbinding to enable push and pull functionality

885291
int	chars
i dont know a better way to check if the chars in the expression is an int without using this crude method or regular expressions

885311
serializable	deserialization
i m not aware of any projects to simplify the object serializable deserialization logic though if that was your question

885320
subtraction	add	subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	division	multiplying	subtraction	multiplying	add	division	subtract	division	subtraction
for add multiplying the order of operands doesn t matter but for subtraction and division you should subtract and divide the first operand by the second

885338
wicket	smartgwt
when i combined google eclipse plugin smartgwt gwt 1.6.4 and wicket the gwt compiler would emit bad javascript

885386
stateless	stateful
you can expect to see the introduction of a flow model that compliments spring mvc s stateless controller model and allows stateful web flows to be defined as pojos

885411
nfa	dfa
build a basic finite automaton dfa nfa nfa-lambda for the language in the alphabet sigma 0 1 2 where the sum of the elements in the string is even and this sum is more than 3

885430
ssl	https
this would mean to install and enable the apache module for ssl encrypted http traffic port 433 https in the adress line of the browser and disable the standard http traffic for this directory on port 80

885523
inherited	subclassing
the different achievements are all subclassing of achievement model and use single table inherited so that they are stored in just one table

885577
filesystems	ntfs
with a modern journaling filesystems ext3 4 ntfs the only problem would be that a file could be in a half-written state

885598
cifs	smb
nfs with the right setup version and tuning is just a tad slower than smb cifs

885641
simpleadapter	listactivity
this listactivity uses a simpleadapter that i fill with items from my service

885708
persistent	transient
core data actually has explicit support for nsmanagedobject attributes that aren t persistent though â they re marked transient

885753
affinity	processors
you might also want to look into processors affinity to reduce cache thrashing

885879
implements	extends
i would argue that extends thread there was unnecessary and therefore implements runnable is preferred

885889
subtract	addition	multiplying	addition	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	modulo	addition	modulo
for example perhaps after every 6 addition operations the 7th addition returns the result multiplied by pi divided by the square root of the log of the modulo 5 of the difference of the total number of subtract and multiplying operations performed since system initialization

885897
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you can add a view to an existing uiviewcontroller s view by using addsubview or by pushing a controller on to the uitabbarcontroller s view

885897
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in the latter case the uitabbarcontroller must be have been a uinavigationcontroller with a rootviewcontroller

885897
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
this assumes you have a uinavigationcontroller as a view in your uitabbarcontroller and it s called navcontroller

885897
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if you just want to add a uiview to the uiviewcontroller s view in the uitabbarcontroller overlay then you can just use addsubview as you ve already figured out no uinavigationcontroller necessary

885905
lisp	scheme
it s common lisp which is quite similar to scheme

885908
for-loop	loops
i set up a script that would run 1 000 000 000 for-loop iterations and the same number of while loops and record the time between

886020
floor	sqrt
but then i get errors when compiling because sqrt expects a floating a and floor expects a realfrac a instead of an integral a

886035
firefox	safari
note colspan is working in ie6 but not working in firefox 3 and safari i have not tested it into ie7

886059

i m working with an rss feed structured like this

886093
fgets	fread
the same problem persists even if i change fread to fgets

886108
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
replace subtraction by addition and division by multiplication

886109
sum	floor
b k floor sum a i m i for i in 0 to p-1 n k mod n

886109

b k floor sum a i m i for i in z to p-1 n k mod n

886109
sum	floor
b k floor sum a i m i for i in z to p-1 + m z - 1 n k mod n

886109
min	max
compute the min and max value for b k

886109
min	max
if the min and max are the same output b k and decrement k

886112
gina	winlogon
if you do want to replace the windows login dialog see winlogon and gina but this says gina dlls are ignored in windows vista and i haven t heard what s what for vista

886151
pop-up	dialog
it is possible to intercept crtl+alt+del though obviously microsoft made it very difficult to do because then you could pop-up a fake lock dialog and record people s passwords

886168
mouse	keyboard
screensavers can do more than just display pretty pictures - i ve seen interactive screensavers before that used the mouse and keyboard to provide a simple game though i can t remember which version of windows i saw this running on.

886207
int	double
using string int double etc is more expected and therefore more maintainable

886210
post	get
googling asp.net routing sitemap should get you there only just joined so so can t post link yet

886273
elementtree	beautifulsoup
this looks like valid xml in that case you don t need beautifulsoup definitely not the regex just load xml using any good xml library edit it and print it out here is a approach using elementtree

886276
postgresql	mysql
to scale on the database side you can go pretty far with read slave in mysql postgresql if you go the rdbms way

886288
background-repeat	background-image
so you should set the image as the background-image of the parent div with background-repeat no-repeat

886328
getter	setter
when you have code in the header file for simple getter setter methods it s more or less just fine because you either want to save some working time because of code maintenance typing same method in header and implementation file or because you actually want the method to be inline due to function call overhead in time critical places

886338
hide	show
instead we have an asp.net listbox that controls the first parameter and when it s selection is changed we are using the reportviewer.serverreport.setparameters function to hide show parameters it takes in an array of reportparameter and the reportparameter constructor takes in a boolean to hide show the parameter

886338
hide	show
1 button hide the parameter and 1 button show the parameter using the setparameters function as mentioned above

886338
hide	show
even with this simple scenario the hide show buttons work fine in the development environment but we still have the same issue in the production environment the show button doesn t work

886345
getter	setter
i m not sure if this is exactly what you re asking but the best way to set the value of attributes or elements using xmlbeans is to use the xmlbeans-generated getter and setter

886351
rar	zip	rar	gzip	deb	dmg
7-zip can uncompress a wide variety of formats including 7z zip gzip bzip2 tar arj cab chm cpio deb dmg hfs iso lzh lzma msi nsis rar rpm udf wim xar and z

886356
submit	submission
the submission of the form is the default behavior for a button of type submit important in a form

886359
stdout	stderr
however in the python 2.6 version you can set this parameter to true if you don t redirect stdin stdout stderr

886379
noscript	meta
you should draw your script or noscript header as a page onto itself that then redirects either through a meta tag or through a script location.href to the next place you want to go based on if javascript is turned on

886401
post	put
anyway it is not a good idea to use http put or http post to upload large files

886472
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
nsapplication nsviewcontroller nswindowcontroller uiapplication and uiviewcontroller all load nib files on your behalf

886490
ssl	https
https and ssl mutual authentication should be used for this because client already has at least corporate ca-signed certificate on its smart card stored

886490
ssl	https
when mutual ssl authentication is used instead just server authentication the client certificate is also verified by server not only the server s certificate by client which is more common set-up for https enabled e-commerce sites

886505
folder	directory
the outer folder is not a repo it s a work directory

886558
for-loop	arrays
since this could be easily checked for in the for-loop i think your problem lies in handling the result arrays

886586
ant	maven
you can do that in your build with ant or maven and in development in eclipse with the ajdt plugin

886647
put	get
the only downside is that the swf will get a lot larger so just put the settings back to mp3 or whatever before you export the final version

886681
hide	show
does anyone know of a way to trap show desktop so i can ensure my application stays visible i assume that windows enumerates all top-level windows and hide them with showwindow sw_hide

886690
google-chrome	firefox
i would like to know about the basic compatibility issues in the major browsers internet explorer google-chrome when compared to mozilla firefox such as

886738
ant	maven
i d second your factory approach and you should have a closer look at maven or ant depending on what you are using

886795
pop-up	dialog
i ve got a series of modalpopupextenders that i m using to implement pop-up dialog on an asp.net 2.0 page

886854
for-loop	loops
i know i can do this alot faster by using one for-loop to loops through the image data and set it right away

886885
folder	directory
now copy all the existing files and directory that you have been working on into the new myproj project folder you just created via checkout not the one in the repository

886906
short	base
the long and short of it all is that i need find the node base on itâ s position away from the current node

886915
int	double
as darin stated you should be always using trygetvalue - it makes the code easier to read to maintain and you won t get a keynotfoundexception and while your at it always use tryparse instead of parse for int double datetime whatever for the same reason

887001
inherited	properties
still you can hide the inherited properties with your s

887080
children	parent
then on document.onload that div s parent node can be easily located and appended new children

887110
ubuntu	linux
forgot to mention restarting tomcat app server has no effect but if i restart linux box ubuntu 8.10 everything works fine

887125
nfa	dfa
well in computer science theoretical field it s very strong and useful equipment since with it you are able to define regular languages and identify with it nfa or even dfa therefore prove some difficult theorem in computation theory or finite automate and formal languages field

887187
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
it works on the latest firefox safari camino and opera mac

887212
onclick	onkeydown
i have access to source code of target application but i would like to not override methods like onclick or onkeydown in every winforms control i m using if it is not necessary

887255
getter	setter
in .net properties are supposed to be first class citizens however in the il code property getter and setter are implemented as get_ propertyname and set_ propertyname

887256
int	chars
the problem is the primitive types int chars double.. don t have a native tostring function

887271
width	height
object id sifr_replacement_0 class sifr-flash height 61 width 1238 type application x-shockwave-flash name sifr_replacement_0 data style library sifr cartonnage-alternate.swf style

887285
implements	extends
fyi a type loaded into a child applicationdomain can be cast to a type that it extends implements in the parent applicationdomain

887297
std	ostream
c++ already has tostring that is called to std ostream

887409
implements	extends
or else if you want to implements a dd library of your own you can take help of their methods or extends them as both the libraries are following object oriented paradigm

887466
debian	linux
i can t answer all of your questions but there s a full port of debian gnu linux on arm

887492
debian	linux
you can install a arm-based debian linux distribution and tinker around with it

887519
inherited	properties
many of the dependency properties will be shared by all these controls and therefore i want to put their common methods into a basedatatype and have each of these usercontrols inherited from this base type

887527
inherited	subclassing
ensure that the subclassing inherited from the base class both in the cs code-behind file and in the first tag of the xaml as shown above

887534
post	get
dummyresult is a simple class that has the same fields as a post or just enough of them to get away with it

887551
google-chrome	firefox
i have the following code that is working on ie but not on firefox google-chrome

887637
google-chrome	firefox
this appears to be an issue with firefox and google-chrome s interpretation of the specifications rather than your code

887637
google-chrome	firefox
the w3c specifications show that table cells should support onkeydown but this doesn t appear to be supported by firefox google-chrome currently you could try reporting this as a firefox bug through their website

887736
.htaccess	httpd.conf
look at the acceptpathinfo directive used in apache directly in httpd.conf or via .htaccess

887742
merb	ruby-on-rails
it s where frameworks like ruby-on-rails merb sinatra and others take place and its -arguably- it s most known mode of operation

887869
metaphone	soundex
unlike soundex or metaphone or nysiis edit distance algorithms make you compare your misspelled composer name to every other composer in the system

887892
union	distinct
using union all means that the server won t perform a distinct which is implicit in union operations

887980
ienumerable	iqueryable
for example check this blog post which shows how the sql generated by ienumerable and iqueryable are different in certain scenarios

887983
udp	mtu
3 you are sending messages that are bigger than the udp max message size 4 each device in your network has a max message size mtu so you might be exceeding a limit there

887983
udp	mtu
in case #4 i m pretty certain if you meet the udp max message size then you should be ok but there very well could be some older hardware or custom device with a small mtu that your data is going through

888007
post	get
then if you re still stuck post code here and get help specific to your problem

888036
ilist	icollection
generally expose only an interface icollection ilist or similar and make it readonly

888054
ant	maven
just configure your job to run whatever ant or maven targets unix shell scripts or windows .bat scripts in the order you wish

888080
profiling	debugging
but if this is the case there is no auditing as it is a shared account and also our dev profiling which you will appreciate are vastly different from a shared one cannot be used to debugging production

888084
cos	sin
in that context taking the sin or cos would tell you something about the ultimate position of the dial but you would lose the information about how many turns were involved

888144
teamcity	ncover
i m trying to apply a fix to allow ncover v1.5.5 to run on windows server 2008 x64 via my teamcity continuous integration server as outlined on this blog

888145
versioning	upgrade
i am trying to convince my web server admins to upgrade our versioning of the .net framework from 2.0 to 3.5

888165
versioning	upgrade
it should not be a major deal for them to upgrade the .net framework versioning because it is not going to affect what you already have there such as 2.0 apps

888195
rss	feed
that is not a hack for rss feed not a hack of an external search engine

888198
public	protected	inherited	properties
lets say i inherited a class that has several public properties and or methods however i do not want them to be public properties methods of my class - in other words i want to make those properties protected properties of my class

888204
hash	md5
i have some code i m revewing which is used to convert some text into an md5 hash

888204
hash	md5
well imagine it s the home page of stackoverflow - for each post generate an md5 hash of the user so we can generate their gravatar url

888212
folder	directory
this is because you do not know if the site will be deployed as root under a folder in root web or in a virtual directory

888288
int	chars
you can enhance the above by extending the fieldtype structure to include information about the type of value stored chars int float etc and then write accessors for each type which checks the required type against the defined type

888289
uitableview	uisearchbar
when the user types into that uisearchbar it will automatically filter the results in the uitableview that is below the search bar

888294
int	double
because the compiler will promote the int argument to a double

888389
deselect	multi-select
you can multi-select with shift and then select deselect the group

888448
width	height
for all positions from 0 0 to width - 5 height - 5

888524
icomparer	iequalitycomparer
the default icomparer and iequalitycomparer for tkinterface simply compares the pointer values as four byte integers so there is on queryinterface done to get back to the aggregate

888524
icomparer	iequalitycomparer
you can avoid this problem yourself by supplying a icomparer or iequalitycomparer when you construct the list

888605
free	malloc
i believed that malloc calls boil down to checking if there is enough free space on the os so malloc would be inexpensive

888624
rss	feed
i also have another rss feed i wrote that lists the next item to occur

888661
hide	show
i found this - - which is helpful but in the example he has a finite number of columns and he just hide or show them according to which ones have values

888688
vbscript	jscript
theres also the windows scripting host that uses vbscript and jscript

888744
webrat	cucumber
i d like to have some cucumber webrat integration tests of my search features that use but the problem is that the data is loaded and then rolled back in a transaction during a typical cucumber test so there is no way for thinking_sphinx to index it

888759
post	get
this way you ll have both get and post data in your search server-side handler

888762
put	get
in each of those cases the same view code might be being used however the controller is the one who knows to call different functions on the model to get the data to display and put it into the right collection name so the view can find and display it even though the view is actually ignorant of what it is displaying

888775
next	except
never looked back except when i think about the time i naively thought i would be the one developing the next big thing

888834
stdout	stderr
i believe this has something to do with the fact that basehttpserver sends log data to stdout and stderr

888842
post	get
coalesce is not the answer to string concatentation in t-sql i ve seen many post over the years about using the coalesce function to get string concatenation working in t-sql

888842
coalesce	isnull
coalesce is the version of isnull which can take more than two parameters

888881
public	protected
edit ok looking at what you wrote i think you need to set the scope of a1 to be public or protected

888932
tinyint	boolean
like last seen on ... then leave last activity and just add a boolean flag tinyint logged_in to your users table

888957
put	get
when storing this information as a string make sure that all numbers are the same length so if the formatter returns 15 you store the string with 015 so that you just divide by 3 later to get the byte to then put into the array

888960
post	get
also you could point your rss reader to sharepointblogs.com and get some pointers to a load of semi-active bloggers who are happy to answer questions posted as comments on their blogs as long as they re related to the main post topic

888962
haskell	ocaml
later i discovered functional programming via mozart oz ocaml later scala haskell and clojure and then i understood that many of the patterns were just boilerplate or additional complexity because the language wasn t expressive enough

888993
put	get
idealy you should never use properties to get data from your object compute things and put data back in the object

888997
width	margin
in sum up i want to put the titles using setting the width attribute plus a negative margin but the width doesn t take effect

889097

obviously it will take some time to get to know the players but joel oleson has put together a good blog article to help get started in the sharepoint twitter community

889456
put	get
i m not sure if this will meet your exact requirement but if you put both the canvas and the content inside a grid as peers it will get you a centered result

889504
globalization	localization
i ve already set the globalization tag in web.config with appropriate uiculture and culture values and they work great for days of the week and other localization settings unfortunately they did not adjust the clock what is the easiest thing i can do to achieve the adjustment so when in the application i do datatime.now i get the current time in timezone b not a

889623
vbscript	vba
if at all possible i would like help in doing this query in vbscript vb.net vba etc

889626
min	max
then you can use the min max x y coordinates to get a simple bounding box and rotate that by the angle to get your final result

889638
ant	cruisecontrol	ant	maven
all unit and integration tests work automatically best on a continuous integration server like cruisecontrol done by ant or maven

889670
maven	pom.xml
look into composite maven projects where there is a top level pom.xml that defines a number of child modules

889692

889986
postgresql	mysql
sysbench is a great utility for benchmarking mysql and i believe has plugins or the capability to test postgresql

889986
postgresql	mysql
regardless of performance if you really know what you are doing with rdbms software and need an open source solution you ll probably want to go with postgresql -- otherwise stick with mysql

890038
yacc	bison
i m writing a grammar in yacc actually bison and i m having a shift reduce problem

890068
children	parent
so i will different modules who can be parent or children

890079
width	height
now the problem is that if the element contains only floated elements or absolutely positioned elements it itself takes no space it has zero width and height

890079
width	height
you can work around this by giving the element some non-zero height and width

890093
public	protected
i think people conceive of internal protected and private as restrictions from the natural state of public

890093
public	protected
rather internal protected and public are weakenings of the natural state of private

890110
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
in the .net world you have svcutil.exe or in the asmx days wsdl.exe to digest .wsdl files to produce proxy classes

width	height
another alternative is having the grid inside the canvas as you ve specified in your xaml with the height width set to or bound to the height width of the canvas

890253
division	modulo
based on robert s code here it can even be done without the division or modulo replacing them with one shift and one and like so

890273
n-gram	words
generate some vector representation for each answer words count using text n-gram

890279
emacs	textmate
however you can extend emacs to work like slickedit and textmate that is copy cut the current line when no text is selected

890322
octal	hex
one option is to directly input the character you re interested in using hex or octal notation

890342
boost	stl
once you got these basics sorted i would recommend to concentrate on getting to grips with the stl and eventually boost

890438
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sorteddictionary and sortedlist both have o log n for retrieval

890438
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sorteddictionary has o log n for insert and delete operations whereas sortedlist has o n

890438
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

890438
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
if the sortedlist is populated all at once from sorted data it s faster than sorteddictionary

890463
button	checkbox
however the problem seems to be caused by the fact browsers commonly add some random uneven margins to radio button and checkbox

890465
folder	directory
so i am trying to use virtualpc s shared folder feature to share the host machine s subversion directory and open the project in vb6 on the virtualpc

890951
post	get
i found this post to be very useful to get me started

890968
inherited	subclassing
it inherited from java.lang.object and there is only one subclassing signedmutablebiginteger which is only available from inside the package

891006
hash	salt
append to the ticket id a hash of the ticket id and a per-event salt

891023
int	chars	int	double
accordingly most perhaps all of the value types chars short long int biginteger bigdecimal float double even string in java are immutable

891044
sequence	permutation
the actual process of summing longer sequence will become very expensive more-so than generating a single permutation on a step basis most architectures have simd vector instructions that can provide rather impressive speed-up i would provide examples of such implementations but i cannot post urls yet

891055
doc	rtf
i m guess i will store the markup in html format then convert to rtf doc etc for user convenience

891057
mp3	wav	mp3	aiff	wav	aiff
file server in the network has a huge library of mp3 aac aiff wav music files

891203
typedef	struct
it might be a good idea to avoid typedef struct altogether

891250
gif	png
all png fix methods require that a transparent gif be available to replace the png image it s part of how the substitution works

891250
gif	png
if that gif is missing then you get this broken image appearance even tho the png draws fine

891285
daemons	launchd
of course the newer osx daemons go through launchd 8 instead but there are still a few that use good old fashioned signals

891311
bazaar	git
i would recommend a decentralized vcs anyway mercurial bazaar git

891338
width	height
i m thinking that a brush of a given width and height that as it s dragged across an area of the screen grabs the section beneath it and analyzes it setting non-text color to yellow and leaving text color alone then placing the updated section back onto the screen

891360
superclass	subclassing
discriminator is used to identify a subclassing or superclass mapping when a database record is fetched from a database

891360
superclass	subclassing
however when it comes to mapping of a transient java object to a database row only class name of the object or provided to the save or saveorupdate method entity-name is used to find subclassing superclass mapping

891360
superclass	subclassing
the userproperty entity is a superclass mapping but there are subclassing with their own entity-names and hibernate does not resolve subclassing identified by entity-names this is actually noticed in the hibernate s code

891363
cassini	webdev.webserver
basically if the debugger is currently running it will stop it then kill any processes named webdev.webserver which should be all the cassini instances and then starts the debugger again which will implicitly start cassini again

891366
firefox	safari
in firefox 3 and safari 3 you can use rgba like georg schã lly mentioned

the browser does create a space appr the correct width but there seems to be a height to it as well and the whole line of text gets pushed downward despite the css line-height rule

891538
datatrigger	eventtrigger
then i tried to use the trigger for the textblock but there will be an exception that i can t use datatrigger only eventtrigger for that

891581
mouseup	mousedown
i ve tried a few solutions mainly involving returning false from the mousedown or click events and although they disable text selection in some browsers they also seem to disable the mouseup event entirely ruining the drop bit of the script and leaving this perma-floating icon hanging around the mouse-- not fun

891593
getdate	strtotime
strtotime possibly combined with getdate localtime or gmtime

891663

the sql query is supposed to be generated by this linq query so i m thinking of it as a poor man s serializable deserialization of linq queries to t-sql format

891714
opera	safari
it works in safari opera and konqueror and for the remaining browsers you may use some javascript

891736
vim	emacs
i cannot yet believe i graduated with a computer engineering degree without ever seeing a bash shell or even hearing about emacs or vim

891835
for-loop	arrays
it is essentially the same a for-loop walking an arrays

891841
rss	feed
i have bunch of feed which are rss 0.92 version and so.

891854
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
inherited creates a strong relationship between a subclassing and superclass

891854
superclass	subclassing
subclassing must be aware of superclass es implementation details

891884
width	margin
as you can see i have given the inner container a fixed width as well as left and right margin auto as is often suggested as the way to center a div horizontally

891896
nodevalue	innerhtml
it s just as easy to pick up the nodevalue of the firstchild as it is to get the innerhtml or innertext which someone mentioned which is less supported

891901
srp	principles
you want to extract code from one class and put it in a class of its own probably to keep up with the single responsibility principles or srp

891908
inherited	subclassing
inherited exposes a subclassing to details of its parent s class implementation that s why it s often said that inherited breaks encapsulation in a sense that you really need to focus on interfaces only not implementation so reusing by subclassing is not always preferred

891908
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
the tight coupling provided by inherited makes the implementation of a subclassing very bound up with the implementation of a superclass that any change in the parent implementation will force the sub class to change

891908
inherited	subclassing
excessive reusing by subclassing can make the inherited stack very deep and very confusing too

891921
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
a solution based on getelementbyid getelementsbytagname will be considerably more reliable and flexible

891959
objectdatasource	formview
how do you guys update let s say for example a formview with an objectdatasource source

891972
disk	ram
that said it s a 1920 1200 res screen 4gb ram 7200 rpm disk

891986
width	height	width	font-size
the first line leaves a height for the element the second pushes the text beyond that height font-size depending x3 is just a good starting point the third hides it from display and the last nukes the width of the text

892017
gridview	objectdatasource
your gridview is linked to an objectdatasource

892057
inherited	subclassing
i have a basic class that derived subclassing inherited from it carries the basic functions that should be the same across all derived classes

892066
equals	gethashcode
i recommmend simply overriding the gethashcode and equals method as the compiler warns but as you seem to want to supress them you can do that as follows

892071
gridview	objectdatasource
you need to find and capture the entered data in the gridview footer then directly add into input parameters of your objectdatasource

892079
disk	ram
remember ram disk and often batteries are changeable

892087
vmware	virtualbox
with something like vmware fusion or virtualbox you could install a complete linux system with python2.3 and do your testing there

892109
tunnel	vpn
if you re doing this over the internet you should probably use a tunnel or vpn for security

892171
width	margin
another thing it s not recommended to use width and margin in the same tag

892188
vbscript	jscript
i m a jscript asp coder like you not done vbscript for an age so the above might need a bit of polish i had to strip out all the

892261
implements	extends
if it gets more complex then you ll probably want to make an outer class that does not implements actionlistener or extends jbutton to handle the data

892261
awt	swing
also note you should be using the eventqueue.invokelater boilerplate to ensure that swing components are only ever used on the awt edt

892269
solaris	aix
not familiar with aix but the following works on linux and solaris

892274
cpu	affinity
you could try to set the interpreter affinity to a fixed cpu and see if this issue still comes up

892296
sorting	grouping
as a hopefully related aside last time i looked the implementation of group_by preserves the relative order of the data fed to it which can be useful to remember as it allows you to sort the data in the flat list of posts and then when you grouping them the order is maintained within the grouping rather than dealing with sorting withing the nested data output by group_by

892307
int	boolean
in c# int values are not implicitly casted to boolean so yields a compiler error and does not compile

892348
hide	show
i would also suggest injecting an additional stylesheet and use that to show hide and style ugly elements

892445
gif	png
so if you got pdf with html wrapper you can use ihtmldocument2 mimetype to find out exact type of the document jpeg gif png etc

892466
put	get
probably faster and easier to get an image of a compass and put an imagemap on it

892469
hash	salt
so hash are useful because they change password login name salt value combinations to a code that cannot be reversed

892489
ssl	https
https ssl are the most common ways to do this

892499
ssl	https
to stop interception of the network communication make sure you use ssl ie https not http

892502
hash	salt
client first sends password i suggest ssl is used server then calculates hash based on that password with salt and compares it to its data in password storage

892558
width	margin
re previous comment - there are no problems with using width and margin on the same tag

892595
inherited	properties
won t properties and methods of car be inherited when i do

892625
hide	show
the viewcontroller class simply show or hide the imageview depending on whether data is available

892649
folder	directory
if the program you re using is installed correctly it should already be in the program files folder so you could just refer to the configuration file as . config_file.txt if its in the same directory as the program or .. other_program config_file.txt if its in a directory different than the other program

892664
division	multiplication
a string representation d h m this needs division multiplication and basic arithmatic

892688
pull	push
the bookmarks extension for mercurial adds local names and with mercurial 1.6 you can move these bookmarks around when you push pull

892698
post	get
get requests may be cached by the browser depending on browser cache size and so on but post won t be cached

892717
memcached	apc
depending on how much memory you have and how long you have to keep them around - you could just use the apc cache or memcached

892773
nsinteger	double
use primitive types double cgfloat nsinteger for typical arithmetic and when you need to store a number as an instance variable that s going to be used primarily for arithmetic in other places

892802
profiling	benchmarking
i would suggest using xdebug php extention to benchmarking and profiling your script

892835
post	get
one issue i think may be an issue is that when you post to your edit create action method in the controller and you want to return a json object i m not sure that is legal as json is used for get actions only

892870
width	height
i would like a to have the same width and height of b or really close while the calculated width and height of a is smaller than those of b

892881
inherited	subclassing
look in the nhibernate documentation for the table per subclassing model of inherited

892910
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu look to be moving toward kvm

892929
google-chrome	firefox
when the gallery is created in firefox google-chrome etc clicking next moves the image on one and the hover state remains for you to click again

892946
inherited	properties
the uicomponent class from which canvas inherited has a minheight and a minwidth properties

892946
width	height
you can bind a s minheight width to the width and height of b so whenever b is resized the minimum dimensions of a also change

892946
width	height
b will automatically show scrollbars when a grows too large to be shown all at once you just need to supply a fixed height and width or some other size constraint

893017
children	parent
even if many children there will only be one parent and combining the parent child creates a globally unique key even though the child key is only unique within its parent

893041
range	max	range	min	min	max
say set a range from a min of 1 to a max of 10 instances

893063
width	height
the variables tile_width and tile_height which are used in the above code examples refer to the width and height of the ground tile in the image representing the tile

893076
put	get	post	put	post	get
focused on forcing the developer to perform some form of validation of the get post put and delete variables

893084
linqdatasource	objectdatasource
linqdatasource and objectdatasource

893100
hide	show
the best way that i can think of to do it while still using a textsymbol is to change the point size and if the extent is large enough hide show the element as the extent changes

893139
post	get
as you did not post the exact error message you get from the compiler i have to guess

893208
hide	show
to have two buttons and hide one and show the other

893210
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried in firefox ie6 and google-chrome and have seen the same issue

893220
client-side	server-side
and i d recommend loading the client-side and server-side traces into the service trace viewer tool so you can see the events correlated together

893230
windows	wow64
and as wow64 can be expected to be available for at least a decade there is little speaking against running 32 bit apps on 64 bit windows

893238
inherited	properties
basically any properties that aren t overriden in a more specific properties group are inherited from the more general first group

893266
textwrangler	bbedit
textwrangler - lite free as in beer verision of bbedit

893288
activemq	rabbitmq
projects like apache s activemq or rabbitmq are already widely used and highly tuned and should be able to support the type of load you are talking about outside of the box

893300
wma	asf	wmv	asf
if compatibility supercedes compression i would recommend asf which is basically just a container for wma and wmv

893323
inherited	properties
basically your generic type becomes a base class and il is dynamically written creating a concrete class that inherited from the generic but with the new properties added in

893342
serializable	deserialization
basically any class not interface that implements serializable should define serial version id or you risk deserialization errors when the same .class compile is not in the server and client jvms

893383
updatepanel	formview
the form exists in a formview control and is wrapped by an updatepanel like so

893483
serializable	deserialization
note - it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected serialversionuid conflicts during deserialization causing deserialization to fail

893484
subtract	add
zip code is a not a number in the sense that you add or subtract against it

893489
subtract	add
zip codes don t add or subtract or participate in any numeric operations

893490
qpainter	qimage
i saw setcompositionmode in qpainter but the docs say that only works on painters operating on qimage

893491
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
other browsers firefox opera safari probably i didn t test it support events like domfocusin domfocusout which are equivalents for ie s focusin and focusout events

893584
valgrind	callgrind
i use valgrind and its tool callgrind

893584
profiler	callgrind
callgrind is a profiler build upon that

893584
profiler	callgrind
few seconds are sufficient because callgrind is a non-probing profiler

893592
int	double
there is a standard implicit conversion from int to double and there is an equality operator that takes two double so this works

893612
client-side	server-side
you could do something similar with googles results html either server-side or client-side javascript dom traversal

893687
folder	directory
i have a fairly straight forward peice of code that just tries to set the default saved directory for a standard .net save dialogue to a specific folder

893710
put	get
but like everything else in the digital world somebody can exploit a vulnerability and get around whatever safeguards you put in place

893716
implements	extends
public class ordermanagerimpl extends java.rmi.server.unicastremoteobject implements ordermanager

893717
wordpress	expressionengine
i m new to programming and my only area of expertise is web design simple development on platforms like wordpress expressionengine

893758
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
basically take a look at nsurlconnection and nsxmlparser and read up on key value coding makes the xml parsing a lot easier and you ll have everything you need to get it done with a minimal amount of code

893775
onclick	onsubmit
i am attempting to add a javascript confirm dialog to either my linkbutton onclick event or my form onsubmit event

893828
pull	push
both push and pull mechanisms are supported as well as the fallback to globally defined resources when a local resource cannot be found

893918
ssl	https
if you have transport-level security typically through using https over ssl then you have a point-to-point encrypted transport channel which i would deem very safe

893983
ssl	https
https establishes an underlying ssl

893998
ssl	https
i believe an https connection requires an ssl certificate even a self-generated one if you don t want to buy one

894032
int	chars
had the struct been int int chars chars then the same object could have been 12 bytes because chars has no alignment requirement

894074
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i always use safari and firefox for development and occasionally opera if i feel like a change

894074
opera	firefox
by the way don t blindly expect opera to work even if it s good in firefox webkit

894114
cassini	iis
i beleive this is done in the project settings you can define the parameters to cassini or have it run on iis

894205
children	parent
will list all parent regardless if they have children

894232
inherited	properties
that s what basedon properties those you can also extend the base style if you create other setters inside of the inherited style

894253
unix	bsd
if you are on linux bsd unix take a look at queue 3 and check into usr include sys queue.h - it s been done before

894337
gridview	rowdatabound
take a look at the gridview rowdatabound event

894347
notepad++	textpad
best tool ever either textpad or notepad++

894362
jsmin	jscompress
the same community extensions also provide a jscompress task for easily calling jsmin from msbuild

894464
filtering	grouping
fyi the sql 2008 filtering option doesn t seem work on the actual query i am using since the actual query uses grouping by functions

894499
chunked	transfer-encoding
i know that iis can serve this content unchunked because i ve tried using http 1.0 in the request which does not support transfer-encoding chunked and the response arrives correctly and compressed

894510
webkit	gecko
so far i ve looked at gecko and webkit and webkit is the winner so far gecko is way too huge and messy to even consider

894526
int	boolean
i m looking for a way to set the checked property based on an int not boolean in this case inside an mvc view

894539
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome and opera have this feature

894563
listview	gridview
gridview listview work better without viewstate

894573
hbase	hypertable
there are a number of efforts underway appscale runs on ec2 eucalyptus xen and uses a hypertable or hbase backend

894587
ireport	subreports
also i have list collections of other persistent objects in the ones i m fetching for the report and i want a subreports that can list the elements of the list but i don t understand how to reference those from inside ireport to have it make sense when i m in the code

894600
stateless	stateful
it is not 100 relevant but i use poe to write proxy between stateless protocol http and stateful protocol telnet session and more specifically - mud session and it was rather simple - you can check the code in here

894602
public	protected
your best bet is to learn the meaning of the public protected and private keywords

894606
public	protected
if the member variable is defined in a parent class then you can only access it if the member variable is protected or public

894682
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
sphinx supports aggregate-functions sum avg min max since 0.9.9-rc2 version

894758
subtraction	addition
for me getting rid of viewstate and the page life-cycle has been an addition by subtraction

894783
post	get
what i find handy is to encapsulate the request data post get cookie etc in to an object and then to add a filter method which u can pass an array of function names to

894788
versioning	upgrade
delete your resharper cache files regularly - especially if you ve upgrade from a previous versioning

894826
primes	modulus
this is why the modulus chosen for such prngs is usually primes

894829
try-catch	exception-handling
i use try-catch blocks when the potential exception-handling are more complex or more numerous

894832
int	boolean
if so a common way of doing this is with a boolean flag or sometimes an int counter

894856
multiplying	add
other classes rectangle that have a combination of fields often use a combination of the string technique of multiplying by a small prime number and adding in but add in the various field values

894884
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
in java in particular certain exceptions descending from runtimeexception such as illegalargumentexception are really meant to signal programming errors conditions that should not happen if your program is correct

894909
google-chrome	firefox
the closest thing that i found catches the context menu in ie but not in firefox and google-chrome shows the context menu and then shows the custom event

894924
lan	intranet
webforms are great for corporate lan intranet sites where development speed is critical upstream bandwidth to the web server is plentiful but memory on the server is more constrained

894936
versioning	upgrade
i have run into trouble in projects were we upgrade our build environment to newer versioning or even to another vendors where we were unable to recreate the exact binaries we had before

894954
width	height
in the configuration above the modal popup is higher that it is wide - even though width is 800 and height is 600

894974
google-chrome	firefox
this refresh works well in ie but both firefox and google-chrome do not rebind the listview

894975
google-chrome	firefox
works fine for me across ie firefox and google-chrome

895006
chunked	transfer-encoding
if the output was too large after about 60 seconds iis added transfer-encoding chunked to the header then added the appropriate hex number and sent what it had

895087
nsmenu	nspopupbuttoncell
if you really need to roll this yourself rather than using one of the built-in controls that shows a menu you can create an nspopupbuttoncell and use that to show the nsmenu

895119
vmware	virtualbox
the one time i was forced to deploy on windows however i installed ubuntu via virtualbox could also use vmware or whatever of course and deployed on that

895140
dlsym	dlopen
functionn in a dll you could simply pull them out and invoke them by name using dlopen dlsym which would probably get you 90 of the way you want to go

895153
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
i hate using gridbaglayout in general so i ll add a version using boxlayout but it s a bit trickier due to the preferred size settings

895171
submit	submission
i have a survey on a website and there seems to be some issues with the users hitting enter i don t know why and accidentally submission the survey form without clicking the submit button

895237
put	get
as developers many of us rely on the output of the computer science world to further our development tools in fact without them many developers would be left floundering but put a computer science graduate in front of a user and get them to design a meaningful piece of software for them and the academic intellect is going to fall to pieces because the two speak completely different languages

895237
imperative	declarative
it would be way more helpful if programmers learned at least one functional language one imperative language one declarative language

895237
xslt	xquery
communication devices - xml xquery xpath xslt xsd as these seem to be used so extensively

895237
profiling	debugging
also tools like query profiling should be taught to help students debugging performance issues with applications

895341
simplecursoradapter	listactivity
i ve populated a listactivity from a cursor using simplecursoradapter that starts another activity when one of the list items have been clicked

895347
svm	k-means
for a basic nlp approach you could represent each document as a vector based on word frequencies then cluster the document vectors using bayesian or other methods svm k-means etc

895461
public	protected
if you allow it to be protected or public all inherited will use it directly

895514
int	double
eventually c a will overflow the int or double types

895559
nsmenu	nsapplication
just hook an action method up to your button create an nsmenu and populate it with nsmenuitems and send it to this method along the the current event from nsapplication s currentevent getter

895598
filesystems	ntfs
summary of the best answer i got and other answers were later deleted i assume by their authors use ntfs-3g to access the ntfs filesystems from linux

895655
debian	linux
edit oh and it works on linux and windows as a standalone library although i believe only debian distributes it as such

895713
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
it has been mentioned that viewwillappear and viewdidappear do not get called per the docs

895713
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
viewwillappear and viewdidappear of

895736
valgrind	gprof
use valgrind if you can along with the kcachegrind visualizer otherwise use the venerable gprof

895747
getter	setter
if i have a class with an attr_accessor it defaults to creating an instance variable along with the corresponding getter and setter

895758
swt	swing
on the other hand if this represents 20 of the application with the other 80 being the user functionality around providing this conversion then perhaps having to do the work to get the manipulation done is a worthwhile trade off to not have to deal with your own memory management and to have whatever other apis java is giving you for user interaction web swing swt whatever you are using

895764
calloc	malloc
it s an error that will lead you to dynamic allocation calloc malloc new etc

895819
pull	push
why i want to do this i ve set up a bare empty git repo on our netapp filer where it will be backed up but i want to work with a clone on my local hard drive and push and pull back and forth

895820
cpython	ironpython
ironpython is a great solution but i keep going back to cpython for windows

895837
width	height
images that are a 1x1 alpha transparent png and you use the height and width attributes in to tell it how much you want to space

895857
appendto	each
if you look at the way appendto is written it s essentially taking each item in the items array and running a ul .append items i

895884
octal	decimal
the 033 will get replaced with 33 octal which is 27 decimal by the compiler

895885
put	get
it seems for the moment the best way to get an interlockedswap is to put a critical section around to ensure the steps don t get split

895900
distance	polygons
so i was trying to get point distance the point is within the polygons to the edge of the forested polygons

895913
distance	polygons
if you want to find the nearest edge you basically want to iterate across all of the line segments the polygons defines doing a line-segment-to-point distance calculation

895923
distance	polygons
google has a wealth of results for distance from point to polygons edge

895947
puts	gets
note scanf with unadorned s is as bad as gets because it puts no limit on the amount of data that will be slurped in

896013
pull	push
you have to have control of both apps of course and change app1 to support either on a push or pull model the data transfer to app2

896055
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
if the view controller is added to a view hierarchy through code the view controller will not get viewwillappear or viewdidappear messages

896080
folder	directory
check the installation folder for your copy of pygame and if it s there modify your python installation s font path to include that directory

896105
rss	feed
in an attempt to write an rss reader i ran into problems with the .net xml reader throwing an exception if an unencoded apostraphy appeared between the start and end tags found in an rss feed

896105
rss	feed
for clarification i was working on rss version 2.0 that was also the version number i found in the feed

896122
serializable	deserialization
this assumes that most of the time all you need to do is reconstitute the original event from the database like serializable deserialization and not search efficiently on every possible property

896131
versioning	upgrade
i have used beast to sponsor a forum and would like to upgrade and move the deployment from ubuntu to os x on a more recent versioning of ruby on rails

896180
serializable	deserialization
this serializable deserialization happens to both the arguments coming in and the return value going out

896215
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for example ie6-8 get an iframe element with id of ie_historyframe google-chrome safari get a safari_rememberdiv and firefox gets a firefox_anchordiv

896224
mouse	keyboard
i ve got the mouse and keyboard control part but now i needed an ocr to process the screenshot

896244
int	chars
my advice read up on data types int real chars arrays dimension input output read write open close rewind and loops do for and you ll be doing useful stuff in no time

896283
width	height
i currently have an image that i want people s annotations to show up on where the annotations actually have an x y coordinate relative to the image as well as a width and height

896288
maven	pom.xml
if your java project is mavenized it s even easier grails 1.1 works with maven so you can create a pom.xml for your grails app and add your java project as a dependency as you would in any other java project

896288
getter	setter
this could be pretty straightforward if your classes are already written as proper beans with getter setter methods for all their properties

896288
inherited	properties
grails will see these inherited properties as it would if they were written in the simpler groovy style

896295
cpu	processors
this is discussed because the cpu will automatically store accessed memory in cache close to the processors

896298
int	boolean
there s nothing special about boolean or int they were just convenient types

896332
put	get
i m not sure exactly what you mean but if you take the background off the a and .currentpage and put the following on the li you get something maybe closer to what you want

896333
multiplying	add
simply count up how many of each letter there are add 1 to each value and multiplying them together

896334
boost	stl
use of boost and the stl is required to employ many of his techniques

896380
hash	md5
why not use encryption to store the passwords in the database such as md5 because they will return different hash versions for example

896401
for-loop	loops
if data is a as you suggest you can use a for-loop rather than a for each loops

896408
udp	tcp
hand roll your own tcp or udp protocol exchange

896473
getter	setter
they have a lot of properties with getter s and setter s and not much else

896482
webclient	httpwebrequest
use httpwebrequest instead of webclient it s slightly less convenient but not by very much and set the keepalive property to false

896483
mp3	wav	mp3	aiff	wav	aiff
it will play virtually any file format aiff wav mp3 aac keep in mind that you can only play one mp3 aac file at a time

896511
svg	vml
you will need to either use an image or vml svg

896511
svg	vml
please note that ie doesn t natively support svg and no other browsers support vml but there is an svg to vml wrapper

896538
inherited	properties
so if such properties is inherited by the object you can not test its existence like this

i had used componentart in a project before and was impressed with its 3d like color settings dundas look bland comparitively.

896567
mockups	balsamiq
you make rough mockups of the screens use balsamiq or something and show them to your client stakeholder and walk them through it as if they were using it

896638
folder	directory
basically what i need is to take a path to a file or directory on a local machine or preferrably on a share on a remote machine and get the list of users groups and the corresponding permissions for this file folder

896640
ant	maven
use the maven ant task to run jarsigner from the jdk against all the dependencies

896664
post	get
so you have most everything in place but in your controller action that handles the post you ll want to get the value of the drop down list load the entity associated with that value then attach that entity to the object you re trying to update

896685
children	parent
children should also know their parent so we have like a doubly linked tree

896685
children	parent
to make disbanding parent from children easier i model the link between parent and child as a relationship with properties parent and child

896685
children	parent
so a parent has a collection of relationships not of children

896687
rss	feed
planetemacsen is a good rss feed with lots of tips

896690
width	height
resizeby width height

896764
folder	directory
then simulate an update with directory of that folder

896815

the app runs on ie firefox google-chrome opera safari

896836
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
it s more lightweight than anything else and still manage to do the job right so for linux i don t think there are any other options and for ubuntu and probably debian and the rest of them there is even a package vim-rails that contain a lot of scripts to ease up the development

896839
google-chrome	firefox
i ve come to the conclusion that it seems it is possible based on my use of telerik s context menu which works fine on ie google-chrome and firefox

896874
stdout	stderr
in addition i want to be able to read the stdout stderr of these processes and search for keywords in the output

896877
cruisecontrol	jenkins
hudson update jenkins 1 is extremely easy to set up and managing jobs projects in it is certainly a breeze compared to cruisecontrol

896911
children	parent
the relationship object keeps a one-to-many relation between a single parent and a certain number of children and it ll keep a reference to each person object

896911
children	parent
this specialization lets you have parent s and children to link between other hierarchies in a completely traversal way

896914
pascal	delphi
free pascal lazarus can compile some forms of delphi apps to wince arm

897039
pop-up	dialog
when i click on the field the datepicker pop-up but behind the dialog box which blocks out almost the entire datepicker

897075
stdout	stderr
for each process i actually ended up redirecting the stdout and stderr to a temporary file then periodically checking the file for updates and dumping the output into a textview

897085
folder	directory
beacause maven didn t get the workspace.html from the war directory but got it from the public directory i had to remove the folder from the path of the script block

897097
keyup	mouseup
would mouseup and keyup do for this purpose

897118

897120
webclient	webrequest
many upload classes is not using like webclient webrequest webresponse

897162
getter	setter
this is a little confusing behavior for those who know java-like getter setter where you have to define them for every class member you want to access

897162
getter	setter
when it s comfortable to use java-like getter setter - you may write something like this

897162
getter	setter
and then use this code by defining custom getter setter

897164
post	get
i think responding is nice if you watch something like gmail you ll notice a lot of post that get

897176

897311
apache	lighttpd
this works with apache and lighttpd out of the box and no rewrite rules are needed

897320
pascal	delphi
both work fine with delphi up to version 2009 and with free pascal

897331
hide	show
in the following code i set up a change handler on a select box to show and hide some follow up questions based on the value of the selection

897390
width	height
you can set a fixed height and width for the div

897398
post	get
to make things worse the complex object graph was being saved to viewstate so every time the page refreshed a cell was updated all the grid and viewstate would get passed from the client to the server in the post back and with a viewstate size of nearly a meg performance is pants

897448
gridview	repeater
according to me using an updatepanel wrapped around a repeater datagrid gridview will be a much more easier-to-implement approach

897462
inherited	subclassing
then define the methods and operators in a base class with a protected constructor and define point and vector as leaf subclassing of this base class so that they inherited its functionality

897472
children	parent
on linux there s a prctl call which is explicitly designed to send a signal to all of a process s children when the parent dies for whatever reason

897472
children	parent
however if you use kill -ppid note the minus sign then so long as the children are still in the parent process s process group then the kernel will deliver any signal to all of the children

897477
fink	macports
i m trying to avoid the macports fink route

897540
minix	linux
if you re still put off by the linux kernel then there s always the minix kernel.

897598
children	parent
and when i try to serialize a parent object which agregates some children - children with links to parent do recursion forever

897733
hash	md5
one more thing relying on md5 hash alone for identifying files is not safe you re better off using the file name as the identifier which is guaranteed to be unique within the folder

897733
hash	md5
there are collisions in md5 two distinct files could have the same md5 hash the probability is small but existent

897828
post	get
it depends on whether you re sending a get or a post request

897831
ssl	https
if you use https the whole communication after establishing the connection will be transfered encrypted over ssl

897846
vb6	vba
here is a code snippet from excel vba should work in vb6 with some tweaks

897849
fast-forward	merge
as i described in rebase vs.merge if your development branch is not too far in term of modifications from master another strategy would be to rebase development on top of master make the split and then merge development back to master fast-forward merge at this point

897862
bazaar	git
than in bazaar or git

897862
bazaar	git
mercurial is significantly faster than bazaar it s slower than git though by a much smaller difference

898011
klocwork	coverity
i have not had direct experience with findbugs or pmd but have met plenty of people who have compared them with klocwork and coverity

898011
klocwork	coverity
not surprisingly klocwork and coverity which cost money tend to be more solution oriented that can also scales better to work with teams has a more efficient easier to use ui and tends to be less noisy

898011
klocwork	coverity
many companies see value and choose coverity or klocwork for a longer term solution although i see also running findbugs and pmd

898041
hide	show
if they need to edit again just show the textarea hide the div

898046
post	get
php treats all get post cookie variables as strings until you do something with them

898126
mouseleave	mouseenter
however jquery 1.3 doesn t support blur focus mouseenter mouseleave change and submit events as live events

898141
vmware	esx
i ve read about the vmware-cmd tool but believe that is only available with vmware esx not workstation

898255
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship diagram with in-place schema editing

898305
solaris	aix
we have steps that execute across win32 linux64 linux32 hp aix solaris and even steps that are pushed across the world for remote execution

898305
solaris	aix
each of the steps can be setup to run in parallel or series so when hp aix solaris and linux are all doing the same thing they can all run in parallel and the win32 follow-up will wait until everything finishes before continuing

898379
range	minimum
to find the possible price range of item x set your objective function to the price of x and solve for the minimum and maximum separately

i do not have a need to publish it to a running iis instance just to put the web content together with bin folder on some local dir

898428
jms	jta
just to set the scene this is a java ee application that uses messaging jms a lot persist data in relational database jdbc and relies on global transactions xa managed by the application server jta

898432
int	chars	int	double
if i declare a static variable of a fundamental type chars int double etc. and give it an initial value i imagine that the compiler simply sets the value of that variable at the very beginning of the program before main is called

898483
freebsd	solaris
if most frequently means the actual number of calls in some run of the program dtrace could be the tool you are looking for assuming you have a solaris freebsd or osx box for development work

898527
apache	cherokee
i used to use mod_geoip but recently dumped apache for cherokee which has its own geoip logic

898635
put	get
also if you ever want to put any other control in your tooltip it won t be focusable since a tooltip itself can get focus

898671
post	put
once you have the command right you can put it into the post build actions so it automatically fires after a build

898677
put	get
also i have noticed that visual studio unit test projects sometimes put a deploymentitem attribute on each of the test methods pointing to your target dll and if you switch between debug and release visual studio can get confused if the dll is no longer in the expected location

898696
sorting	filtering
im very ho using the current version of mvc to build for example data entry systems with lots of tabular data inline editing sorting paging filtering etc is quite a lot of work when compared to using webforms

898724
hide	show
when an admin fieldset is given the class collapse it is rendered with a show hide link installed by collapsedfieldset.js which collapses or expands it

898732
ienumerable	iqueryable
the other 2 ways in involve joining in-memory ienumerable which means your pull all records for each before doing the join above and doing an iqueryable join using a contains method which has limitations.

898739
portrait	landscape
i want to set the text direction for some cells in a texttable so that they are vertical the text is landscape instead of portrait

898763
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	modulo	multiplication	modulo	addition	multiplication	addition	modulo	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	modulo	division	multiplication
integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

898793
free	malloc
it s not impossible but it s pretty darn close if you re using the standard malloc free new delete calls

898850
width	height
you need something to contrain the size of the wrappanel and the scrollviewer - you could set the width and height of the viewer then use an element binding on the wrappanel

898864
folder	directory
everything else in this scenario has stayed the same essentially a new website with a static ip address was created pointing to a new folder where all of the files from the virtual directory were xcopied to

898867
implements	sealed
when implements a sealed class that doesn t use unmanaged resources you simply implements a dispose method as with normal interface implementations

898867
suppressfinalize	finalizer
also note that even though b doesn t have a finalizer it still calls suppressfinalize to correctly deal with any subclasses that do implement a finalizer

898870
allocator	stl
i should point out though that things like stl containers which allocate memory on the heap should almost never be passed by value if avoidable because heap allocator is very slow compared to stack allocator

898876
ferret	sphinx
most people i know have ditched ferret and replaced it with sphinx

898886
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
as per chad s post to crack attempt 4 all one has to do is crc32 loads of passwords and then reverse the function he s coded up leaving you with a salt md5 hash and the salt which you would then test for validity

898886
salt	md5
simply test this pair by calculating md5 password+salt where password is the password you are trying and salt is the salt you have calculated by reversing the algorithm

898886
hash	md5
if the md5 equals the first 32 characters of the hash you ve cracked the password

898907
firefox	safari
i think some of the nightly builds of safari and firefox can do this but i suspect this isn t what is being asked about

898984
maven	m2e
m2e maven plugin

899035
hide	show
the easiest way to manage all this is to create a class that derives from uiviewcontroller and have it implement a show and a hide delegate method

899035
hide	show
but with a standard show hide interface it should make it easier to manage the flow between screens

899058
int	double
this presumes that your double fall within the range of an int

899061
hide	show
if all your manager is asking from you is to show and hide some elements or fade in and out a couple of images or request some data via ajax and display it then learning jquery and its api is perhaps all that you need

899064
google-chrome	safari
css3 supports rotation however at this time only google-chrome and safari support css3 rotation with webkit

899064
google-chrome	safari
in the future or with safari or google-chrome you can do this

899100
vbscript	jscript
i want to be able to run vbscript or jscript on a server using cscript.exe to manipulate sharepoint through the object model

899213
addition	multiplication
a simple example expressions involving numbers addition and multiplication this illustrates operator precedence

899215
tetris	pong	tetris	pacman	pong	pacman
you may want to start with a simpler project such as recreating something like tetris pacman or even pong so you can get an idea of all that goes into creating a game

899226
put	get
a good habit that some c programmers get into is to put rvalues on the left-hand side of comparisons so that the compiler will generate an error if you accidentally use the assignment operator instead of the comparison operator

899249
postgresql	mysql
mysql versus postgresql adding a last modified time column to a table

899274
maven	pom.xml
i have a maven pom.xml with a plugin that i want to be able to control on the command line

899292
post	get
this will contain the post variables in a raw format--i was able to use php s parse_str function to get the post variables out of that raw string

899300
for-loop	arrays
a for-loop is idiomatic and easy to read especially if you know the size of the arrays user-defined macros are non-standard

899356
hash	salt
i can t view the link in the original question the website just returns a 404 not found error but the method described in the question is not really using a salt hash

899356
hash	salt
in a proper implementation of salt hash when the passord is created a random salt is combined with the password and hash

899356
hash	salt
then random salt used and the hash are stored

899356
hash	salt
even if i know the password i cannot predict what the hash will be since there will be a different hash for each of the many possible salt values

899359
google-chrome	safari
pelms made some further investigations and pointed out that ie8 on win7 and google-chrome 2 safari 4b allows you to style br somewhat

899375
ubuntu	linux
i recently jumped from mac to linux ubuntu and have been missing bbedit

899375
geany	gedit

so please explain to me why the base-class superclass can t access private protected variables from its subclassing

899501
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it has been tested in ie 6 7 8 firefox 2 3 3.5b4 safari 3 4 for windows opera 9.6 10 alpha and google-chrome version 2 and it didn t work in any of them

899525
int	chars
int putenv chars string

899533
stdout	stderr
note that s closing from 3 up to keep stdin stdout stderr open

899581
inherited	base-class
as well a base-class super-class doesn t know when it has been inherited from

899581
inherited	base-class
to allow a base-class to know when it has been inherited you would have to be able to modify the base-class when inheriting from it

899629
int	double
it throws an error with primitive types such as int or double since a cast cannot convert from a string to a numeric type

899650
vim	emacs
you should also look into vim and emacs as both have extensive sets of add-ons targeted at just what you need

899666
put	get
take a break get yourself a coffee put a breakpoint on the line logger.error... and try again

899721
children	parent
in some countries mostly of western civilization communicating every act of lawbreaking even within family parent children to authorities is a normal practice

899733
hide	show
this starts becoming a nightmare of its own when you want to hide and show certain textfields

899746
post	get
post back how you get on

899762
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
how can it benefit from the inotifypropertychanged and inotifycollectionchanged notifications so minimal work is required when implementing the models business objects

899782
listview	gridview
i have do create a menu list of actions which would be easier if made with a control that accepts a datasource like listview or even gridview with templated collumns

899868
cil	ildasm
you can use ildasm to disassemble the assembly into cil code and use ilasm to reassemble that cil code and sign it with your own key

899887
division	multiplication
multiplication is faster than division so the second method is faster

899888
gridview	onclientclick
so onclientclick i want to reload the gridview so that it will reload with the textbox s value

899926
public	protected
in the controller tier helper methods defined on applicationcontroller should be marked as protected -- if they were private the other controllers would not be able to access them but if they are public rails will treat them as actions

899929
division	multiplication
if the latter yes floating point multiplication is generally faster than division

899959
post	get
works great and also supports get and post parameters

899967
firefox	safari
in safari we found that the dom level 0 took twice the time off the dom level 2 but was still four times faster than either firefox case

899970
rtf	odf
data datasets export into 17 most popular formats ms access ms excel ms word open xml format open document format odf rtf html xml pdf txt dbf csv sylk dif latex sql and windows clipboard

899983
x86	64bit
the downside is that there is a possibility that you will lose a very small portion of accuracy on certain processors - eg on modern x86 processors 64bit float operations are actually internally computed using 80 bits when using the default fpu mode and storing it off in a variable will cause those extra precision bits to be truncated according to your fpu rounding mode which defaults to nearest

900060
cvs	rcs
if the keywords look like cvs rcs keywords and so on then the keyword extension bundled with mercurial might be able to help with unexpanding those

900092
width	height
however now there is code being added to calculate the x and y positioning of some of the child elements based off of the width and height of other children

900120
superclass	subclassing
the extract class refactoring can help as can extract subclassing and extract superclass

900121
valgrind	callgrind
i would use valgrind and callgrind as a base for my profiling tool suite

900121
profiler	callgrind
callgrind is a profiler build upon that

900121
profiler	callgrind
even one second run is sufficient to get rock-solid reliable results because callgrind is a non-probing profiler

900154
post	get
might proxies convert post requests to get requests without the client making the request knowing about it

900166
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
iirc getelementsbyclassname was introduced in firefox 3 safari 3.1 and has been in google-chrome since the beginning

900178
listview	gridview
in a project i was developing i was using a gridview but replaced with the listview as i wanted very specific paging requirements that couldn t be provided by the gridview

900203
passenger	thin
i find passenger on dreamhost to give relatively poor performance when compared against running threads by either rack mongrel or thin

900296
pascal	delphi
the latest version available from the svn links on the authors website is updated and supports delphi 2009 in addition to free pascal lazarus

900301
int	chars	int	double
so for basic types chars short int long float double you should always prefer pass by value unless you specifically need to use a reference to store a value for use after the function exits

900305
actionscript	mxml
use states to swap out form elements unless the nature of the form itself is highly dynamic in which case you might want to go with a purely actionscript versus an mxml approach

900336
packets	multicast
a client that detects a missing sequence number sends out a messge on the multicast group hey i missed packets 12345

900336
packets	multicast
you will have to make guesses as to where a packets was dropped and whether the retransmission is most efficiently sent unicast or multicast

900352
pull	push
you can pull push between slave clones and master clones like normal since they are well... just normal clones

900361
allocator	stl
allocator internally but unlike stl it returns a error code when it can t allocate more

900377
cairngorm	mate
although no green threading frameworks exist at the moment which enable you to run ui and logic in separate threads you can use a good architectural framework such as cairngorm or mate there are many which uses commands instead of straight up methods so that functionality execution which may take up processing cycles waits until the ui has finished responding to the user

900397
mp3	wav
at worst you will require an extra tool to decode re-encode mp3 files from raw audio wav files

900468
waitpid	posix
there are various options to waitpid to help you quotes from the posix standard

900471
post	get
the data option is passing the parameters as querystring get instead of post and the content-type needs to be application json

900512
centos	linux
i am getting thousands of pictures uploaded by thousands of users on my linux server which is hosted by 1and1.com i believe they use centos but am unsure of the version

900528

take an md5 hash of each image as it comes in

900528
hash	md5
write that md5 hash in the database where you are keeping track of these things

900528
hash	md5
store them in a directory structure where you use the first couple of bytes of the md5 hash hex string as the dir name

900529
firefox	safari
you can fake the user agent string using the instructions great_llama provided but remember that firefox is not safari and it probably won t lay out the page identically

900626
lisp	scheme
the let construct is similar to the let construct in lisp and scheme

900638
min	max
just define a min of 0 and a max of x where x is the number of distinct values you need

900654
versioning	upgrade
any change or upgrade to a new versioning of a library can add bugs in very subtle and unexpected ways

900662
post	get
ideally for high performance you should post ahead 3-4 buffers and post new buffers as soon as you get one back before you process the one got back so you ensure that the socket always has somewhere to deposit the data coming from the network

900662
kerberos	ntlm
ntlm kerberos authentication and traffic encryption or at least traffic tampering protection

900671
ready	each
for each fd ready for i o fd_isset fd my_set

jruby	mri
deploying a rails app with the glassfish gem is very easy and jruby performs better than mri ruby 1.8.x

900768
comparator	comparable
firstly you want comparator not comparable because comparator takes two objects whereas comparable compares the current object to one passed in and you can t change the comparator method on string or integer so

900782
listview	gridview
sounds like an asp.net gridview listview combination to make a grouping grid

900802
tapestry	wicket
you also have less popular ones like wicket and tapestry

900817

width	height
i tried removing the height width attributes and use max-height max-width

900868
put	get
35 is not a long list as long as you sort it alphabetically when you put it in the list so the user can type the first few characters and get close to the choice they want

900874
apache	nginx
my first thought is to proxy requests through nginx or apache or tomcat for that matter

900893
disk	ram
be careful with ram disk

900908
hide	show
i have an nstableview and i have the ability for the user to show or hide columns dynamically with a mail-style header context menu

901021
post	get
i saw some post about people saying to create an empty animation and call getcurrenttime from the storyboard class i couldn t get it to work.

901060
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
i disagree that inotifypropertychanged and inotifycollectionchanged are ui-specific

901077
hash	md5
that said if you actually will use the file s md5 hash in the described way your service will become vulnerable to attacks

901084
stopwatch	dispatchertimer
to set up a dispatchertimer to work like a stopwatch we ll also need an associated timespan representing the time it is run

901110
serializable	deserialization
this gives you full control over serializable and deserialization

901186
versioning	upgrade
what you can upgrade and when is determined mostly by how hard or easy it is to test the new versioning of the system

901191
equals	gethashcode
the system.string overrides gethashcode because it overrides equals and then gethashcode has to be kept consistent

901202
hide	show
i d like to be able to show and hide different entries but they re in the form

901207

i m having a small project in actionscript 3 and everything would be very much easier if it was possible to call code in the superclass from the subclassing

901267
width	height
i am using getimagesize to get image width and height

901268
hide	show
to add functionality to expand a row to display detail you can wrap that information in a div tag and attach a click event to show or hide the content

901278
firefox	safari
because the opener property is definitely lost in firefox safari and most browsers when you navigate to a different window

901311
post	get
in particular this post will get you started

901325
put	get
you can also put the server in strict mode and get an error if any data is out-of-range

901335
post	get
this is my first post and i am fairly new to javascript but i was hoping to get some help on creating objects and arrays using javascript

901351
firefox	safari
webkit safari has been supporting it since version 3.1 microsoft since ie4 mozilla since firefox 3.5 browser support overview

901356
memcached	apc
i m currently implementing memcached into my service but what keeps cropping up is the suggestion that i should also implement apc for caching of the actual code

901395
memcached	apc
on our website we use a combination of apc and memcached

901395
memcached	apc
apc to speed up the above mentioned steps and memcached to enable fast and distributed storing and accessing of both global variables precomputed expensive function calls etc that can be shared by multiple clients for a certain amount of time as well as session variables

901395
memcached	apc
if you have a need for multiple frontends somewhere down the line i would try to go with memcached for such caching and storing and use apc as an opcode cache

901409
ant	maven
ant maven hudson

901438
toolbar	tabs
also it would be confusing for the user as most iphone apps have a stable set of tabs even if they are sometimes hidden or replaced with toolbar

901446
hide	show
edit if this solution is not appropriate some comments below points out that that this solution is non-standard and only supported by the big-three you might have to re-think whether you should make the non-ajax version the standard solution and use javascript to hide show the information instead of fetching it via ajax

901543
iboutlet	ibaction
check interface implementations for ibaction and iboutlet and implementations for proper load sequences

901557
profiling	instrumentation	profiling	debugging
one of the great things about the xcode debugging tools is that they can be run against an application executing on the device so you can use instrumentation to do profiling of your application on the actual hardware

901588
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
n3 for web my preference will be vwd but for other stuff i ll prefer monodevelop and sharpdevelop

901638
pull	push
you will then see progress bars on clone push pull and other operations

901639
hash	md5
option #3 seems the most convenient to the user but since i save passwords as an md5 hash i don t see how option #3 would be available to me since md5 is irreversible

901701
apache	lighttpd
in production environment you want to skip this and make your http server apache lighttpd etc serve static files

901712
hide	show
for example if the age checkbox is checked then i need to show a textbox to enter age else hide the textbox

901826
vmware	virtualbox
i use vmware workstation at work and sun virtualbox at home

901826
ubuntu	linux
at home w ubuntu linux virtualbox is easier to maintain performs as well as i require and is free

901826
ubuntu	linux
without debating one linux distro s merits over another suffiuce it to say ubuntu meets all my needs

901826
vmware	virtualbox
if vmware delivers only token ubuntu support i ll use virtualbox

901865
ubuntu	linux
you can test my assertion w any linux distro livecd i d suggest ubuntu 64-bit desktop

901890
put	get
you want to be careful to put the most important options above the fold so they don t get lost

901900
hash	md5
you mentioned you used md5 to hash stored passwords

901934
ienumerable	iqueryable
the gridview is capable of taking and traversing an ienumerable and iqueryable inherits ienumerable

901986

i d like to code a scrobbling utility for grooveshark using last.fm s api but i don t know if it s possible to get the song information from the grooveshark s flash frontend

902198
sharepoint	spsite
whenever you ask sharepoint to find a site collection using an url it ll do it s best to return a spsite even if it means that it ll have to ignore part of the url

902198
spweb	spsite
if you have the full url of a list and want to find the corresponding spsite and spweb

902221
bazaar	svn
although some centralized vcs like svn are usable in local on the developer s computer i was seduced by distributed vcs and after briefly testing mercurial which is good i found bazaar better suited to my needs and taste

902277
jobs	cron
preferably without using cron jobs

902320
int	double
i understand that a double cannot hold the accuracy of a 64-bit int but at this time the performancecounter only required 46 bits and a double should be able to store 52 bits without loss

902369
bazaar	git
i just wonder why nobody mentioned distributed version control systems in this context if you could manage to switch over to a distributed system git bazaar mercury most arguments of your second group would become pointless since they can just start their repository locally and push it to the server when they want and they can also just remove it if they want to restart from scratch

902393
put	get
from what i understand the only operations supported within a transaction for the java api are get and put

902453
put	get
i don t know if the problem is related but all i get when i put a url into ie8 is this message

902471
onkeyup	onkeydown
use the onkeydown or onkeyup event to fire a handler function

902490
onkeyup	onkeydown
you would attach an onkeydown or onkeyup event handler to the global document object

902490
onkeyup	onkeydown
w3schools has more information on using these events onkeydown and onkeyup

902531
mouse	keyboard
have your program open a second window which displays underneath your main window but is maximised then your errant mouse clicks will all be received by the maximised window and it can receive your keyboard input

902538
postgresql	mysql
i can t speak for mysql but postgresql has transactional ddl

902541
folder	directory
over the years i have vacillated between having my project source folder in a directory one level removed from the root d projects and keeping them in the default location for visual studio

902541
folder	directory
i finally switched to storing them in the documents folder since vista shortened the path and i got tired of changing default directory for my dev tools

902542
bash	zsh
i have not found a tab-completion script for rubygem in bash zsh

902611
folder	directory
i havenâ t tried it myself but i guess you can put your projects in my documents and use a symbolic link to the directory in your root folder

902639
profiling	debugging
individual configuration properties rarely change on their own but you will almost always have a set of profiling usually for different environments debugging production etc

902644
put	get
then i can put my stuff anywhere and move it around and yet i always get to refer to it by y or q or whatever

902698
width	height
create img links to the images at the end of your document and set the width and height to 1x1 pixel and additionally put them in a hidden div

902712
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
yes there are the nsdatecomponents class be used to convert time intervals to and from nsdate objects along with an nscalendar to handle localization issues

902736
put	get
put it all together and you get this

902767
keydown	keyup
i would set the booleans to true in the keydown event and to false in the keyup event

902767
keydown	keyup
i think this is because the second key triggered the keydown event and upon its release the keyup event was fired and the keydown event stopped firing completely even though the first key is fired

902774
decoder	encoder
it s a pure python no dependencies open source png encoder decoder and it supports writing numpy arrays as images

902788
implements	sealed
this probably isn t necessary until you get into some of the cooler aspect-oriented programming features but if you ve forgotten to make a method virtual sealed off that method s class and it doesn t implements an interface and you re uncomfortable making those changes because of existing dependencies then making the switch isn t quite as appealing

902802
hash	salt
e.g. header with salt and sha1 hash of salt+password.

902807
udp	tcp	profiling	benchmarking
benchmarking test profiling prove that tcp is your bottleneck only then consider udp

902815
floating-point	fractions
for example the fractions 1 10 cannot be represented exactly as a binary ieee standard floating-point number

902815
decimal	ieee
for this reason the ieee standard also provides for a decimal representation but this is used primarily by handheld calculators and not by general-purpose computers

902818
put	get
in other words how do i get from a clean install of windows 7 with visual studio to a working gadget that i can install and put on my windows 7 desktop

902831
post	get
the button_to helper is implemented as a form post by default which means it s a bad choice for actions that aren t idempotent regular get actions

902836
dictionary	map
or others yet after values you could have 1 2 3 or named styles fee fie fo or fee s fie s fo s where you pass a dictionary instead of a map as the second argument to execute

902842
width	height
then you can refer to element x y x is along width y along height like this

902868
super	implements
i recommend that you implements -didrecivememorywarning and after calling super at the very least print a log so you can see whether it s happening to you

902891
textblock	visualstatemanager
i want to add a state called textblock and i want the visualstatemanager to go to that state when the istextblock property dependency property is true

902896
unsigned	short
old_string is an array of char and new_string is an array of unsigned short so given two chars 42 and 43 this will put 4342 into

902914
post	get
thought i d post these thoughts now to see if i can get a jump start on next weeks work

902938
udp	tcp
tcp and udp sometimes use a simple checksum to make sure the contents are correct

902952
public	protected
basically it has to do with the view of a package as an api controlled unit hence the recommendation to start your package with your domain name - guaranteed global uniqueness so visibility grows from private - package-private - protected - public

902956
public	protected
given progressive levels of access private package protected and public it would be unnecessarily limiting if it went protected then package since that would force me to allow subclasses access in order to grant other members of the same package

902956
public	protected
so protected is between package and public in that it allows a wider exposure of access

902957
keydown	keyup
you should only be tracking the state of the keys during the keydown and keyup events and handle movement elsewhere

902957
keydown	keyup
if you use the second option you will need to look into doevents because if you have code that s constantly running without ever finishing the function the program will not process any other events such as keyup and keydown events

902959
put	get
thus if you want to get the same behavior for both login shells and interactive non-login shells you should put all of your commands in either .bashrc or .bash_profile and then have the other file source the first one

902971
typedef	struct
instead windows provides a typedef for pointer to struct for that struct

902999
int	chars
a chars set is an abstract list of chars with some sort of int chars code associated

903052
perl	tcl
it s a bridge between perl and tcl tk so it can use all of the modern tcl tk features like tile while still having application logic coded in perl

903059
filtering	grouping
logging to public folder makes search filtering easy grouping ...

903063
abc	subclassing
i don t see why an abc couldn t properly have per-instance aka non-static data members as needed to support the methods it supplies to subclassing

903127
ready	each
then create a function that each computer calls to check if the response is ready

903157
hex	binary
the previous answer to this which i can t link to because of my member status - sucks can be easily countered since the signeridentity string can be looked for and replaced in the binary using a hex editor

903165
post	get
the params scope is a combination of url form get post fields and it will be printed out in the log as part of the normal output processing so you might not need your own dumping of it - any development or production log contains the params dump at the top of the log line

903179
junit	testng
i m not sure about junit but for testng the strategy would be to define a suite xml file with only the one test and then in your pom configure the surefire plugin to only run that

903185
junit	testng
examples of this include pmd bnd junit testng and so on - no serious projects seem to package the maven plugin with the library proper

903202
mechanize	hpricot
so i am trying to extract the email of my website using ruby mechanize and hpricot

903254
fink	macports
otherwise you ll need to either build it from source -- which does require the mac dev tools -- or install it with macports or fink

903306
put	get
to put it above all and check how many pixels you need to position your button so that it does not get above the tabs

903334
super	self
to the current one but forgot that with super self is passed implicitly

903345
extjs	gxt
extjs has debug console but i was not able to find something similar for gxt

903384
division	subtract
i just remember the performance counter of when my program started and subtract this from the current counter before converting to double and doing the division

903433
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i ve tryed to add clientaccesspolicy.xml and crossdomain.xml to

903435
inherited	properties
the problem here is that static members are properties of the class itself rather than of individual objects while virtual declarations and inherited are about handling individual objects that may not be of the same class uniformly at a higher level of abstraction

903472
post	get
i need to log all post and get requests on web site in the database

903548
bitarray	bitvector
why is the bitvector 32 structure more efficient than bitarray

903553
inherited	subclassing
if all of your classes are subclassing of loggable you ll inherited this identification function in all classes

903566
int	boolean
bitvector32 is more efficient than bitarray for boolean values and small int that are used internally

903576
hide	show
this code hide and show a div in a td using jquery ui s toggle function same result with the show and hide functions

903579
int	boolean
bitvector32 is more efficient than bitarray for boolean values and small int that are used internally

903595
folder	directory
the problem is that the build process takes a very long time because the deployment process copies my images folder to the deployment directory

903633
folder	directory
register the folder as a virtual directory in iis

903659
background-image	background-color
what i am trying to do is to show both background-color and background-image so that half of my div will cover the right shadow background image and the other left part will cover the background color

903726
hide	show
using slidetoggle instead of toggle or hide show actually solved the problem

903768
background-image	background-color
you set the background-color and background-image styles

903768
background-repeat	background-position
if the image is smaller than the element you need to use the background-position style to place it to the right and to keep it from repeating and covering the entire background you use the background-repeat style

903804
google-chrome	safari
gives a dashed line in google-chrome 2 safari 4b but loses the line break which unless anyone can come up with a way to reintroduce that makes it less than useless

903804
google-chrome	safari
ie8 test google-chrome safari test and another

903808
uiview	subviews
i call -release on the uiview that contain the uiimageviews as subviews

903816
bash	zsh
shell independent occurs with bash and zsh

903834
fflush	gets
sounds like a good application for a memory-mapped file since you can control when your in-memory view gets fflush back to the file on disk

903842
onresize	onmouseup	onresize	onscroll	onmouseup	onscroll
catch mouse-drag and viewport events onmouseup onresize onscroll

903864
execvp	fork
before this i create a fork of the current process and i call the execvp in that child process right after that i call exit 0

903893
notepad++	jedit	emacs	jedit
i ve tried slickedit notepad++ emacs jedit and visual studio

903893
emacs	jedit
jedit is probably the best gui cross-platform editor almost-ide and emacs is probably the best terminal cross-platform editor almost-ide

903910
int	boolean
methods that take boolean just as it does int and so on

903933
chm	winhelp
use chm files instead of pretty much deprecated winhelp files

903955
inherited	properties
when you call a function this way this is initialized to a new object that inherited methods and properties from your function s prototype properties

903990
google-chrome	firefox
however for some reason there s a small gap at the right end of the bar in firefox and google-chrome

904001
post	get
in web work i have done with other technologies i only ever used get and post methods

904009
ssl	https
authentication should ideally be left to the webserver as spliff recommends and ssl https is generally good for that

904013
post	get
in practice though most browsers only support http get and post

904013
put	get	post	put	post	get
rails uses some trickery in html forms to act as though a put or delete request was sent even though rails is still using get or post for these methods

904015
post	get
http has supported verbs other than get post forever but the way soap evolved kinda twisted the original meaning of those verbs

904022
jobs	cron
i was previously using dapper drake with these cron jobs in the etc crontab file directly and when i upgraded to hardy i moved them to user-specific crontabs via sudo crontab -e - u mongrel_appnamegoeshere which was the point where they appear to have stopped working.

904082
quicksort	mergesort
for example a sorting algorithm like quicksort or mergesort really only needs to know one thing about the things it s sorting how to compare them

904140
filesystems	fat
fat simply uses a single file allocation table which is effectively a gigantic series of linked lists and many modern filesystems use extents

904143
vbscript	jscript
it is possible to call these from vbscript and jscript

904155
gif	png
and there are various image file formats jpeg png gif

904166
children	parent
perhaps this explains why the counter cache was not updating but i m still not sure why the parent would not be able to find its children

904203
vbscript	jscript
4 vbscript jscript allows me to use either dao or ado

904220
pull	push
automate and push don t pull useful info

904229
gentoo	linux
the gentoo linux distribution does just that

904313
vbscript	jscript
for what its worth you could use either jscript or vbscript

904358
hash	md5
even if you do an md5 hash in javascript this does not help because it is trivial to submit the hash to the login page and the hash effectively becomes the password

904397
post	get
you re seeing it for your site and not for others because livehttpheaders shows the url for get requests but doesn t show the content for post requests

904397
post	get
sending login information through get requests is a minor extra security hole over sending them post in that the urls for get requests are often logged in various places whereas almost no one logs post content

904397
post	get
however as others have pointed out unless you re using https for login data is going across the network in plain text whether you use get or post

904397
post	get
still as an intermediate measure i would change your app to send username and password stuff as a post not a get so that you don t end up storing usernames and passwords in your webserver logs - it s no use using https over the wire if you re doing something that then writes the username and password to an insufficiently protected logfile on the server

904402
cvs	svn
as for the mercurial side the recommendation is also to refactor large legacy cvs svn repositories into smaller components

904420
onkeyup	onkeydown
my advice is to use onkeyup and onkeydown

904448
ubuntu	linux
this can be done on an ubuntu linux distro according to a howto that i wrote at

904526
int	boolean
just wrap the float boolean int or similar in an nsnumber

904543
min	max
a couple of advantages of this proc are that you can specify multiple summary functions like max corder min corder etc

904550
uiview	subviews
i have an uiview that acts as an grouping for some subviews

904598
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
if you prefer opensource you could also look into sharpdevelop c# and boo and or monodevelop c# but better for linux multiplatform not so great for just windows imho but yout mileage may vary

904600
for-loop	loops
the enhanced for-loop is based on the iterable interface which it uses to obtain an iterator which is then used for loops

904645
post	get
i can t post a link since i am new user but if you google for binarymission you will get there

904668
folder	directory
child directory solution folder which are logical collections of projects

904709
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
if you need to access the db sequentially let s say you do a select then another select and then an update you may reuse the connection i mean the same sqlconnection instance but if you need to access the db while reading from a sqldatareader then you ll need 2 different connections

904715
haskell	sml	haskell	ocaml	ocaml	sml
haskell actually does this but in languages like f# and ocaml and sml which have unrestricted side-effects this is a bad idea because it might reorder the side-effects too

904728
for-loop	arrays
after you get it sorted you can create the last arrays in another for-loop

904734
superclass	subclassing
then make you re domain entity a subclassing of this superclass with the additional persistable fields

904759
uiview	subviews
as i clicked on subviews that were drawing outside the bounds of their superview the uiview no touch events where received on these subviews

904780
put	get
i m trying to get the result in and put it in a progress meaning 140 1058 100 bar on my application the second value 1058 is actually ulong type in my application but that doesn t seem to be the problem

904792
width	height
although i don t really need to specify the width and height here because i can access these through the stage variable

904792
width	height
the scene width and height updates when the stage width and height changes

904792
width	height
i ve found that the canvaswidth will update a lot better when bound to the scene width and height rather than to the var width and height which only update once the resize is complete

904807
width	height	wordpress	expressionengine
i m trying to put my old wordpress powered site into expressionengine just for giggles and i m stuck with my project layout i want a grid of my projects each a div with a set height width

904848
post	get
i think that the first request the browser sends is often a head request and not a get or post

904861
int	chars
d is a format chars that insert a signed int decimal m has no such meaning

904897
mantis	bugzilla	trac	mantis	trac	bugzilla
among the regulars are bugzilla mantis and trac

904907
springsource	grails
the springsource tool suite sts provides grails integration

904919
post	get
not sure if you can mix get and post type requests

904949
int	double

908168
filewriter	bufferedwriter
in a java program java 1.5 i have a bufferedwriter that wraps a filewriter and i call write many many times.

908232
iboutlet	ibaction
the pattern i try to stick with is making the controller in code adding iboutlet and ibaction for the things in the xib nib that interact with that code and a thing in the controller s constructor which loads the xib nib with self as the owner and in ib i connect stuff to the file s owner placeholder whose identity i will have specified to be the my controller s class

yes document.write is bad it blocks additional loading any js executing before your pages has finished loading basically requires all other processing to stop -- modern browsers like safari and by proxy google-chrome and firefox do a degree of content preloading in order to prevents loads from blocking but subsequent style resolution etc is largely blocked

908571
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
oh for animations you should look at css animations and they perform much better than any js implementations but they re only present in safari and by proxy google-chrome and firefox 3.5 -- definitely not in ie -

908571
getter	setter
in terms of javascript performance avoid with and getter setter like the plague and you should be fine in most modern js implementations

the extension methods .skip and .take are available on all iqueryable t and ienumerable t objects along with a whole bunch of others

909069
ilist	iqueryable	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	iqueryable
this would require that you change your domain somewhat and start passing iqueryable t or ienumerable t around in place of ilist t and only convert to an ilist t at your higher-level publicly facing services

909077
google-chrome	firefox
however flash player plugin for firefox google-chrome etc has a bug which breaks usage of international characters when its using wmode for the html embed

it s perfectly ok to have multiple browsers of different types installed on the same machine such as ie8 firefox 3 and google-chrome all at once

910208
folder	directory

this is because the temporary asp.net files gets written to this temporary folder first before being moved to the asp.net temporary internet files directory

910292
kerberos	ntlm

910305
uiview	subviews
i also tried to put a uiview as subviews there

910358

i would declare that grosswage is a property and synthesize the getter and setter

910368
google-chrome	firefox
there is no such problem in ie6 ie7 firefox or google-chrome

910400
for-loop	arrays
the idea not sure how good or bad this is is right now is to do a for-loop through all the excel.area selected fields and add the content of that field to the multi dimensional arrays

910425
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
we have the touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended methods for this purpose

910459
folder	directory
lately i ve noticed that this file shows up in several different places so my first thought was of course to always set the current working directory to the folder i want the log to show up in and this works fine

910462
int	double
so if you are converting a double to an int the number is within the range of int and the required rounding-up is toward zero then it is enough to simply cast the number to int

910487
versioning	upgrade
i have recently upgrade my asp.net mvc application from beta to versioning 1

910505
profiling	debugging
if you use the sql server query profiling you can still see the exact sql that is run on the database so you re not really losing anything in terms of debugging your sql statements either

910518
width	height
but i want to access not only the screen width and height but the appearance settings also

910522
persistent	transient
the thumbnailimage field is marked as transient so only the original image is serialized rather than persistent both the original image and the thumbnail image

910557
bmp	png
assuming that you are loading bitmap images which includes bmp jpeg png etc

width	height
since wpf triggers only check equality we need a converter to compare two values - in this case our actual pixel height width and the pixel height width we ve determined makes an image low resolution - and return a true false value we can trigger on

910557
width	height
then when an image is loaded the rectangle s style checks its triggers to see if the image has a height or width that is less than 100px

910563
width	height
as far as the width height unless your running your silverlight app in fullscreen what should be more important is the browser window width height as that will not always be the same size as the screen itself

910563
width	height
you should be able to google for code for how to get the browser window width height rather easily

910583
google-chrome	firefox
the table renders differently in firefox from ie8 google-chrome

910596
put	get
the simplest way to get the modularity you seek is to put those portions of controller code into separate methods set_up_graph1_data set_up_graph2_data etc. which you simply call from your index action to set up the variables for the view

910617
hash	md5
i need to hash md5 all the password in our sql server 2000 database

910617
hash	md5
i can easily generate a c# vb.net program to convert hash all the passwords but i was wondering more for my education than for a real compelling need if it was possible to calculate md5 hash directly in t-sql

910650
hash	md5
no there is no native tsql command to generate md5 hash s in sql server 2000

910690
mouseleave	mouseenter
another thing that i usually do is that i hook up event handler for the mouseenter and mouseleave events for the splitter control and add this code there

regarding offering a final mp3 to the user you will need something else because these 2 tools only record to flv format due to the licenses needed to encode mp3s

911264
exponent	modulo
admitedly the documentation isn t explicit but i would venture that you can just send the modulo and exponent components to any other rsa engine in order to reconstitute the public key

911366

911526
free	malloc
you can t free file it wasn t allocated by malloc

911538
free	malloc
you shouldn t use free f as the memory is not allocated by malloc

911538
free	malloc
otherwise i think the thumbrule would be for every malloc call free explicitely

911539
free	malloc
in general only free pointers that were allocated directly by malloc

911553
int	chars
the language types string int chars are simply aliases for the clr types system.string system.int32 system.char

911553
int	chars
personally i tend to choose the c# language types int string chars etc because they involve less typing - i suppose i m just lazy

wxpython	pyqt
one marked advantage of matplotlib is that you can integrate it with python guis wxpython and pyqt at least and create gui application with nice plots

911766
pull	push
the greatest advantage of jms is that it uses the push method the server notify new messages rather than the pull method the clients keep asking for new messages each x milliseconds

911781

912288
memcached	ncache
i have seen another commercial option in the form of ncache but memcached seems perfectly acceptable to me and apparently is used on facebook myspace etc.

912288
sorting	filtering
if i where to sort the items descending then items 1-10 would be different products so i would not want to store the actual objects each time the paged data sorting filtering changed but instead stored the ids of the objects so i could then perform a trabsactional lookup in the databse if some of them do not already exist in the cache or are invalid

912294
addition	multiplication
your best bet is the multiplication by 10 and addition of the value

912319

913108
pull	push
this can t happen when you push only when you pull confusingly pull isn t quite the opposite of push fetch is the opposite of push- a pull is a fetch followed by a merge or a rebase

913108
pull	push
so if you re in this situation whoever is trying to push their changes first needs to pull back from the updated origin master merge or rebase their version of master and then push

913108
pull	push
or the two of them could cooperate beforehand one of them pull the other s changes do the merge and then push the result

915653
affinity	processors
though i agree completely with brian here i can t see the benefit in running a java app as a separate process when you should be able to just run it in the original jvm barring some really unusual environmental stuff such as setting niceness or processors affinity of the various processes

915659
folder	directory
different apps can use different templates as common practice these days are to place template directory in respective app folder

917304
easymock	jmock
after using both jmock and easymock i have to say that easymock s api is about 10x easier to use and since the interface is mostly statically-typed it s refactoring safe as well you are using strings for method names etc.

basic sin cos stuff isn t slowing down the app

918741
nsstring	nsobject
every objective-c class like nsstring nsobject nsview etc

918741
cfstring	nsstring
cfstring and cfstringref are interchangeable with nsstring this is called toll-free bridging although the compiler will probably appreciate it if you cast it first

918744
getter	setter
a straightforward solution that is good enough is to create sort of a valuebox class with a single value field and a getter and setter

918744
getter	setter
the anonymous class will use its getter and setter to write read

918747
hide	show
you would then hide or show the frames based on which one you want to be active

918796
integer	unsigned
an unsigned integer type is size_t

918796
integer	unsigned
so the size of size_t is not specified only that it has to be an unsigned integer type

918825
vtk	itk
if you don t already have a lot of code in matlab i m guessing you d have a much easier time seamlessly integrating vtk itk with python s numpy matplotlib etc

918946
opera	google-chrome
i don t actually know that the script isn t working in opera google-chrome but nothing happens

918966
getter	setter
i agree that disposability could have been elevated out of the pattern world and into the c# language proper as we did with say property getter and setter which are standardizations of the pattern of having getter and setter methods or events which standardize the idea of storing a delegate and calling it when something interesting happens.

918966
filtering	grouping
linq for example moves the concepts of filtering projecting joining grouping and ordering data into the language proper which adds a lot of expressive power to the language

919638
arp	tcp
if the remote address of the google web server was locally cached in dns and the arp nd6 cache contains an entry for the ipv4 ipv6 address respectively of a default router then the first transmitted packet will be a tcp syn packet sourced from the interface address attached to the router and destined for the cached remote ipv4 ipv6 address

919638
tunnel	packets
alternatively the default router could be reachable over some kind of layer-2 or layer-3 tunnel in which case the syn packets will be appropriately encapsulated

919638
subnet	packets
if the first dns resolving server address in the resolver configuration is in one of the local ipv4 subnet ranges or in a locally attached ipv6 prefix with the l 1 bit set in the router advertisement and the arp nd6 cache already contains an entry for the address in question then the first packets the host will send is a direct dns query for either an a record or a aaaa record matching the first fully-qualified domain name in the domain search list

919707
hide	show
now here is the problem this inserted content inside this div with id childparent8351 wont respond to the hide show toggle only in ie v6 v7 and v8

something to be careful about when designing a restful api is the conflation of get and post as if they were the same thing

920181
flask	web.py	web.py	bottle	bottle	flask
some frameworks that get it right are web.py flask and bottle

920181

i have getter setter in my action class

920206
put	get
if i put alert point in i get the longitute and latitude

920208
children	parent
in com circular references are tricky because if you were the set the container and all its children to nothing then objects will not be cleaned up properly as the children still hold references to the parent

920242
gridview	datalist
i am struggling to find the template sample or datalist view or gridview that shows a sample of how to lay that out properly

920282

i am redirecting users to https using a httpmodule for selected pages what i don t want is to force users to use ssl if for some reason there browser proxy etc does not support it

920340
translation	localization
currentculture.currentuiculture has to do with localization that is translation

920384
hide	show
it correctly hide upon load but i cannot get it to show again

920410
integer	unsigned
it seems you want to store the cast function that takes a void and produces an unsigned integer

920445
mp3	wav	mp3	aiff	wav	aiff
if you are using audio files you could consider using mp3 instead of aiff or wav at the possible price of a slightly higher processing overhead

920447
int	double
sounds like you might be able to use the built-in functions int.tryparse string out int or double.tryparse string out double which both return a bool but in any case go for ck s suggestion

920453
ienumerable	ilist
make entity implement an interface ientity and make entitycontainer hold a ilist and unless you have a very specific reason for using ilist you should considere ienumerable it would make it easy for the consumer of the entityclass you use

920465
bindparam	pdostatement
bool pdostatement bindparam mixed parameter mixed variable int data_type int length mixed driver_options

920470
post	get
here are some examples to get you going which i copied from this blog post

920485
libc	ldd
i tried putting the libc from the first machine into the directory of the binary on the second machine but the linker as i found using ldd still loads from the standard path lib tls libc.so.6

920501
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
2.use getelementbyid getelementsbytagname or getelementsbytagname instead of relying on position in the dom

920543
httphandler	httpmodule
the breaking change for ajax.net professional is that you have to move the httphandler and httpmodule if used to a new section system.webserver and rename httphandler to handler

920556
disk	ram
or perhaps exposing that array as a file that is actually stored in memory like a ram disk i guess

920625
ienumerable	ilist
in a response to this question runefs suggested that unless you have a very specific reason for using ilist you should considere ienumerable

920645
for-loop	loops
i am finding problems in when i should use a while loops or a for-loop in python

920673
ienumerable	ilist
basically if you re defining a method for external consumption then the parameters should be the most basic type that gives you the functionality you require - in the case of your example this may mean taking in an ienumerable instead of an ilist

920673
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
on the other hand if you are exposing a property for external consumption then do so with the most complex type ilist or icollection instead of ienumerable since this gives the client the most flexibility in the way they use the object

920819
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in my tests this works fine in ie firefox and opera but produces the bug you mention in google-chrome and safari

920830
portrait	landscape
before when i was taking a picture in the landscape mode the picture in the preview when the buttons retake and use photo were present was always automatically rotated so as to appear correctly in the portrait mode

920899
integer	fractions
for example for number 1.33334 my function gives me string 133334 and set up special integer variable decimal_part in this example will be 1 which means in decimal part only 1 symbol everything else is a fractions

920915
public	protected
if you push the include of a type that is in your public or protected interface outside of the header you will be creating dependencies on the order of includes

920918
folder	directory
i noticed it had a program files directory right on the iso so i just copied the folder onto my hard drive

920947
firefox	safari
the issue is that nothing renders in ie 6 7 but ie8 firefox and safari are all fine

you could also use not exists or subqueries with min and max instead of the left outer joins on yc_bot2 and yc_top2 if you wanted to do that

921003
width	height
the image is a bitmap and is sized at 500 width and 250 height

921003
width	height
this however only changed the resolution tag for the image and did not properly according to my third party technical contact adjust the image height and width

921003
width	height
i thought that i could just increment resolution without having to increment height or width

921039
lwjgl	jogl
i am making a java app that will use jogl lwjgl to access opengl

921086
hide	show
use the option kieveli suggested and show and hide the subreports depending on the user s choice if you want a more dynamic solution

921161
hide	show
the hacky version is to show a fake form field in its place that looks like it s disabled grayed out style and onclick hide it and show the correct field enabled but that s ugly

921166
mouseup	mousedown
if i recall correctly mousedown event doesn t happen until the mouseup happens at which point both fire

921172
ant	maven
although these packages were written for maven and ant specifically with some work you can adapt them to just about anything

921277
pull	push
on the same server you can either push or pull data from the official repository of the master data and insert any new rows update any changed rows

921334
put	get
there are lots of variables that need to get passed around in the program i m writing and from my previous question i understand that i should put these variables into classes and then pass around the classes

921338
google-chrome	safari
on gecko-based browsers works but on webkit ones safari and google-chrome when i click the select box an empty drop-down box is shown before the ajax request and after the response the drop-down box is not refreshed

921380
jar	war
it has webapps packaged as war which depend on components packaged as jar files

921380

p.s. i do not want to embed the webkit or gecko renderengine into my application

921491
firebird	pervasive
i can t speak to some of the other less-enterprise databases out there sqlite firebird pervasive but i expect that all databases will perform these steps when they parse the sql statements into database operations

921501
try-catch	exception-handling
usually that is due to the ide offering a helpful quick fix that wraps the offending code in a try-catch block with that exception-handling handling

921521
pull	push
note that this creates a new repository foo and you cannot push pull between your-big-repo and foo

921543

921588
children	parent
not sure if leaf node is still proper terminology since it s not really a tree each node can have multiple children and also multiple parent and also i m actually trying to find all the root nodes which is really just a matter of semantics if you reverse the direction of all the edges it d they d be leaf nodes

921588
children	parent
each node has a list of it s children and it s parent

921658
nstimer	nsrunloop
ok i ve read the articles about why it s a better idea to use an nsrunloop instead of an nstimer call to run a game loop and maintain a nice frame rate

921679
children	parent
so long as the nodes in general have more parent than children this direction will be much faster

921687
ord	chr
also you don t need some conversions ord and chr

921747
put	get
as a general suggestion throw in some memory get a velociraptor put only sources and build directory there measure again

921765
gridview	datalist
for displaying a list of things repeaters are typically faster than gridview datalist and their other counterparts

921770
put	get
is there something i need to put into either the parent or sub class to get it to run

921809

fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout	hide	fadeout	hide	show
and i use the jquery method fadein and fadeout to show and hide it

921815
sorting	filtering
my way of doing this was to first query the tablerows table - for filtering i then filtering out the rows who s columns did not match the criteria and for sorting i sorted the rowids based on their column s content as specified by the sorting specified

921834
width	height
use width height and position or offset

921851
width	height
but for height and width you are better off using height and width functions

921893
tabcontrol	tabitem
i don t know how to block a tabitem because there is no dependencyobject command in the tabcontrol to tie into do i need to roll my own tabcontrol and build an icommand around the selectionchanged event

921939
implements	extends
yes it is but dbconnection itself extends and implements component idbconnection idisposable

921947
children	parent
you can represent each node with a reference to its parent and then join against the parent to get the children back out

921985
opera	google-chrome
i ve tested in ie8 ie7 ie6 ff3 google-chrome and opera

922055
metaphone	soundex
in addition to the other good info here you might want to consider using the double metaphone phonetic algorithm which is much superior to soundex

922094
put	get
then in the sql that tests validity if something could be put in that would fail if the connection is in the dbms_flashback enabled mode that should get jboss to discard the connection

922121
put	get	post	put	post	get
you can replace put with get post delete or whatever

922128
width	height
let s say i have a size class which has height and width properties in reality the class is a bit more complex than this but size makes a good example

922128
width	height
i want to display this as width x height in my ui

922128
width	height
the obvious way to do this is to bind to a dimensions property which is dependent on width and height

922138
jar	war
i m having a hard time to make my maven2 multi module project with a deep project structure appear as a single ear with its dependencies - which includes 1 war 2 ejbs and 1 jar to be deployed in my jboss 5 server inside my eclipse ganymede tab servers

922138
jar	war
my project has 1 war 2 ejbs and 1 jar that must be packaged inside an ear each of the subprojects is a separate module

boost	stl
both work pretty much the same way in boost and stl contexts

922429
width	height
the source buffer is the size of the image data width height

922429
width	height
it s close - i m finding if height is greater than width the left position of the rotated image is incorrect

922429
width	height
similarly if width is greater than height the top position of the rotated image is incorrect

922457
width	height
if want to display this composite value as a string then bind display pattern 1 of a text field to the width property and display pattern 2 shown when you bind display pattern 1 to the height property

922457
width	height
this will give a text field that displays width x height and will update on changes in either property

922457
width	height
the downside of this method is that the text field will not be able to edit the bound width and height values

922533
treemap	treeset	comparator	comparable
for cases where your keys are a complex type that doesn t implement comparable or you don t want to use the natural order then treemap and treeset have additional constructors that let you pass in a comparator

daemons	systemd
your systemd may have a start-stop-daemon script and for c code it may also have a daemons 3 call in the c library

923730
post	get
rest only makes sense by using it fully but as to convincing you to actually stretch your brain a bit further and do something clever i can only dare you to cut through the fud that it s all about rpc only get and post necessary you don t need it all equivalent to json soap and other ilk etc. and be smarter about how you make applications

923764
hide	show
routing hide you application structure and makes you think more of your urls as path to the content that you want to show opposed to the path to some page with params

923857
put	get
or you could get a little smarter put some first names in column a and some surnames in column b

923954

if all the data is in the view the filtering and sorting can be contained within the view

924017

925387
submit	submission
this doesn t really fall under the remit of your question since here the submit button is unambiguous but i thought i d include it for people who read the first part and wonder how to make a submit button successful via js form submission

925387
submit	submission
the specs don t say anything about submission a form using the enter key while in a text entry field if you tab to a button and activate it using space or whatever then there s no problem as that specific submit button is unambiguously used

both can be obtained through other tools such as r# testdriven.net ncover etc but it all adds to both the cost and the complexity

925532
post	get
some options i considered were to send the query parameters via post instead of get but this is often not interchangeable on the server side and the clients will treat this differently in that the url can t then appear in a hyperlink or be bookmarked or entered manually and if the user wants to refresh they ll get the send information again warning which makes sense since post is meant to update information on the remote server and it ll only work if it s the query string pushing it beyond the limit rather than some ungodly url

925587

925685
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you can limit your users to ie8 google-chrome safari and firefox then you can probably get away with css2 otherwise you re going to have to learn all the differences with css1 along with the myriad broken things - especially in ie5 and 6

926004
maven	pom.xml
what happens is that maven is unable to locate a number of resources that are included as dependencies in the rampart pom.xml files note that the rampart pom.xml files are downloaded automatically by maven so i wasn t supposed to edit those files

926033

i could write a recursive function to jump from a parent to all the children but i d like a way to do it in one query

926349
mouse	keyboard
a shared remote desktop connection where multiple users are in control of the keyboard and mouse is a step in the right direction

926366
disk	ram
the advantage of an in memory golden copy such as the one you propose is that it never has to read from disk when a request comes in and if you host it on the same machine as your iis provided you have enough ram for both there is no extra network hop making it much faster that querying a db

926404
getter	setter
or is this not necessary since you should always assume something isn t copied when calling a setter getter

this appears to me to be ie and firefox putting the float outside or underneath each li instead of inside where it should be like google-chrome

926994
google-chrome	firefox
if i adjust the position -14px up for ie and firefox it works fine for them but then google-chrome is messed up

firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
you prolly know how to test out firefox opera safari with without scripting

927980
bazaar	git
newer distributed source control systems like git bazaar and mercurial aka hg all tend to be better at detecting broad changes done in the file system such as moving directories renaming files and even replacing large chunks of the file system

927980
bazaar	svn
from my reading bazaar and mercurial were essentially built from the ground up to handle this sort of free-form editing specifically because of how explicit svn required you to be

i m playing with python class inherited and ran into a problem where the inherited __init__ is not being executed if called from the subclassing code below the result i get from active python is

928013

928099
whiptail	ncurses
you could use dialog that is ncurses based or whiptail that is slang based

928109
daemons	systemd	perforce	cvs

928370
x86	64bit
the vm does all this with a single short instruction possibly one or two bytes instead of 4 or 8 bytes per instruction in machine language depending on 32 or 64bit architecture which guessing should mean around 16 or 32 bytes of x86 for 1-2 bytes of machine code

928389
union	distinct
insert b col1 select distinct col1 from a union select distinct col2 from a

928395

929014
width	height
i know exactly where i want to position my uilabel in a uiview but i don t necessarily know what height width i want it to have at compile time so setting a width height in initwithframe is useless

929014
width	height
i want to be able to just init its x y point and then use something like mylabel sizetofit so it can automagically set the width height based on my break mode and content

929014

929128
getattr	subclassing
once you have somehow identified a child class of interest maybe all of them if you want instances of all child subclassing etc getattr parentclass s_set childclass.__name__ should help if the child class s name is foo this is just like accessing parentclass.foo_set -- no more no less

929184
versioning	upgrade
see this wordpress artice which advices not publishing the wordpress versioning you re using due to the multitude of past vulnerabilities and the fact that people are very slow to upgrade

929229
post	get
for example that the web service responds to get requests as opposed to post or other http verbs

929250
tolower	toupper
using unicode-aware tolower toupper -type functions is the better way to go

929251
selecteditem	selectedindex
if no item is selected selectedindex is -1 and selecteditem is null

929259
prepare	execute
you can use the prepare feature to execute dynamic sql

929332
getter	setter
in this case you could implement setter and getter functions which will operate on a matrix like so

929357
width	height
of course you can change the flt_max to constrain to a specific width or height

929360
imagemagick	magick++
it relies on the magick++ imagemagick api for most of its image handling

929367
post	get
i ve written a blog post that uses some basic codedom that may help those wanting to get started with it

929389
width	margin
as i understand width padding margin properties only work on block level elements

929409
post	get
i seem to have a problem with getting mvc to fill in my custom model parameter when called through get instead of post

929413
width	height
this allows you to specify width height and other block-specific properties without the need to break the flow of inline elements

929444
put	get
you might want to put that off until you get some entries which don t match any of the normal letters.

929457
toolchain	binutils
all of these produce a resource script and you should have a resource compiler in your toolchain rc.exe for visual studio including the express editions or available as part of the sdk or windres as part of the binutils in cygwin or mingw

929475
libtiff	freetype
of course you could also use some combo of freetype and libtiff but you ll have to build those libs for win32

929481
qcodo	qcubed
i ve been using qcodo for 2 years and now i m with qcubed

929481
qcodo	qcubed
remember that qcubed is now growing in acceptance and it s good for all qcodo s community

929482
serializable	deserialization
in both serializable and deserialization there are callback points where you can execute additional code to fix-up objects for deserialization

929489
put	get
you should put field nonserializable attribute on events so event handlers don t get serialized too

929536
ubuntu	linux
but ubuntu is not the only linux distribution that uses this method

929548
emacs	aquamacs
there is also aquamacs and carbon emacs for an emacs-flavoured mac editing experience

929548
emacs	aquamacs
carbon emacs is closer to the unix emacs experience whereas the aquamacs people have put considerable effort into os x integration

929568
rpm	yum
then it s a matter of using apt yum rpm windows msi or whatever to deploy a given version

929590
opera	firefox
we just have to wait for it a but since it will be available only in firefox 3.5 and opera 10

929656
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
i just loaded a visual web developer â express edition to help my development and this after two hours of installation time it appears that it gave me an upgrade to my iis to versioning 7 without notifying me if i wanted to load that

929660
curb	libcurl
curb and libcurl multi provide libcurl bindings for ruby

929679
versioning	upgrade
if you have anything below proffessional you probably got upgrade to ii6 and not ii7 - there is no ii7 for lesser versioning

929725
for-loop	loops
we may never enter the for-loop at all or if we do enter it the compiler can t be sure that we reach a return statement before we leave loops

929739
onkeyup	onkeydown
use onkeydown and or onkeyup for the other keys

929864
jms	jta
atomikos is the inventor of java ee without application server so if any open source jta xa does well in java se then it must be transactionsessentials it was designed for java se right from the start and includes jdbc and jms connectors pools so you don t need any application server functionality

929885
hash	md5
now a days md5 hash or any other hash for that matter are pre computed for all possible strings and stored for easy access

929885
hash	md5
though in theory md5 is not reversible but using such databases you may find out which text resulted in a particular hash value

929903
jms	jta
consequently it offers premium jdbc and jms pools as well as jta xa functionality and you will find it very easy to integrate into your applications

929904
libcurl	typhoeus
if you like it less low-level there is also typhoeus which is built on top of libcurl multi

929919
range	minimum
i woul define unwanted vibration or shocks as acceleration values that change very fast by an large interval of values or an permanently changing accumulated value that does not exceed an specified treshold range in an specified minimum period of time

930006
multiplying	add
this means that counting the frequencies of words that aren t in both sets is a waste of time - we multiplying the frequency by zero and that will add nothing to the score

930065
free	malloc
i think if you define a malloc and free in your own .c file included in the project the linker will resolve that version

930079
formview	detailsview
your choices are the formview or detailsview controls

930079
formview	detailsview
the primary difference between them is that detailsview does all the work for you whereas formview requires you to create your own templates thus allowing greater control

930081
prepare	execute
so you ll have to execute your drop table statement first and then prepare and execute the create table statement separately

930096
int	chars
another reads a single chars returning an int which will be -1 if you ve reached the end of the reader

930174
uitableview	nsindexpath
you can iterate through the button s superview hierarchy until you find a uitableviewcell then call - nsindexpath indexpathforcell uitableviewcell cell on the uitableview

930174
uitableview	nsindexpath
the event delegate can then call - nsindexpath indexpathforcell uitableviewcell cell on the uitableview to get the index path

930183
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython and ironruby do let you leverage all of your .net experience and codebase they don t answer your objection to learning new languages however

930197
inherited	subclassing
if you have an inherited form or any class for that matter you would be able to invoke this function from within the subclassing

930210
cvs	svn
i have just started to use svn for version control but there always is a lot of talk going on about version control system like git mercurial svn cvs etc

930215
cvs	svn
the centralized svn cvs etc. versus distributed git mercurial etc. repository is a fundamental difference that reflects the way your development team operates

930217
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	cvs	svn
distributed version control systems dvcss like git mercurial and bazaar do collectively have advantages in flexibility of workflow and operation compared to centralized cvss such as svn or cvs

930217
bazaar	git
on a horses for courses basis you might pragmatically pick hg mercurial if you re going to be using code.google.com bazaar if you re going to use launchpad git if you re going to use github for example

930264
wordpress	joomla
basically i m in the midst of creating a website where users can search for and buy website layouts wordpress joomla themes etc

930281
atomikos	bitronix
i ve elected to use the bitronix transaction manager to solve this problem although apparently there s at least one other option that wasn t apparent to me at the time atomikos

930336
put	get
you have to actually put statements in the if blocks to get it to step in

930359
width	height
with the colorbox plugin that you are using you can specify the width height of the dynamic image

930368
disk	ram
more ram more disk more cpus

930471
accessor	properties	getter	setter
where the intended implementation language s support properties it s perfectly correct to use them in your interface s as well of course you d have to stick to getter setter accessor if your intended target was a language that s lacking in support for properties

930512
width	height
if possible i would like a border for the user to stretch to edit the width and height

930578
post	get
but what happens is that it doesnt even get to that action coz is nothing in the post

930578
put	get
i know i could put something in the session and check for it in the get action of the guestbook but i wanted to check if someone could come up with a better solution

930583
kde	gnome
kde or gnome - it s like deciding which fat girl you want to date

930604
post	get
in particular try to understand datatypes server settings like timeouts post versus get etc. security and database interactions as they exist beyond javascript ecmascript

930673
folder	directory
it doesn t run the tests in the regular output bin folder and it doesn t respect the project s file inclusions copy to output directory

930734
vbscript	jscript
internet explorer supports pluggable scripting languages although the only one reliably included with ie besides jscript is vbscript

930742
versioning	upgrade
i got a segmentation fault error i googled and some say upgrade to latest versioning of ruby

930752
versioning	upgrade
well based on your own question i d say upgrade to the latest versioning of ruby

930761
queue	fifo
using single-writer single-reader fifo or queue

930766
implements	extends
i m working on some effects and things to get a handle on classes implements extends

930766
implements	extends
the second class mooslidesfx.elements extends mooslidesfx to likewise be implements but rather than just animate the element passed in it will animate it s children in order not looking for a lesson chain right now but it s next on my list

930850
post	get
i would like to get your opinion about whether or not this kind of layout can work on a site like this many categories browsing searching post reading description etc

930856
public	protected
same for public protected private public first so everything that can be used from other files is quickly visible when opening the file

930866
cvs	svn
in the long term it would be cool if such a script would support different types of backends cvs svn or git or at least be implemented generically enough so that it is easily extendsible

930869
put	get
ok so i am going to put this solution out that will get you started but please note that this is only a rudimentary implementation of a mediator pattern

930892
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however i tried this in plain old javascript and it worked just fine in ie firefox safari and google-chrome

930892
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
edit the following works in firefox safari and google-chrome when using window.load

930958
uilabel	nsstring
you can t assign a joke object to a uilabel s text propertyâ it takes nsstring only

930982
ironruby	ironpython
with silverlight 2 you can run client-side code you ve written in c# ironpython ironruby vb.net etc

930988
freebsd	linux
as a computer science student you simply couldn t be that interested in software or how computers work without becoming a linux user even better if you go with freebsd or something else

931022
vbscript	jscript	ironruby	ironpython
as already said you have flash actionscript which is a derived language from javascript and silverlight moonlight ironpython ironruby jscript vbscript c# that can run in the browser via plugins the first one being much more ubiquitous

931030
post	get	webclient	webrequest
you can continue using webclient to post instead of get which is the http verb you re currently using with downloadstring but i think you ll find it easier to work with the slightly lower-level classes webrequest and webresponse

931030
post	get
there are two parts to this - the first is to post the login form the second is recovering the set-cookie header and sending that back to the server as cookie along with your get request

931034
post	get
the problem is self.redirect cannot carry along the payload of a post http request so from a post method the redirection to the login-url c is going to misbehave in fact i believe the login url will use get to continue when it s done and that there s no way to ask it to do a post instead

931034
post	get
if you don t want to stash that post payload around somewhere session or otherwise you can make your code work by changing the def post in your snippet above to def get and of course the in the html written in other parts of the example that you haven t snipped to

931098
versioning	upgrade
so unless you upgrade your os it will remain the old versioning

931161
bazaar	svn	tortoisegit	svn
because switching to tortoisegit bazaar hg you will not be able to access svn repositories

931176
lisp	scheme
you may just find out that you ll learn the other later also happened to me -- i had to learn more scheme after one year studying common lisp

931176
lisp	scheme
so it was either scheme or common lisp to me

931187
rss	feed
pipe that attempts to transform an html page into rss but the resulting feed contains no items

931197
lisp	scheme
cs teachers at colleges and universities today particularly the young ones were educated using java c and c++ and they probably learnt either scheme or common lisp in a course called comparative studies of programming language or programming paradigms which was probably taught by someone who doesn t like any lisp language and taught them about functions lists symbols and higher-order functions

931214
lisp	scheme
i do not know lisp but heres why i think plt scheme is a good choice

931234
children	parent
in the same breath i would also like to be able to run a specific number of child processes at any given time say for example n children running concurrently whenever one exits the parent process starts another child if needed but has no more than n children at any given moment

931243
children	parent
it looks like your parent process is finishing before the children and therefore never getting a chance to reap them

931252
onchange	onblur
saves onchange and or onblur

931283
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
it s located at and it does play ogg wav mp3 and a whole other bunch of formats

931312
int	chars
the type casting from chars to int is a little awkward though

931364
g++	gcc
this might be because gcc is being used to link not g++

931370
dictionary	map
naively i ve thought of inserting a key in a hidden span and using a dictionary object in the controller to map edits creation

931468
rss	feed
but i ve seen it used to access non-local web pages in vista gadgets for instance for rss feed without using a proxy.

931476
int	chars	int	double
so far i can only think of maybe having a string array of data types int double chars etc search for that in the line and then search for the parenthesis and then search for the absence of the semicolon so i know it isn t just the declaration of the function

931494
typedef	struct
anything between a toplevel and is a function body except after typedef class struct union namespace and enum

931544
nsis	prerequisites
check framework prerequisites 2.0 - check nsis system func

931570
haskell	ocaml
for those who are familiar with haskell the ocaml syntax

931578
submit	submission
you can use the fieldserialize method to submit only a subset of the form and iframe true option to make it work with submission files etc

931605
uiview	subviews
the navigation bar is a uiview so you can simply create a regulat uibutton and add it to your navigation bar as a subviews

931621
serializable	deserialization
without a deserialization constructor and the serializable attribute your exceptions won t function in a distributed environment and could possibly cause other problems

931634
postgresql	mysql
mysql sql server 2005 2008 oracle postgresql sqllite maybe others

931643
submit	submission
this means it s possible for two users to be assigned the same record to edit and we favor the first one that submit failing silently on subsequent submission

931656
filtering	grouping
in my current application i have a full domain model linq to sql extremely lightweight repositories and then use extension methods across iqueryable to filtering sort order based on business requirements and then a service layer which contains services based on grouping of responsibilities such as iregistrationservice register users check availability of login names etc.

931724
inherited	properties
all objects in javascript have the prototype object and all instances of objects you create inherited methods and properties from their object s prototype object

931724
inherited	properties
this allows the childclass object to add methods and properties to its prototype object from the parentclass object which creates an effect similar to the idea of inherited present in class-based languages

931743
opera	firefox
well works the same for me in opera firefox and ie6 8

931826
jsr311	jax-rs
jax-rs jsr311 does not define a client api but most jax-rs implementations have one like jersey resteasy or apache cxf

931866
calloc	malloc
note that if you also divert calloc and its implementation calls malloc you may need additional code to check how you re being called

931877
inherited	properties
javascript has no built-in support for inherited hierarchies as type extension is supposed to be done via aggregation ie adding desired functionality directly to the object itself or its prototype if the properties is to be shared between instances

931893
post	get
2.- that code above will give a no post action wait or something like that if i add method get i will get a no route matches

931895
pull	push
whenever you commit push new stuff in main repo you just git pull them back into project

931913
ubuntu	linux
you could use ubuntu server which a variety of hosting providers offer among other gnu linux distros

931915
int	chars
map can contain any arbitrary type as a key while switch is very limited to c++ primitive types chars int enum etc...

931968
google-chrome	firefox
if it s just the colour you are after in firefox you can use colorzilla which lets you eyedrop any colour off the viewport including the google-chrome

931986
postgresql	mysql
mysql doesn t implement any join methods except for nested loops but postgresql does

932031
cassini	iis
i have a mixed app asp.net webforms later mvc added and it runs in iis 7 on vista but does not run on cassini on the same box and with the exact same files in the webroot

932061
implements	extends
if you want to derive a class to extends or change the name of init you should implements your class and have your method call init

932116
qapplication	qwidget
you can probably use qapplication setstylesheet or qwidget setstylesheet to get it done

932132
dxcore	coderush
dxcore is the freely available engine that runs developer s express s coderush dxcore can be found at

932202
icmp	telnet
however if the site blocks icmp echo then you can always do the telnet to port 80 of some site wget or curl

932253
freebsd	linux
freebsd can already run linux executables

932253
freebsd	linux
there are a whole lot more linux programs than freebsd programs so freebsd implemented the linux compatibility layer

932253
solaris	bsd
however don t expect the reverse solaris bsd executables on linux since there is just no demand for it

932255
postgresql	mysql
i m thinking of choosing between postgresql or mysql

932255
post	get
i have gone through several post on internet about search solutions nevertheless i d like to get opinions for my simple case

932287
post	get
maybe you can get something out of looking into this post on my my blog

932313
typedef	struct
typedef struct

932359
curb	libcurl
curb-fu is a wrapper around curb which in turn uses libcurl

932360
postgresql	mysql
i can t tell whether you need full-text search on description as i have no indication of what it is -- nor whether you need the reasonable but somewhat rudimentary full-text search that mysql 5.1 and postgresql 8.3 provide or the more powerful one in sphinx.

932360
postgresql	mysql
edit so it seems the only possible need for full-text search might be on description and that looks like it s probably limited enough that either mysql 5.1 or postgresql 8.3 will serve it well

932360
postgresql	mysql
me i have a sweet spot for postgresql even though i m reasonably expert at mysql too but that s a general preference not specifically connected to full-text search issues

932360
innodb	myisam	postgresql	mysql
this blog does provide one reason to prefer postgresql you can have full-text search and still be transactional while in mysql full-text indexing only work on myisam tables not innodb except if you add sphinx of course also see this follow-on for a bit more on full-text search in postgresql and lucene

932365
put	get	viewdidload	viewwillappear
put your table updating code in viewwillappear in stead of viewdidload - that way each time you go back to your parent controller from the child controller the data get reloaded

932455
for-loop	loops
rather than bitswapping the index every time through loops you can manually implement a ++ equivalent that uses bits in the wrong order to do a double indexed for-loop

932502
graphics2d	bufferedimage
the reason being a graphics2d object of the bufferedimage can be obtained in order to produce a better quality scaled image

932502
graphics2d	bufferedimage
then using that graphics2d object an image can be drawn to the bufferedimage using the rendering hints specified earlier

932520
min	max
the problem is that i ve run it more than 100 times and it s always giving me the same answer when my min 0 and max 1

932520
min	max
i did re-run the test with min 0 and max 10 and the first 50ish times the result was always 5 the 2nd 50ish times the result was always 9

932527
min	max
the min is inclusive but the max is exclusive

932530
min	max
the problem with min 0 and max 1 is that min is inclusive and max is exclusive

932531
hash	md5
delicious.com provides feeds to query information about urls but the function only accept an md5 hash of the url you want to look up

932544
min	max
also as mentioned by others the max is exclusive so if you want a 0 or 1 you should use 0 2 as your min max or some larger max and then do a binary and with 1

932583
yacc	bison
i m creating a compiler with lex and yacc actually flex and bison

932666
google-chrome	safari
furthermore we tried using ie google-chrome safari to show the same document directly

932668
integer	fractions
to convert decimal 10.1 to binary separate the integer and fractions parts and convert each separately

932668
integer	fractions
to convert the fractions part use repeated multiplication by 2 subtracting off the integer part at each step

932681
maven	m2e
i am sure m2e maven plugin for eclipse - the other way around - can do that

932707
folder	directory
the main thing i am trying to achieve is setting an existing websites home directory to a different folder

932738
subtraction	addition
it is just addition and subtraction

932746
hash	hmac
briefly some mac algorithms hmac use a hash function and include a secret key as part of the hash input

932760
width	height
the trace redraw seems to happen once the image is loaded but the border still does not get redrawn with the correct height and width

932784
decoder	encoder
i once wrote a custom encoder decoder that encoded bytes 0-255 to unicode characters 0-255 and back again

932797
hash	hmac
these concerns may seem overkill but if this is an application you sell for instance then all it takes is for one hacker to break your hash sequence or hmac secret

932860
setinterval	settimeout
use javascript s settimeout and setinterval functions

932940
width	height
for instance height and width could be two different domains

932940
width	height
although both might be stored as numeric 10 2 a height and a width column could not be compared without casting

933001
daemon	cron
in a high traffic situation i would have a separate script that runs a a daemon or cron job and fetches the weather every specified interval and overwrites the public website page when done

933004
put	get
however when we put that string in a text node and call toxml on it we get amp

933047
superclass	subclassing
you can t cast a superclass in a subclassing because the subclassing may have a bigger interface than the superclass means the subclassing can have functions like getunixtimestamp that the superclass doesn t have

933050
super	implements
if you re keen on having your subclass implements a constructor in your date class taking a java.util.date foo and in it call super with foo.gettime

933095
try-catch	exception-handling
try-catch statements are used to handle exception-handling

933100
uiview	subviews
i want to draw text into uiview s subviews using drawinrect withfont linebreakmode call but that operates on the current context only

933100
uiview	subviews
the subviews is a generic uiview instance and i don t really want to create a new uiview -derived class just for this purpose if i can avoid it

933120
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
so you already can inherited and add properties fields methods to your subclassing that will all be handled by reflection if the dynamic path doesn t do the lookup

933144
multiplying	multiplication
filtering in the time domain is just multiplication in the frequency domain so you may want to just apply a filter which is just multiplying each frequency by a value for the function for the filter you are using

933199
hash	salt
my understanding is that plaintext passwords should be appended to a random salt and that whole phrase should be hash by some hashing algorithm such as

933222
pascal	delphi
other than that if you like pascal delphi s compiler can produce native exes

933238
postgresql	mysql
they all support mysql and postgresql among others

933291
crypt	salt
the way you check your user s password is that you take their clear text input and crypt it with the salt and then compare the crypted_passwords if they match they are authenticated

933301
nswindow	nsapplication
you would need to look at the appropriate methods of nswindow such as -setframe animated or nsapplication

933309
uiview	subviews
you can always make your subviews a uiview subclass that overrides -drawrect to display the text you want.

933334
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i m using a jquery plugin called cycle and i am having issues with the css for it in ie it looks perfect in opera firefox google-chrome and safari but ie is cracking the sads

933334
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
you will see the latest work on the right hand side and the thumbnails below the main image in firefox safari google-chrome and opera the grey container is behind all the thumbnails but in ie the grey background stops at the top of the thumbnails

933377
put	get
i could put my code up here and have a bunch of have you s that never get anywhere

933380
stdout	stderr
these constants are stdin stdout and stderr

933408
jar	war
the way i am trying now seems like each war would try to use the jar files it contains but i want to have one set of shared jar files for the whole ear and then each war file in the ear use those jars

933408
jar	war
i would love to set it up this way but i can t even get one war with its own jar files to load up right when inside the ear

933423
uiview	calayer
one option would be to add a calayer to the view s layer instead of adding a uiview to the view

933428
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
the customcell implements touchesbegan and touchesmoved

933476
put	get	for-loop	arrays
then the arrays is put through a for-loop with various tests for keywords in various elements which indicate the next n-elements get processed in particular ways

933489
perl	tcl
others could say the same for python or ruby or back in the day perl or tcl

933508
jruby	mri

937532
hash	salt
side note from a crypto best practices standpoint the salt should be a known length should be generated randomly and prepended to your hash before being stored to the database

937532

937713
processors	hyperthreading
for context assume that the code would be required to run on any type of processors single core hyperthreading multicore etc

937775
int	double

938073
hash	salt
it might be overkill but you could hash their email address with sha1 using your guid newguid is fine as a hash salt and place that in the url

938073
hash	salt
even if somebody were to know what email addresses to try they would never be able to generate a hash collision without knowing the guid you salt with or it would take them a hell of a long time

938073
hash	salt
of course you would have to save their email and the hash salt guid in the database

938075
division	logarithm
a b 2 log2 a -log2 b if you can get the logarithm of the values you can closely approximate the division

938076

938084
put	get	post	put	post	get
what it certainly doesn t do is check if the http verb is a post or a get which most people assume you can see this if you set up a simple page and put the viewstate and eventvalidation if present fields in the query string then check ispostback

941560
boost	stl
regarding c++ the he boost library is the most used library so you should start by looking there if you already know c++ contrary to what i saw in some of the previous answers you must understand that the stl is now part of the standard and so part of the c++ language

another way is of course define the data as int and cast it to chars array whenever necessary

943294
int	chars
to allow a single type of data to be accessed in several ways as in your example accessing a colour as an int or as you probably intended four chars

943307
vbscript	vb6	vb.net	vb6
if all you are wanting is to check the component responds when called then use a quick vbscript rather than building something in vb6 vb.net

943359
portrait	landscape
another reason for excel instead of pdf is that users can do some minor tweaks and modifications before printing changing landscape portrait layout line numbers adding a custom memo etc.

943366
post	get
it looks like that sid is the session id which presumably is a cookie that you should send back in your next post get

943374
stretchblt	bitblt
try using stretchblt instead of bitblt

943395
strcpy	strncpy
using strncpy rather than strcpy to copy 123456 will ensure that any extra space beyond the end of string null terminator is also initialised to null as long as you specify n as being 100 for your example

943395
memset	malloc
otherwise without initialising the memory allocated by malloc to null memset num 0 100 then it is conceivable that you could step beyond the end of the string

943475
trac	bugzilla
the bugzilla and trac systems mentioned are nice but geared towards bug tracking which is just very different from a tool you d want to use in a helpdesk-type setup where end users would raise incidents

943494
ant	maven
having said all of that i do think that maven is a very interesting and useful system i m not calling it a tool like ant is maven is broader than that for software development configuration and build management

943499
prng	random
well it looks to me like you forgot to seed the prng pseudo random number generator

943507
children	parent
meaning where 10 is the parent and all of it s children and upwards where 10 is the child and all of it s parent

943532
filesystems	fat
fat or fat32 filesystems st_mtime

943534
mbunit	nunit
perhaps it can be found in nunit also but i found it in mbunit first

943552
google-chrome	safari
if your ie google-chrome or safari do not show a warning when visiting your secured page it means that you have added this new certificate to trusted certificates database of your account

943563
filesystems	fat
for example for entries in a fat filesystems the finest resolution for modification time is 2 seconds

943682
subtraction	addition
completely un-tested but that s a hell of a reduction for the addition of a one-line method to array and performing a single extra subtraction in a model

943699
scrollable	panels
the following code produces pretty much what i want but the scrollable panels on the left doesn t scroll

943827
hide	show
as i don t think we can explicitly control the show hide of the context menu strip i decided to trap the right mouse button click on the control with which the contextmenustrip is associated

943846
button	checkbox
significantly button checkbox richtextbox and radiobutton and a few others don t raise and event on right click

943995
post	get
google help says that this auth code should be used to send future post get requests

944025
fink	macports
that appears to do everything you want and is available on macports and fink

944029
post	get
this is so that if the user hits refresh on the home page after logging in then they don t get that browser warning about resubmitting a post

944030
for-loop	loops
just a quick note i would do what schnalle does but in your code i would change the for-loop to a while loops as you are not doing anything with the i

944031
jar	.war
this meant the jar files would now be exported in the .war when deploying to tomcat

944031
jaxp	saaj
however i don t like this because the jar files come from a few different libraries in jwsdp-2.0 and copying them like this meant the were all just tossed in together rather than nicely seperated as jaxb jaxp saaj etc

944041
sorting	filtering
check out sun s tutorial for jtables and look at the sorting and filtering section

944045
children	parent
so in a typical model where you have a parent that can have many children and a child that can have only one parent how do you manage the adding of children

944045
children	parent
i could just add an addchild method to the parent class and make that responsible for adding children - the problem now is that there is 2 ways to add a child through the children property and the method

944125
children	parent
i just expose a readonly-copy of the children list so that you can easily iterate over the children of a parent and get the number of children that the parent has

944125
children	parent
adding and removing children to the parent has to be done using the addchild removechild member methods

944138
hide	fadeout
hiding the row either by hide fadeout slideup applying a class setting a css value or by way of an animation

944232
range	minimum
range is the minimum to maximum value supported for that datatype

944236
range	minimum
range is the range of values an datatype can use defined between its minimum and maximum values

944239
range	minimum
range means the maximum and minimum value that can be stored inside the variable of a given type

944245
implements	extends
in other words it would extends arrayobject or implements arrayaccess or something along those lines

944253
hide	show
you change the value of the radiobuttonlist and the textbox will show hide accordingly

944264
int	chars	int	double
on x86 chars is 1 byte short is 2 int is 4 float is 4 double is 8

944281
range	minimum
in the case of an integer the variable definition is restricted to whole numbers only and the range will cover every number within its range including the maximum and minimum

944296
inherited	properties
when i derive a new type of order class it will inherited the delivery properties of type deliverystrategy

944298
range	max	range	min	min	max
the definition of range is the difference between the max and min values the type can hold

944303
scrollable	panels
now here is some code stolen from perlmongers that creates a scrollable panels with a bunch of buttons

944379
inherited	properties
if there isn t then i would suggest just making the delivery properties virtual so it has to be defined by inherited classes instead

944386
width	height
my code is different to yours as it supplies a width and a height for the window so it opens as a pop-up but if i set ie to always open pop-ups in a new tab it still focusses on the window for me but i have pop-up blocker completely turned off

944399
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
you can also use svn simultaneously with git mercurial bazaar - some projects actually do so

944435
submit	submission
however if you want the user to feel like they are submission a form place a normal button not a submit button on the page that will act as your ajax submit button

944479
int	double
rather it is a way to declare pointer to a function which takes int as argument and returns double same as the prototype

944509
serializable	deserialization
apple provides the nsarchiver and nsunachriver for object serializable deserialization but this can not handle any custom xml schema

944513
post	get
now the issue to get certain functionality i have to post to a page from the old site to make it render differently and thus provide a response to the post

944513
post	put
in old asp the previous developers put a lot of functionality into 1 page and by using the post message i can call upon these functions rendering a different page each time

944541
queue	fifo
i read that you can queue up actionscript events somehow so that events are processed in a fifo basis

944553
range	max
this means that the loop min+ range max enters a for all intents and purposes infinite loop

944553
min	max
db 10 print self- max - self- min

944587
width	height
iframe true width 800 height 530

944602
persistent	transient
i couldn t create a transient which is not persistent to the database property

944636
versioning	upgrade
if you bought your copy of dterm the upgrade to the next versioning is free regardless of when you purchased dterm

944642
peer	p2p
other extreme p2p radio system source peer

944706
inherited	properties
however if your derived class is not sealed classes that inherited from it could introduce the same types of problems by hiding the delivery properties with a version of their own

944751
min	max
in your case the min and max values are exactly adjacent representable values so there can t be more than one partition

944760
int	double
this works since modf takes the int part of the double and returns the fractions part

944769
floating-point	fractions
if you re dealing with an actual floating-point number as opposed to a string representation of such you should use modf for splitting out the integral and fractions parts

944773
jlist	jtable
you should be able to use a similar process to find child components in jlist or jtable which also use this renderer pattern

944780
free	malloc
if you just want a buffer use malloc free

944786
put	get	post	put	post	get
there is an add-on for wcf called the wcf rest starter kit which will also be included in wcf 4.0 with .net 4.0 which allows you to use get post put delete http commands to query wcf services and such

objectdataprovider	xmldataprovider
silverlight supports the xmldataprovider but not the objectdataprovider

944831
ubuntu	debian	uninstall	upgrade
this way you should get the maximum benefits 1 all the bleeding edge features you want 2 proper debian ubuntu package which you may easily uninstall upgrade and deploy to any number of debian machines

944925
mp3	ogg
i was wondering if anyone knew how to convert an mp3 audio file to an ogg audio file

944931
apache	nginx
use nginx over apache especially

944983
superclass	subclassing
one of the requirements is that you have a group of related classes a set of subclassing with a single superclass

944990
mp3	ogg
you will need to decode mp3 then encode into ogg

944990
mp3	ogg
one possibility is to use liblame for mp3 decoding and libogg libvorbis for encoding into ogg

945003
put	get	post	put	post	get
it takes in a url and a request method get post put etc and i want to be able to parse the url and open a httpsurlconnection or httpurlconnection based on whether it is https or http assume the given urls will always be correct

945003
post	get
then that will automatically create a urlconnection that can accept both http and https but if i do this then i can t find any way to set a request method get post etc since only the httpsurlconnection or httpurlconnection classes have the setrequestmethod method

945009
decoder	encoder	mp3	ogg
you need a mp3 decoder and a ogg encoder and a little bit of glue code around that opening files setting up the codecs piping raw audio data around ect.

945012
folder	directory
in this case the settings.xml file is in the current directory but i normally put it in the user s app data folder because you can always write to that

945024
richfaces	tomahawk
my application also uses facelets tomahawk and richfaces

945039
mp3	ogg
it would take only a few clicks to convert from mp3 to ogg

945039
flac	ogg	mp3	flac	mp3	ogg
keep in mind that moving from a lossy format to a lossy format will reduce the quality of the audio more than moving from a lossless format flac cd audio apple lossless codec to a lossy format mp3 ogg m4a

945073
x86	64bit
x86 - 32bit - can not be loaded into a 64bit process

paradox	bde
connecting to bde paradox from c#

945211
g++	gcc
i am trying to link a .a library that was built with gcc to a program built using g++

945293
min	max
this is the version with group by min .. and max ..

945293
min	max
if your cardeventtime is sting not integer then you must ensure that it has leading zeros 020000 not 20000 otherwise the min max will not sort it properly so that 20000 is higher then 150000

945355
firefox	safari
silverlight is cross browser compatible what you see in ie is what you ll get in firefox safari and the same on the apple mac versions of the browsers

945363
versioning	upgrade
try clearing the option always upgrade to the installed versioning of office

945398
nstreecontroller	nsarraycontroller
i also have an nsarraycontroller in each of the sub-view controllers which is bound to the nstreecontroller via some overly-complicated keypaths

945416
awt	swing
this is often called the swing or awt event thread

945416
awt	swing
build a list of items and be able to do something else you should use a thread other than the awt event thread the main swing one

945416
awt	swing
so in these cases you spawn a new thread and do what you have to and when the results finally come back you then somehow have to create an event that can be executed by the awt swing dispatcher

945428
opera	google-chrome
i need to do google-chrome opera hacks because of a font replacement script wanted by the client that breaks things.

945463
profiler	hprof
hprof java profiler

945482
ubuntu	debian
tested on the default installations of ubuntu intrepid jaunty and debian lenny and those are affected too

945509
int	double
say you have a function with 3 parameters that are int and it returns a double

945522
hide	show
honestly i d just make a regular window and hide show it as appropriate - just have an itemscontrol whose datatemplate is a menuitem

945545
gif	png
i allow them to upload png gif and jpeg images

945571
webkit	gecko
that said most browsers you ll encounter today safari webkit gecko ie will have decent xslt support

945572
paradox	bde	paradox	dbase	bde	dbase
the bde could work with several file types foxpro dbase paradox ascii and sometimes even access

945585
serializable	deserialization
unfortunately the .net serializable engine at least by default totally ignores automatic properties on deserialization and only cares about the backing field which is obviously not present in the javascript object

945618
versioning	upgrade
upgrade are defined as full versioning releases not content or add-ons

945627
response.redirect	redirecttoaction
i m guessing that the response.redirect and server.transfer throw errors because in mvc you should be calling the redirecttoaction methods from the controller

945641
hash	md5
the md5 function is over twice as fast and the sha1 hash is about 35 faster

945655
int	double
however the chance that you re going to run out of bits when working with int or longs or double etc

945655
int	double
automatic conversion from int to long float to double etc

945691
pop-up	dialog
my friend insisted that the best you could do was pop-up the print dialog for the user they would have to click print themselves

945692
junit	testng
i would recommend switching from junit to testng

945692
junit	testng
testng has a lot of advanced features over junit

945695
implements	extends
i ve solved this problem by implements a base class that test classes should extends if such functionality is desired

945746
int	double
you can define lua_number to be a double default float or any int

945764
linqdatasource	objectdatasource	sqldatasource	linqdatasource	sqldatasource	objectdatasource
expects a column with the name of item which you would have if you were binding to one of the datasource controls such as sqldatasource objectdatasource or linqdatasource

945768
nstreecontroller	nsarraycontroller
nsarraycontroller and nstreecontroller are treated more as view objects than true controllers so it sounds like you re on the right track

945768
nstreecontroller	nsarraycontroller
i would have started about the same way you did giving each nsviewcontroller its own nsarraycontroller or nstreecontroller as needed and configuring the bindings between them at runtime through the window controller that s responsible for putting all the pieces together

945768
nstreecontroller	nsarraycontroller
if you think it would simplify things it doesn t sound like there would be anything wrong with moving the nsarraycontroller and nstreecontroller objects to the window controller

945774
hash	md5
addendum when i measured i saw a factor of 2.6x comparing your crc32 to the md5 hash when the app was compiled with debug+ and optimize-

945775
public	protected
some of these classes are not public protected as such in the api docs they wont have links to the class documentation

945820
int	chars
this includes things like the data wrappers int string chars etc... data classes and collections

945839
versioning	upgrade
you have features requests inquiries and schedule items too you might have to upgrade to the latest versioning to take advantage of those

945846
matlab	simulink
some of those models have been converted to c++ but the current trend is to create these models using matlab simulink

945846
matlab	simulink
from a computer science perspective i have always felt matlab simulink was not a good solution

945899
opera	firefox
on my computer even firefox and opera failed completely .

945921
set	bag
attributes however are naturally a property bag - a set of values rather than a sequence

945942
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested in ie firefox google-chrome .

945948
gif	png	tiff	png
so as you can see the name of the image is file.png and this works correctly it saves the image as png also works with jpeg tiff gif and it can be loaded with any image processing application

946017
temp	tmp
so combining that page with your post i would guess that either one of the tmp temp or userprofile variables for your administrator user points to the windows path or else they re not set and it s taking a fallback to the windows temp path

946114
wtl	atl
so my question is how can i use idispatch in c to create the com object without having to depend on mfc .net c# wtl or atl

946128
put	get
going further if you mean to get optimal with really large scale networks and are ready to put in some time and effort -- consider a structured p2p mechanism like dht

946183
rss	feed
also there is a application called blog rss feed reader if you wanted to go the rss route

946189
google-chrome	firefox
i have a code that works only in ie anb i was looking for something similar in firefox and google-chrome to set user s default homepage through a link click here to make this site your default homepage but so far i didn t find anything

946208
inherited	properties
inherited from panel add a properties that represents the text you need to write and override the onpaintmethod

946210
int	double
i read somewhere about other data structures similar to hashtables dictionaries but instead of using int they were using floats double etc

946218
restrict	shared
while it is not good to be restrict to a least common denominator and hopefully your management will realize this you should not overlook the benefits of shared experience

946228
width	height
you can create a 2 views one for each line set the background color of that view to whatever you want the colors to be and then set the height to 1px and the width to fill_parent

946251
winpcap	wireshark
i d only like to use something like wireshark as a last resort if no other method is available as i d like such dumping to be available on the clients machines without having to install winpcap and stuff

946297
ninject	spring.net	autofac	castle-windsor
spring.net ninject unity castle-windsor autofac are all ioc containers which are configurable in different ways many of them do also support aop

946330
opera	firefox
my endless tweets user script works equally well in firefox webkit and opera

946348
boost	stl
it may be a bit much for a newbie but it is a great next-step after learning stl and boost

946366
post	get
basically i need to simulate a response.redirect but do so with a post instead of a get and also set a couple request parameters

946404
floating-point	integer
it s not hard to write a simple polynomial type hash function that outputs a floating-point value rather than an integer value but it s difficult to ensure that the resulting hash function has the desired properties without getting into the details of the particular floating-point representation used

946404
floating-point	fractions
doing the same for a calculation with a bunch of floating-point fractions would be a drag

946415
equals	gethashcode
as others have noted implementing equals and gethashcode is a step in the right direction

946474
accessor	properties
inside the class methods i always use the properties accessor with the dot syntax and never access the private ivars directly

946474
accessor	properties
however i ve seen some sample code that uses declared properties to expose the relationships do not implement the kvc accessor methods yet are still key-value observable

946488
put	get
if you put just the full name in as the recipient you won t get anything

946523
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the microsoft model is used in internet explorer and the w3c model is used in other browsers firefox opera safari google-chrome etc.

946547
firefox	safari
this works fine in ie and firefox when the user hits the back button they are presented with a page expired message and are forced to login but in safari the last page the user was working on shows up

946555
filtering	grouping
inspired from query anything with sqlite article i would like to let sqlite engine to do the dirty work grouping filtering etc

946574
children	parent
this is the parent canvas so it has no parent only children

946580
hash	md5
md5 hash collisions

946590
gmail	hotmail
sure people can create dozens of email addresses using gmail or hotmail or even if they have their own private domain

946591
viewdidload	viewwillappear
on any load after that the viewdidload will not fire letting the viewwillappear to do its loyal flipping job

946593
put	get
i have a byte array 8 bits in each position of the array and what i need to do is to put together 2 of the values of the array and get a value

946600
width	height
the canvas should do this automatically unless you are manually setting the height and or width

946614
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
if this doesn t work then what you could do is bind the width and height properties of the canvas to the actualwidth and actualheight properties of the containing window

946624
filtering	grouping
then you can use different querys on that temporary table to do your grouping filtering etc

946628
winpcap	wireshark
there is microsoft s netmon or as you said a winpcap based product like wireshark

946642
int	chars
chars index const chars int will always be true

946649
rss	feed
i wanto to build a wcf service that read rss syndication feed .net 3.5 sp1

946651
hlsl	glsl
if glsl is anything like hlsl directx s equivalent which i suspect it is i think you are stuck with passing attributes

946717
adplus	cdb
i have done this in the past on xp machines but with my current vista ultimate setup - the adplus script doesn t spawn the 2nd window with cdb running

946718
int	boolean
boolean are meant to be used for specific purposes flags and shouldn t be mixed with int else the uses of variables can potentially become quite confusing

946729
jquery	jqtransform
i am using the jquery form plugin the jquery validation plugin and the jqtransform plugin

946739
cassini	iis
i have a wcf web service that i am hosting in iis actually running within the visual studio web host cassini

946750
int	boolean
in c int are frequently doubly used as a normal number and a boolean such as for loops that run while a certain number is not zero

946750
int	double
this kind of double nature allegedly frequently leads to problems and it makes the code less readable since you have to judge from the context whether a given usage of an int is intended as int or bool

946750
int	boolean
if you absolutely need to use a boolean as an int you can either use

946782
cos	sin
then you can calculate your carthesian position with the sin and cos of the angle

946864
post	get
use your favorite search engine to search for what you want to do or post examples of your test here and get comments - this will help you improve what you are doing

946876
int	chars
if your variable is a primitive type int chars etc.

946896
width	height
the problem is that you re specifying the height and width

946932
folder	directory
under c c++- general- additional include directory add the folder where you have your .h file

946943
multiplying	add
after that multiplying each input pixel value with the corresponding scaling value and add the results together to get the value of the output pixel

946952
int	boolean
it does not apply to java because it has special treatment for it s basic types int boolean etc for operators cumbersome syntax that makes clear what is built in the language and what is library etc

947025
free	malloc
in c you just have malloc and free

947039
put	get
as far as other objects like tables you can put them in model and new databases will get them when you create a new database

947094
folder	directory
on my host i set the folder as an application directory since it s a subfolder of my root

947094
folder	directory
each folder is it s own application directory where i put different sites

947103
pop-up	dialog
if i put the uri into a browser it pop-up a dialog asking for credentials and then works

947120
children	parent
traversing children parent

947136
uiswitch	uibutton	uilabel	uibutton
but this is a series of special-purpose controls an odd assortment of various uisliders uiswitch uilabel uibutton etc. that wouldnâ t readily fit into a standard table view without a bunch of customizing anyway

947225
post	get
if your app is not performance sensitive and your requests aren t post of large data you probably won t notice but to get around it i had to manually build the http basic authentication header and set it on the httpwebrequest manually by manipulating the headers collection

947241
sorting	filtering
i d also like to add sorting and filtering capabilities to these objects

947263
accessor	properties
in any case you would not gain anything from creating a real properties with set and get accessor since it would be created only at run-time and you would not be using it in your code.

947263
sorting	filtering
here is an example showing a possible implementation of filtering and sorting no error checking

947271
put	get
the thinking is that you could put your click handlers outside of document.ready so they get executed right away

947279
sorting	filtering
for filtering and advanced sorting ibindinglistview

947292
client-side	server-side
in addition to creating server-side validation you can use the clientvalidationfunction property on the customvalidator to provide client-side validation as well

947311
jobs	cron
one of the biggest headaches is cron jobs etc running in local time zone this means that some cron jobs will get missed once a year and all the rest run at a different time gmt for half the year i m assuming you re in a time zone which has daylight saving time here

947319
width	height
if you add a width height you ll fix that up

947343
directx	directdraw
i need to be able to set an overlayed graphics area via directx directdraw methods in any place on the screen or at least to use it inside a windowed area

947398
put	get
also put a file share on and store all the installers for development tools you d use - so you can easily get all the bits you need to set up a new development workstation

947403
clang	llvm
another tool i ve found invaluable is clang from the llvm project

947440
implements	extends
by extends the application class and implements it as a singleton you get an object that will exist whenever any of your application components exist providing a centralized place to store and transfer complex object data between application components

947455
post	get
use get for getting data and codeigniter post function to store data on server

947461
quicksort	heapsort
in addition to the above the stl s sorting algorithm is introsort which is a mixture of quicksort and heapsort it fails over from quicksort to heapsort if the former is doing poorly

947473
profiling	debugging
many people recommend this for the debugging project profiling

947503
uilabel	uibutton
you are simple wrapping the uilabel in a uibutton allowing you to add anything you want to a tool bar

947513
mouseover	mouseout
i am halfway there but when you mouseout it disappears before you can mouseover any of the items

947514
innodb	myisam
if you tried to change the storage engine for this table from to myisam innodb and something went wrong then indices in this table could have been screwed up

947530
post	get
the remote site has looked at their logs and they say my code is doing the post and then immediately doing a 2nd get request

947530
post	get
i m definately not doing a get i m only doing the one post

947534
typedef	struct
typedef struct _myoverlapped

947539
free	malloc
it turns out that in the c runtime a counter used to aid debugging was being incremented each time a malloc free was performed

947570
set	bag
depending on your feature set and user interface there may be some other session state for the user but that shouldn t need to apply to the direct rp-op communications and you can use your standard bag of tricks

947581
sorting	filtering
also if you are looking at sorting and filtering i m guessing you re going to be using some kind of grid

947618
hash	salt
note to clarify my post i understand the techniques of securing the password hash salt etc

947620
put	get
i then put in variables like #username# into the html that get replaced in code

947641
rss	feed
an rss feed of the last 15 errors from the log

947703
width	height
the plugin assumes in the iframe case that there are no other important parameters in that url and removes all of them after parsing out the height and width

947744
hash	salt
for each credential set store a salt along with the hash data

947750
hash	md5
avoid the use of a fast and cheap hash such as md5 or sha1

947750
hash	salt
in addition to hashing salt the hash with a randomly generated value

947765
getter	setter
however synthesized getter and setter do more than just retaining and releasing

947873
width	height
the core application should contain information that will be shared by all other projects link to database data manager which loads data from the database application information like height width colors fonts.

947880
uiview	subviews
use the subviews property of the uiview containing the buttons

947928
superclass	subclassing
normally equals in general should not be implemented to return true between itself and its subclassing although there are plenty that do due to covariance issues the superclass will think it equals the subclassing but the subclassing won t think it equals the superclass so this type of implementation of equals is tricky no matter what you do

947999
dictionary	map
for the example given where the strings are used as keys to a map or dictionary i would lean toward use of an enum or other object instead

948000
gridview	repeater
bind that datasource to a control like a repeater gridview details view or similar

948058
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
what i ended up doing to solve the problem was to create a uinavigationcontroller and push the uiviewcontroller based class onto it and then do presentmodalviewcontroller to the navigation controller s instance

948080
single-quotes	double-quotes
try removing the double-quotes since it s already quoted with single-quotes

948115
children	parent
in most scene graphs you ll have parent nodes that each contain children in this case each ship would be a node and the people rooms furniture etc inside the ship are children

948115
children	parent
the positions of children are specified relative to their parent

948125
mouseout	mouseenter
i want to bind a mouseenter event to each inner div respectively and eventually a mouseout once i see what s done it will be easy to expand upon

948127
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
you ll have to do a little work with nsdatecomponents converted using an nscalendar typically the user s default calendar to figure out the start and end nsdate values and compare use those to compare your time interval to

948127
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
i would definitely spend some time looking over nscalendar and nsdatecomponents in the docs though you might find a better method than what i m suggesting for what you need to do

948138
jflex	cup
when i ve ported a lalr grammar to java i ve used jflex cup

948190
dia	visio
dia is inspired by the commercial windows program visio though more geared towards informal diagrams for casual use

948195
jboss	weblogic
typically we use weblogic or jboss to deploy our apps

948207
firefox	safari
the first is watir which is an automated testing framework that will control both firefox and safari on mac os x

948214
stdout	stderr
note that on windows you cannot set close_fds to true and also redirect the standard handles by setting stdin stdout or stderr

948262
jboss	weblogic
the clustering failover and session synchronization features of weblogic and jboss still make them worthwhile in large data centers

948262
jboss	weblogic
if you don t use vendor-specific extensions in theory your code can be moved from websphere to weblogic to jboss without changes

948310
packets	multicast
i have proprietary application sending out multicast packets to the network

948313
implements	extends
if you re writing your own collection class and you re extends any of the existing classes or implements any of the collections framework interfaces you basically have no choice but to use iterator

948367
children	parent
looks reasonable though it really needs to fix leaking std and aux to the children and after the loop and the parent s original stdin is lost forever

948372
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
if all you care about is the date on the calendar then you ll create the nsdate then use an nscalendar to get nsdatecomponents for the date

948423
abc	subclassing
for example header files that declare classes need to be imported directly in subclassing header files and header files declaring protocols might well be imported directly although youy can use protocol abc

948503
rss	feed
one last question is there a php and mysql plugin that will create a database and index all my web pages from my site in order to create an rss feed

948530
children	parent
it is far from a nice solution it messes with the parent process standard descriptors does not recover the standard input descriptors leak to children etc

948540
int	double
similarly this can be extended to int long float double types as well

948540
int	double
floating point types such as float and double are also represented by a bits in memory but their data representation differs from int data types such as byte and int in that they will store a value in memory as binary fractions and exponents

948550
stretchblt	bitblt
you could as has been suggested use stretchblt rather than bitblt to scale up your image

948554
rss	feed
as for the second question if you are asking in the context of migrating your existing site to wordpress wordpress automatically will generate the rss feed so long you port your pages into their posts and pages mechanism

948554
rss	feed
do let us know and provide more information on what you want to achieve if you are asking the last question on a different context as in you have a set of webpages which you are not migrating to wordpress but needing a means of needing an automatic means to translate those existing pages into a dynamic rss feed

948564
factors	matrix
there are n 2 relationships in a matrix that would determine if character a could attack or use ability m on character b ignoring other factors for now

948569
rar	zip
for other compression formats the docs say truezip ships with archive drivers for zip tar and all derivatives jar tar.gz tar.bz2 tzp ... . no rar that i know of

948576
profiler	visualvm
the visualvm which comes with jdk6 has a basic profiler inside it

948602
udp	tcp
this is why tcp is different to udp

948618
folder	directory
but in sharepoint users from active directory can also login but temp folder is only available for users on that machine

948640
dictionary	map
some oo languages have multi-dispatch common lisp and dylan are the two that come to mind at the moment but for all the vast majority of languages that lack it this is a good approach in some cases you ll find that a centralized map dictionary is restrictive and refactor to a dynamic visitor design pattern or the like but thanks to the getter function such refactorings will be pretty transparent to all the rest of your code

948668
integer	unsigned
shifts the bits in c one to the right which ends up being the same as doing an integer division by 2 for unsigned or positive integers

948728
telerik	componentart
telerik and componentart are good too

948755
folder	directory
navigate to that directory and delete all folder in it

948755
inherited	properties
the inherited properties should be set to your partial class s name in your .aspx.cs code-behind file

948796
mouseleave	mouseenter
check out this article on the mouseenter and mouseleave events

948799
factors	mean
presuming you mean precise since accuracy would depend on the hardware clock and many other factors the docs seem to indicate second precision

948815
post	get
something like the cookie session post get objects

948846
profiler	hprof
java has a basic built in profiler called hprof

948912
unsigned	short
note that behaves differently on unsigned types whether char short long or long long than on signed types

948927
post	get
it transparently maps urls onto python functions and handles all the cookie and session stuff and of course the post get parameters for you

949019
mouse	keyboard
it supports scrolling with arrow buttons along with mouse wheel and keyboard arrows

949059
src	attr
to always get the full resolved path use element.src not element.getattribute src which seems to be the equivalent of attr src

949071
folder	directory
i think i need to make some changes in the .htaccess file present in the public folder of my rails_root directory but i am not sure

949165
width	height
report viewer width height is not display properly in mozila firefox but perfectly displayed in ie

949165
width	height
dispaly size in mozila is 450 width and 175 height and perfectly in ie shown in full page

949169
kde	gnome
look at kde and gnome for instance

949183
kde	gnome
it s the offspring of dcop from kde primarily and to a lesser extent bonobo from gnome so if it s older you might look one of those things up

949192
rss	feed
i have created a basic xml feed which works fine in my web browsers but i was hoping that someone could point me to some instructions on making an rss feed properly that is more likely to work in any program

949231
cruisecontrol	teamcity
we changed from cruisecontrol to teamcity and there are a lot of new and useful features like cancelling a build etc

949242
mergetool	winmerge
see git mergetool winmerge

949287
hash	md5
thus a 128 bits md5 hash value would result in a 128 bit 8 bit byte 16 byte long string

949298
add-on	xpcom
it should be a part of our already existing xpcom dll add-on

949304
pull	push
this is assuming that the fork will create a project for him where he can push his changes to github then you can pull from his github project then push it to the main one where he pull from

949311
hash	salt
on hashing algorithms sha384 is probably a sufficient algorithm but ensure that you salt your hash

949346
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
raphaã l currently supports firefox 3.0+ safari 3.0+ opera 9.5+ google-chrome 2.0+ and internet explorer 6.0+

949351
svg	vml
it is a javascript cross-browser wrapper library around canvas svg and vml an ie-only vector markup language that predates svg used in ie6

949364
hash	salt
you should add a salt to your hash data

949364
hash	salt
then store the salt value with the hash value so that you can regenerate the hash value

949364
hash	salt
the role of this salt is to prevent building dictionnary mapping common passwords to hash values

949364
hash	salt
with a 16bit salt you have 65536 different hash values for the same clear text password

949364
hash	salt
better pick a 64bit salt because it won t add much more effort to hash and verify passwords

949378
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
does for firefox opera safari etc

949386
inherited	properties
how ever a good solution that will not make you have to keep this mapping in mind is to create a class inherited from combobox with its own dataprovider properties

949412
debian	linux
if you work in non-debian linux another way to set up a default font for emacs is to add emacs customisation to the file .xdefaults in debian any file in etc x11 xresources is used

949429
octree	quadtree
something like a quadtree or octree is common in 3d worlds although you could overlay a grid too or track arbitrary regions etc

949431
google-chrome	firefox
this piece of javascript code works fine in firefox and google-chrome but fails with the error object expected in internet explorer 8

949459
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this works perfectly in firefox google-chrome and opera browsers

949534
bazaar	git
i prefer gnu bazaar and git

949543
rsa	aes
i have to implement a digital envelope using aes and rsa but i am having problems with the .net implementation of the rsa algorithm

949543
rsa	aes
i have managed to encrypt the data aes with the random symmetric key but now i have to encrypt the key with rsa

949543
exponent	modulo
the key is an array of bytes and the public key i have tells me only the modulo and the public exponent both arrays of bytes

949543
exponent	modulo
afterwards the public key is read from the public key file and the modulo and the exponent are in their appropriate byte arrays

949543
exponent	modulo
currently the modulo is 128 bytes and the exponent 64 bytes

949599
hash	salt
oh and dont forget to salt your hash if its a password you are hashing and anything smaller than sha384 is a security risk if we talk about password because is so easy to get quality rainbow tables for sha1 and other common hashing algos

949601
exponent	modulo
so what you need are the rsaparameters but all you need to set are the modulo and the exponent to encrypt

949611
folder	directory
the easiest thing to do is set the target directory for the 64-bit dll to be a x64 subdirectory of your target folder

949654
firefox	safari
works in firefox and browsers with webkit core safari konqueror

949659
folder	directory
d libs orm subsonic_2.1_final_source src subsonic bin debug directory to that command line tools folder .

949713
tax	shipping
and i don t want to put the satchmo apps product shipping tax etc directly into the python django path

949731
content-disposition	content-type
if you wanted to determine what a given url resolved to you could issue a head request and inspect the content-type and content-disposition headers to see if the content is of a type that implies an underlying file but even that s not bulletproof since images pdf etc

949764
post	get
in our application we often have a button that will perform a post back get data convert it into excel pdf and stream it to the client via response.write or response.binarywrite

949771
verilog	vhdl
vhdl verilog and other hardware description languages are essentially dataflow

949776
printf	strlen
you can fix it by testing how many strings you have and the greatest strlen of them and start by allocating chunk to output before you enter your printf loop

949845
disk	ram
express messages are only stored in ram and not persisted to disk so restarting the msmq service will destroy them

949890
arduino	avr-gcc
in order to ensure that some initialization code runs before main using arduino avr-gcc i have code such as the following

950014
vbscript	jscript
if possible vbscript or jscript via windows scripting host

950027
jobs	cron
a cron job not likley - if there s not even a database then there are no cron jobs

950084
coalesce	nvl
the obvious differences are that coalesce will return the first non null item in its parameter list whereas nvl only takes two parameters and returns the first if it is not null otherwise it returns the second

950084
coalesce	nvl
it seems that nvl may just be a base case version of coalesce

950103
coalesce	nvl
nvl always evaluates both arguments while coalesce stops evaluation whenever it finds first non- null

950106
paradox	dbase
based on experience with shared file databases dbase paradox and the like this doesn t scale well

950107
ubuntu	debian
when i compile the 2.6.24-24-generic ubuntu kernel according the alternate build method the old-fashioned debian way i get the appropriate modules directory and all my devices work except those requiring firmware such as my intel wireless card ipw2200 module

950146
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
according to this stackoverflow answer they are supported but behind flags in google-chrome 60 firefox 54 and ms edge 15 with only safari 10.1 providing support without flags

950165
folder	directory
with maven and axistools-maven-plugin the generated sources are places in a different source folder in the target directory

950194
put	get	post	put	post	get
look into why using put post get and others is important

950198
post	put
c not required because you use curl encode the parameters and post put them

950258
for-loop	loops
if it s limited to the scope of the for-loop definitely declare it inside loops

950296
bazaar	git
distributed version control systems are just for you look for bazaar git or mercurial

950395
ant	maven
i m interested to move a project based on seam 2.1.1 from ant to maven to integrate some tools in the build process like testability explorer and others

950440
children	parent
but you may be better using a really structured list for your parent children relationship

950471
serializable	deserialization
the serializable and deserialization should be very fast

950538
cassini	iis
yet when i rebuild and run the site again on my local machine with iis not cassini the value of system.configuration.configurationmanager.appsettings prod still returns true instead of false

950549
post	get
anyway those are some places to start if you post some more detailed information on the issue you may get some more responses

950565
serializable	deserialization
for partial or split deserialization which i have been looking sime into myself such as dynamic and static parts in a game level i think you will have to write your own serializable engine

950584
range	max	range	min	min	max
if it is an incremental refresh then you need the pk range to work with anyhow so you would want something like your high water mark data except you may want to store min max pairs

950594
pop-up	dialog
if you interact with an http api be it that it s https or not and the dialog box pop-up it means its using http authentication either basic or digest

950600
serializable	deserialization
the key point being to watch that between serializable and deserialization we only create one extra object

950626
cassini	iis
the comment with iis not cassini could mean you have a published separate version in iis

950680
strsplit	substr
strsplit string regex is convenient but if you don t need the regular expression handling then go with the substr .. example java.util.stringtokenizer or use apache commons lang 1

950697
int	double
as far as i know though any numerical type int double decimal etc. will

950717
typedef	struct	getter	setter
you start by typedef ing a struct providing create destroy functions and then other setter getter doers to operate on that struct

950717
typedef	struct
typedef struct

950717
int	chars
mytype_t mytype_create unsigned int x chars y

950717
typedef	struct
the important point is this as soon as you typedef a struct users of the type are not allowed to access its members

950717
typedef	struct
a typedef struct means private keep out

950740
mockups	balsamiq
i use screen mockups in balsamiq

950794
implements	extends
if you create a class extends uiview then you can make the file s owner for your xib implements the extended class

950856
nsis	prerequisites
then i use nsis to pack the msi the bootstrapper and the prerequisites framework sql ce... into a single setup.exe

950872
post	get
i get the impression from this and the previous post that you may be over-architecting your code

950877
getter	setter
you also can add more properties to the person domain object and not have to write more getter setter type statements

950878
put	get
and i have a servlet which tries to get the parameter that i put in the ajax method but isn t finding any parameters in the request object

950936
math.h	sqrt
if i include math.h it coudn t find sqrt

950992
hex	binary
when i open such a binary formatted serialized stream using a hex viewer a simple drag ndrop into vs will do i can see there s assembly information contained in this stream

950995
dictionary	map
map dictionary collection stack

951016
int	chars
establishdefaultdtr chars comportname int dtr

951025
getter	setter
if you use setprice to do this then setproduct would also do this and they would forever call each other in the second line hence i create an explicit link method instead of using the setter and getter

951033
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval do everything you need

951138
hash	salt
i suggest a salt hash of the id

951152
strcpy	strncpy
basically you can t write a drop in replacement for strcpy that takes the same arguments and hope to avoid the problems that produced strncpy in the first place and better replacements beyond that

951153
stdout	stderr
try iirc the log output of cvs is to stderr not stdout so the pipe doesn t catch that by default

951184
jquery	scriptaculous
scriptaculous provides some nice effects but in my opinion has been surpassed by jquery and its available plugins

951189
arraylist	treeset
i too typically use arraylist but i will use treeset or hashset depending on the circumstances

951192
jquery	scriptaculous
prototype and scriptaculous jquery mootools or moofx are some

951195
serializable	deserialization
serializable and deserialization of datastructures

951214
jquery	scriptaculous
i d personally say that mootools and prototype scriptaculous are the two best libraries if your only interested in the gui aspect of it although jquery has also recently seriously stepped up its animations and effects

951236
getattr	setattr
using getattr and setattr

951273
affinity	processors
assuming that the web server has multiple cpus i suppose that you could assign this web app to its own application pool and set the affinity to a particular processors to limit the impact on the other web applications

951320
width	height
what i want to do is if the actualweight is not null then return the actualweight for the actual weight dims or else use the actual_dims_lenght width and height

951320
width	height
the actualweight adcutal_dims_lenght width and height are all int integer value but the output for actual weight dims should be varchar 50

951320
width	height
edit the user can only pick either weight or dims on asp.net page and if user selected dims then they must supply length width and height

951325
postgresql	mysql
i m contemplating the switch mainly because of the more permissive license and tend to hear a lot of internet murmuring about how much better postgresql is than mysql but not many specifics

951330
avr	microcontroller
i need to build a prototype for a simple data collection device using an avr microcontroller

951333
min	max
when you are sure a test will ever only have a max min and mean - use design 2

951354
jquery	scriptaculous
my vote goes for prototype scriptaculous combo or jquery as well

951368
postgresql	mysql
postgresql s most useful features which mysql lacks in my opinion are

951376
put	get
what i want is to get vehicles assigned to x user and put it in a drop-down

951440
min	max
in this specific case -- aggregated data mean sum min max -- you have ambiguity because you re not dealing with atomic objects you re dealing with aggregates

951514
getter	setter
if you really have all those getter and setter then you need to validate your class better than in the constructor

951573
put	get
with this you will get an runtime error if you try to put something into list that is not assignable from objtype

951659
width	height
you should be able to make the textbox have a smaller width and just give it a bigger height and it should print on one page

951662
mouseover	mouseout
if you use the jquery library you can use the .hover event which merges the mouseover and mouseout event and helps you with the timing and child elements

951772
ant	maven
if you did you would just import a maven project or create a web free-form application and wire it up to your ant script

951822
arp	icmp	arp	dhcp	arp	snmp	icmp	dhcp	icmp	snmp	snmp	dhcp
pascal stang s avrlib provides libraries for basic networking arp ip icmp dhcp etc. which could be built upon to provide http and snmp if you find nothing pre-coded

951927
strcpy	strncpy	strlen	strncpy	strlen	strcpy
by declaring strcpy and strlen forbidden and taking 2-3 days out of the project to replace them with custom strncpy strnlen in all these projects we suddenly could run for days instead of hours

951939
rss	feed
my boss wants me to provide an rss feed to get updated content

951991
hash	md5
prf generation in ssl uses both md5 and sha1 in a bid to prevent the system from being compromised if one of the hash algorithms were sufficiently compromised

952035
rss	feed
rss is xml but it s xml meant to syndicate data with a consistent format there s a pretty good overview here and that allows feed readers and other consumers to know how to process and display them

952035
rss	feed
so if your boss wants to look at this data in his or her feed reader of choice then go for rss

952058
try-catch	exception-handling
this produces a cost during entering and exiting a try-catch block however when an exception-handling is thrown the runtime mechanism can quickly pop off the stack to find where to go

952080
width	height
does setting the width and height of the image force it or does wpf simply resize the first icon in the ico file

952107
subtraction	add
thus since the result of the subtraction is an int you can then add 7 to it

952126
lua	scheme
most naturally written in lexically scoped languages scheme javascript lua

952137
floating-point	integer
longer since python 2 s is integer division while perl s is floating-point

952170
post	get
you might wanna post this on uservoice cause its going to get into server details quickly but it seems to me that the file already exists

952183
aggregate-functions	sum
collation settings can affect some aggregate-functions but admittedly i don t see why it would alter the results of sum

952185
width	height
i was searching a solution to get height and width of an image using javascript

952185
width	height
finally i found a solution to get the image height and width even if the image does not exist in the browser cache

952195
width	height
i am trying to pass a pointer rgb that is initialized with memset to 0 and then looped through to place a 32 bit integer only in the bounds that i create with height and width input h and w as well as offset from the top left corner of the 2d array x and y

952204
ncover	fxcop
ncover nunit fxcop sandcastle wix lokad shared libraries autofac fxcop etc

952227
for-loop	arrays
to reverse an use enumerable.reverse - but if you need to iterate in reverse over a collection which is indexed by position such as an arrays or then it would be more efficient to use a for-loop starting at the end and working backwards

952264
folder	directory
the code above works well for recursively finding what files directory lie in a folder on my c

datalist	repeater
if you get tired of that learn to use a repeater or a datalist control or even the old datagrid control

952267
submit	submission
i want to use the standard multipart submit method rather than submission the file in an iframe

952279
vbscript	jscript
implement such as vbscript jscript

952319
protected-mode	real-mode
wsh can be run from either the protected-mode windows-based host wscript.exe or the real-mode command shell-based host cscript.exe

952333
jsf	seam
also since seam knits together jsf and ejb3 so the next step is to learn each of these

952384
int	double
typedef std list std pair int double pairlist

952444
httphandler	httpmodule
control of html is yours through httpmodule and httphandler and some of the issues mentioned above are fixed in asp.net 4.0

952460
put	get
that can get you into trouble if you maybe have oracle.dataaccess installed on your dev machine which would put it in the gac but when you deploy you just copy the .dll into place on the production machine

952467
gridview	rowdatabound
i have a gridview that i create a dynamic footer wired up to the rowdatabound event

952518
width	height
if i give textrenderer.measuretext some text to measure and width to use it will return the height needed to display that text

952518
width	height
if i give that text width and height to a linklabel it would display the text in the width and height provided with nothing clipped off

952595
int	double
with value types any struct including int float double etc the type is passed with zeros so the following are equivalent

952599
children	parent
when a class is created in java all its parent class constructors are called in order parent before children

952599
swt	swing
examine the documentation for swing or swt for information on the event models of those gui toolkits

952625
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the page break works in firefox and ie but not in safari 4 nor opera

952625
opera	safari
i can t seem to find a way to force a page break within a table in safari and opera

952657
int	double
edit i ve experimented a bit and i noticed that performance improved a bit by converting the coordinates which were previously in double to int to prevent wpf anti-aliasing sub-pixel lines

952659
hash	md5
the best way would be to use a hash function such as md5 or sha1 to generate it then you can truncate it at the desired length

952668
integer	unsigned
i used an unsigned integer to prevent entering negative ages and put the input into a loop

952686
udp	tcp
any kind of proprietary communication protocol running over udp or tcp would fit this description

952686
udp	tcp
we have a handful of applications that communicate with embedded systems using tcp and udp all using specialized protocols

952706
.htaccess	httpd.conf
to my httpd.conf in the hope that my .htaccess in the htdocs folder will be picked up with the following rules

952710
udp	tcp
this would mean udp tcp peer-to-peer etc

952720
udp	tcp
that ranges from third party communication products like tibco to fix over tcp sockets to in-house frameworks over udp multicast

952727
direct3d	directx
edit changed directx in original answer to direct3d

952742
firefox	safari
tested in safari 4 and firefox 3

952845
post	get
you can define a whole path with get and post and the cookies follows the path which means stuff like going to xx.com simulate valid button then go to xx.com valid.php with all the cookies and so on set then simulate something else.

952882
interbase	firebird
textolution fulltext search for interbase and firebird

952910
vim	emacs
in fact that was the main reason i switched from emacs to vim

952959
post	get
well i probably should not be answering this post because i am not sure that i fully understand your question but sometime you can get around namespace conflicts like the one i suspect you may be having by using the â œglobalâ directive

952964
for-loop	loops
the most common scenario for update is when you change a property say label1.text which will invalidate the label in a for-loop and that loops is temporarily blocking the message-loop

952976
fgets	strstr
that reads thousands of transactions files using the normal fopen fgets etc which we parse using normal c functions strstr strchr etc and return back a normalized char

952988
integer	unsigned
so far the only difference i see is that addroledef takes a 64 bit unsigned integer as one of the parameters and addrole takes a 32 bit unsigned integer

953079
innodb	myisam
innodb enforces foreign keys myisam does not

953145
integer	fractions
the integer portion is the number of whole days the fractions portion is the fractions of a day

953145

953153
ubuntu	linux
i tried to install the linux jdk 1.4 from the sun download site on ubuntu 9.04 but it wouldnt install

953173
activemq	rabbitmq
for implementations that can run on the windows platform activemq runs on windows as does rabbitmq

953185
javacc	recursive-descent
i ve implemented parsers for various different kinds of languages before using antlr javacc and custom recursive-descent parsers and when the language gets really big and complex you usually end up with one huuuuuuge grammar and the parser implementation gets really ugly really fast

953191
inherited	properties
if i set modifiers properties of tabcontrol on baseform to private then inherited forms will not be able to add new tabs

953191
inherited	properties
if i set modifiers properties of tabcontrol on baseform to protected the inherited forms can remove the tabcontrol from the baseform

953244
typedef	struct
therefore it s fairly common to typedef struct foo as foo

953250
gridview	objectdatasource	gridview	sqldatasource	sqldatasource	objectdatasource
bulk edit with gridview without xxxdatasource sqldatasource objectdatasource etc.

953251
georss	kml
ve has some nice capabilities of late including georss and kml support simple layers etc

953293
submit	submission
one possible solution i found for other s reference basically duplicates the form fields the same way i am but on the form submission submit button click he s calling a method that updates a hidden form field with the appropriate data from the dynamic data

953303
children	parent
i need each object to be closed because i want to be able to pick any parent and have all of it s children closed

953355
wordpress	phpbb
for example a blog running off wordpress a forum phpbb a store etc

953400
post	get
does javascript require some working around with when encoding strings to be post ed or get

953405
getter	setter
in the following setter i can access the property backing field directly or through the getter

953431
getter	setter
in this case the difference between the syntax is that in one case the getter setter get invoked while in the other case they don t

953431
getter	setter
this way only the getter setter have access to the unprotected variable and you can confirm any invariants about this value looking only at the getter and setter rather than at the whole class

953435
button	checkbox
this continues until the user gets to the end of the hierarchy at which time the window displays the parameters using the appropriate controls text boxes option button checkbox

953587
vb.net	vb6
as3 c++ c# vb.net vb6 delphi java or similar languages will be fine for answers

953602
textarea	textbox
i m using tinymce textarea or textbox for an event logger app and i need the text to be formatted a certain way

953602
textarea	textbox
i can t figure out how to do this without a table which i cannot nest in the textarea or textbox

953613
libpcap	wireshark
someone told me that there was a java wireshark library out there that used jni to wrap libpcap

953630
post	put
one of my working understadings of a restful architecture is that a rule of thumb on deciding between put and post is that post is used for creates and put is used for updates

953635
hide	show
i m trying to hide show items based off of their workflow being approved using moss 2007

953647
nullpointerexception	classcastexception
if you were to search the java bug database just before 1.5 was released you d find seven times more bugs with nullpointerexception than classcastexception

953687
jnetpcap	libpcap	winpcap	jnetpcap	winpcap	libpcap
on your libpcap question look at the winpcap links page and you will find jnetpcap

953689
textarea	textbox
you cannot -layout- content in a textbox or textarea

953710
put	get
for some reason if i put the inline keyword in either one of the implementation and declaration as well as in both places i get linker errors as shown

953711
hash	salt
and you can choose what salt size and hash function to use

953716
google-chrome	safari
you d need to look at google-chrome ie safari and any other browser you re interested in

953769
min	max
haven t you ever written a method or a class where the key concept of the method class wasn t tightly bound to a specific data type of the parameters instance variables think linked list max min functions binary search etc.

953810
keydown	keyup
handle the keydown and or the keyup event on your root grid

953813
keydown	keyup
silverlight 2 supports the keyup and keydown events only i believe - not keypress

953814
postgresql	mysql
postgresql has more established support for this but mysql has played catch up in the last year or so and has a working method of this in the latest versions

953814
postgresql	mysql
mysql s version is apparently marginally faster than postgresql but lacks some of the more advanced spatial features therefore it s pretty much limited to finding records that match a certain range of coordinates

953814
postgresql	mysql
i can t speak for microsoft s sql solution but for huge amounts of data you are going to want to stick with postgresql mysql for performance--unless you want to go with oracle but even then the performance difference would be negligible

953828
ssl	https
that error means that the tidssliohandlersocketopenssl.passthrough property is being set to false which would happen when posting to an https url before tidssliohandlersocketopenssl.init has been called to intialize the ssl context first

953850
fgets	fread
if the file is unicode you cannot read it with fgets you need to use fgetws or fread

953862
nofollow	noindex
to that i would think that a reasonable strategy would be to set 404 pages and placeholder pages to noindex nofollow and noarchive in their meta tags

953874
hide	show
this is a callback function for a jquery ajax function basically what is does is when all ajax is finished .ajaxstop it hide the loader then show the content

953893
hide	show
a solution we have done commercially in the past is basically the daemon writes to a log typically db with a date time stamp about what its doing and the web frontend just show the latest x amount of entries from the log with a little toggle to hide all of the looked in directory no file found messages worked fairly well we upgraded it later on with ajax timer that reloaded every 20 seconds

953898
postgresql	mysql
now if i want to put it on my own linode vps i have to configure mod_python or mod_wsgi as well as memcache ngix mysql or postgresql etc

953900
coldfusion	railo
of course this means that some frameworks are going to have to be rewritten for railo since this breaks full compatibility with adobe coldfusion

953927
width	height
you said you specified the height to 800px and wanted the div not to stretch when the width was greater than that.

953931
width	height
the width and height of the sidebar will vary from page to page so i can t use any hard values

953931
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i don t completely understand why i have to have the sidebar div first but it this code works fine in firefox google-chrome safari windows and ie8

953941
width	height
it appears that x y coordinates that are returned to me are from the center of the image instead of from the top left if i drag something to the top left corner of a room it shows x y as being half of the width and height

953950
int	chars	hash	md5
this has to be unique and usually not sequential - examples are a uuid guid or a hash md5 of the int id but be careful of chars that are not compatible with http

954024
switching	screens
no switching to full screens mode

954040
firefox	safari
html5 defines a contenteditable attribute that can be applied to any element including the body element it s supported in ie which i think invented the attribute safari 2.0 and firefox 3.x where x is at least 5

954047
google-chrome	safari
tested and confirmed in ff3 google-chrome safari win and most importantly ie6 ie7 even though i still hate ie

954069
cpu	processors
core two duo etc.. does each cpu core processors have its own cache

954080
post	get
i have a fairly simple scenario where i have a strongly typed view that is correctly populated from the controller on the get but then when it post the form to the controller the reqeust is full of all the right values and right key names for the default model binder to correctly populate one of my model objects and the dmb creates the correct opject but it never populates any of the properties they re all in their default state

954154
ssl	ntlm
you can also use ntlm ssl certificate mapping or digest authentication

954170
width	height
would it be reasonable as a work around to simply translate the location using the height and width of the object

954170
width	height
on import can you simply add half the width and height to the x and y respectively

954185
min	max
this says that you might want to set min max for all but the last columns then set min preferred on the last column and either not set max or set a very large value for max

954198
for-loop	loops
this allows a for-loop to be written as a foreach loops

954230
post	put
edit replaced incorrect method put with post given the request is not sending the entire resource just an update of a part of the resource

954251
codeigniter	cakephp
i also know that i18n is supported in zend cakephp and codeigniter

954330
lisp	scheme
scheme macros hygienic macros are completely different from traditional lisp macros

954330
lisp	scheme
some implementations of scheme offer lisp macros in addition to scheme macros but this is not required by the scheme standard

954338
jobs	cron
if your team is small five or fewer and not dispersed over great distances or multiple timezones a reasonable first approximation is to make test a git workspace on a server upon which your toolchain has been installed along with some cron jobs so that this workspace is updated and rebuilt every night usually

954380
folder	directory
go into iis find the virtual directory that contains your project go into properties for that folder and in the virtual directory tab you ll see application settings near the bottom

954395
post	get
post is non-idempotent meaning if you send the same post request many times you will get many new items

954414
post	get
if you re not getting that warning you might be using get instead of post which is not a good idea for actions which change or insert data

954418
opera	safari
yes this attribute first appeared in ie then it was added in mozilla about the end of 2003 then in opera 9 and safari 2

954445
typedef	struct
typedef struct #39

954481
rss	feed
i am generating an rss 2.0 feed using system.servicemodel.syndication.syndicationfeed for outlook 2007 sp2 clients and i would like to know if it is possible to set the update limit for the feed in order to be recognized by outlook client

954507
yourkit	jprofiler	profiler	yourkit
as the others have mentioned it is a memory leak if you are using java you can use profilers like jprofiler yourkit profiler to see where the memory leaks happen

954524
post	get
another solution is to make two different controller methods for get and post operations

954534
ssl	https
either the conversation between those two is secured by ssl https but then both ends need to participate or not

954568
ssl	https
when you connect to a server marked with server side ssl server marked with https it sends a copy of its cert to the client your browser which verifies if its a genuine cert

954605
nsstring	nsdata
m stuck m trying to create an uiimage from a byte array which i get from a webservice.it comes embedded in a xml.i can parse the xml and get the byte array as a string.then i convert the byte array which is in nsstring to nsdata

954613
post	get
the difference between a get and post request is that in the former all data passed is part of the url string

954613
post	get
this assumes the receiving end is capable of receiving data through get requests not only post requests

954613
post	get
most decent server-side libraries allow data passed through both get and post request although ymmv

954620
udp	tcp
if you need to know this type of information you need to build it into the format that you layer ontop of udp like the tcp sequence number

954620
udp	tcp
also note that the tcp sequence number implementation also helps to detect out of order packets take may happen when using udp

954648
width	height
if you are adding a new view you should be sure to set the frame property to a position and width and height that will not cause it to be bigger than it should

954649
factors	mean
not sure what you mean by low activity but i believe the major factors would be how much you actually need to do to handle each request

954675
getter	setter
a and b don t have any behavior - they are java beans with getter and setter

954724
getter	setter
instead access their getter and setter using reflection

954762
stateless	stateful
i recently took the time to change all the stateful skins to stateless skins and my cpu droped from about 40 to about 3-4

954804
jar	manifest.mf
you can try looking inside the jar s manifest.mf in the meta-inf directory - it should indicate what version yo re working with

954851
hide	show
or alternatively i need to hide show details on my existing masterpage dependant on the active theme hope that makes sense

954904
firefox	safari
the contenteditable property for ie firefox and safari

954911
post	get
most people know about the get and post methods because that s what they use when building forms

955058
mouseover	mouseout
bind a mouseover event handler to the env. elts.content element that will set the env.paused value to true and a mouseout event handler to set it back to false

955092
equals	gethashcode
you d definitely also want to implement and as well as all the corresponding operators and overrides of equals gethashcode etc

955117
post	get
i thought the problem was that the request had the host set to the requesting server not the remote server but then i noticed in firebug that the request is sent as get not post

955137
spaces	delimiter
it s confusing me slightly because the field delimiter appears to be a spaces but the fields themselves are sometimes quoted with quotation marks and other times by square brackets

955154
inherited	properties
you can create your own principal class with the required properties that inherited from a generic principal and then set the user properties of your current context to be the a user of that type

955168
spaces	delimiter
then you should be able to use a standard parser using spaces as a delimiter respecting quotes

955182
hex	binary
if that still doesn t do what you want in terms of hex binary i suggest you email its author preferably with a patch

955217
post	get
if i remove datatype json or use post it s synchronous again but i m dependant on using both json and get

955240
liferay	web-inf
this is not sufficient to deploy the portlets since liferay needs to augment the web.xml in my portlets web-inf to insert servlet mapping tags

955264
youtube	vimeo
my client has come back saying he wants to play mp4s on the site - plus being able to embed some other videos from youtube vimeo etc..

955265
versioning	upgrade
however it can be a bit fiddly to set up currently due to it requiring newer the latest versioning of the air sdk see the release notes on how to upgrade

955269
width	height
you can do that by adding width or height to your div or zoom 1

955282
mouse	keyboard
there are many managed wrappers for doing global system hooks for mouse and keyboard

955283
inherited	subclassing
i need to add the specific parameters of corresponding subclassing that inherited the class pointed to in the service of the wsdl

955286
youtube	vimeo
now if you re client is only really talking about embedding videos in blog entries or articles that s a very trivial task youtube vimeo and other video sharing sites already supply the html embed code that s needed to display a video on a page

955384
post	get
if you do a post or remove the datatype you will get an access error because of same-origin policy

955438
jquery	scriptaculous
in time i got more and more into jquery and now i want to replace my current scriptaculous scripts with jquery scripts

955470
.nettiers	codesmith
normally page-aware select stored procedures created by for instance .nettiers codesmith template return a multiple result

955541
jpa	javax.persistence
even though you are using the javax.persistence package you are using hibernate jpa

955575
vb.net	vb6
the second biggest issue i have personally observed is vb6 developers writing vb6 code in vb.net

955592
inherited	properties
in winforms form had a clientsize properties inherited from control which returns the size of its client area the area inside the title bar and window borders

955604
x86	64bit
flag it s a x86 64bit cpu even if you have 32 bit linux installed

955610
pascal	delphi
free pascal compiler lazarus is not close to the latest delphi features but it is quite stable even though there are still bugs to find out

955613
width	height
function imageloop images speed width height inc

955645
int	chars
if you use a id int or a chars referential integrity is preserved in both cases

955645
int	chars
an int is 4 bytes long so it s equal in size as a chars 4

955645
int	chars
if you use chars x where x 4 your chars key will be shorter than a int one

955645
int	chars
if you use chars x where x 4 your chars key will be greater than a int one

955645
int	chars
anyway when talking about tables with - say - 500 records the total overhead of a chars 5 over a int key would be just 500 bytes a value hilarious for database where some tables could have millions of records

955645
int	chars
considering that countries and currencies are limited in numbers a few hundred at most you have no real gain in using an id int instead of a chars 4

955645
int	chars
therefore though i usually use an id int key for most of my tables in several circumstances i choose to have a pk fk made of chars countries languages currencies are amongst those cases

955672
actualheight	actualwidth
as trent said actualwidth and actualheight are also viable solutions

955679
post	get
i can successfully post the data and get a response from the server however it is simply returning the code for the home page instead of the xml

955692
pop-up	dialog
the providers try to prevent this id images browser certificates call back verification etc but it doesn t help when the black hat site pop-up a dialog page that says enter your openid user name and password and the genius user complies

955693
yslow	pagespeed
google just released pagespeed a plug-in for firebug just like yslow and it s got some pretty cool features

955776
terminate	timeout
you can also set an idle timeout in minutes after which a worker process is terminate

955801
post	get
i found a few forum post that seem to be from people having a similar problem but they never get a clear answer

955823
mvp	presenter
since the mvc framework isn t an option then i would take a look at model view presenter pattern mvp with either the passive view approach or superviser approach as described here

955841
ironruby	ironpython
i ve been reading up on f# ironruby and ironpython

955841
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython seems to catch my eye the most although i m not completely closed to ironruby

955841
ironruby	ironpython
f# as i understand it is still more of a research language so i m a bit wary of writing production code using it - ironpython and ironruby have also pre-existed for several years whereas f# is completely new

955864
uiview	subviews
in this uiview i draw custom subviews with labels etc it s a scoreboard with various colors

955881
dom4j	xom
here s yet another solution using the xom library that competes with my dom4j answer

955881
dom4j	xom
this is part of my quest to find a good dom4j replacement where xom was suggested as one option.

955881
dom4j	xom
now adding the child node is simple and similar as with dom4j except that xom doesn t let you add the original root element which already belongs to newnodedocument

955922
x86	64bit
adding true support for enc to the 64bit clr is unfortunately a large work item and other features were prioritized over this given the work around of changing the platform target to x86

955953
getter	setter
i d like to add that once you ve hunted for a bug in some large legacy code bases with public members you ll never ever ever write a class without setter getter

955953
getter	setter
1 setter getter you put a breakpoint 5 minutes later bug is solved

955960
versioning	upgrade
i ve tried everything from deleting the msadc folder from iis and re-adding it i ve uninstalled sql native and reinstalled it and subsequently upgrade it to the newest versioning

955987
stdout	stderr
stream stderr stdin or stdout

955993
ironruby	ironpython
additionally f# will be included in visual studio 2010 whereas ironpython and ironruby require extra steps to integrate them with visual studio

955993
ironruby	ironpython
that said asp.net and mvc support for f# is pretty much non-existent whereas ironpython and ironruby have various efforts underway already

955999
textarea	textbox
this is working fine with textbox controls and dropdownlists etc however when i add the htmlattributes to the textarea it stops working claiming that the best overloaded method has some invalid arguments the code that is failing is

956043
equals	gethashcode
the tuple needs to override gethashcode equals and iequatable

956098
hide	show
a general strategy is to place the loading image in a div or span tag and show or hide it when you want to show it

956098
hide	show
if you want to show it initially just place a jquery hide function on the div or span in the jquery on ready function

956098
hide	show
see the jquery docs on show and hide

956109
hide	show
the following will show a loading image pre-existing then load some html retrieved via ajax then upon completion it will hide the loading image

956114
implements	extends
to accomplish this i also had to create a new class that implements com.adobe.cairngorm.commands.icommand that i extends for all commands in my projects

956124
getter	setter
in some cases for visibility you might want certain parts of the code to see the concrete class and have access to the setter and some others to see only getter give them access to the interface only

956124
public	protected
this cannot always be achieved with public protected private

956155
getter	setter
however i ve noticed that getter and setter aren t really used in c# as they are in java or php and and i suspect that there is a better more succinct standard way to do this in c#

956172
jdom	xom	xstream	xom	xstream	jdom
you can use any decent xml library like jdom or xom or xstream

956180
getter	setter
i ve noticed that getter and setter aren t really used in c# as they are in java or php

956180
getter	setter
yes and the reason is simple .net s properties offer a special syntactic sugar to express getter and setter

956184
versioning	upgrade
today i got an update notification asking me to upgrade internet explorer to versioning 8

956186
getter	setter
properties are just syntactic sugar for the getter setter methods you would normally do in java

956206

956649
versioning	upgrade
how do you select which versioning of the api to use - through a preprocessor define in the code or does updating to the latest platform sdk simply upgrade to whatever is the latest versioning can t imagine this last option but you never know...

956662
hash	md5
you re effectively doing an md5 hash of the password and then using the algorithm defined in a global constant encrypt_algorithm

956662
post	get
you d have to post the value of that variable to get a better answer

956662
hash	md5
by the way using a straight non-salted md5 hash of the password can be bad

portrait	landscape
if i go to any view on portrait and then try to go to landscape the iphone performs the animation for rotation but my controls don t seem to move to the right places

956675

957110
ienumerable	iqueryable
i went with returning a list but i could have returned an ienumerable or iqueryable

957110
ienumerable	iqueryable
in my reading it seemed iqueryable had more functionality for linq to sql but since i am returning a simple two column list then i only need to return an ienumerable or list

957110
ienumerable	iqueryable
aka - should i just have returned and ienumerable or perhaps gone with iqueryable

957151

957266
post	put
so if you use the instance variable post you can put all the form code into _form and just call the partial and it will handle the rest based on if you pass in a new record or an existing record

957271
versioning	upgrade
the only way that you will be able to force upgrade is to create a must-have application for enterprise that requires the latest versioning of internet exploder to function

they go into a grid on the window using xaml with height width margin attributes

957306
mouseleave	mouseenter
my current work around is to set clear boolean flags in the mouseenter and mouseleave handlers but there must be a better way

957329
versioning	upgrade
i think the best way is to repackage your site only for ie7+ displaying the old versioning for ie6 and advertise it on your ie6 site in an attractive way like new upgrade to go to v2 the new featured thing and other deceptive but harmless ways of marketing p

957501
organization	naming	getter	setter

inherited	properties
i have an object that can t inherited dependencyobject or use notifypropertychanged and i ve binded it to quite a few controls so when the properties change i don t want to go to each control and change it s value on the code so i m thinking there must be a way to tell the xaml to rebind all that it s bound to with one or two lines of code instead of going

using equals or tostring work on valuetype object but not with referencetype which can be null and therefore do not allow equals or tostring

958138
maven	buildr
buildr maven on a couple of projects i didn t want to convert plus nexus and hudson

958434
qstring	qlist
value of qstring and qlist

958467
int	boolean
you can store up to 64 boolean variables into a single bigint column as a mask with one bool per bit and compute the match extremely fast as bit_count the_column user_preferences which will count how many bits are equal between the column and the mask giving the user s preferences should php give you problems manipulating 64-bit int you can use two columnns of 32 bits each summing the two bit counts will still be very fast

width	margin
its just using the width of the browser but pushed over a bit with a margin so its actually hanging over underneath the sidebar

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i m a .net developer but have dabbled in linux a bit so i m not completely turned off to the idea of an ubuntu or debian server.

958784
width	height
i would assume that you are doing all of this with the flash ide because had you loaded this all at runtime with purely code you would have went out of your way to force these to center by specifying an x and y that is half it s height and width

958784
width	height
if your bitmaps have negative values of half their width and height as their x and y values this would center your bitmap in the middle of the movieclip sprite as opposed to having a top-left registration

yslow	pagespeed
you may also want to look at tools like yslow or pagespeed if you re looking for other ways of improving the performance of a web page

959276
inherited	properties
the best advice i ever received for ood was to look to the smallest object that each logical branch of your app can be distilled to it probably on has native types for properties with .net there no point in reinventing framework objects either so they can be in your base class and then using inherited polymorphism and encapsulation to expand on those base classes until you have an object that encapsulates the logical branch

959280
int	boolean
as for the int and other numerical and boolean types - those have a fixed system-given length - no problems there

959296

openbsd	linux
