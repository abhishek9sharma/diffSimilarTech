in some cases it is not possible to use inherited in which case there are ways to read the proto-stream via either protoreader or by using a second model which only reads that properties then resetting the source and reading again

14884644
inherited	properties
however because every class inherited from object which is dynamic we can look up their .constructor properties just by casting an instance to object

14884644
post	get
i learned of this from the post get the class used to create an object instance in as3 by josh tynjala

14884676
src	attr
tag pos 1 type img attr src

14884677
rss	feed
i ve got a windows8 app that i ve made via javascript css and html and it displays a rss feed

14884677
rss	feed
i have a animated loading animation gif but i don t know how to display it while the rss feed it loading

14884681
serializable	deserialization
xml serializable deserialization is case sensitive and this is caught me out more than once

14884691
cypher	gremlin
the model dsl the built-in querying eg the built-in indexing and the lucene gremlin and cypher behind that

14884728
cos	sin
take a look at java.lang.math and java.awt.graphics which you already have an instance of with this you can use the draw polygon function to compute the points of your rectangle which you can do using the sin and cos functions in java.lang.math

14884728
subtraction	addition
from there it s just a matter of doing some addition and subtraction with the points that you have and your dimension values to get the last point kitty-corner to your starting point

14884739
width	height
will add 20 pixels to the .elem s sides causing the actual width and height to be 140px total

14884742
google-chrome	safari
i can t figure out why my stylesheet is only working with google-chrome and safari

14884742
opera	firefox
it doesn t work with ie firefox or opera

14884742
google-chrome	safari
since it only works in safari and google-chrome i was thinking it had something to do with some webkit stuff i had put in the code

14884748
leaflet	openlayers
open source choices include openlayers and leaflet

14884761
super	self
in any case the difference between the two patterns besides self vs super is explained in my answer to this other question but in short dispatch_once is the modern way to do this

14884771
getter	setter
once compiled their namespace cannot be changed to my knowledge so any non-private property is implicitly enumerable and modifiable whether or not you ve written getter setter ie

14884782
min	max
you need to use positive infinity in the min calculation negative infinity is correct in the max version

14884782
min	max
this also simplifies the min and max code a bit

14884784
super	self
in a static method self simply refers to the class itself and super to its direct superclass and i d see it as a shorthand for writing the actual class name nothing more

14884839
button	checkbox
with this form it s using the latest update of jquery ui to styalize the button and checkbox

14884924
children	parent
since you are using jquery you should use it s on method to attach a single listener to the parent dom element and use the selector parameter to properly delegate the event to it s children the button popups

14884930
button	checkbox
when you click the checkbox check to see if it is checked or unchecked and based on that enable or disable the button

14884956
ssl	ntlm
the curl verbose log show the ssl handshake happening first and the ntlm succeeds as the next step

14884964
hash	md5
so a hacker will be trying to decrpyt this md5 hash when in fact it is nothing like that

14884995
textview	imageview
then when you load up a png to display it you ll need to also load up the txt file that shares the same name and populate the data contained inside to some textview or something near your imageview

14885000
strlen	strcmp	strncmp	strlen	strncmp	strcmp
therefore if one of the arguments is known with 100 certainty to be null-terminated it is a string literal there is no security benefit whatsoever in using strncmp with n with a call to strlen as part of the third argument to limit the comparison to the known string length because strcmp will already never read more characters than are in that known-terminating string

14885000
strlen	strcmp	strncmp	strlen	strncmp	strcmp
in fact it seems to me that a call to strncmp whose length argument is a strlen on one of the first two arguments is only different from the strcmp case in that it wastes time linear in the size of the known-terminating string by evaluating the strlen expression

14885001
dictionary	map
but at that point you re probably better off with a dictionary comprehension than a map call and a dictionary constructor

14885024
int	chars	int	boolean
it seems that boolean int and strings c chars are marshalled flawlessly i don t talk about memory management policy and who s responsible to release memory or return value policies

14885030
strncmp	strlen
if you use strlen in a strncmp it will traverse the pointer until it sees a null in the string

14885062
button	checkbox
seems i misread your question and you want the button enabled when any checkbox is checked

14885067
getter	setter
in general the only advantage of adding a property on top of a variable or having a automatic property over a readonly static is your ability to perform additional checks in the setter or adding some code in the getter say to collect access statistics or for logging

14885090
arraylist	treeset
i have used various java collections treeset hashmap arraylist before quite successfully

14885099
scrypt	pbkdf2
don t try to invent your own crypto use standardized hashing algorithms like bcrypt scrypt or pbkdf2

14885166
min	max
you can add xlim ylim zlim lines to fix your axis with the global min to max value of each of them

14885216
folder	directory
the code below will appropriately rename all folder in the current directory that have at least one space in the name

14885229
strncmp	strcmp
now i agree that this isn t particularly useful use of strncmp and i can t see any benefit in this over strcmp

14885237
getter	setter
my workaround was to turn the onetoone relationship into a manytoone with an associated arraycollection with a custom getter and setter which only sets and returns the 0-th element of the collection

14885245
mouseover	mouseout
i want it to have 2 different images - the mouseout image and the mouseover image

14885260
width	height
well you have to set your dialog s height and width before to show this dialog.show

14885275
scrypt	pbkdf2
summary pbkdf2 bcrypt scrypt provide this

14885328
ubuntu	centos
i am particularly interested in what s needed for ubuntu and centos

14885370
mouse	keyboard
the browser is in control of mouse keyboard events - the flash container can only gain control of them if it is in focus

14885396
kombu	celery
i m using django with celery and kombu to make use of django s own database as a broker backend

14885396
post	get
those last two lines are not shown immediately but get displayed when my api receives a post request that runs the code in the put_message section above

14885422
post	get
whene i press submit button it deliver the value of textarea and some value of hidden field with existing cookies which are get when i logged in through webview post method

14885432
decoder	encoder
it is a generation of a data structure encoder decoder in a certain programming language

14885432
decoder	encoder
after that one can use these encoder decoder and integrate into an information system for exchange of information

14885437
maven	pom.xml
the pom.xml is in memory as a java object tree of the project setup at build time only when maven reads the pom.xml and creates the model

14885450
put	get
you have to either put the js variable into the url query string essentially sending a get request where you can access those variables from php or use ajax

14885461
width	margin
it actually uses the width to figure out how much margin is there

14885461
width	height
saying margin-top 10 will make that value 10 of the available width not the available height and making it negative will just negate that value

14885471
google-chrome	firefox
edit for info the issue i m having is in google-chrome and firefox - ie 8 sets the td height they way i want

14885507
uiview	calayer
this code takes a calayer either directly or from the backing layer of a uiview and renders its contents to a texture

14885520
width	height
you should first use an absolute width and height for both the paper and the path

14885529
getter	setter	superclass	subclassing
you haven t shown us the code of the superclass but one approach might be to create a mirror of the shape field in the subclassing override the getter and add a setter

14885530
hide	show
you can always use an accordion or some other method to collapse or show hide the docs

14885557
cucumber	vcr
hi i am trying to test google auth with cucumber using vcr with a tag

14885561
super	self
do else elsif end ensure false for if in module next nil not or redo rescue retry return self super then true undef unless until when while yield

14885576
getter	setter
i tend to prefix all private variables with _ even ones without getter or setter

14885576
superclass	subclassing
the only reason you would ever use one is to allow subclassing to access variables in the superclass

14885576
superclass	subclassing
however if the value of the protected variable was somehow very important to the superclass the superclass would never know if the subclassing modified it

14885576
getter	setter
better to make it private and provide a protected getter and or a setter for the subclass even though it is a little more work

14885628
inherited	properties
i m asking because i ve inherited some code using pretty heavy prototyping and i m running into all kinds of issues trying to reference properties and methods on objects from within themselves

14885632
onmouseover	onclick
also if i change the onclick events to onmouseover the hidden elements are kept hidden after the loop has finished

14885636
inherited	properties
in your case it s myotherobj.prototype and likely that has a constructor properties that is now inherited myobj.prototype.constructor myotherobj.prototype.constructor myotherobj

14885646
getter	setter
let us see a degree to radian converter using a getter setter

14885646
getter	setter
you might also have a look on object.defineproperty which allows to define both standard properties and getter setter but with more option especially the option to hide a property which allows it not to be enumerated

14885673
getter	setter
but the best solution is change the other class so that it has accessible getter and or setter methods .

14885690
width	height
then i ve also readjusted the width and height of the box to be relative to 1 5 of the viewport

14885723
freemarker	velocity
i would recommend freemarker or velocity as a replacement for jsp

14885757
nsmutablestring	nsstring
since now it is initialized as it is trying to call appendstring on nsmutablestring object which accepts only nsstring type as its inputs where as you are passing an nsnumber in it

14885773
hash	md5
i have generated hash values for files using md5

14885784
hash	md5
the md5 hash of a file is related to its content not its permissions

14885799
puma	unicorn
based on your standalone req i d recommend a puma or unicorn server behind a nginx reverse proxy

14885810
hash	md5
the md5 hash will change if there s any change to whatever data you input to the md5 hashing function

14885810
hash	md5
if you fed it the permissions and the permission change then the md5 hash will change

14885810
hash	md5
if you fed it only the contents then the md5 hash will change only if the contents change

14885810
put	get
what you get out depends on what you put in

14885836
min	max
i want to find the min max average total and count for each animal type but only for a particular owner

14885855
width	height
it will better if you calculate width and height and round to power of two before connecting in data array

14885862
portrait	landscape
anything that would save time with page formatting landscape vs portrait a4 vs letter etc

14885867
for-loop	loops
i tried a nested for-loop in a while loops but i m getting some strange results

14885869
comparator	comparable
returns a comparator that imposes the reverse of the natural ordering on a collection of objects that implement the comparable interface

14885881
min	max
select min weight max weight sum weight count from animals_table group by animal

14885886
free	strdup
just remember that the string returned from strdup will need to be free d later

14885895
ggplot2	aesthetics
one of my favorite aspects of using the ggplot2 library in r is the ability to easily specify aesthetics

14885921
mouseleave	mouseenter
as a side note if you need to have different functions performed for mouseenter vs mouseleave u need to use the xml format using the .on method is slightly different than the traditional .hover method

14885922
setinterval	settimeout
the best you can do afaik is to cut your processing code into chunks as small as possible then execute them with settimeout or setinterval using a low value for delay but preferably non-zero so the rest of the page won t freeze

14885937
post	get
as mentioned in the comments get and post methods result in data being passed in to different global variables in php -- get _get post _post

14885943
google-chrome	firefox
so i tried with the following tutorial and its worked amazing with firefox and google-chrome

14886024
post	get
that will stop the submit event and you should get the post event to occur

14886090
viewdidload	viewdidappear
all i had to do was separate adding the full background image on viewdidload but having the fade out animation inside the viewdidappear method

14886105
unsigned	short
i would like to use parallel processing for taking array statistics for large arrays of unsigned short 16 bit values

14886111
width	height
i want to use an element s new width and height which is set by the loaded css

14886140
pull	push
i added the files locally that i wanted to push the the repository using git add but then realized i should pull the readme first from the github repository

14886178
np-hard	np-complete
i have a feeling it is np-complete or at least np-hard

14886305
inherited	subclassing
the client views exposed by a particular session bean are not inherited by a subclassing that also happens to define a session bean

14886319
addclass	removeclass
there is another possible improvement here which only uses removeclass loading and no addclass green technique but that is another story case

14886361
mouse	keyboard
ournal and you will be able to press alt + j to click that button from the keyboard without touching the mouse which is very important for accessibility reasons

14886361
keydown	keyup
this is why the keypress event isn t doing what you want the keydown and keyup events would have the same problem

14886381
namedtuple	dictionary
but as rohit suggests would you want to isn t a dictionary better or perhaps the op would like a namedtuple

14886393
width	height
the answer is the height width of the windows bounds is the same no matter if retina or not

14886395
apache	nginx
i have apache on my localhost and nginx on my web server

14886424
width	margin
i m using jquery ui draggable to drag a whose width is calculated as part of the layout margin auto

14886441
put	get

i used the width inherited properties to inherited the parents width no matter what size it is

14886575
filtering	grouping
beside it does not show in the filtering of the association the grouping id

14886582

what i would like to do is get the binary data and put it into the form let the user add the description and then submit the form with the binary file data

14886589
put	get
i would like to automatically move messages that get put into the spam folder into another folder in my local pst file

gridview	checkboxlist
i need to populate my gridview after i select a checkbox from checkboxlist

14886668
sqoop	hadoop
sqoop 1 is older fully functional and mature project supporting hadoop 0.20 1.x 0.23 and 2.0.x you can download the bits from here

14886703
versioning	upgrade
the problem is that the gcc you used to compile your installed versioning of ruby got removed as part of the xcode upgrade

14886703
versioning	upgrade
using rvm rebuild your ruby you might want to upgrade to the latest versioning as well

14886711
post	put
i m a very new asp.net developer and web developer at all for that matter. i want to put together a simple website that has the web server providing a form containing a few controls for setting a timer and a start button which when pressed post the configuration to the server for how long the timer is set for. and also starts the timer in the client upon expiration it would also post to the server that this has been done

14886726

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works as intended in all the browsers on my mac computer safari google-chrome and firefox and another mac that i tested it on

14886752
matplotlib	scipy
when looking for a free matlab substitute i was directed to use scipy numpy and matplotlib as the best alternatives

14886842
stdout	stderr
i basically want to reopen stderr stdout so they write to one logfile with both the stream and the timestamp included on every line

14886844
min	max
the default is min on the left and max on the right

14886858
width	margin
you just need to set the width and the margin on the cloned element based on the draggable object when it is dropped using

14886869
client-side	server-side
as this is a client-side thing i wouldn t use asp.net obviously it still stands for the server-side anyway

14886869
post	get
this is why when a user presses f5 or hits refresh for a post d page they get a message-box prompting them in cryptic language to resubmit the form however often if the user resubmits the form they ll end up breaking the application because their data will be processed twice

14886885
setinterval	clearinterval
i think you re looking for setinterval and clearinterval

14886939
width	height
i have an audio element on a page which is currently being loaded inside an iframe with zero height and width

14886987
qmainwindow	qdialog
the problem when a qmainwindow or qdialog s corresponding .ui file has been altered in qt designer the entire project must be cleaned and rebuilt in order for those changes to take effect make clean then make

you can now as of about 10min ago set min max attributes then call

14887100
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
now this works fine in google-chrome and safari and i have had to use assitional css settings for firefox but ie and opera both display my ribbon div about 25px higher than in google-chrome or safari

14887129
unsigned	short
note that xs_utf16 is an unsigned short

14887179
min	max
step 3 create a function to determine max min values for both charts to make sure they are on the same scale

14887202
stdout	fflush
after your first printf should force the type a string prompt to appear immediately and even if your output is unbuffered fflush stdout is harmless

14887259
int	boolean
partnumber string padsperstrip int and verified boolean

14887290
gentoo	linux
the system is linux gentoo x64 the code is c++

there is no problem accessing my remote github repo from terminal but egit is not working

14887463
superclass	subclassing
i m trying to program a chess game so i have a an array of superclass called gamepiece for which the subclassing pawnpiece extends

14887471
post	get
each post or get to the server generally sends that session id or token with it in order to tell the server who it is an identifier

14887482
libstdc++	libc++
you could also try recompiling after navigating to build settings apple llvm compiler 4.2 - language c++ standard library and selecting libstdc++ gnu c++ standard library rather than xcode 4.5 s default libc++ llvm c++ standard library with c++11 support

14887497
google-chrome	firefox
i use firebug in firefox and developer tools in google-chrome

14887497
google-chrome	firefox
the response is of type object in google-chrome and is a string in firefox

14887506
stdout	stderr
write another script that runs your script with stdout and stderr replaced with pipes

14887506
stdout	stderr
you can get away without it if you combine stdout and stderr in one stream

14887525
google-chrome	firefox
â google-chrome uses individual sqlite files per hostname and protocol where firefox uses a single webappsstore.sqlite file with the reversed hostname and protocol in a scope column

14887577
lxml	beautifulsoup
the problem is that a href actually has two spaces not just one there are some that are a href with one space that i do not want to retrieve so using lxml has proven to be quite a pain and i do not want to use beautifulsoup for other reasons

14887590
vb.net	vb6
note that if you were going to reference this dll created by vb6 to a vb.net project you need to add something in your vb.net code

14887593
mouseup	mousedown
specifically touchstart as the equivalent of mousedown and touchend touchcancel as the equivalents of mouseup

14887649
int	double
function.cpp returns an int array while wrapper.py tries to interpret them as double

14887671
folder	directory
you will also need some code to make sure the correct folder trees are replicated in your target directory

14887681
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to upload a file using jquery ajax + formdata object found on google-chrome and firefox browsers

14887723
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
ie9+ firefox google-chrome and safari are all quite standards-compliant and should show you nearly identical results

14887737
integer	unsigned
then there is no longer any possibility of undefined behavior due to integer overflow because all types involved in arithmetic are unsigned so everything wraps mod 2 n where n is the width of unsigned in bits

14887743
folder	directory
i only want to create the new directory if the source contains .mp3s otherwise it could lead to a bunch of empty folder in the destination

14887822
devise	cancan
in a rails 3.2 app i m using devise + cancan

14887845
width	height
clearrect takes four arguments x y width and height

14887876
ravendb	couchdb
hbase on the other hand is a pretty typical nosql database engine that in spirit compares to couchdb ravendb etc

14887877
rtp	rtsp
so i guess i have to use rtsp to figure out what to send over the rtp

14887877
rtp	rtsp
p.s i am not allowed to use rtsp modules or rtp modules

14887905
integer	unsigned
as was pointed out above you can improve the predictable behavior of your rather poor hashing algorithm by declaring everything as unsigned integer

14887932
public	protected
basically any protected and public functions located in either my_controller or my_staffcontroller will be accessible from derived controllers that extend the extended controller

14887952
versioning	upgrade
when i upgrade to the latest symfony 2.1 versioning and the latest fosuserbundle from the master branch after fixing lots of stuff the labels are not being translated form.username

14887955
google-chrome	safari
here s my advice use google-chrome or safari

14888103
for-loop	loops
oldkeychar is an empty list so when you run this it will enter the while loops then enter the for-loop assigning 0 to num

14888137
getter	setter	equals	tostring	equals	compareto	tostring	compareto	tostring	getter
lets say entity e is simple class without any logic â only attributes and getter setter equals hashcode tostring or maybe compareto

14888174
int	boolean
i d like to know if there is a way to do this without converting them to int actually using boolean logic

14888176
folder	directory
after experimenting around i found that nothing bad happens when i put a folder named files under any other directory including sites all and nothing bad happens when you put a differently named folder under sites default but if i put a folder named files under sites default it causes the css to not render

14888182
int	boolean
i have a function that takes a bunch of parameters strings int boolean etc... and it returns an image type bitmap

14888195
super	extends
the filter i was extends was form_login_filter which is correct however i needed to perform all the retrievals j_username j_password here and call the authentication manager manually instead of calling the super method which passes the retrievals and auth manager calls to spring

14888274
lxml	beautifulsoup
one time i measured that beautifulsoup was 10 times slower than a regex and that lxml was around 50 times slower

14888289
int	chars
so declare a to be int not chars

14888340
sudo	passwd
if i remove echo xsxsxs| sudo from the line 4 and then execute then it show error you must be root user invalid passwd segmentation fault

14888363
int	chars
read the int as a string and write each digit as a chars

14888370
int	boolean
when it comes to php strings int boolean etc

14888406
post	get
issue is because you are posting the form to welcome1.php action of your form and code to get the post value is in new1.php

14888433
width	height
now you need to make some ui changes say in portaint you have width 320 and height 480

14888451
width	height
i want these slideshows to have different dimensions for width and height preferably transition time also and my problem is that the function will only run one slideshow

14888455
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
you need to check for innertext for ie google-chrome safari or textvalue for firefox google-chrome safari property

14888494
google-chrome	firefox
i would suggest checking webrtc api which allows to access video and audio streams in google-chrome and firefox browsers

after that you need to calculate the height needed for it with the width you have available and then add that value to the top bottom margins your text area already has

14894865

imagine your cell size is in your ib and your text area is located on your text area has a 100px margin top and 100px margin bot and it s width is 300

14895075
width	height
edit 1 sorry forgot to add that i need to keep the image in proportion so that if the user decreases the width of the browser the image will stay centred but will start to lose the edges if the user then decreases the height the image will shrink so that what ever the height or width of the browser it will always stay in proportion

14895079
hash	md5
i also saw posts about using an md5 hash but other posts pointed out that hashing cannot be relied on to produce unique keys all the time

it will delete children entities when the relationship is cut offfor instance if child entity is removed from the collection in parent entity and then child will be deleted when hibernate session is closed

14895388
pdfbox	itext
because i have already used itext in other functionality so for compaction of application i want to do this with itext not with pdfbox

14895637
google-chrome	firefox
but if i do the following it works in google-chrome and firefox but not in ie8

14895743
content-length	content-type
i want to check http header content-length and content-type and then if it s ok mount uploader

14895756
versioning	upgrade
note that the guide is for versioning 2.3.0 so if you upgrade to 2.4.3 you ll have to pay attention to the filenames and paths because opencv appends the versioning to some filenames

14895780
versioning	upgrade
note that for code that we have tested on a given target os you should upgrade to a versioning of installshield that was actually tested there but in many cases copying the correct supportedos element will be sufficient.

14895952
joptionpane	jdialog
use joptionpane jdialog which has modality

14895952
joptionpane	jdialog
after using a modal jdialog joptionpane you would simply use public getters to access the variable contained within the class instance

14896106
client-side	server-side
you re mixing client-side and server-side code

14896126
post	put
if it successfull it then does the post put to the server

14896137
bmp	png
you can save the canvas data to image file png jpeg or bmp

14896141

you can t just put the has_many method call in your module because you will get an error for example in a module called votable

14896165
google-chrome	firefox
it also works in firefox and google-chrome

14896212
maven	m2e
i would recommend you don t use the m2e command line tools mvn eclipse eclipse and instead use the built-in maven support known as m2e

14896212
maven	pom.xml
finally with a modern version of eclipse just do import maven existing project into workspace... and select your pom.xml

14896214
ant	pom.xml
i shudder every time i have to use ant in my pom.xml but in some cases it s the easiest option

14896307
google-chrome	firefox
the problem i am encountering is when i scroll any amount and then click sort of a field the tbody pushes back to its initial 0 scrollleft 0 position in ie and in firefox the entire tbody shifts the position left to the degree of the scroll distance it works in google-chrome as intended

14896331
int	boolean
stat relations are a little different again and return a single scalar value int string boolean etc.

14896435
post	get
but anyway just a hint you can use get parameters with a post request

14896435

you can also add some get parameters to a post request which are received on the server side as long as the get url is not longer that 1024 bytes

14896465
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to have our wordpress blog display a little better in ie8 and below it works great in ie9 firefox google-chrome

14896470
maven	pom.xml
when you add dependency in pom.xml do a maven clean and then maven build it will add the jars into you project

14896476
mouseup	mousedown
note that mousedown and mouseup events along with selectionstart and selectionlength properties are public in textbox so you can avoid subclassing if you need

14896507
gridview	onclientclick
as utkarshs answer shows use the gridview rowcommand event not an onclientclick

14896533
folder	directory
i am using egit plugin for eclipse but whenever i add my project to git the plugin puts a no-head indication next to my project folder in eclipse directory view

14896543

14896607
portrait	landscape
my application is navigation based and mainly runs in portrait orientation but one view controller supports both portrait and landscape orientation

14896607
portrait	landscape
now the problem is when i push the new viewcontroller from landscape view controller the new view controller is also pushed in landscape mode though i want it in portrait mode

14896607
portrait	landscape
also when i pop view controller from landscape controller then the poped view controller is getting displayed in portrait mode

14896607
superclass	subclassing
i have also created a uiviewcontroller subclassing that acts as superclass for all classes

14896609
screens	tablet
would also be cool to show several levels next to each other on large screens tablet like in the mac filebrowser

14896625
entities	entitymanager
you are not doing that with the code you ve shown that persists entities but you have not shown how you are reading them in so it might be possible and is more common when users manage the entitymanager themselves rather than let the container do it for them

14896662
distance	mercator
i need to use google maps api for calculating the x and y distance between the two places since google maps uses mercator projection

14896720
google-chrome	firefox
the fix removing the following property fixes it in ie 8-10 firefox google-chrome

14896724
width	height
that will force an img with the id of underconstruction to go full width and height if the device screen is 600px or smaller

14896732
pop-up	dialog
i have a listview of all list when i click an item on the list a dialog will pop-up with a textview

14896800

14896861
google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome and firefox but in ie9 i am getting console is undefined

14896863
width	height
i am able to create and showing a kendo window as popup with custom width and height

but when i am trying to create a popup window child window in a popup window parent window i am not able to apply the custom width and height

14896906
opera	google-chrome
i ve noticed that the media query breakpoints get triggered differently in google-chrome vs all other browswers ie9 google-chrome opera

14896906
opera	firefox
we will use firefox as the example but it is the same for ie9 and opera

14896906
google-chrome	firefox
i took a screenshot of the point before and after the media query triggers on both google-chrome and firefox

14896918
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
i have done a possible solution based on bufferedwriter and bufferedreader i used iso-8859-1 that is correct ascii extended character encoding

14896918
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
i have simply opened the source of bufferedwriter and bufferedreader andlooked how to obtain my interaction

14896936
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
like i said above you can use jenkins gui to gather all sorts of job parameters dropdownlistfor checkbox text entry

14896940
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox it works as expected

14896980
for-loop	arrays
you need a for-loop to go over the arrays and print it out

14896996
getter	setter
if you define them private you need getter and setter

14896997
hash	salt
you need to store the salt unencrypted to be able to hash a string to check if it matches the salt hash of the original password

14896997
crypt	salt
some crypt functions concatenate the unencrypted salt amongst other things to the encrypted salt password

14896999
post	put
i think its not calling the second function because i cant see the trace i put inside it anyway heres my code sorry for the long post

14897013
width	height
he just calculates the window width height and use the popup width height to give an offset

14897022
hash	salt
a salt is added to a plaintext before hashing so the same plaintext hash to a different hash forcing an attacker to try all combinations of letters for each individual hash slowing him down tremendously

14897024
hash	salt
but look how it usually works you send the salt to the client which uses it to hash the salt+password

14897026
getter	setter
usually if you wanna encapsulate your class you make your attributes private and have public getter setter methods so that other objects can t access your attribute directly

14897026
getter	setter
they will only be able to access them thru getter setter

14897055
getter	setter
creating both a getter and a setter for an attribute that merely return or assign a value without additional logic actually exposes your attribute as public and provide unnecessary clutter to the code in terms of readability

14897084
irix	linux
i am porting a code from irix to linux redhat that is currently using signal handlers with the form of

14897149

you want to implement comparable on the student using the code you already have in the comparator

14897224
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox the above script renders an iframe with the share button

14897280
submit	submission
the form is submission before the ajax request is completed so the form submit is the request your server receives

14897367
folder	directory
it currently unzips just mp3 files to my base directory but i want to put them in my newly created folder

14897395
width	height
it has attributes such as src title height width e.t.c

14897433
for-loop	arrays
if i understand correctly you only need to check the values at the same location in the arrays meaning you should have deleted the second for-loop and check like this

14897453
daemons	systemd	daemons	launchd
use upstart or something similar to launchd the god daemons on systemd boot for me this is done like so

14897457
hide	show
i modified the multiply script to make it hide the original image and the hover effect to make it hide the canvas and show the original image

14897480

i know this is not a vulnerability concern but i don t understand why the stdin is not fflush after the normal return of the program at the point that the prompt get back stdin stdout stderr

14897492

i recently upgrade jquery to versioning 1.8.2 and noticed that my mvc extensions grid started to give me javascript errors when it renders empty bound to empty data source

14897492
versioning	upgrade
in my solution i have a mix of kendo and mvc extension grids on the same page so i need to upgrade jquery since kendo requires the newer versioning per the requirements

14897504
opera	firefox
ie firefox and opera do count the scrollbar width as part of the viewport

14897504
opera	firefox
however ie9 firefox opera will execute that code at a viewport width of greather than or equal to 483px

14897538
portrait	landscape
in my case this very one view controller had to be displayed in landscape all times and on the way back the other view controllers must be set back to portrait

14897556
int	chars
it might choose int or it might choose chars

14897658
width	margin
you can use margin auto to center horizontally but for that to work the inner div you re trying to center needs to have some sort of width specified

14897658
width	margin
alternatively if you don t want to set a width you ll need to set an actual margin that s the same left and right change margin 0 auto

14897667
width	height
this transparent box has the same dimensions height width as the rotated div

14897707
getter	setter
my model have a series of setter and getter

14897707
serializable	deserialization
however during serializable deserialization i am running into an issue where a setter that also invokes a method that is dependent on another propert say property1 is run before property1 is actually been set

14897737
nunit	moq
i was wondering if there exists something similar for unit testing with moq nunit

14897898
dictionary	map
the cql driver accepts empty dictionary fine as new value for a map type while none is not allowed even though querying the map column returns none if it is empty

14897905
rss	feed
the posts show up and everything looks fine except that the rss feed shows an invalid year expecting 2013 instead getting -0001 in the date field

14897905
rss	feed
this problem causes the rss feed to not validate and it s breaking other things

14897924
nsstring	nsdata
i need to get that payload as either an nsstring of xml or as an nsdata object so that i can use it in another library that converts the payload to an nsdictionary

14897926
hide	show
i don t need the events that bootstrap has like on show hidden or show hide i just need to trigger a simple collapse of the element with transition and keep my elements height dynamic i don t want a fixed height otherwise i would just use css to achieve the collapse

14897932
opera	firefox
ie firefox and opera follow the w3c spec of including the scrollbar width in the media query where webkit browsers do not

14897941
stdout	stderr
for stdout or 2 for stderr

14897952
google-chrome	firefox
so it s entirely possible that google-chrome is only sending headers the server has approved and so the request works but that firefox is sending a header the server doesn t approve and so the request doesn t work

14897952
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
unless you re using ie10 ie probably isn t working because cross-domain requests don t work in ie unless you use the xdomainrequest object instead of the xmlhttprequest object and jquery doesn t do that

14897965
google-chrome	firefox
the tip shows up where expected just fine in google-chrome and firefox but i don t know why it s not working in ie8 and even in ie9

14897995
getter	setter
updated i edited my original post to include the whole class except for getter and setter which have no markup or annotations

the recommended method is to use the mediawiki api to parse the wikitext

14898722
ienumerable	idictionary	ienumerable	icomparer	icomparer	idictionary	comparator	icomparer

hash	md5
all static files are collected from your applications as usual but this storage manager also creates a copy of each file with the md5 hash appended to the name

14898868

will trigger the haslayout property of the element thereby making it available the width height margin and padding

14899010
innodb	myisam
as another example the behavior of mysql with respect to foreign key constraints differs significantly depending on whether the storage engine for the table is myisam or innodb

14899010
innodb	myisam
note that the syntax that mysql accepts and in some cases the operations it performs is dependent on the settings of specific mysql variables in particular sql_mode and of particular concern in the case of your statement the setting of the default-storage-engine variable and whether this table will be created using the myisam engine or the innodb engine or even the corner case that default-storage-engine has been set to blackhole

14899027
multiplying	subtract
the reason for multiplying instead of subtract is that you don t want the object to rotate twice as long if the spin from the user is twice as hard since that becomes annoying to wait on i find

because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is

14899189
margin	border-box	box-sizing	border-box	box-sizing	margin	width	border-box	width	margin
to not let the margin add extra width to this 33 you can use padding and box-sizing border-box

as you can see it s not an impossible task - supporting natural keys in generic relations - but to accomplish that a lot of things would need to be changed in the serializable and deserialization code

14899619
post	get
almost everything its working i can get the roster list send and receive messages but when i m trying to change my presence from avaliable to xa or dnd or any other else the server stops answering and i start to get 404 errors on my post and invalid sid messages like this networkerror 404 invalid sid

14899675
post	get
whene i press submit button it deliver the value of textarea and some value of hidden field with existing cookies which are get when i logged in through webview post method

14899676

14899749
opensuse	linux
linux - opensuse 11.4

14899775
portrait	landscape
i am working on an ios app that must work in both landscape and portrait except one view that should be always in landscape

in this context if i rotate the device to landscape the method return a true and the interface rotate properly and if i tried to rotate again to portrait this method return false and the interface remains in landscape

14899806
folder	directory
however i discovered that if i have it enabled in my root web.config it allows directory browsing on all folder without a default page as you would expect

14899806
folder	directory
as i believe and i could be wrong the default directory browsing module only checks for the enabled attribute if there is no default folder and you aren t requesting a specific file for example mysite.com images versus mysite.com images logo.gif

14899838
decoder	encoder
i m writing a generic encoder decoder and running into an issue with an extended generic

int	chars
treat the non-ignored values as hex and convert to int resulting in the value of an ascii chars

14899997

do standard hex conversion on the chars value to convert to a 0..15 int value

14900061
glut	qglwidget
first of all qglwidget does everything glut does plus more

14900091
jscrollpane	jviewport
you should add component not to jscrollpane but to its jviewport

14900123
width	height
the design in zedgraph was to loop through every object and calculate whether it s visible in the current scaled view given the upper left corner and the height and width of the object

14900154
min	max
however the best status value is not a min or a max

14900173
persistent	transient
if you do not need it persistent you can mark it transient and the serialization will ignore it

14900193
put	get
however when i put a break point in the code behind i always get an empty string

14900196
sorting	filtering
if the number of rows in the dataset is not too large then i d use a datasetprovider to pump it into a clientdataset then do sorting filtering searching etc in that clientdataset

14900206

the bitmap is scaled appropriately as stretch is set to uniform since both width and height of the image control are set stretch could as well be set to fill or uniformtofill

14900210
inherited	properties
i did try moving the properties declaration up to the inherited viewmodel as

14900250
int	chars
the general specification is that int has the natural size suggested by the system architecture one word and the four int types chars short int and long must each one be at least as large as the one preceding it with chars being always one byte in size

14900251
eigenvalue	diagonal
provided a has the right properties you could transform it to the diagonal form a0 by calculating its eigenvectors and eigenvalue

14900251
eigenvalue	diagonal
in the diagonal form the solution is where a0 is the diagonal matrix with the eigenvalue and inv a0 just contains the inverse of the eigenvalue in its diagonal

14900251
multiplying	transpose
finally you transform back the solution by multiplying it with the transpose of the eigenvalues from the left and the eigenvalues from the right

14900299
rank	max
either way you re assigning a rank to each record based on the date descending since you want the max and your own order for the status values and then only ever picking the highest ranked in the join condition

14900315
folder	directory
take a look in the tomcat directory for some lib folder i cant remember the exact location and i think it changes based on the version but something like cataline_home common lib

then give its child the svg tag the proper version of the syntax attribute baseprofile attribute xmlns attribute and a height and width of 100

14900471
mktime	strtotime
if the current format is a string and the date is just not formatted as you wish it to then you will first need to transfer value back to a timestring for example using strtotime or explode + mktime before you can then use date to reformat it again

14900475
pascal	delphi
vst is a very popular standard and on windows people use just about any compiler to do vst plugins including delphi which is pascal based and has nothing to do with c++

14900475
pascal	delphi
then other people can make the plugins with other languages such as delphi pascal free pascal c other c++ compilers etc.

14900502
svg	vml
i know that i could dynamically change the viewbox of the svg and apply an offset to the svg element but that would be quite a painful refactoring because it s an old code ported from vml and there is a lot of interaction that makes coordinates systems conversions

14900541
debian	linux
using debian linux kde konsole and bash.

14900621

14900735
hide	show
when you click button1 it show div 1 and hide all the others

14900738
children	parent
apparently you can set animations on a per-op basis not global to the whole transaction which means the children can have an indefinite static animation set while their parent can have a different animation and the whole thing can be committed in one transaction

14900745
width	height
edit also be careful if you are setting canvas height width with css as it only changes the element size not the drawing surface size

14900745
width	height
to make sure both the element and drawing surface size changes use the width and height attribute

14900758
width	height
perhaps bootstrap has changed significantly since may however since i ve been using it since august of 2012 i can say most of what andres llich said about it being difficult to control the width height centering of the modal is either gone away or more likely he just doesn t understand css very well

14900793
restructuredtext	asciidoc
beside markdown and restructuredtext there exists also asciidoc which is more powerful than markdown there are f.ex

14900849
hide	show
you can hide by using a class and to make it dynamic you can use data- attributes to retrieve the correct id from the button and show the corresponding div

14900855
inherited	properties
just because objects share items with the same properties names doesn t mean that they inherited from the base

14900906
width	height
i am trying to create a image button and i want to give the specific width and height to it but my image size 512 x 512 and when activity starts layout is distorted because of the image

14900928
getter	setter
edit this is another phenomenal reason for getter and setter

14900935

i only need to auth in the google accounts in order to execute google apps script scripts namely only for make get or post parametrized requests to these scripts which will handling this parameters according its code nothing more

14900983
mouseleave	mouseenter
basically just balanced your mouseenter and mouseleave handlers for the rows

14900983
mouseout	mouseleave
also if you re interested in knowing the real issue read about mouseout vs mouseleave demo at bottom of the page

14900983
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter
hover is just a shorthand that attaches mouseenter and mouseleave handlers you could explicitly use mouseleave instead of mouseout in your original example and it d work as well

14900983
mouseleave	mouseenter
this second piece of code is what you asked for it removes all buttons when you mouseleave the table while the first is my refactored version that appends a button when you mouseenter the row and removes it when you mouseleave it

14900983
mouseleave	mouseenter
side-note i ve replaced the hover by mouseenter in the example as .hover would unnecessarily attach the handler to both mouseenter and mouseleave events when called with a single argument

14900983
mouseleave	mouseenter
with .hover the mouseleave for the tr would remove the button and create a new one and when you move the mouse to outside the table the event would bubble up to the table element removing the just-created button or if you move the mouse to another row the handler would also be called twice mouseleave of old row and mouseenter of the new hover target row

14901010
mouseout	mouseleave
the problem is that the mouseout happens when the mouseleave the td but the hover wasn t happening again since it was on the tr

14901045
disk	ram
some tips allow to have very very better performance but you ll need a bigger server if your website generate traffic and you re able to get 500 per month for hosting you can find very powerful server configuration like 6 quad core 48gb ram ssd disk 10gb s network with unlimited bandwidth

14901045

also if i rechange back to normal width height with no refreshment the css properties defined in js file are overriden the properties in css as they have higher precedence

14901971
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
then in your javascript change getelementsbytagname to getelementbyid like so

14901972
put	get
there will be one key for each access event each get put delete etc so you may want to look into a programmatic way of reading them like sawmill

14902081
width	height
i am doing a simple table where a user puts in their length width height and number of pieces and then calculate the cubic feet with the answer displayed in the table

14902100

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i see there is a different handling of history browsing in google-chrome and safari compared to firefox and ie

14902316
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
if i click the back button in google-chrome and safari i would go to the previous page but if i try to do the same on firefox and ie it seems they try to go to the original page and then it s again redirected to the access manager page

14902336
super	extends
is there any combination of extends super or some other generic

14902349
move	drag
if you want the page to move with the users finger i would move the page on a drag event with code

14902372

i saw this post which provides a way to retrieve the cart s shipping methods magento get all shipping rates

14902453
min	max
min and max can also overwrite these attributes

14902457
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
i would provide you with one written myself however i would highly recommend using afnetworking it s a wrapper above the nsurlconnection nsurlrequest system that has a much cleaner flow you can also use basic nsurlrequests connections with this along with regular nsoperationqueue

14902457
hide	show
huds must be called on the main thread so you will definitely need to handle that i usually just build extensions and use performselectoronmainthread however a better way might be to wrap your function in dispatch_async and call you re hud show hide code outside of that

14902498
apache	nginx
this would be reasonably easy to do in the development environment but significantly more difficult when nginx apache and or gunicorn get involved

14902514
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to install emscripten on ubuntu but the official installation guide for emscripten doesn t offer any instructions for installing emscripten on linux

14902522
width	height
however the gif needs to be the full width and height of that field in the table.

14902549
stdout	stderr
fuser sends the part of the output you see to stderr and the rest to stdout i suspect that it tries to simplify its usage from scripts while preserving some beauty from the user s point of view

14902576
superclass	subclassing
i m afraid if you want to invoke a subclassing method on a superclass reference then casting is indeed necessary

14902578
post	put
that should put you in the right direction but i can post code if you really need it

14902586
width	height
if there is a field that is empty just put a transparent image in there that s the right width and height

14902683
clang	llvm

14902829
for-loop	arrays
where the strongly typed model is an arrays and the above is being iterated over from inside a for-loop

14902952
libstdc++	libc++
however i m not sure whether libc++ or libstdc++ work under those circumstances since they probably depend on things that the windows c runtime library does not have

14902967
disk	ram
or even make a ram disk and place all files on it

14902999
ord	chr
you can find the ascii value of a character using ord function and the reverse is chr

14903011
put	get
when i put inside f2 i get false but i can call on that the a s methods propertly

14903012
children	parent
and the reason why the subtree isn t reached is because you only call heapifyhelper for the children if one of the children is smaller than the parent but when you call heapifyhelper 1 the two children of the node 5 are 9 and 11 both larger than the root value

14903012
children	parent
once when comparing it to its parent once when comparing it to its children

14903013
hide	show
i would be strongly apposed to hiding the buttons using jquery as they will still show up in the source code and wouldn t hide until the page was loaded

14903039
textview	imageview
first page just has a textview imageview and button

14903068
scrollable	panels
what i want to do to this panels is to add a series of scrollable panels

14903081
folder	directory
the solution of cd ing to the target directory first and renaming without folder names in either argument turned out to work

14903097
dbcontext	objectcontext
you just need to connect using the entity framework driver and if you develop in any of technologies that uses dbcontext includes code first model first and data base first but is lighter than objectcontext you can use the list below

14903126
folder	directory
change appbase to the parent folder of your web application directory.so say your application myapp directory is under say c git source put appbase as c git source

14903135
width	height
i want each table row view to expand in height to accommodate the text content but have a fixed width that is the full width of the table view

14903141
folder	directory
i put this file in conf folder of maven installation directory

14903142
treemap	treeset
the drawback is that treeset treemap and basically all comparison-based data structures won t work at all

14903173
ffmpeg	libvpx
it might be a good idea to remove libvpx-dev if present so it doesn t possibly interfere with ffmpeg detecting your compiled libvpx

14903190
itertools	functools
check at least operator itertools and functools modules

14903211
post	get
i am trying to post xml to a server using curl without any headers but i can t seem to get rid of the following headers

14903221
easeljs	fabricjs
several good libraries among many good ones are easeljs fabricjs and kineticjs

14903228

i got a strange problem with minitest and capybara

14903228
capybara	minitest
i am using rails 3.2.8 and test with minitest capybara poltergeist

14903273
jasmine	mocha
we have experience building backbone.js apps test-driven so we are familiar with testing front-end code using jasmine or mocha chai

14903288
post	get
the solution is to go to properties home directory configuration find the .php extension change the executable path to the asp.net path and limit it to get head post debug or whatever you prefer

14903290
ant	maven
however you can use tfs build to run ant or maven which in turn can be used to build c++

14903290
ant	maven
to use ant or maven you need the tfs build extensions the link is for the tfs 2012 version however there are extensions for older versions of tfs

14903290
ant	maven
once you have a build server set up you can use ant to build your c++ code or maven

14903319
post	get
but maybe i ll get around to replacing this with the proper solution if someone post it

14903347
getter	setter
individual getter and setter

14903368
width	height
for starters .game_thumbnail_div has a width and height that is too small

14903383
sorting	grouping
you can use this feature to get better performance by avoiding unnecessary column sorting and grouping

14903409
memcpy	malloc
just as the size of the allocation returned by malloc is not changed when you call memcpy on the returned pointer

14903427
portrait	landscape
i want to print the first div s content onto the first page with landscape orientation and the second one with portrait mode

14903427
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
however all browsers google-chrome opera safari ie10 print two portrait pages

14903431
width	height
the movement of the selected area works perfectly if the crop selection area is the same height and width as the destination preview div

14903443
oncreate	onstart
then in the fragments onstart or oncreate call this.getarguments

14903453
for-loop	loops
i kept the glbegin and glend inside the second for-loop like this then it works fine because in each loops you draw ploygon and start the next so here you can use gl_polygon

14903479
ceil	floor
since you re looking for fourths .00 .25 .50 .75 multiply your number by 4 round to nearest whole number as desired floor if down ceil if up then divide by 4

14903542
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly fine with google-chrome firefox etc

14903594
post	get
to get started take a look at the john west post error management with the sitecore asp.net cms and also give some consideration to adding an application level error handler that applies the entlib policy that you ve setup

14903604
inherited	properties
when using a uiscrollview which uitableview inherited from you can t change its contentoffset is not an animatable properties

14903604
performselector	delegation
in the delegation method bounce back the animation you could here add a delay by using performselector afterdelay

14903669
hide	show
i have a bunch of pre-made paths that i hide and show depending on the selection from two drop-down boxes

14903701
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere commerce 6

14903710
background-position	background-size
then apply them to the background-size and background-position

14903718
switching	screens
when i switching to another tab and then return to the tab in question the screens redraws with the bigger size table

14903725
free	malloc
malloc error for object 0x7fff7b646570 pointer being free was not allocated

14903776
folder	directory
navigate to your base joomla directory where you installed joomla and look for the templates folder

14903802
post	put
put my problem is some people enter a post code like this l236yt and some with a space like this l23 6yt

14903841
hide	show
that means the item will show briefly while the page is loading and then your code will hide it

14903863
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
spectravideo328 is right you should use viewwillappear or viewdidappear

14903982
getter	setter
all this happens because using you access instance variables directly some overly strict oo fans will even say that it violates encapsulation which it indeed does quite frequently while the dot notation invokes the proper getter and setter methods which take care of managing memory decently notifying kvo listeners etc. etc.

14903988
folder	directory
you can also use a partial path in the filename like the example below incase you need to into directory once you are at your base folder that you know the name of

14904076
implements	extends
public static class mapjob extends mapreducebase implements mapper

14904130
implements	extends
and remember if you are using spring and you have to solve a problem by extends classes overriding methods implements interfaces etc.

14904133
lisp	scheme
now added a ish or scheme lisp example

14904183
gridview	objectdatasource
using asp.net c# nhibernate architecture - i have a gridview with an objectdatasource and am having problems getting the delete method to work

14904183
gridview	objectdatasource
below is the code snippet for the gridview and objectdatasource

14904242
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
also in order to further make your code look good you can use an enhanced for-loop instead of the old loops to avoid indexing the arrays like this

14904312
google-chrome	firefox
you can do this with google-chrome s developer tools or with the firebug firefox extension and i think ie10 has something equivalent too

14904338
nfa	dfa
then simplify the dfa to a nfa

14904338
nfa	dfa
i don t know of any library to manipulate dfa or nfa in python

14904384
google-chrome	firefox
just remove the last and copy paste the code in the web console of your browser ctrl+shift+k with firefox ctrl+shift+j with google-chrome

14904408
highcharts	highstock
you should be able to load data into a highcharts highstock object by using an array or a named-value object

14904408
highcharts	highstock
the php sample url on highcharts.com returns json data that can be understood by highcharts highstock but you can use any data source that returns json data

14904413
put	get
i am thinking there must be a way to put this in a or maybe a table and force the size to be 200px wide but i can t seem to get either method to work

14904428
config	ini
the config file is in place and pointed at by my ini file

14904463
accessor	properties
you should always use accessor methods to set and get an object s properties outside of the implementation of that object s class

14904463
accessor	properties
you should almost always use accessor methods to access a class s properties even inside the implementation of said class

14904463
accessor	properties
this isn t as big of a deal with arc since it will mostly see below be handled properly either way but with manual memory management the accessor method for a properties will take care of properly retaining and releasing the underlying object

14904463
accessor	properties
if you use properly named accessor or synthesized properties you get support for kvo automatically

14904463
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
if you implement custom accessor methods as opposed to synthesizing a properties you will have to directly access the ivar inside the accessor implementations of course

14904467
prepare	execute
when this is done the prepare phase will not be performed when the call to execute is made with none or the same string object as the statement

14904467
prepare	execute
prepare a statement for execution against a database and then execute it against all parameter mappings or sequences found in the sequence parameters

14904522
jython	pypy
note although documentation on tb_next is scarce saw a reference to it in the docs for inspect but nothing specifying what constitutes a traceback level the behavior above is consistent between python 2.7.3 python 3.2.3 jython 2.5.3 ironpython 2.7.3 and pypy 1.8.0

14904537
hash	md5
i need to be able to calculate both md5 and sha1 hash for these files

that jsp page makes use of jstl s sql and core taglib

14904569
folder	directory
which connects to the remote server goes straight to the directory i want and proceeds to delete the particular temp internet files folder that s causing issues without bothering me at all

14904587
post	get
this is working just fine the key was from another stackoverflow post that someone created a few years ago uploading to imgur.com i ve registered my application at imgur here but when i use my client id or client secret id i get error 400 bad request

14904610
google-chrome	firefox
which you can view in your browsers console which is located in it s debugger hit ctr+shift+c in either firefox or google-chrome

14904620
flask	django
the good news is that it is very easy to integrate with flask or django or anything else really since its written in python

14904648
width	height
the reason i set only one dimension width is that this way the image s height will be automatically adjusted to fit maintain the natural aspect-ratio

14904659
ggplot2	lattice
in ggplot2 or lattice you need to reshape the data to seupose them

14904661
width	height
you can then calculate the aspect ratio by dividing the width by the height

14904670
post	get
assuming that your get or post requests send at least one variable to the server then you can check if the previous request was a get by retrieving the url from the history and seeing if there are any parameters in the url

14904689
firefox	safari
i m osx and firefox safari

14904702
put	get	post	get	post	put
also webapi maps to url verbs get post put delete.. not functions like setparameters unless you have a name setparameters above your get function

14904774
vim	emacs
imo there would be little reason to develop on the virtual machine although there s no reason you couldn t especially if you re comfortable with vim emacs etc

14904775
getter	setter	accessor	properties
option 1 this is a member field with no properties accessor getter setter

14904775
getter	setter
you can customize several things about a property s getter setter methods

14904775
getter	setter
after declaring a property you can either use the auto-generated getter setter or you could write your own by implementing getter and or

14904803
post	get
i have already made a post regarding this issue no longer than 2hours ago but i really need to get this finished asap

14904829
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
i didn t like the idea of returning sqldatareader or creating and closing sqlconnection outside this function

14904876
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
the proper remedy would not be for ioexception to be an unchecked-exception but rather for there to be a declarative means by which code could indicate that one or more kinds of checked exceptions should not be allowed to percolate out of a certain block from methods called thereby but should instead be wrapped in some other exception type runtimeexception

14904903
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
http server for that job nginx lighttpd apache or even better some distributed cdn

14904936

please notice that according to the java.util.queue contract queue typically but do not necessarily order elements in a fifo fifo manner.

14904950
margin	height	width	margin	width	height
however when trying to vertically align i am unable to set the width and height properties meaning that i cannot use margin 0 auto

14905025
put	get
i realized my get was too long so instead of putting many numbers in the in statement i put a sub-query there that fetches those numbers from fb fql - but unfortunately it looks like fb couldn t handle the query and returned an unknown error in the json which really doesn t help us understand the problem

14905072
width	height
i want a user to be able to input a number in an gui gridjapplet and on clicking go have that number passed to a jpanel gridpanel to redraw a grid to that width and height

14905072

some text i do want next to each other because i am making a form that has radio button and checkbox

14905134
google-chrome	firefox
ie is going to have a totally different api than google-chrome and firefox is different from both

14905134
opera	safari
so as you can see it s greatly different for each browser then there s all the outliers safari opera etc...

14905158
int	chars
please note that this is all about bytes and that a chars might take 2 3 or even 4 bytes depending on your encoding and also that an int will always be 4 bytes

14905166
post	get
i believe the error you re getting is because match defaults to a get request but you are testing a post request in your spec

14905181
nsobject	ivar
as i could see at nsobject.mm there is no ivar called retain count in the nsobject s interface body

14905259
ggplot2	lattice
with lattice and ggplot2 you need to reshape the data

14905282
getter	setter
i have created a class that has some getter and setter methods

14905301
put	get
or you might need to get a hangmanlexicon object to put in your instance variable some other way

14905314
children	parent
i am in need of a snippet that will remove all tags and their children if the parent contains the given classes or ids

14905332
put	get
the only way i can seem to get that effect is if i have a set define off or scan off in old syntax in the called script so it tries to put the literal string into the variable which obviously won t fit instead of the value it represents

14905407
centos	linux
this test is working fine on a centos 6 server and on any other linux machine i tried

14905426
versioning	upgrade
getting this error after a forced wordpress upload i was working in the database when at one point of time i got an alert - while on the backend with only one option to upgrade to the newer available versioning

14905454
multiplying	multiplication
but later i realized that in this way vertices need to take 2 matrix multiplication namely left multiplying model-view matrix -- culling -- left multiplying perspective matrix which increases the overhead to some extent

14905496
ubuntu	linux
there is a lot to be said about the differences between linux and unix but all you probably need to know is download ubuntu burn it onto a disc then restart your computer with the disc in your cd drive

14905499
subtract	add
i know you can add a pointer to an int and subtract two pointers and a pointer and an int but can you add a int to a pointer

put	get
i know that i need to put the resources jar file into the class path it s part of the constraints of the project but whenever i try to add it i get an exception

14905782
filtering	grouping
i usually use grouping routes because controllers tend to have the same type of filtering needed if they are related to organize them or if you wish to can have a smaller routes file you might want to register your controllers and do the extra validation checks of the url s parameters inside the controller itself

14905783
websocket	pusher
what i need i think is a websocket interface from my backend server to one of these pusher services

14905790

it generates skeletons for extbase fluid based extensions and is compatible with typo3 6.0 makes even use of namespaces in generated extensions which were only introduced in 6.0

14905800
stdout	stderr
well after a few quick tests it appears my best option is to use subprocess however i have noted by included stdout stderr with the communicate call it adds about 0.002338 s extra time to the execution

14905806
wan	lan
in client mode you ll experience double-natting both routers do nat and you better have picked different network numbers for wan and lan

16-bit	64bit
you ve probably heard processors described as being 16-bit 32-bit 64bit etc

14913174
16-bit	64bit
in practice pointers will be size 2 on a 16-bit system if you can find one 4 on a 32-bit system and 8 on a 64bit system but there s nothing to be gained in relying on a given size

14913177
int	chars
because you are dereferencing the pointer you will write data the size of a chars and the size of an int into the location pointed to by ptr

14913177
int	chars
assuming an 8 bit chars and a 32 bit int will write 0x154 to the memory address assigned to ptr and will write 0x0000000154 to the 4 bytes starting at the address assigned to ptr

what you want to do is not possible because for template class t void foo t functions foo int and foo double are of different types and you can not create vector holding pointers to both that functions directly because vector is homogeneous container

14913600
int	double
it isn t hard to create an functor which is true on int and possibly double and only true on double if arbitrary computation returns 1

getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
however if you write a getter method and annotated this method with your id annotation instead of your field then we would tell our persistence provider to access our field through the accessor getter and mutators setter methods and not use reflection

14914702
getter	setter
in that case both a getter and a setter should be present

14914702
getter	setter
when property access mode is used the same contract as for javabeans applies and there must be getter and setter methods for the persistent properties

14914702
getter	setter
the type of property is determined by the return type of the getter method and must be the same as the type of the single parameter passed into the setter method

14914702
public	protected
both methods must be either public or protected visibility

14914702

if you are using multi-core cpus it s better to load the image once then run processing threads on it i assume the processing only reads the image with x y width height parameters

14915956

if you can send the image to this local network as broadcast i mean that all the hosts receives the image at once it would be a performance gain the displathcer has not to split and re-send parts processing tasks should just pick the appropiate part of the whole image received x y width height

here is a simple example that plays an audio file on mouseover and stops it on mouseout

14926582
int	double
or when you are using constants like in this case you can use double literals instead of int literals

14926585
hide	show
if i understand your question and comments correctly you want to ensure that columns b c always show you the right values based on your formula but also want to protect and maybe even hide the formula from the users

14926593
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
or you can search other web audio api examples for google-chrome and safari and data audio api for firefox

i d like to do division with a modulo as well as a floor so i found the f_divmod function

14926631
min	max
i want to avoid that and would want to set the min and max for both y and x axes

14926638
min	max
don t know why mongoose is not offering min max for the string type

14926638
min	max
you could extend the string schema type of mongoose i have just copied the min max function from the number schema type and adapted it to strings - worked fine for my projects

14926657
for-loop	arrays
after the second pass through the for-loop c is a two-cell arrays and its contents are displayed

14926804
width	margin
when you use just one flexible margin a change in width will all be applied to the one flexible margin

14926804
width	margin
this means the other margin stays the same no matter how the width changes

14926837
getter	setter
i found the solution to this after coming across this link relating to getter and setter

14926881

ubuntu	linux
i am running ubuntu linux 12.04.1 server x86_64

14926890

14926937
public	protected
i can imagine the benefit of public private protected keywords for variables because it will prevent unnecessary value change by objects outside the particular class

14926937
public	protected
but i cannot imagine the benefit of putting the keyword private or public or protected in method declarations

14926967
public	protected
first of all let s clarify the meaning of public protected package and private access

14926970
public	protected
in java difference between default public protected and private

14926970
implements	extends
so maybe there s some implementation that you want to make available for overriding -- or perhaps you need an extends class to implements this method in order to make your class work but it s not part of the contract your exposing to callers of your class or those calling the extends class

14927002

create it in viewdidload but don t worry then about the geometry as you can do this in viewwillappear

14927066
portrait	landscape
by the way i am not sure your frames are correct - in portrait you are shifting the left edge offscreen in landscape you are shifting the top edge offscreen

14927070
width	height
you can t specify width or height using percentages but there s something that is similar - weightsum and layout_weight

14927070
width	height
as you can see the container of a view linearlayout has set android weightsum to 1.0 which means that 1.0 will be 100 of it s width height

14927070
width	height
then if you specify android layout_weight for view inside this container to for example .5 and set it s width or height to 0dp this part is very important as if you miss it the view will use it s specified value instead of calculated one according to weights it will receive 50 value of it s container s width height

14927073
ng-view	ngcloak
i try put the ngcloak on body tag ng-view footer and also inside the ng-view html template

14927230
lxml	libxslt	lxml	libxml2	libxml2	libxslt
the error message you mention is typical on lxml when the libxml2 and or libxslt libraries are not installed for it to link with

14927230
libxml2	libxslt
if you issue apt-get install libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt libxslt-dev that should eliminate this error

14927240

14927499
public	protected
but foo int is not accessible since foo is declared in parent doesn t matter if it declared is public or private or protected

14927501
floating-point	integer
roundings to integer with floating-point result map the ieee-754 2008 specified rounding modes as follows

14927501
int	double
please note that you would not want to use an intermediate cast to int as int supports a narrower numeric range than int that are exactly representable by a double

14927501
ceil	floor
instead use trunc ceil floor as appropriate

14927505
int	chars
of the specified radix as determined by whether character.digit chars int returns a nonnegative value except that the first chars may

14927514

onmousedown	onmousemove	onclick	onmousedown
firefox is the only browser which allows the onclick onmousedown and onmousemove events to fire on an in a drop down list

14927655
post	get
i do not think that there are limits on how or what choice of input you use when data is comming from a form input then you will use post since you cannot pass form input in url or you could it just not recomended style like example 2 if it is coming from a api or some other sources definitely the best way to do it is via get or ci s function

14927668
profiling	benchmarking
anyway i would advise you to profiling and benchmarking your code if you are doing such a massive append

14927685
mongoose	mongovue
it strikes me as if you have little experience with mongoose mongodb so i will suggest you download and learn to love mongovue

14927686
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
to simplify matters you could just use an objectoutputstream and an objectinputstream and that would serialize the actual string to the stream rather than just its representation

14927690
division	modulo
if you want to calculate the quotient using floor division and then reduce that result modulo another number then your alternative is correct

14927703
sqoop	hadoop
based on the log i would guess that your java application that is executing sqoop do not have hadoop configuration on the classpath

14927703
sqoop	hadoop
you need to put the hadoop configuration into your classpath in order to run sqoop against remote cluster

nsuserdefaults are a subclass of nscoder

14928005
np-hard	np-complete
short answer the only np-hard problems which are not np-complete are the ones which are not part of np

14928005
np-hard	np-complete
let s look at the definition of np-complete and np-hard carefully

14928005
np-hard	np-complete
out of these definitions it s obvious to conclude that the only problems which are np-hard but not np-complete are the ones out of np

14928005
np-hard	np-complete
for instance all the np-hard problems which are not decision problems are not np-complete since np by definition is formed with decision problems

14928005
np-hard	np-complete
the search version of the tsp is proven to be np-hard but since it s not a decision problem you cannot solve it by answering yes or no to a question it s not part of np and thus cannot be np-complete

14928025
public	protected
see in java difference between default public protected and private

14928221
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
basically its the same keysequence for google-chrome firefox opera to detatch current browser tab and send to screen n

14929174
modulus	fractions
2 - any of those numbers 1-5 divided by 6 gives you a fractions number not a whole one and i thought modulus only works with whole numbers

14929175
width	height
for width and height you can just set them both to 100 since the size is determined by the parent element

14929195
explode	implode

your particular example doesn t do much justice to this pattern because you re initializing a rectangle with 0 width and 0 height and the default nsobject implementation resets the memory for all instance variables to zero by default and your initwithwidth andheight method does the same

14930388
width	height
however suppose that you were allocating unit rectangles width 1 height 1 by default when a rectangle object was created using

width	height
secondly i ve got no idea what absolutelayout is but i suspect that it s a convenient way of saying setlayout null and without evidence to the contry i would suspect that you re not providing any width height information for the label meaning it will 0x0

lodash	underscore.js
there are plenty of dom selection alternatives such as zepto.js but lodash underscore.js libraries are really in addition to jquery not in lieu of jquery

14944441
lodash	underscore.js
again underscore.js lodash is not an alternative to but one or the other provides additional functionality that in the long term will save file size.

i would have liked to post an example for each case but i just can t seem to get what the difference is between the two situations

14944828
haskell	ocaml
i came across a really nice article demonstrating the translation between types and type classes in haskell and modules and module types in ocaml ccshan wiki blog posts translations

14944828
haskell	ocaml
basically as thomas showed type classes in haskell become module types in ocaml with a type the type implementing the type class and a bunch of values using that type

14944828
haskell	ocaml
then corresponding to an instance of the type class in haskell you have a module in ocaml that implements the module type with the type being the type of the instance and the values being the implementation of the values in the type class

14944828
haskell	ocaml
and then every time you have a function that uses a type constrained by that type class in haskell you need to wrap that function inside a module in ocaml

14944828
haskell	ocaml
you will notice that a big difference in the haskell and ocaml ways of doing it is that in haskell when you use that last function the compiler infers the proper instance of the type class for you

14944853
post	get
i read through some relevant stackoverflow post that suggested it can be caused by hardcoded url s which i was using but i have since used the url helpers and continue to get this issue

boost	allocator
i looked at boost pool allocator - but didn t find a way to establish multiple independent pools for heterogeneous objects of different sizes

14945073
boost	allocator
i was very encouraged at first by boost container - but was disappointed not to see a concrete example of how to use stateful allocator with these containers

14945073
boost	allocator
that the vanilla std containers have a get_allocator on msvc 2010 and 2012 and g++ 4.6.3 which suggests that the standard libraries in these contexts have similar stateful allocator support to boost container

14945073
boost	allocator
my problem having found boost container was that i had expected its documentation to be explicit about any new functionality - such as passing allocator objects at construct time.

mouseover	mouseout
apparently not even the mouseout event will stop the .transition associated with the mouseover event.

14945381
mouseover	mouseout
takes precedence over the mouseover .transition so having a .transition on the mouseout event puts the mouseout event back in control

it s so easy to create small java objects and use gson or jackson or something to marshal the data back and forth that the advantages of rmi are vanishingly small in comparison

14945612
getter	setter
i like to use private variables you have attempted to use however you also need to implement getter and setter methods for getting to the variable

clang	icc
this code compiles fine on gcc 4.7.2 clang 3.2 icc 13.0.1 and vs10

14945675

google-chrome	safari
in step 5 select playback via html5 ie google-chrome safari

14945700
getter	setter
you don t have to place those variables make and price into the carnode class but you can use your getter and setter methods in your car class to use in your node class

14945700
getter	setter
so if you are using a car object in the node class that has already been created instantiated then you can just use those getter and setter methods like so

14945701
mouseup	mousedown
it s your browser client mousedown mouseup that do all the work and that s why it rotates properly on some clicks and not others

14945787
int	chars
more specifically the int and the chars were retained and displayed properly

14945989
udp	tcp
we have use udp to emulate tcp

14946154
google-chrome	firefox
this solved the problem in google-chrome and firefox for me

14946192
jtabbedpane	jscrollpane
after that add that jscrollpane on center of jtabbedpane

14946192
jtextfield	jlabel
and again don t call setxxxsize methods let some other things to determine size of your component like size of font in case of that jtextfield right to total jlabel or size of icons in these jbutton s in hot drinks panel

webclient	httpwebrequest
i ve tried using the webclient and httpwebrequest classes with the same result

the divs are width 100 and height 100 so they scale with the browser within each div i am using flexslider to create a fullscreen slideshow

14946375

this will show the correct section and hide the others but i can t figure out how what i need so that when the mouse moves off a ul.main li the .sub ul disappears if it s not being hovered over

14946395
equals	gethashcode
important make sure that your reporttimes class implements gethashcode and equals in a sensible way the same entry always hashes to the same value and different time entries hash to different values

14946395
equals	gethashcode
and as i said in the beginning please make sure to implement gethashcode and equals in the reporttime class

14946396
switching	screens
if screens real estate is the issue you can have one datagrid with one type of items and switching the item template to switching between both views

14946412
prop	each
6 in general is a single pass through that will scale in a relatively linear manner still some cost for each prop lookup and nested prop lookup but that s that.

14946420
margin	height
i removed stuff but 20px height plus 8px vertical padding 2px for border and 10px margin bottom means this will have 40px total overall height

14946421
google-chrome	safari
html5 video takes quite awhile to begin playing from google-chrome safari latest and google-chrome canary

14946441
post	get
when the first command end another one will be start i just can get the start it means that the post command is the end time of the previous command

14946443
viewdidload	viewdidappear
the things you are doing should be done in viewdidload not viewdidappear

14946450
portrait	landscape
when the second activity changes orientation to landscape mode and then i press the back button the main activity which was on portrait mode before the creation of the second activity destroys itself and reopens in order to show in landscape mode because it comes to the foreground for the first time after the orientation changed

14946473
onreadystatechange	onload
so i think you can assume that onreadystatechange is the way to go and onload is a addition that can be used if the browser supports it

14946490
padding	overlapping
usually when i have this problem it s because you have another item s padding overlapping the toolbar or something else

14946522
children	parent
you can force parent containers to wrap their floated children by applying overflow hidden

14946522
width	height
also i don t know if the width and height of your .toolbarright .shortcut class will stick because you have it set to display inline

14946522
width	height
try inline-block or just plain old block when you need to apply width and height to things

14946533
google-chrome	firefox
i have it made such that it looks perfect on both firefox and google-chrome but on internet explorer the .png files for some reason have an outline around the outside of them

14946533
google-chrome	firefox
as you can see it looks fine on google-chrome firefox but unfortunately the majority of the staff here use ie

14946554
hash	md5
for those projects i just used a simple form that sent the password filled to the server which validated the login by checking the password received with the md5 hash password stored in a database

14946581
ember.js	backbone.js
that said there is certainly a growing trend toward using client-side routers in general not specifically backbone.js s to create one-page appsâ ember.js

14946588
cpu	processors
the same effect will happen on modern cpu s even if they are much faster - the effect may not be exactly the same but it will be a large slowdown and the more processors sharing data the more effect so a quad-core system would be worse than a dual core etc

14946595
width	height
both should likely be the same value unless your source uses a different dpi for height and width

14946597
width	height
you must set the size of a control by using the control s width and height properties or the size property but not the width and height of the size property since that is passed by value and will have no effect

14946599
hide	show
for your case if you have a user object you can hide any login-related ui and show the problem otherwise hide the problem and show any login-related ui

14946608
pop-up	dialog
now i have updated the application and using the alassetslibrary but the dialog didn t pop-up

14946612
post	get
since both your get and post methods need to re-display the page post in the case of an error both of them can call getlogins so that you don t repeat that db access code in both places

14946613
post	get
however there is a workaround in order to get similar results you can tag your friends on post this way it would still display on their news feed

14946627
width	height
including the width height and duration of a video.

14946652
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari

i only want to read alternate lines from this group skipping each line with 4 int but reading the line with 3 fortran double precision numbers

14946672
post	get
you may need to post more code of the actual web page lifecycle for us to get a better idea of what s going on

14946706
post	get
i have looked at many many post about this subject and have tried several of the solutions but i can not seem to get it right

14946717
squash	merge
you can use git merge --squash to squash all commits into one and then push it

14946724
hide	show
if you are using subreports to show the charts the reason you don t see any message is ssrs hide a subreport if every dataset of the subreport doesn t return anything

14946727
nsscanner	nsregularexpression
you could also do more flexible things with nsscanner or nsregularexpression

14946773
memcpy	strcpy
memcpy should work fine but strcpy will work fine too

14946842
for-loop	loops
i simply removed the for-loop and added an extra requirement on the while loops

14946864
post	get
the problem is that you are sending an empty post with a lot of get parameters set and your php code is expecting post parameters

14946864
post	get
or don t worry from php side if they are get or post params

14946867
ng-show	ng-include	hide	show
the titlebar view html would use ng-show hide or ng-include directives to show include the appropriate html based on the current state of the model scope

14946876
width	margin
then set a width on your container wrapper and zero the margin

14946890

14946898

the problem occurs when i open the app and select one or more checkbox and hit the back button to exit

14946992
getter	setter
to try to leave the standard core data getter setter alone

14946996
memcpy	strcpy
you can use memcpy or strcpy but you ll have to do the bounds checking yourself and there are other errors in your code

14947040
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari

im not an expert on jquery im trying to make the lower menu hide when scroll .smenu-lower and then show toggle the menu when you hover over the #sticky-menu

14947118
google-chrome	firefox
tested with google-chrome and firefox on the pc

14947156
folder	directory
if the folder is a symbolic link into another sdk folder inside the xcode directory structure it s better to copy the actual content from there into the new destination

14947180
serializable	deserialization
your serializable deserialization logic needs to be smart enough to handle cases where attributes are missing or have default behavior for new attributes that were not present in serializable objects that were serializable by older versions

14947186
width	height
use them to calculate the values of height and width instead of using hard-coded values

14947190
postgresql	mysql
i tried mysql and postgresql but i still encounter the same error

14947196
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
your configureview method is probably better called from somewhere else perhaps in viewwillappear viewdidappear or even a custom mutator for birddetail item as per hermann s suggestion

14947212
put	get
i think i can get a hold of the back stack entry for this transaction using getbackstackentryat but it s not much good if i can t remove it and put it back in place when the user comes back to the tab

14947214
mockito	easymock
an alternative would be to create a mock datasource using for example easymock or mockito

14947225
ilist	icollection	idictionary	icollection	idictionary	ilist
for example if i implement both ilist and idictionary they both implement icollection and i only implement icollection once

14947225
ilist	icollection
in the above example both ilist and icollection expose a count getter name get_count which will result in a name clash

14947244
google-chrome	safari
the css specified will only apply a custom scrollbar on a webkit browser such as google-chrome and safari

14947258
post	get
i m trying to get some post from a specific category into a multidimensional array like so

14947270
minimum	max	min	max
instead of -n count my ping syntax is -c count and instead of a line containing minimum i have min avg max mdev

14947286
getter	setter
this is the code that is causing the problem when the world.map1.render 0 0 is removed no problem exists - i know that i should be using getter and setter

14947290
min	max
here is the big deal i don t know to specify the min and max value

14947314
width	margin
however if you wish to have the length of the grid to take up the entire width make sure you set the left and right margin values to 0

14947322
versioning	upgrade
but the versioning of jetty i m using has that annoying null identity service thing so i want to upgrade the versioning i m using but i can t figure out any good way to determine what versioning of jetty would be best for me to run

14947331
post	get
in_category check is not required because the query will get you only post from the videos category

14947363
folder	directory
but when i share a folder by sending someone the link to share because they don t have a google drive account they can view the files in the public shared directory but the files are always sorted alphabetically

14947366
getter	setter
your code just invokes the getter of property then setting the value of the member field which would invoke the setter of member if it were a property which isn t the case here

14947368
portrait	landscape
if i uncomment the autoresizing line when i first launch in portrait mode my view s size is something like 320x430 and when i first launch in landscape mode it s like 480x200.

14947369
hash	md5
now it successfully inserts a row into my user table with the username but for some bizarre reason i end up with an empty md5 hash and an empty email field

14947425
width	height
you only really need to add this view to vc s view and set it to flexible width height so it ll fill parent view

14947429
int	chars
i ve tried every permutation of signed unsigned sscanf atoi initializing not int chars and even using the pointers directly instead of as an argument

14947437
hide	show	mouseleave	mouseenter
really the smartest way to do this is to have an outer wrapper for your whole navigation wrapping all div s you ve got in your existing fiddle and then bind your show event to mouseenter while separately binding your hide event the one for all .subz to an event triggered on mouseleave for the wrapper div

14947468
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu linux 10.04 64-bit and my ckan instance version is 1.8

14947492
width	margin
and some more like width top left margin background z-index and so on.

14947493
rxtx	jssc
jssc looks like a suitable alternative to rxtx

14947562
google-chrome	firefox
i just had a look at this again after giving adobe a couple of months to get their act together and the problem is now gone in google-chrome and firefox on xp with version 11.5.502.149 of the flash player

post	get
after a get request the view shows the querystring and after a post request the view does not show the querystring - both as expected

14947819
multiplying	subtract	multiplying	multiplication

for-loop	loops
the result amazed me in the way that as loops goes over bigger range the performance of c# decreases as compared to c..for smaller range c# shown well performance over c....but as upper range of for-loop increases the c# performance degrades as compare to c..

14953701
for-loop	loops
here i started above testing with the aim that c for-loop performance will be better than c# loops but it goes exactly opposite with my understanding and gone with this question and agreed...but when i increase the upper range of for-loop the c performance goes well as compared to c#.

14953706

14954215
hash	salt
the username and password must be at least salt and hash in a user s browser before they are sent to mojolicious web server over the internet

14954215
hash	salt
i think the best way is to use embedded perl to manipulate the form values and then reassign them so that when submit button is pressed only salt and hash username passwords are received inside the controller the logic in mojolicious would be like copied from mojolicious website

14954215
hash	salt
myusers.pm handles login validation on server and i will tweak it to handle salt and hash strings.

14954225
getter	setter
i explained in this post that as soon as you create a rails- model with the same singular name as one of the plural tablenames of your database the magic of rails will create setter and getter in order to modify your table s records

14954225
getter	setter
all you have to know is that at that point you have setter and getter available to crud create read update delete your database column encrypted_password

14954230

list a directory folder to a variable

14954249
post	get
the get http method should be used to read data while the post http method should be used to send data

14954333
hash	md5
you hash the password not with md5

hide	show
in that group i have two radio buttons named as show hide

14954465

disclaimer i haven t tested the code above i m basing it on my own code which i recently used in a project and which uses passport-local instead of passport-twitter

14954560
comparator	comparable
if you don t want your class to implement the comparable interface you can pass a comparator to arrays.sort

14954591
google-chrome	firefox
works in firefox and google-chrome at least

14954591
width	height
if you specify width and height it means that you also have to specify the name parameter

14954591
width	height
if you do not specify width and height i assume you also don t specify name and therefore it is opened with which means a new tab

14954622

14954684

always check the parent element of any element as they inherited their css properties

14954844
put	get
yes it is possible and quite easy make an element object for the element tag and put there all possible sub tags if jax-b can t find them in you xml it will leave them as null so you will get a decent object

14954855
for-loop	arrays
you want to travel on the arrays until you reach the last object since we re comparing addresses in the for-loop so we compare ptr with the address of the last element in the arrays

14955000
postgresql	mysql
all i need is echo to print postgresql and mysql is separate new lines

14955046
floating-point	fractions
another option could be to use from c99 to break down the floating-point value into a normalized fractions in the range 0.5 1 and an integral power of 2

14955046
integer	fractions
you can then multiply the fractions by flt_radix dbl_mant_dig to get an integer in the range flt_radix dbl_mant_dig 2 flt_radix dbl_mant_dig

14955046
int	double
when you load a saved number you do the reverse operation and use double ldexp double x int exp

14955067
versioning	upgrade
so you don t need to upgrade major versioning for this reason at least

14955067

if you do this you can create a simple index on the combined column that replaces both kellaaeg and kuupaev and use that for min and max among other things

14955074
hide	show
code above hide a jqgrid to show element details and allow to close it and show jqgrid at previus state - but after closing element jqgrid disaper i could always call again initgrid but that is not the best solution

14955187
inherited	properties
btw the newer attribute.getcustomattributes apis - which fixes the inherited resolution for properties and events - have as their return type

14955213

14955292
128bit	64bit
a 128bit curve 64bit security can be broken but it s probably too expensive to be worthwhile will produce a 32 byte signature

14955325
versioning	upgrade
this means old versioning of the database can always be upgrade automatically

14955326
post	get
but it s a get type not a post

14955358
post	get
get and post should be used based on the type of the request to the server

mvp	presenter
when you use mvp you normally test methods in the presenter injecting a mocked implementation of the view so in your test the display does nothing just offers stub methods to the presenter

14956811
mvp	presenter
a very different case is if you wanted to test your code using gwttestcase so as you could use real view implementations but in this case your tests would last a long loosing one of the main goals of using mvp which is to decouple the view to test the main app code which is supposed to be in presenter and classes which can be run in the jvm

14956818
hide	show
or you could have a numerous forms and show and hide them

14956896

i noticed you have 2 password fields on your user data array the first password field appears to be the last 8 characters of the md5 hash of the second password field if the data was provided to you this way you cant do much with it and will have to get the hash yourself but so long as both keys are the same the second password value will overwrite the first one

14957425
hash	md5
the md5 will be used to get the hash of the password so that you can use it for whatever reason you need like

gridview	rowdatabound
convert the 2 hyperlink fields in gridview to template and change the rowdatabound to

14963875
stdout	stderr
so one possibility might be to execute not the converter directly but a shell script or windows equivalent if you re on windows that sends the converter s stdout to stderr

14963875
stdout	stderr
if the converter program writes to both stdout and stderr then you ll need to spawn a second thread to consume stdout as well the script approach gets around this by sending everything to stderr

14963881
folder	directory
ive tried adding the platforms folder in with my directory and adding the windowsd.dll and minimald.dll but still does not work

14963927

i use a separate binding for this instead of the update function for the main dialog binding because i only want to update the title not other properties such as height and width don t want the dialog to resize just because i change the title

14963952
width	height
i suppose i could also use update and just remove height width but now i can do both either and not worry about the settimeout being completed or not

14964001

14964547
email	dkim
firstly you would need to set an spf record for the domain you are sending email from and enable dkim as well

14964629

14964686
scipy	scikit-learn

14964979
range	max
the benefit of backbone models is that those are are dynamic so you can create a parser to read the validations form the server and add those validations to the backbone model in the way your pluggin need it its kind of easy if you only use required minlength max length and a regex but gets harder with range or some other kind of validations

14964983

if not would i be better served using a different framework like laravel zend yii symfony or codeigniter instead

14965267
for-loop	arrays
the range-based for-loop needs a collection like an arrays or a vector

14965280

14965488
puts	gets
my initialize.php file gets all my core include files and puts them into one require_once

so if you want the height width specified in your question to only apply to you would do something like this

14965495

then use the height width properties in the selector

14965495
width	height
then you can add a differnet height width for the selector

14966508
int	double
i think the solution is to calculate roughly how many digits you want in the result by taking the number of int digits or floor log f log 10 +1 and then subtracting that number from a constant such as 17 which is the number of digits you can expect from a double

14966523

portrait	landscape
so now i have created 2 view controllers in landscape mode and main portrait mode

14967367

deleting inherited properties if the properties you are trying to delete is inherited delete will not affect it

14967568
inherited	properties
that is delete only deletes properties from the object itself not inherited properties

14967568
inherited	properties
therefore if you need to make sure an object s value will be undefined delete will not work when the properties is inherited you will have to set override it to undefined in that case

14967638
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter
use mouseenter instead of mouseover and mouseleave instead of mouseout when you use mouseout it fires every time mouseout occurs on any inner element of the main div and same for mouseover

14967641
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari

i have it working to clear onclick but the onsubmit doesn t work

14967877
configparser	argparse
if you want to allow environment variables to interact with either of the above a myapp_config might tell your configparser code to load a different config file than normal or a myapp_cache_dir might provide a different default for the --cachedir command-line argument for argparse you get the values in os.environ but have to write your own code to do anything with them

14967945

of course linux early versions and minix have example code but take care of the design structure monolithic microkernel or hybrid-kernel - and don t mix it write your own code

14968114
mouse	keyboard
you wrote a basic irq handling and the plan is to write a keyboard mouse driver - write the keyboard driver

14968159
post	get
you confuse the attributes from the http request get post etc and the httpservletrequest attributes that can be accessed through httpservletrequest#getattribute string

14968194
touchesmoved	touchesended
now you track the touch events on the host view with the uiresponder methods touchesbegain touchesmoved and touchesended

14968201
pull	push
where this will get a little dirty is having to deal with a branch that is ahead of what is deployed and having to pull merge before being able to push

14968213
mouseover	mouseleave
i bind a mouseover and mouseleave events to the #container div and the html is as follows

14968213

the problem is everytime my mouseenter the .zclip div and then leave it will also trigger the mouseleave event of the #container div even if my mouse is still in the container

14968220
button	checkbox
then i ticked the checkbox advanced between checkbox grouped and button add entry

14968227
for-loop	loops
seems like you have to add a for-loop to loops over the platforms

14968248
int	chars
the goal of the program is to be able to extract int in a string chars only if they are inside a set of parenthesis

14968249
google-chrome	firefox
the easiest is to use something like firefox s firebug or google-chrome s developer tools to monitor the network traffic and check the ajax call and the php response

14968296
versioning	upgrade
i did create a revision file as well so i can just check up front what versioning they have and then upgrade it but i still have to keep a lot of different versioning alive and write the conversion functions for all of them

14968300
hash	salt
i d like to be able to use passlib to hash my passwords before they go to the database and i m not really a fan of using the built-in mysql sha2 function since it s not salt

it is not supported by non-dev builds of browsers yet but both firefox and google-chrome are working on it

14968398

14968562
portrait	landscape
on the ipad when in landscape orientation i create an adwhirlview that is 1024 wide but the first iad returned is always a portrait width ad 768

14968562
portrait	landscape
if i rotate the ipad to portrait and then back to landscape then the ad is properly shown 1024 wide in full landscape

14968563
setinterval	settimeout
the only way i can think to do this now is to create a wrapper for my setinterval settimeout calls

14968568
post	get
header set access-control-allow-methods post get options

14968574
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
this jquery xmlhttprequest object or jqxhr returned by .get implements the promise interface giving it all the properties methods and behavior of a promise

14968585
portrait	landscape
then just add your landscape view as the prime subview in landscape and then remove it when you rotate to portrait and so forth

14968626
implements	extends
another approach would be to extends authorization class and implements apply_limits

14968661
width	height
just in case you do not want to specify canvas height and width and want it to take the height of the parent then to refrain your drawings to be off the point of interest add following line of code in init function

14968716
profiler	perf
below is the screenshot from ants perf profiler

14968894
lwuit	lcdui
you can not mix lwuit components with lcdui ones

14968935

so make sure you close the tcpclient and the networkstream but only when you re completely finished processing in the loop

14969019
rubygems	rvm
gabi ubuntu rvm rubygems current

14969044
pthreads	fork
you might want to call shmget ipc_creat before calling fork as pthreads doesn t guarentee the order of execution after the call so the shmget in the child process could fail because the parent hasn t had a chance to create the shared segment

14969115
ocaml	mercury	ocaml	prolog
most of what i do with this is done in a functional language such as ocaml or f# or a logic language such as prolog or mercury

14969115
haskell	ocaml
if you look you will find the ocaml code at the bottom of the page and f# here and haskell here

14969120
mdpi	hdpi
like mdpi hdpi and so on

14969141
mouseleave	mouseenter
now lets say i want to hook up a mouseenter mouseleave and click event handler to the normal button

14969141
mouseleave	mouseenter
now lets say we want to append a mouseenter mouseleave and click event handler to the grow button and the shrink button

14969161
turkish	polish
take a look at this function it works with russian ukrainian turkish polish latvian greek and latin

14969180
oncreate	onnewintent
this because oncreate will be called one time only when the activity instance is created afterwords onnewintent will be invoked

14969281
pull	push
my project has quite a few people and i want to give them all push pull access because right now they forked the project and when they make changes they have to push to their fork and send me a pull request

14969301
justmock	typemock
so i m stuck with 3 possible frameworks typemock expensive telerik s justmock expensive or microsoft s fakes

14969481
rss	feed
this link to an rss feed doesn t load with simplexml_load_file

14969481
rss	feed
the link is a valid rss feed and no it isn t a permission problem everything else loads

14969485
maven	pom.xml
because namespaces are being used with our ivy configuration the dependencies within the pom.xml file are not the original maven groupid artifactid but the namespace derived names

14969485
maven	pom.xml
this causes a maven project using this pom.xml to fail when resolving dependencies

14969485
ant	pom.xml
the only way i have found to get around this problem is to generate the pom.xml within ant then run a series of ant replaceregexp task steps across the pom.xml before publishing

14969488
google-chrome	firefox
opened video directly in google-chrome and firefox

14969488
google-chrome	firefox
in my case here is only one request in firefox and multiply from google-chrome and there is canceled or pending only

14969488
google-chrome	firefox
tryed the same with ogg clip it is good in firefox though chunked and bit better in google-chrome part of requests are in pending part canceled and fiew is good

14969488
google-chrome	firefox
also i am on win7 with latest google-chrome and firefox

14969547

i have setup up the viewport to the standard width and height

14969557
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
for example the following code works in google-chrome and safari but in ie and firefox nothing happens--no errors no nothing

14969596
hide	show
you d need to wrap something around the fields to show hide even just a tag with an id

14969636
put	get
or to put it another way you cannot use glgetactiveuniformname to get the length of the uniform s name

14969643
int	double
each customer call record contains eight fields which are as follows 1 a ten digit cell phone number string no dashes 2 the number of relay stations used in making the call int 3 the length of the call in minutes int 4 the net cost of the call double 5 the tax rate double 6 the call tax double 7 the total cost of the call double and 8 string field called discount_aval with a value of yes or no

14969667
put	get
and what i want is the values from the rows to be put in lists similar to what you would get if did this by hand

14969789
move	drag
for example i am using d3 and defining the following events that are supposed to capture a click mouse move no drag and drag events on an svg as well as handling the end of such events

14969792
setinterval	settimeout
you can t really do this with setinterval unless you keep clearing for a delay change so you might as well write a wrapper around settimeout to accomplish something similar

14969795
pop-up	dialog
generally speaking pop-up and modal dialog interrupt users flow

14969850
squash	merge
you can use git merge --squash to squash all commits into one and then push it

14969866
int	double
i would also add as a suggestion and besides the string comparation that you could declare the variable number3 as a double and in the if clause instead of cast it to int invoke the method intvalue so it would be something like

14969907
rss	feed
the rss feed is gziped

14969983
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview subclass containing several subviews that i want to drag drop into one of several other uiview which are contained in a uicollectionview

14969989
fadein	fadeout
what i wanted to achieve is that when i click some text under the page div it will fadeout and the info will fadein

14969989
fadein	fadeout
when i click on the paragraph .click the .page will fadeout and at the end .info will fadein

14969989
fadein	fadeout
however when i click the first p.click every .page will fadeout and every .info will fadein

14970053
put	get
line 55 in logon.vb is the line current.response.statuscode 402 which it should never get to if it managed to put the values in the session

14970067
express	node.js
i have a node.js express application that checks for authentication before allowing you onto the homepage

14970098
hide	show
i would probably render all the controls server-side and then use javascript to show and hide them

14970126
libs	library-project
it s just important to remark that compiled libs resources cannot be used in your executable project that s why the actionbar sherlock have to be used as a library-project

14970126
post	get
that library already contains an excellent multi-threaded bitmap download and cache classes we used to have a mapfragment now deprecated before google released their mapfragment easy http get post methods etc

14970141
firefox	safari
it s worth noting that whatever optimizations google is doing in v8 are markedly superior for less.js than safari and firefox s engines but here s the kicker

14970144
int	chars
it works great with simple types as int floats and chars but when it comes to strings or tuples it gives the following error

14970163
width	height
so i changed the code around so that i only divide width 2 and height 2

14970167
mouseout	mouseup
in the mouseup and mouseout handlers

14970190
google-chrome	firefox
the image loads in google-chrome and firefox but not ie

14970231
innodb	myisam
to prevent this use innodb engine instead of myisam

14970231
innodb	myisam
myisam locks the whole table when making a change to any rows while innodb doesn t

14970247
cpu	processors
of course you can vary that scheme to whatever complexity you desire by modifying the processors mask which cpu you assign

14970248
outputstream	inputstream
the inputstream and outputstream objects are final so i really don t think you can reconnect to desired device without restarting application

14970250
width	height
the height will differ based on the browsers width and there is content below the carousel

14970250
google-chrome	firefox
with some help from a friend i almost have this working in firefox the first slide jumps the rest animate but an obvious bug is happening with the sliding animation in google-chrome

14970267
min	max
to simplify design assume a set min and max height

14970280
hide	show
i ended up going with jquery show and hide functions

14970340
width	height
the problem is likely that you re not giving your container a width height

14970340
width	height
in this example i add your component to the body giving it a hardcoded width height this works

14970340
width	height
however if the parent container doesn t have a set width height the border layout will not work

14970348
inherited	properties
the enemy class from which enemy1 2 3 ect inherited contains a properties expired which is set to true from within the enemy class enemy.update when the enemy has reached a certain point

14970359
versioning	upgrade
i ve just upgrade it from a slow versioning that dealt with some gross javascript to a super fast php header redirect

14970377
getter	setter
you could make isselected into a property with a getter and setter like this

14970393
width	height
resample image with another width height

14970414
int	double
i can cast the double as int and subtract from the double to get .32000

14970444
google-chrome	firefox
this works nicely in google-chrome but not in firefox or ie

14970532
postgresql	mysql
we have native data stores in mysql postgresql and mongodb

14970543
width	height
to solve this problem you should put all your components inside one or usually more than one stack panel and align the controls left right height width etc... in relation to the stack panel

14970574
portrait	landscape
confirm you have an alternate layout out in your main.xml file portrait and landscape

14970579
xsl-fo	xslt
i think it doesn t work because there is no rule in the xsl-fo xslt stylesheet i am using to account for style

14970584
width	height
i am using a function to make a path element bigger or smaller based on width and height inputs by the user

14970584
width	height
the user selects an element and clicks on a button to fire up the function which takes the last known width and heght measurements and then asks from the user the new width and height values

14970584
width	height
i want when the user is asked for a width and height also to be asked for x y position on canvas and then move the selected element to that position

14970591
google-chrome	firefox
on this page i m creating for some reason the image is full size in firefox but it correctly resizes to fit google-chrome and other browsers

14970596
getter	setter
the simplest way to use it is to overload a getter and setter method like jquery does for its val and many other functions

14970612
ubuntu	linux
there are instructions on setting up vsftpd on ubuntu here other versions of linux will be similar i seem to remember fedora needing slightly less setup but that was years ago

14970620
folder	directory
1 go to conf folder in tomcat installation directory

14970645
superclass	subclassing
i would discourage subclassing as suggested by hot licks on account of the subclassing not being true to the superclass s intended implementation and use super could rely on being able to add null elements and thus this breaks it

14970661
apache	nginx
my server is nginx not an apache didn t thought that this info will valuable

14970688
spaces	linefeed
also since s can match all kinds of whitespace including linefeed and tabs you re better off using a literal spaces character

14970689
post	put
i m using wp limit post automatically plugin to my website and i put continue reading as a read more linktext

14970711
memcached	apc
keep in mind if your application is hosted on multiple live servers you will want to use a shared cache such as memcached or redis since apc s cache is only shared across processes on a single machine

14970714
chown	chmod
process running chown apache file or set the file to have write permissions to everyone chmod 666 file

14970741
maven	pom.xml
however with maven enabled i get this error in first line of the pom.xml

14970771
put	get
i put breakpoints at my applicationdidfinishlaunching and they never get hit

14970773
int	double
the round function declared in rounds a double value to the nearest int -- though the result is still of type double

14970786
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox and google-chrome with the same result

14970787
bionic	libc
so it calls the libm sin function which on android is supplied by bionic libc

14970793
children	parent
the children- next will point to the next children and the sibling- next will point to the next sibling from a common parent

14970836
google-chrome	safari
on google-chrome the print dialog hangs whereas on safari i see a blank page

14970884
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
i am pretty new to programming and but i just can t wrap my mind around trying to add subtract dividing or multiplying numbers

14970891
google-chrome	firefox
you can see this if you leave the text black while selecting on firefox it becomes invisible while on google-chrome you can still see it

14970904
int	double
even adding a double and an int is okay because the int is implicitly converted to a double

14970923
google-chrome	firefox
again firefox works perfect while google-chrome and dolphin do this mess

14970928
getter	setter
the uploaded file will be in file logo assuming proper getter setter etc. and i have no clue what formdata is

14970982
int	double
i have registered some custom editors to perform validation globally such as for ensuring numeric values double int etc in a text-field for ensuring valid dates regarding the joda-time api etc

14971012
height	border-box
the button uses border-box so the border is actually considered part of the box model height

14971012
box-sizing	border-box
perhaps add box-sizing border-box to the text input you will need -moz-box-sizing too

14971030
width	height
the issue i am running into is that i need to put a limitation in so that if the dialog is asked to grow beyond the width or height of the window it will simply grow to the in ratio maximum size it can

14971030
width	height
if we are asked to grow beyond the maximum width of the window the dialogs width including padding will be equal to the window width but the height will not be unless of course the dialog ratio happens to exactly match the window but that s unlikely

14971030
width	height
this is where i am getting stuck and my attempt is in code block #2 right now i am just doing the check for too big height but i have that working fine to do the height the issue is that i don t know how to work out what the width should be when the height step is adjusted

14971047
std	ostream
position the put pointer to the beginning of the file before writing to it using std ostream seekp

14971080
post	get
if you use it s aesthenhmac.aessimpledecryptwithpassword ciphertext password when the wrong password is used null is returned if the ciphertext or iv has been modified post encryption null is returned you will never get junk data back or a padding exception

14971086
margin	height
by default there is also a 4px border on the .flexslider div and i also had one more line of unwanted whitespace which i removed with a negative top margin equal to my default line height

14971092
serializable	deserialization
i prefer to use serializable apis like gson only for serializable deserialization tasks keeping those layers of the system as thin and as simple as reasonable

14971092
equals	compareto
so i d probably prefer to deserialize into the target largetestpojo and implement a compareto and or equals method for it or just put the two data sets into a map and compare from there

14971107
width	height
i ve tried using a wrap_content on the relativelayout height and width

14971141
linefeed	delimiter
towards the end of readrec to skip past the cr linefeed delimiter to the next line

14971149
portrait	landscape
i used the same method as op pre-ios6 present and dismiss a modal vc to show a single view controller in landscape mode all others in portrait

14971149
portrait	landscape
it broke in ios6 with the landscape vc showing in portrait

14971150
width	height
if the height needs to be shrunk 1 then the width would need to match the ratio

14971150
width	height
since 16 9 is referring to the ratio of the width over height

14971150
width	height
1 the height would need to be changed if height width and height max_height

14971168
for-loop	arrays
so i populate my arrays from a file using a for-loop like so

14971189
uicollectionview	uitableview
otherwise you should subclass an uiview like apple does with many components including uitableview speaking of datasource glkview uicollectionview

14971210
peer	p2p
for a p2p game you might have to agree on a consistent game state if the player was disconnected after sending commands to a subset of other peer

14971212
mouseup	mousedown
edit from op it made sense to not use the click action at all and only mousedown mouseup actions

14971219
int	chars
i was thinking that if i could generically sort in o n time i can accomplish this result in o n time but i m having a hard time doing that with strings int chars or whatever else may be used generically

14971260
postgresql	mysql
i would recommend to configure hive to use some database backed data store mysql postgresql and configure both hive and sqoop to use that

14971352
put	get
you can easily get and put with different keys into the same sharedprefs

14971397

14971738
onchange	onkeydown
u can call your function on both onkeydown and onchange event of textbox

and innodb is also having a table lock like myisam whenever data is not extracted with primary key

14971836
int	chars
cannot implicitly convert type int to chars

14971861
uitableview	reloaddata
i am aware that a uitableview s data source methods are requested when reloaddata is executed on the table view

14971924
folder	dir
i am sure that files like jks files are never bundled with ear they are in domain folder of the server or server dir weblogic websphere.

14971927
int	chars
however converting back from int to chars will need you to provide an explicit cast

14971927
int	chars
you need to explicitly convert your int to a chars for

14971939
stdout	fflush
or use fflush stdout

14971946

14972107
hex	binary
in earlier days people used to program using hex and binary

14972177

the big difference is that ejbs runs in a full featured java ee 5+ web application server like glassfish or jboss making it unusable in a servlet container like tomcat or jetty

14972219
put	get
when i put a breakpoint here i get an array of 1â s in allgradecategories

14972397
hash	salt
without salt the attacker hash all the words in a dictionary and sees which match with your users hash paswords

14972397
hash	salt
with salt he has to hash each word in the dictionary many times over once for each possible hash value to be certain of having one that fits each user

14972397
hash	salt
this multiplication by several thousand or possibly several million depending on how large a salt you use increases the time to hash all the values and the storage need to store the results -- the point that you hope it s impractical

14972417
regression	least-squares
setting up v as the dependent variable with ggplot i can easily show the usual least-squares regression of v on u

14972417
regression	least-squares
but i d also like to show the least-squares regression of u on v at the same time

14972421
put	get
alternately you can put the second word in your regular expression in a lookahead and capture it - but make sure you get the captures not the matches since the matches will still only include the first word

14972426
getter	setter
in this case it would need to say that any class that implements that interface would always have a property getter and a property setter

14972430
put	get
now i understand there a already in there however it seems like it doesn t work if you open a new window and type in the url the equivalent to bookmarking the page how i figure is that if i put this message above the line if the window doesn t close the customer will get the message

14972434
hash	salt
if the passwords are salt then the attacker must re-generate their hash tables using the hashing algorithm and the salt

httpconnection	downloading
along with this you use httpconnection class to establish the connection to the web server and you can downloading the content

i am pretty new to pom.xml files and maven so any explanation would be helpful

14973995

hid	keyboard
this was happening because i did not set a windowsoftinputmode in my manifest so it was using the default value stateunspecified which hid the keyboard on startup

14974164
hide	show
apparently that setting is applied after some delay on resume and so my call to show the keyboard only worked if my delay was longer than the built-in delay to hide it

14974164
hide	show
to fix i set windowsoftinputmode stateunchanged and then i always either hide or show the keyboard in onresume

14974241
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
notice that i added the collate latin1_general_cs_ai - this tells sql server what type of string comparison to perform if your database collation is case-sensitive cs you can remove this part of query but if your collation is case-insensitive ci you have to use the case sensitive version of your collation i used latin1_general case sensitive accent insensitive

14974253
maven	pom.xml
if your using maven then check in the pom.xml

14974277
viewdidload	viewwillappear
my app had exactly the same behavior when calling setregion method in viewdidload or viewwillappear

14974287
actualheight	actualwidth
while the code works properly i am trying to understand why the image actualwidth and actualheight do not change after the scaling

14974287
width	height
they are always the same as the width and height values

14974296
getter	setter
you could then attach actions to setter and getter to re-write the cpp_block into a method

14974314

i have a list defined by the layout list_item_new.xml in which i have an imageview and 2 textview

14974602
put	get
instead of using intent why don t you use shared preferences for put whatever values you want in it so that you can get anywhere in your app need not that should be an activity compulsory just pass context to that class in order to use shared preferences

14974658
viewdidappear	viewwillappear

i grepped through the vim 7.3 source and it looks like the redir is done with fopen puts and putc and fclose stdio

14974668
stdio	fflush
there did not appear to be any calls to fflush setbuf setbuffer setlinebuf or setvbuf so the redirection will always use the default buffering provided by your systemâ s stdio probably â œblock bufferingâ of some convenient size

better yet in my opinion don t use an uberjar but keep the dependent .jar files external and reference them in the class-path entry of the meta-inf manifest.mf file of your application this saves you a lot of hassle to get your uberjar working correctly or verify that it is actually working correctly

width	height
however since replaced elements can be resized using width and height as described in section 10 of the css2.1 spec this raises the question of why the properties don t seem to apply here

14979383
width	height
in the meantime if you want to be able to resize the after pseudo-element and the image that s generated you will need to apply it as a background image instead and â assuming browser support isn t an issue â use background-size along with width and height to scale it based on the understanding that those properties apply to the pseudo-element box instead

14982522
equals	gethashcode
sometimes hash table implementations need to call gethashcode for multiple objects or perhaps even equals for objects with different hash codes due to the way they use modulo arithmetic to place keys into buckets

hibernate does not need a multi-argument constructor it will call the zero-argument constructor and access the properties via getter and setter

14983295
getter	setter
if your class just carries some data and your constructors perform no checks on the validity of the provided parameters than you can just list the properties and use the facilities of your ide to create getter and setter

14983430
getter	setter
you should not break in the setter only in the getter

14983432

14984003
disk	ram
it seems like pytables have very smart io buffering system which as i understand stores data referenced by user in fast ram as alivenodes keeps referenced before and presently unreferenced data as deadnodes for fast reviving it when needed and reads data from disk if requested key is not present in both dead or alive categories

now you can just listen to a click event on all toggle anchors get the number from the id hide all reply divs and show only the matching reply post

14992326
spaces	delimiter
a possible alternative assuming spaces delimiter words is something like

14992355

the static notifycallback method seemed to get called back first unless the gcd callback block was put on the high priority queue

14992493
hash	salt
how do we generate hash passwords with salt using t-sql for storage in the database that would be identical to the ones that forms authentication would generate

14992535
int	chars
in the loop you can also convert the chars to int and store them someplace array probably where you can access them for calculations

14992543
hash	salt
you do not want to store the salt alone you should be storing both the hash and salt and then using both to verify the password

14992543
hash	salt
the password_hash function returns a string that contains both the hash and the salt

14992546
hash	md5
returns the md2 md4 md5 sha or sha1 hash of its input

14992568

14992788
debian	linux
if it complains about linux package y then use your linux package manager and install the development version of this package which is called normally in debian

14992809
width	height
the height should be of the proper aspect ratio based on the random width that was generated

14992819
client-side	server-side
you can see there some examples of http communication client-side and server-side

14992874

if you don t have home-brew check out this page for instructions to install saved my neck with many things including minimagick imagemagick and postgres

14992921
macports	homebrew
i am aware that there is a homebrew formula for this version of macvim but i am a macports user and i would rather not switch to homebrew just to resolve this. i also tried running cc clang ldflags -l usr lib . configure .... but still hit errors

14992938
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine on google-chrome but it only works on the sub-links under device and category on firefox

14992947
for-loop	loops
also the return straight after the for-loop will break loops - you need to add a to a buffer and then return the buffer after you ve done loops

14992953
for-loop	loops
also your loops condition in your for-loop is wrong

14992955
memcpy	strcpy
use strcpy memcpy to bing a local array variable to an outer string literal

14992960
submit	submission
assuming that .finalize is a submit button the page is getting submitted whenever you click on it because you are not stopping the page from submission by returning false from the click event handler

14992990
hash	md5
for md5 i found this which states 200 million hash checked per second

14992993
children	parent
this happens because parent don t stretch to fit their float children

14993003
for-loop	loops
the problem is that you re using for..in to loops when you should be using a regular for-loop

put	get
not sure what sort of features you are looking for but i just put up an extremely lightweight js router that offers the bare minimum to get things going

14993254
subtract	add
happily and sadly you have correctly implemented pixel-snapping when you add subtract .5 pixels to get your lines to align with pixel boundaries

14993256
put	get
not sure what sort of features you are looking for but i just put up an extremely lightweight js router that offers the bare minimum to get things going

14993320
spaces	delimiter
general idea would be to figure out how many delimiter spaces are in each field and run substring_index in a loop for each such field

14993321
entity-relationship	diagram
here is the entity-relationship diagram

14993366
post	get
typically it s hard to get a file over the wire without a form post

14993379
mp4	h.264
by mpeg if you are referring to h.264 mp4

14993379
opera	firefox
firefox and opera does not support mp4 within the html5 tag

14993379
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox	vorbis	webm
google-chrome firefox and opera supports this codec via webm which consists of vp8 video and vorbis audio

14993379

aside from tangential post get mixup always use json_encode to output php variables in js code

14993418
winpcap	libpcap	packets	pcap
pcap pcap pcap are often used to refer to a particular type of packets capture file those packets capture files written in the format that libpcap winpcap supports for writing

14993418
libpcap	wireshark
there are several other capture file formats one of which wireshark and libpcap 1.1.0 and later can read pcap-ng and several of which wireshark can read and some that wireshark can t read

14993418
libpcap	wireshark
the way i as a core developer of libpcap tcpdump and wireshark would say is the proper way to refer to files in the aforementioned format is pcap with no extra capitalization

14993418
packets	pcap
the pcap comes from libpcap not directly from packets capture and libpcap is not capitalized it s a un x library and those tend to have all-lower-case names given that almost all un x file systems are case-sensitive

14993418
winpcap	libpcap	packets	pcap
others may call it pcap perhaps because a number of terms in the computer and networking fields are acronyms or other initialisms and they assume pcap must be as well or call it pcap because they think of it as standing for packets capture rather than referring to libpcap and winpcap but then again people also referred to sun microsystems as sun it did come from the stanford university network project but it wasn t stanford university network microsystems it was just sun microsystems

14993420
oncreate	ondestroy
that s because onbind is called after ondestroy oncreate

14993440
min	max
this solution assumes all values are non-negative because i set max to -1 but you easily change max to int min or something like that

14993489
winpcap	libpcap	winpcap	wireshark	libpcap	wireshark
all programs that use libpcap winpcap to read capture files - and some that use their own code such as wireshark - can read a pcap file

14993506
google-chrome	firefox
when i call fetch on the object in firefox or google-chrome it runs perfectly fine

14993523
highcharts	highstock
i am currently considering purchasing highcharts or highstock

14993599
width	height
pimage have some requirement before its ready to run so a basic tip is make sure that the image of you are working with its equal in dimensions than the size width height of your .pjs doc must be

14993670
width	height
so when i m re-sizing the window using the resizegrip provided by the canresizewithgrip property the window itself will to stop to re-size at the moment it will reach the minimum width and height

14993685
winpcap	libpcap
libpcap winpcap write out capture files in the host byte order - the goal is to eliminate byte-swapping overhead when writing out live captures shifting the burden to the program reading the file

14993685
winpcap	libpcap
and yes libpcap winpcap capture what they seen on the wire but they add a file header giving for example the link-layer header type for the packets and add to each packet a packet header giving a time stamp for the packet the length of the packet as it appeared on the network and the number of bytes that were captured in case the capturing program were told to slice the packet at a maximum size to reduce the cpu and i o bandwidth when capturing if for example only the link-layer network-layer and transport-layer headers are interesting

14993711
hide	show
i also added a class .person to make it easier to hide or show the checkboxes

14993742
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works fine in firefox google-chrome safari and ie9

cpu	processors
use chrome s developer tools profiles tab to take cpu profiles which measure processors utilization over time and heap snapshots which measure memory usage in an instant as you use your app

14994028
actionscript	mxml
but i think you want to create the component in actionscript instead of mxml

14994383
children	parent
now what i want to do is return all valid parent and their children so this case i would return everything except id 3 parent 3

14994383

floating-point	integer
nsdecimalnumber and the floating-point types may be able to store bigger numbers than the integer types though with decreasing precision

14995306
hash	salt
as long as each hash has its own large random salt then yes it does become mostly impracticable if each hash uses an static salt you can use rainbow tables to weed out the users hashs who used password1 for example

14995306
scrypt	pbkdf2	scrypt	md5	pbkdf2	md5
using an good hashing algorithm is also important as well using md5 or sha1 is nearly like using plaintext with the mutli gpu setups these days use scrypt if not then bcrypt or if you have to use pbkdf2 then you need the rounds to be very high

14995315
postgresql	mysql
i would recommend getting your favourite dbms if you don t have a favourite all of the decent open source dbmses do it including mysql and postgresql and looking at the plans of various queries just to see what sort of operations the real systems implement

more formally i d like to find a function w rwc x min max where x is a vector that returns a vector of the same length that has the following properties

15002186
min	max
2 min w_i max for all i

15002186
min	max
4 if w_i and w_j are both different from the cutoffs min and max then they keep relativity that is if min w_i max and min w_j max then w_i w_j x_i x_j

int	chars
that is a chars is at least 8 bit both short and int are at least 16 bits and so on

15002213
x86	64bit
in c c++ code local variables are allocated on the stack and the space used there is different between 32bit and 64bit mode due to the point below and due to the different rules for passing arguments 32bit x86 usually on the stack 64bit x86 in part in registers

15002213
int	double
currently two main branches of 64bit environments exist il32p64 what win64 uses - int and long are int32_t only uintptr_t void is uint64_t talking in terms of the sized int from and lp64 what un x uses - int is int32_t long is int64_t and uintptr_t void is uint64_t but there s the subdivisions of different alignment rules as well - some environments assume long float or double align at their respective sizes while others assume they align at multiples of four bytes

15002213
int	chars
the examples just given are only about language primitives chars int long etc. but of course affect all sorts of platform-dependent runtime library data types whether size_t off_t time_t handle essentially any nontrivial struct union class .

the important thing to remember is that unless the target in this case timeband implements icomparable or overrides the equals members the comparison is going to be on references so two lists of different objects with the same values will show up as different unless one uses a helper of some sort to compare them

this is not very likely to be something you want to do for every single build i personally only use cobertura in jenkins

15006631
hide	show
as the code demonstrates i am trying to show the imgloading image while the task is carried out and the hide the icon when the task is complete

15006644
hide	show
i m attempting to conditionally show hide two divs using ng-show with a boolean value in scope based on when an ajax call has completed

15006644
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the ajax call is operating correctly and this works fine in google-chrome safari firefox but not the two versions of ie that we are required to support - ie7 and ie8

15006668
width	height
one table could be 200pt height when added to a page with a width of 400pt

15006668
width	height
the same table could be 400pt height when added to a page with a width of 200pt

15006668
width	height
if you don t know how to calculate the height of the rows in the subtables please note that you need to define the total width of the table and lock the widths

15006668
width	height
for the reason explaiined above no software can calculate the height of a table if it doesn t have any info about its width

15006682
width	height
i m having an issue setting the height and width in a usercontrol

15006727
solaris	irix
solaris irix and posix have a system call statvfs 2 that returns a struct statvfs defined in containing an unsigned long f_fsid

15006762
versioning	upgrade
if an abandoned project needs to be reactivated i would like to bring that drive to the tfs server an restore that project with all its files and its history workitems build definitions and sharpoint sites even if the original collection and the users of that project do not exist anymore and ideally even if we have upgrade to a newer versioning of tfs in the meantime

15006804
min	max
however the problem is when i try to find the min max values of these ids arrays it became very confusing with that many different arrays and elements

15006804
min	max
and then later on i can find the min max value easier by doing 1 for-loop and comparing the values using 1 if statement instead of many as would be in my previous example

15006804
min	max
edit without using vector from std or min max from std

15006821
children	parent
so i want to query the table for x number of records and order the results by post id with children of that post grouped with the parent where the result would look like this

15006821
children	parent
lets say there are 16000 records in the table in some sort of random order meaning the second 100 records records 101 - 200 might all be post children but i always want to return the results where parent of children are always returned with the children

15006821
children	parent
so with the above query if i use limit 100 25 i wind up getting results that are only children with no parent

15006830
width	height
those containers are the ones that usually set up the layout and most of them do take into account a set width height of their child elements

15006833
serializable	deserialization
using this the serializable and deserialization of classes within my defined data model mydata works when i serializable to a file and deserialize from the file to mydata

15006856
fast-forward	merge
as you ll have a straight history you ll be able to fast-forward to merge and this won t create any merge commit

15006862
portrait	landscape
the layout-land layout wil be used in a landscape orientation and the layout layout will be used in portrait or be used as a default

15006920
cvs	svn
does jenkins gets the project sources from svn cvs git

15007010
postgresql	mysql
i start off with something like mysql and then later on i might decide that postgresql makes a better fit - and if i have done everything the propel way switching to the new engine is trivial - rebuild and go

15007023
prepare	execute
then use that sql string with prepare and execute

15007050
implements	extends
therefore it makes sense to implements some baseactivity which extends activity and subclass it by every application activity

15007057
google-chrome	firefox
this is working in ie9+ firefox google-chrome etc

15007068
post	get
what i can t figure how to get the selected manufacturer from the dropdown list when the user post the view back to my controller and this method is executed

15007071
pbkdf2	salt
currently they recommend a long salt value and pbkdf2 with 64 000 iterations which iteratively stretches the key and makes it computationally complex to brute force the input values

15007071
scrypt	pbkdf2	hmac	scrypt	hmac	pbkdf2
there are other hmac functions that could also suit your needs that wouldn t require pbkdf2 such as bcrypt or scrypt but pbkdf2 is currently the industry standard that has received the most scrutiny

15007071
hmac	scrypt
one could argue that bcrypt or scrypt would also be suitable but this is yet another reason why a pluggable scheme should be used to allow you to upgrade hmac functions over time

15007131
implements	extends
you can make some abstract class which extends activity and implements this method

15007132
width	height
the tricky part at least for me is that the buttons need to be of the same width and height with a minimum and maximum width and height and centered in it s container

15007132
width	height
i can live with a code solution for the same width and height

15007178
jlabel	jslider
it is a class that creates a jpanel control that contains a jlabel at the top in one pane and a jslider and jspinner in another pane

15007204
width	height
i have worked out the width and height of images in the view however when i put these in as parameters to drawinrect it no longer draws on screen

15007264
width	height
i have a class that creates a canvas of characters with a desired width and height

15007264
put	get
rotate and fliphorizontal i have done fine and they work but i cannot seem to work out where im going wrong with flipping the array vertically out of interest i think i have horizontal and vertical the wrong way round but ill put a sample of what im trying to get done below

15007278
stdout	stderr
to capture a commandâ s stderr but discard its stdout

15007317
ubuntu	linux
i want to install the plugin on qgis 1.8.0 ubuntu 12.04 64-bit that is done by placing the compiled linux dtclassifier plugin file into

15007336
folder	directory
use a combination of cake s folder and file utilities to open the directory loop through the files and apply the necessary resizing

15007359
width	height
because you gave the textview height and width of 100dp

15007367
prepare	execute
of course check for success after each prepare and execute

15007378
rss	feed
the rss that it sends out for the feed is simple the page has one image and some text for testing

15007378
rss	feed
i have done this before with other rss feed and it displays properly

15007378
rss	feed
when you view the source on the correct rss feed the xml is all there in the tags as it is supposed to be

15007420
getter	setter
i have plenty of use case where i want to have a pair of getter and setter methods where the setter method should return self so that i can use it in a method chain

15007420
getter	setter
rather than following the convention i am tempted to name a pair of getter and setter methods like this

15007434
inherited	subclassing
thus unlike instance variables static variables cannot be inherited by or directly manipulated by subclassing .

15007435
for-loop	loops
i was trying to write this code using for-loop insdie for-loop but i don t know how can i loops the whole document word by word.

15007437
width	height
it has information regarding the specifics of the frame like width height etc

15007452
hide	show
i need to hide title on actionbarsherlock and show only logo

15007482
width	height
however all these use image galeries with a fixed width and height

15007482
width	height
this works if the site is of a fixed width but for dynamic sites where the site can expand both in width and height depending on window size this doesn t look great

15007501
google-chrome	firefox
this works a lot faster than the original especially in firefox where it performs a whole lot better google-chrome it s still pretty slow

15007538
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the webpage renders fine in google-chrome firefox safari on iphone and ipad but not on internet explorer only tried version 8

15007540
width	height
it is important to use the results from fz_bound_page for width and height because they contain the real unrounded dimensions of the page

15007550
apache-poi	docx4j
is docx4j relying on override tags which may not be present in the content types or is apache-poi not correctly writing content types for some of my files 3 out of 4

15007566
mouseleave	mouseenter
how would i go about finding a solution one idea i have is to remove the existing id on mouseenter before adding the class and then visa versa on mouseleave

15007568
getter	setter
they also have optional getter and setter methods like the setall method which fills all necesary fields

15007568
move	drag
also i want to implement an inventory system that uses slots as containers and can keep stacks stackable items only also the main feature of it is that you can drag and drop them into other slots for example to reorganize or to move to another inventory instance like a bank or to place in an hero s weapon or equipment slots if it is allowed and that you can click on them to display a screen that shows the name description and possible actions of the item which trigger the previously mentioned delete and use voids

15007595
versioning	upgrade
i don t want to upgrade libpcap versioning

15007639

15007708
google-chrome	firefox
i can t seem to get this working although it should be possible in theory i m trying this for over a week now but it s just doesn t work in ie7 or ie8 works as intended in firefox google-chrome safari.

15007748
put	get	post	get	post	put
if creating a product requires a passing in a store and shelf as a requirement then those should get passed in the body of your post or put if you re changing shelves

this will be installed side-by-side with visual studio 2010 it will not upgrade your existing installation

15007795
google-chrome	firefox
it s working in firefox and google-chrome

15007813
children	parent
it s also not a delegate situation because the children don t need to notify the parent of anything but the other way around

15007823
width	height
use percentages for the container containing the image for both it s width and height

15007823
width	height
then also use percentage for the image s width and height as well it doesn t have to be 100 it just has to be a percentage relative to its container

15007845
spaces	delimiter
if you can rely on your input text always having 10 numbers at the beginning and 4 word groups at the end then you can simply start with a delimiter that just splits on spaces s+ and after 10 calls to nextint switch to a delimiter that splits on a

15007859
pop-up	dialog
during this time i want a dialog box pop-up or some thing like that to appear infront of my gui which tells the user to wait with a message

the new line works on firefox but doesn t work on google-chrome v

15008211
range	max
need ability to configure max range for each number in sequence

15008234
multiplying	add
then you can still use your multiplygeneric function with arrays of this type multiplying elements of a and b will give you int s but that s okay because you can still add them to elements of c and get back values of type t to store back into c

15008388
google-chrome	firefox
jquery s documentation warns that cached images don t work well with this eventing handler code but it s working for me in firefox and google-chrome and i don t have to worry about ie

15008417
children	parent
i am creating a webpage for small primary school where teachers can make a new posts for children parent

15008437
uicontrol	uibutton
a solution i ve used is a simple subclass of uicontrol which allows more customization than subclassing uibutton and less hassle than nsattributedstring et al

15008519
post	get
i know that there s a million post on this but i ve tested everything and can t seem to get it to work

15008527

apache	nginx
you ll need to serve you page through apache or nginx and open your html with the url localhost or 127.0.0.1

15008551
gitolite	gitosis
an ssh connection to a gitolite server must always be done with the account which manages gitolite repos git or gitolite i doubt it is gitosis as in your question you would never connect as user1

15008585
rss	feed
i m trying to create a frontend with angularjs for an app that generates rss feed

15008585
rss	feed
i m conceptually stuck on what to put in my controller since i don t want the index.html to be rendered my single page app but the rss feed

15008589
put	get
you could put the data in a singleton class and just have each of your child view controllers get the data from the singleton

15008639
onresume	onpause
the documentation suggests that the data should be committed read in onpause onresume

15008639
onresume	onpause
one would then surely not write read in onpause onresume lest the user experience become sluggish

15008642
range	max
then for your max range per number just convert the base

15008645
xmltype	clob
i also was experiencing this same issue exactly as described by mikosz seeing an extra nul character around the 4000th character when outputting my xmltype value as a clob

15008645
xmltype	clob
i was trying to see the output of my xmltype but was tired of scrolling to the 4000th character so i started wrapping the clob output in a substr ...

i read about masonry and after failing to get image appending to work was advised to switch to the successor isotope

15008705

instead of adding error-bars however i was hoping to create a shaded box around each x y pair where the height of the box ranges from y - epsilon_y to y + epsilon_y and the width of the box ranges from x - epsilon_y to x + epsilon_y

15008735
put	get
when i put it to the template i get a syntax error within dreamweaver

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
as i say this setup works in ie9 firefox google-chrome safari - just ie8 playing silly buggers with me

15008768
onresume	onpause
it depends on the developer however i would write in onpause and if necessary read in a separate thread probably initialized with onresume

15008779
rss	feed
you cannot assume that an rss feed reader will interpret javascript in fact most don t since it s considered a security risk

15008779
rss	feed
so you need to generate the rss feed on the server-side

15008790
srp	principles
my default advice is to follow oop principles keept things simple do not to violate srp and create meaningful abstractions

15008814
onresume	onpause
using onresume and onpause guarantees that your data will always be current commits are made as soon as the activity goes to the background and new data is loaded as soon as it becomes visible

15008907
int	chars
so i m lost as to why cin is coughing on chars values that represent int -1 or int 255

15008907
int	chars
i ve tried a few different non-working combinations all involving either cin.get or cin.read with either chars or unsigned chars and call casts to chars and int in between

15008915
int	chars
to save space i d like to store the ips not as strings with decimal points but as 32-bit int 1 bit per int vs 1 byte per chars in the string

15008951
children	parent
children override the parent

15008959
children	parent
the code is quite informative in that it shows a class on a parent element dictating how the children decorative elements should be positioned

15008997
multiplying	multiplication
in order to observe correct results multiplying the matrices as model view projection which makes perfect sense as matrix multiplication is not commutative

15009039
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome lets you change it and so does firefox

15009110
post	get
and each time when user got view the post s replies attribute is get updated to a particular reply s created_at value if it newer

15009132

google-chrome	firefox
here s the fiddle tested in ie9 firefox 18 google-chrome 24 on a win 7 machine

15009352
oncreate	setcontentview
you should never call setcontentview again after oncreate though

15009362
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
i have tested the above with google-chrome opera safari internet explorer and on my iphone and it seems to work on these tested devices .

15009362
width	height
as the name says it has a width of 16px and a height of 9px to represent the aspect ratio

15009413
bmp	png
it looks like maxwidth option affects only pixel images like png bmp etc

15009426
single-quotes	backslash
to prevent that you need to quote the either by using a backslash or by using some single-quotes

15009446
width	height
basicly i removed padding declared height and width wrapped the close in a with a class called .label and set its margins

15009507

15009719
put	get
this way you iterate by all elements inside your div and get only the text put a n between them

15009723
wan	lan
set up a firewall i highly recommend pf between your wan connection the internet and your lan your other servers

15009723
wan	lan
use a private ip address space inside your lan and set up nat to forward traffic received on the firewall s wan interface so from the internet on port 80 to forward the request onto the web server which now lives on the lan at port 80

15009807
width	height
i m having an issue with a css gradient background i have for an 100 width height div

15009856
nsstring	nsobject
this method is by default impemented in nsobject and it does indeed compare memory addresses but it s overridden in most standard collection classes for which it s sensible for nsstring nsnumber nsarray nsdictionary etc. and it does a semantically more correct content-related comparison

15009860
joptionpane	jdialog
swap the frame to a modal jdialog or a joptionpane

15009886
jar	war
war is a way to package a jsf application in the same as jar is a way to package java classes

15009896
for-loop	loops
such a construct simply embeds particular instances of your loops variable i into a closure created within the constraints of your for-loop

15009960
hide	show
i basically want page1.php to stay and for the #address div to hide and the #done div to show when success is passed from page2.php

15010015
width	height
based on the selector in the jquery it will take all images and check the width height of the parent container .parent_container and fill the container

15010042
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
my solution after many different approaches to get this working across firefox ie safari and google-chrome was not have a 2 step download

15010047
sorting	grouping
i found the solution - remove the draw callback that the grouping plugin creates and reset the grouping sorting

15010048
ssl	https
also if you are using tokens to track session be sure to set the secure flag on the cookie so that the user s browser doesn t transmit the contents of the token unless connecting via ssl https otherwise the token will be sent in plaintext over http after being redirected

15010049
for-loop	loops
as the sqlcode is not 1403 our program does not exit from the for-loop and goes on an infinite loops

15010056
google-chrome	firefox
svg animation shows ok in google-chrome but although i see the image in ie9 and firefox i can t see the animation

15010062
umask	chmod
i tried to change permissions of files and folders by using chmod and umask but it did not work too

15010077

each of those instances will be created with the width and height that you have set here but at any point those can be overridden

15010100
mouse	keyboard
if you have a mouse you can click and drag with with middle mouse button to do a visual block i ve never found a keyboard command for visual block in st2 vintage mode though

15010109
google-chrome	firefox
my code won t refresh in any browser meaning not just internet explorer but also google-chrome and firefox

15010139
screens	tablet
but say later you were to develop the same screens for a tablet device and realize that the preparation screens is too barren and want to have both queryprep and display result show at the same time you would have to write a totally new 3rd activity

15010152
principalcontext	userprincipal
you should still be able to validate user credentials if they sit on 2 different domains you want to look at the following principalcontext userprincipal groupprincipal if necessary and validatecredentials which is probably the one you want the most

15010187
super	abstract
before fragments you had to re-write the much of the same code that 2 or more activities had in common especially if you couldn t find a good approach to abstract the ui control code into a super class

15010221
hide	show
but i need to have a background-image with the part of image setted as propriety for each cell so i ll can hide a single cell for show the background

15010221
hide	show
i can t set my background like in my fiddle because i need to hide a single cell and show the backgroud that will be a dynamic content

maven	pom.xml
the information on the archiva page regarding the pom.xml file will be needed but you will have to google maven deploy and read how to do it for your particular case

15010303
tcplistener	tcpclient
for some references checkout the tcpclient and tcplistener classes on msdn

15010315
screens	tablet
in short fragments were introduced to accommodate the emergence of tablet large screens devices and allow developers to create applications that will run across a wide range of screens sizes with very little change to code

15010407
getter	setter
than create another variable in the country class your bean class getter setter class

15010413
int	double
now we ll just do all our math as double but if the output type is integral we d like to round to the closest output int rather than truncating down

15010433
portrait	landscape
when the device rotates i have different layouts based on portrait landscape

15010498
min	max
ok i guess i had bad day earlier - i managed to solve this by using min and max values of xaxis and also assigning dummy values to both sides of curve generated at server side which will be left outside of visible view

15010502
put	get
i need to get data from form2- textbox and put to form1- textbox

15010524

oncreate	findviewbyid
why couldn t you use android configchanges and then override the onconfigurationchanged and then store whatever is in the edittext in a temp variable call you ui initialization method take out the findviewbyid from oncreate and put it in a seperate method and then set the edittext to the temp variable

15010609
ubuntu	linux
i have an executable jar file that i would like to start from a .sh script on ubuntu linux

if only mouseenter mouseleave existed you wouldn t have a choice in the matter

15011570
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter
speculation the reason why the creators of jquery created the mouseenter and mouseleave non-standard events is because their behavior works as you would expect the mouseover mouseout events to work without regard for descendants

getter	setter
while i m at it william s answer linked to why use getter and setter a language-agnostic question where the accepted answer is a list of reasons why accessors are sometimes a good idea

15012995
getter	setter
allowing inheritors to change the semantics of how the property behaves and is exposed by overriding the getter setter methods

15013005
getter	setter
you can combine the accepted solution to that question with typed getter setter to avoid any casts

15013005
getter	setter
alternatively if you are not actually concerned over ensuring only student objects can be added you can write an extension or category which adds a typed getter or setter - this just calls the standard setter or getter adding an casts as needed

anyway assuming you have a legitimate need not to include the id in the url the other way to do it would be to pass the id or the image path for that matter in via post rather than in the url get

get includes the parameters in the url where as post wraps them up in the request itself so they re not in the url

one last thing to keep in mind in this example the parent references don t cause any circular references because the parent don t have references to their children

multiplying	add
you cannot meaningfully add two addresses together in c or multiplying an address by a number or another address

15028200

think about it this way since addresses are just numbers and because math lets you multiplying and add numbers freely does not mean that the result of the mathematical operation would produce anything meaningful

my current loop shows 5 upcoming events however when the day of the event passes i cannot get those event post to not be displayed

15028570
int	double
tries to print a double with a conversion format for an int which also invokes undefined behaviour

15028570
int	double
printf reads part of the bytes making up the double and interprets them as an int common on 32-bit x86 since the double values you store are integral the significands have many zero bits and then on little-endian systems the bits that printf reads are all zero

15028585
width	height
you need to set this in the css using width and height

15028589

the only solution unless you can upgrade framework versioning is wrap your functionality in a wcf self hosted service and use it via web service or other ipc techniques

15028677
width	height
in your example width and height are just constant values you can store them as constant fields

15028697

i ve begun playing around with this idea by creating a render loop that clears the canvas saves it s state then draws a rectangular clipping region followed by drawing the background texture that occupies the entire width and height of the canvas

15029214
width	height
you can then put your items in a layout and be sure to sort the width height parameters to what you need - match_parent will fix your layout to the screen

the video s play perfectly in firefox and google-chrome but in ie9 i only see the poster image and no media controls

15033113
children	parent
the way i use this mechanism is as follows you always keep a shared_ptr from your parent to your children and you always keep a weak_ptr from your children to your parent

15033151
put	get
you could put your code inside an execution group instead in which lines of code get input to the right of a red prompt

multiplication	modulo	division	addition	division	modulo	division	multiplication	addition	modulo	addition	multiplication
implementing multiplication and division might be more costly than you would like but at least addition is easy modulo protecting against over underflow and you claim to not need any operations so even better

15033192
realloc	malloc
i m confused when allocating memory with malloc you have to provide a size however it sometimes happen that you don t know the size you need at that point so you either alloc a huge amount of memory which doesn t sound too wise since you re probably not going to use it all or you use realloc when the initial buffer size becomes too small

15033226
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
you ll get 900px in google-chrome firefox and opera

15033226
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox

setting the width and height in the datatemplate won t work

15033328
free	malloc
you dynamically allocate the buffer by calling malloc but you don t free this memory

don t forget to call free on a pointer pointing to the memory that has been allocated by malloc

15033329
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
os x uses a case-insensitive filesystem by default whereas git is internally case-sensitive and i believe the problem had something to do with this

in the example i had created however i did not even need to use those proprietary events as ie 10 happily used the standard mouse events mouseup mousemove mousedown and worked well to an extent

15033751
mousemove	mouseup
the main problem that arose for me while dragging was that the mousemove event stopped being triggered by the browser and the browser instead started panning the page leaving my dragged elements in limbo state no mousemove or mouseup triggered

15033764
fastcgi	scgi
you can also use scgi it is a lot simpler than fastcgi

15033981
post	get
when i post a request to my node server to create a new item i need to get the max item id from the item table

15033996
hide	show
you can then use this class as a styling hook in your css to show hide content depending on whether js is enabled

15033996

in other words you use javascript to change the no-js class to js and then use css to hide .js .read-more but show .no-js .read-more or whatever your hidden element s class name may be

15034002
stdout	stderr
that should make perf print the output on stdout or stderr

children	parent
basically i have a parent wrapper div which has min-width set and 2 floated children

15034107
for-loop	loops
sounds like mult divi and power are all 0 and you never change them-- therefore you re executing your while loops and therefore your for-loop an infinite number of times

15034109
put	get
i put break points there and they never seem to get hit

15034141
instances	transient
and in case of transient instances it returns a new instances does not modify the original

i d suggest instead preventing the default completely then submission the form if it is a form by using submit on the form node thus bypassing the jquery event handler

15034257

i am trying to implement a hover feature on my iscroll div where i am able to show hide the scrollbar

15034299
width	height
problem was i had put the wrong values for new width and height and mixed them with the old changed

15034315
min	max
your problem is being caused by the min and max attributes you ve added to your input

15034315
min	max
until you show more code the simple solution would be to remove the min and max attributes from that element

15034315

15034451
ostringstream	std
internally builds into a std ostringstream

15034451

15034460
post	put
you basically cannot post or put data using models

15034466
put	get
i m tyring to get data from my website and then put that info into a spinner

15034575
width	height
you can get the width and height of the image like that

15034623
post	get
after i get the _files array i do a little processing to make it easier to parse the images but post processing my values are truncated

15034625
range	max
so a call may look like this tag.update_tags 100 5 where 100 is the max number of objects returned in 1 call and 5 is the page to begin if you assume that the tags are stored sequentially what this is saying is return the tag records with ids in the range of 401 - 500

for the code below which is the contents of main.cpp i ve put under source files i get the following errors

15035208
unsigned	short	integer	unsigned
the reference station will be from an unsigned short so a 2 byte integer

15035407
outputstream	inputstream
you are producing an outputstream that presumably you want to send to your client and you have a process that you know how to do that needs an inputstream actually the reader interfaces might make some of this easier but the fixes are parallel

15035407

while my javascript no longer has any action associated with the submission of the form when i submit a search the page fully reloads with the search performed and displayed correctly

15035529
disk	ram
the alivenodes live in the ram while the deadnodes are probably stored on disk in hdf5 files the binary file format used by pytables

15035529

since the ram is limited it will probably kill write to disk an unused alivenode to make some room beforehand

15035570
consistency	acid
consistency acid

g++	gcc
anyway none of the answers so far has mentioned the actual reason why linkage doesn t work with gcc but does so with g++

15035701
vim	emacs
however if you re using an editor like emacs or vim you can try ghc-mod

15035701
vim	emacs
if you re not using emacs or vim you could probably wrap ghc-mod as a ghci extension or something but i think that would be somewhat awkward

15035701
vim	emacs
of course if you re not using emacs or vim you probably should p

15035751
jar	war
the other project b has a webapp web-inf beans.xml but when looking at the deployed war of a project b is represented as a jar containing only class files no beans.xml

15035751

is does not matter if the shared server is restrict to 80 and 443

15036237
rdf	owl
i am aware of manually creating and java object to rdf owl object mapping by jena api but i need the automation of the mapping of java source code to rdf owl object

15036238
int	chars
you can convert a digit chars to the int it represents by doing this

15036267
post	get
after processing a post request i am doing the very standard thing of redirecting to the same page so that the user won t get a confirm form resubmission or equivalent dialog if they reload the page

15036267
firefox	safari
this works as expected in safari and firefox

15036267
pop-up	dialog
chrome pop-up the confirm form resubmission dialog

15036267
post	get
in chrome i can use the network inspector to see that the 303 redirect is indeed issued and there is a get following my initial post

15036269
starttls	smtps
starttls provides a way for text protocols smtps imap pop3 etc. to negotiate a secure connection using tls ssl within an existing established plaintext connection

15036269
starttls	smtps
the amazon ses smtps interface currently requires the handshake protocol and does not support starttls

15036269
starttls	smtps
the documentation of net smtps ssl claims it supports the handshake protocol with ssl while net smtps tls suggests that it supports only starttls not the tls handshake protocol

15036281
int	chars	int	boolean
so i m pretty sure the value category of int chars boolean and floating literals are prvalues

15036294
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome seems to have no issues yet both firefox and ie have the problem

15036305
int	chars	int	boolean
so i m pretty sure the value category of int chars boolean and floating literals are prvalues

15036320
mouseleave	mouseenter
.hover also takes two arguments one function for mouseenter and one for mouseleave so you can write it like this

15036367
put	get
but this should get you where you need to be once you figure out how to put it in the correct syntax

15036370
int	double
also there s no need to cast an int to a double

15036390
int	double
one of the reason int double etc wrapper classes were introduced is to avoid casting

15036396
int	double
int and double are not cast compatible but int and double are widening compatible

15036396
int	double
in your current code the right hand side rhs of your expression is getting autoboxed up to an int then you specify a cast of that result to double

15036396
int	double
by instead specifying a widening conversion the int result gets unboxed into an int then converted to a double

15036422
put	get	post	get	post	put
even though i know the server is expected a post i tried get and put too and still received the same error

15036433
typedef	struct
the idea behind typedef is to let you skip the struct keyword

15036446
typedef	struct
using a typedef also provides some abstraction because it means that cairo_clip_t can be implemented as either a built-in type or as implemented as a struct without causing a change in the syntax of the client code

15036451
jar	war
all of the projects i am using my interceptor project in are either jar war and cdi-enabled

width	height
2 i have code behind to grab the width height of the image

15036457
width	height
unless i explicitly set the height width the code behind tries to grab the height and width and crashes .

15036457
width	height
but if i set the width height explicitly i m afraid it s not going to grab the available space

15036525
google-chrome	firefox
i want my audio to play if the browser does not support the mime type of a file in google-chrome and firefox my code works but when it comes to ie9 it stops working

if not then i would suggest running it with a profiler jprofiler yourkit etc. this tools can point you to your hotspots very easily

15036618
google-chrome	firefox
problem happens in both firefox and google-chrome so i suppose it is my code rather than the same bug in both browsers

15036657
silex	slim
i think youre confusing how you would typically work with slim or another similat microframework like silex

15036659

i have already written the program in question which is quite readable and hopefully won t get me put in programmers hell and i am curious as to how low i can get the char count

15036804
post	get	webclient	httpwebrequest
what you can do now is simulate that post request either with webclient or with httpwebrequest then you will get your new web page you can work on that new webpage using htmlagilitypack

15036818
getter	setter
better yet let the compile synthesize the real and imaginary setter and getter methods for you by defining them as properties and your code is greatly simplified

15036821
min	max
we could improve this by comparing the min and max of each row and decide based on that whether it is possible for a number num to fall between min_num and max_num of that row

15036856
getter	setter
or using the getter setter on automationproperties

15036891
pull	push
it s full duplex and lets you push and pull content in both directions

15036894

15036937
profiling	benchmarking
the profiling helpfully pointed out what the problem is your benchmarking is comparing apples and oranges

15037007
versioning	upgrade
and to upgrade wordpress editor tinymce to an advanced versioning of itself via this plugin

15037019
width	height
the applet would specify a width height in html

15037021
wxpython	kivy
if you re not completely committed to wxpython and for anyone else looking for a cross platform python gui framework i recommend you check out kivy

15037069
for-loop	arrays
also for purposes of illustration and since you used the for-loop above i will assume we can keep an index for each of the arrays but i ll talk about how to get around this later

15037080
int	chars
this does a greedy match which would be problematic if you ever have any commas other than the one that separates the initial int from the chars you want to retain

15037086
for-loop	arrays
then at the bottom of the page i call a for-loop on the arrays as follows

15037091
getter	setter
private should be used when you want to force a concrete class to go through a getter or setter defined in the abstract class

15037130
hide	show
using the following code on a touch overflow container works fine except during fast scrolling quick successive flicks and while the content is still moving from resulting momentum. during fast momentum scrolling the div does not show hide until the content slows eases into a rest position

15037166
width	height
if you are happy having a tab bar that is always the same height in pixels but just changes width then you could use something like this

15037166
width	height
it will span the whole width of your screen with a fixed height

15037210
int	chars
you can also add try and catch blocks to ensure the program does not crash when the user inputs wrong type of data int instead of chars

15037239
folder	directory
when you git checkout it will dump the appropriate files and folder into your working directory that is the folder containing the .git folder

15037297
textview	simpleadapter
if you still want to switch to an arrayadapter then you have to overwrite the arrayadapter s getview method because an arrayadapter supports only a single textview per row unlike the simpleadapter that supports mapping of multiple values to multiple views for a single row

15037339
rtp	rtsp
there are so many posts about rtsp protocol generating rtp packets from android

15037492
qmainwindow	qwidget
the top-level window can be a simple qwidget or a qmainwindow if you need the extra functionality provided by it like menus tool bars status bar etc. if you use a qmainwindow you should still use another widget set that as the qmainwindow s central widget setcentralwidget and then add the list and table to that central widget

15037690
fts4	fts3
am planning to create a simple search engine in python python3 .going through the documentation for sqlite fts3 fts4 it became my choice to store the documents since full text searches are fast.i already have a set of webpages with their text extracted and saved in text files

15037723
chunked	transfer-encoding
we may observe this behavior in fiddler by unchecking the chunked transfer-encoding in the transformer tab of response pane

15037927
firefox	safari
also both subdirectories work great in every other browser ie firefox safari

15037959
int	boolean
you could replace them with int and boolean returns to resolve that though

15037976
hide	show
another important point while activity bindings can hide ui elements those ui elements will automatically be show again if the workbench needs them

15037990
width	height
your for-loop runs through and will use the height and width values

15037990
width	height
an array usually starts off with 0 and width and height are just array counts typically

15037998
disk	ram
cpu a processing node needs the fastest cpu you can afford whereas a db machine can often make do without often its performance is gated on disk and ram

15037998

15038233
width	height
problem is that both the list and the bottom text overlap the respective button s when width height is set to 100 in the jsfiddle example i used lower numbers for demonstration purposes

15038233
margin	height
all examples i have seen with a fixed footer and height filling columns use some fixed size height for the footer which is then negatively applied as margin but my footer should just wrap it s content

15038259
uiview	subviews
just add the button as subviews of a uiview and also add button s title uilabel as subviews of the same uiview

15038282

you should use setinterval instead settimeout

15039324

mdpi	hdpi
on xhdpi devices i have no artifacts but on mdpi and hdpi devices there are artifacts

mdpi	hdpi	screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi
so i got good result without any artifacts for xhdpi and hdpi screens but for mdpi screens images were too big

15039744
mdpi	hdpi
then i put big star images to xhdpi and hdpi folders and small star images to mdpi folder

15039744
mdpi	hdpi	screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi
but it seems like android choose images from hdpi or from xhdpi folder and scale them automatically for mdpi screens because i have artifacts again

15045937
oncreate	setcontentview
i guess setcontentview r.id.yourlayout is not created in oncreate

15046085
versioning	upgrade
i don t understand why this doesn t succeed as it says nhibernate just need to be versioning 3.3.1 or higher so why is it trying to force an upgrade to 3.3.2 i want to keep it at 3.3.1 which then isn t compatible with castle

16-bit	64bit
one could theoretically conceive of a 32-bit os that addresses 4gb of memory and therefore would need a segment system common with 16-bit os s but the practicality is that 64bit systems became available before the need for that complexity arose

15046336
put	get
unfortunately i didn t ever get to put nice tests around this and submit a pull request to mr

15046346
ubuntu	linux

width	height
define a class window that implements the guicomponent interface and has the following members - width height xpos and ypos integer instance variables with xpos and ypos initialized to 0 - a constructor that accepts two integer variables width followed by height which are used ti initialize the width and height instance variables - an implementation of open that sends window opened to system.out and returns true - an implementation of close that sends window closed to system.out and returns true - an implementation of resize that modifies the width and height variables to reflect the specified size - an implementation of move that modifies xpos and ypos to reflect the new position

15046404
implements	extends
the generic base repository class should only implements methods that make sense for all repositories that may extends it

15047084
hash	salt
well theoretically salt only need to be unique in the sense that no other password should be hash using that salt

15047084
scrypt	salt	scrypt	pbkdf2	pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt
if you use a salt and you hash the password correctly using something like bcrypt scrypt pbkdf2 etc. then it will take a long time to crack just a handful of passwords -- let alone an entire database

udp	tcp
i have read about the topic on the wiki articles of ethernet osi model tcp udp routing no links due to new user restrictions and others but was not able to get my specific problem answered

15047376
udp	tcp
that solution is flawed in the sense that i would need 2 software solutions one for a d one for b c plus it restricts the connection to the tcp and udp protocols also it does not really simulate a connection - it is only a workaround to route information from a to d not the simulation of a peer-to-peer connection

15047398
logmein	hamachi
i ve used logmein hamachi which is free to accomplish this in the past

your for-loop makes sure you return false and then your while loops always sets i to 20 this is your infinite loops

15048530
free	malloc
then originalarray is still the value that was returned from malloc which is what free wants to get back

15048530
free	malloc
summary you should always free the exact pointer that malloc returns and you should never discard change the value of that pointer

15048545
octal	decimal	octal	binary
a byte is 8 bits and can be expressed in decimal 0 to 255 octal 000 to 377 hexadecimal 00 to ff or binary 00000000 to 11111111

by accessing them through the public and or protected methods we are testing how the system would behave in production

15054535
public	protected
this approach will also allow you to manage test coverage through sending all combinations of data through the public protected methods

15054554
mockito	jmock	mockito	easymock	junit	jmock	junit	mockito	junit	easymock	easymock	jmock
so using junit plus any mocking framework you suggest easymock i use mockito or there is a third one called jmock is a great idea

15054554
junit	easymock
so using easymock with junit should give you better coverage and better tests than junit alone

of course the better design is also to have 2-args bicycle constructor and initialize your attributes in it.or to have setter and getter for your attributes

15055018
folder	directory
also i am using the solarized theme the guy suggested but there is no difference now in color between folder and files in my terminal when listing a directory

pull	push
to update a pull request point #1 the only thing you need to do is checkout the same branch the pull request is from and push to it again

15055671
pull	push
the usual way to push pull between repos is to git remote add name url but that s just a convenience and also required for the remote tracking branches

15055685
concave	angle
if either head corners of edge are concave you can replace their inner angle with pi 2 to prevent reduction from those corners

15055698
pull	push
either way it will not affect what s in the repository in fact you ll likely need to enter this password every time you push or pull to github

15055699
screens	hdpi
i m assume you re using an hdpi screens to do this since the density factor for hdpi is 4 3

15055718

they are just a convenience to a give git push and pull a default behaviour and b to receive information about the local branch status in contrast to the remote one in the git status output

15055838
width	height
you may wish to specify a minimum width and height for the area the image

15055838
width	height
so lets say you have a panoramic image - above code will make sure that the minimum width is 50 pixels but it s height might only be 15 px because of its aspect ratio

15055844
width	height
say that your header has a class of .header and a width and height of 800x50

15055847
width	margin
as long as your image div has a fixed width or percent so it scales it will stay centered with a left and right margin of auto

15055847
width	height
the inner div is flexible width set height and stays centered

15057929
int	chars
toupper tries to interpret that int as a chars finds out that it s non-alphabetic and returns it unmodified

15057929
int	chars
that s sheer luck on other platforms your program would probably crash because of truncation in the pointer to int conversion and because the behavior of toupper on int outside the unsigned chars range plus eof is undefined

15057929

15071750
pdu	smpp
so far the smpp response pdu has a sequence number and operation status code

15071767

mouse	keyboard
you can either simulate them via javascript or you can use os-level mechanisms so-called native events for simulating mouse and keyboard events

15072110
mouse	keyboard
native events on the other hand are far more closely representational of a user s actual mouse and keyboard operations

15072131
dao	facade
on your facade or dao clasess

15072183
width	height
if possible the best and easiest way to do this is to use javascript to calculate the height and width of the elements then position the inner element accordingly

width	height
with this solution you don t have to manually set width and height

15072190
post	get
to get the data out simply in your deletephotofile method and check the response in your browsers console it should be a nicely formatted array with the data you post d over in your ajax request you should be able to work out the rest from there

solaris	bsd	solaris	aix	bsd	aix
the common un x and un x-like systems linux macosx bsd solaris aix hp ux surely behave like that

15072339
cifs	smb
to filesystems though the picture is different because network filesystems - whether nfs smb cifs or others do not always maintain o_excl as this could result in denial-of-service if a client does an open ... o_excl ... and then simply stops talking with the fileserver is shut down everyone else would be locked out

and with an unsigned 64-bit integer type you can also represent f 93

15072391
int	double
you should use double temp rather than int temp

15072391
addition	multiplication
you need to have a different starting value for addition versus multiplication

15072397
width	height
i m just guessing since it s hard to test but i don t think width and height attributes in should include px

15072407
multiplying	multiplication
it doesn t work for multiplication because multiplying anything by 0 gives well 0

serializable	deserialization
then i realized i could do basically the same thing with a single self-contained script that only loads necessary django settings and does the serializable deserialization directly

15072877
serializable	deserialization
side note one critical part of doing this type of migration regardless of which technique you use south serializable modification deserialization or otherwise is that as soon as you set auth_user_model to your custom model in the current settings django cuts you off from auth.user even if the table still exists

width	height
the minimum height width of a view textview is determined by its background drawable amongst other things

15073274
width	height
it uses the background drawable s getminimumheight and getminimumwidth to determine the view s minimum height and width

15073274
width	height
it looks like you want the view s minimum height and width to be 0 excluding padding and the view s width height should be based only on the view s content in your case the textview s text

15073288
folder	directory
git only tracks files and folder within the root folder which includes the .git directory and the subfolders inside root folder

for sizing the image to fit in the div specify either the height or width of the image

15073989
sorting	filtering
you are actually filtering not sorting

15074105
many-to-many	one-to-many
if you know you will need to switch to one-to-many or many-to-many later then you d likely use a fully-fledged join model that has an id column

i have used yourkit profiler to capture cpu snapshots shortly after startup and then again later when it s significantly slower

15074544
stdout	stdio
so using the bare mimimum the stdio library you can write to stdout using ascii graphics as the other answer shows or you can output a simple graphics format like xbm which can be viewed with a separate image-viewing program

15074564
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox work perfectly however

15074578
width	height
here is the problem im having in the oncreate i would like to initially set the imageview to the first image in the list of files but with the imageviews width and height when it flips back and forth it sets the image to the imageviews dimentions no problem but in the oncreate i get illegalargumentexception width and height must be greater than 0

15074623
rdf	owl
owl and rdfs are more expressive than rdf which means here that you can capture more complex relations for instance you can also represent the link between sets of things rdfs subclassof or use transitive properties hasancestor

15074623
rdf	owl
owl can be serialized as a rdf graph too and is particularly useful coupled with a reasoner

15074623
rdf	owl
so owl can express everything that rdf can but rdf alone cannot capture some of the statements available within owl

15074623
rdf	owl
modeling temporal or dynamic information is challenging using either rdf or owl

15074623
rdf	owl
the second question is more in the realm of rdf and owl

15074623
rdf	owl
it s an example involving a dynamic behaviour tricky to capture with rdf owl

15074699
width	height
the height and width of the image view will only be calculated when a layout is requested for the parent view which is after oncreate has finished

15074699
width	height
you should implement an ongloballayoutlistener and get the imageview s height and width from there

alertdialog	progressdialog
i have alertdialog and i want to show progressdialog after clicking on alertdialog positive button during internet connection - asynctask

15074807
children	parent
a common example of this is when you have an object hierarchy where a parent class holds a reference to children who intern hold a reference to the parent

15074807
children	parent
the children will likely not need a strong reference to the parent as they will be expected to go out of scope when the parent does

15074866
post	get
i have now spent hours trying to figure out how you do this by reading other s post - i even got a jsfiddle to work but can t get this to work in my page

free	strdup
or perhaps for readability you should strdup the strings you get from _get_text and then pass those into _set_text and free those later

15074946
parent-child	one-to-many
with that being said wherever you have a parent-child relation ship in your object one-one or one-to-many mapping they should be stored inside your in a foreign key table

15074956
width	height
i need to dynamically generate images based on url parameters width height fit fill etc

15074956
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
the origin server would get the images from s3 process them using graphicsmagick since it s much faster than imagemagick then serve them

15075007
width	margin
so the width + the margin 275 and that s how it renders

15075007
width	margin
in ie the browser is subtracting the margin from the width so the total width is 245 with the 15px margins inside that

15075022
google-chrome	firefox
for firefox and google-chrome works perfectly

bazaar	git
in addition to the backup configuration that dualinity has described i d suggest you put all your emacs customizations under version control git hg bazaar etc.

15075408
width	height
if auto then grid stretches its width and height to fit its content hence why your grid.width is greater than windows width

15075408
width	height
now after implementing you use the column.width height which is inside window boundaries as your final width height and inside the grid you can measure the desized size of your nested innner controls

15075433

15075492
google-chrome	firefox
it functions fully in firefox but only partially in google-chrome or ie

15075541
screens	tablet
on the phones everything is displaying properly the tablet are the problem because they take small resolution assets for their big screens so the actual size in inch 4cm measured with a ruler is correct but they actually look small making the overall design incorrect

15075543
spaces	delimiter
findstr will split the search string into multiple search strings delimiter by spaces

15075545
for-loop	loops
i ve tried for-loop foreach loops zip array_merge and array_combine but unable to attain desired results

15075545
for-loop	loops
this is the code i ve tried but foreach loops iterates multiple time every time for-loop iterates

15075588
min	max
a slightly more efficient version is to use min and max assuming that the site_id is never null

15075588
min	max
this is because min and max generally require a bit less processing than count distinct

15075615
accessor	properties
config.ts 32 6 properties accessor are only available when targeting es5 or greater

15075622
width	height
the width and height dpi can be acquired by overriding the onconfigurationchanged method in your activity and using newconfig.screenwidthdp and newconfig.screenheightdp

15075753
addition	modulo
modulo can also cause a divide-by-zero and it has a higher precedence than addition

15075772
union	distinct
assuming that username is unique in each table your second query would be the way i would try first with the slight modifications of removing distinct and simply using union which implies distinct rather than union all

15075774
inherited	properties

15075939
persistent	transient
it goes into lengthy explanations of transient persistent and detached state which i will point out some questions about

15075939
instances	transient
transient instances will be

15075939
persistent	transient
basically i read the documentation about hibernate - working with objects but the explanations of persistent and transient state are still unclear and therefore so are save update and saveorupdate

the conceptually simplest approach is to simply manually set the surfaceview s width and height by updating the surfaceview s layout to a fixed-size one with layoutparams and setlayoutparams

15076575
width	height
but for testing you can just force your surfaceview to have the width of the test device s screen and height set by

15076946
outputstream	inputstream
i was considering if it makes sense to associate an inputstream or outputstream to get set the value rather than reference the string itself - which means when i attempt to read the value of the contents i read it as a stream of bytes rather than a whole huge string loaded into memory.

15076948
versioning	upgrade
i assume your old versioning was 2 but you explicitely expect the upgrade to only work for databases older than 2

15077783
spaces	delimiter
the php explode will break a string into an array using a delimiter in this example using a spaces

15077783
button	checkbox
the radio button will get you whether blue or green is submitted - if you want to also submit blue green with it as part of the question_9 array regardless of whether blue or green is checked you should be able to just add a single hidden field like you said removing checked attribute since it only applies to checkbox and radio button

15077814
mouseleave	mouseenter
.click is shorthand for it but i like using .on just because it allows for less potential codewriting if you want to do more like mouseenter mouseleave for example because you can combine them into a single codeset

exif	jfif
i am trying to save an image into the camera roll while preserving all the original exif jfif data

15078357
exif	jfif
when i save the image via the original exif data is preserved but jfif is stripped out

15078357
exif	jfif
formally the exif and jfif standards are incompatible

15078357
exif	jfif
this is because both specify that their particular application segment app0 for jfif app1 for exif must be the first in the image file

15078357
exif	jfif
this will not affect the image decoding for most decoders but poorly designed jfif or exif parsers may not recognise the file properly

15078374
asterisk	freeswitch
set up an asterisk or a freeswitch server

15078390

15078454
radiobuttonlist	onclientclick
the next candidate would be the client-side onclientclick event but the radiobuttonlist control doesn t have an onclientclick event

15078454
radiobuttonlist	onclientclick
so the solution which worked for me when i tested it was to hook the client-side onclientclick event for each listitem in the radiobuttonlist

15078454
radiobuttonlist	onclientclick
might consider subclassing radiobuttonlist and adding a server-side addition of the listitem onclientclick hook to each of the child listitems before sending it to the client and then using your custom version of radiobuttonlist instead of the stock version

i ve also read about other issues using the locale property on the datefield component which suggested just modifying the day and month names flex 4.5 setting locale for datefield does not work but that is not sufficient for the hijri calendar which has a different way of counting days months and years to the gregorian calendar

15078621
hide	show
my only other thought is to run them in separate divs and hide or show depending on the active function

15078626
post	get
most browsers can t do http requests other than get or post from html forms so it s generally emulated using a http post with an override header or a special form variable

15078654
post	get
the reason to use post for emulating delete instead of get is because some http verbs aka methods are deemed to be safe by the http specification

15078654
post	get
according to the w3c latest candidate recommendation for html5 the html5 form element does not support values for the method attribute other than get or post

15079292
int	chars
without knowing any more about the problem the most straightforward solution seems to be splitting off the last chars converting the rest to an int and then handling each final chars as a separate case

15079293
int	chars
hence when comparing with another chars or int iso c++ forbids when you try to compare an int or a chars with a pointer example a string

put	get
that is what allows you to put the definition in a .cpp files and get no unresolved reference error by the linker as long as in other translation units you only use those template instantiations

15079756
queue	fifo
consider for example the so-called banker s queue which is a fifo fifo queue made out of two stacks

15079756
put	get
now i claim that the amortized cost of put and get is o 1 assuming that i start and end with an empty queue

15079756
put	get
the analysis is simple i always put onto the right hand stack and get from the left hand stack

15079756
put	get
so aside from the if clause each put is a push and each get is a pop both of which are o 1

15079756
put	get
i don t know how many times i will execute the if clause -- it depends on the pattern of put s and get s -- but i know that every element moves exactly once from the right-hand stack to the left-hand stack

15079756
put	get
so the total cost over the entire sequence of n put s and n get s is n push es n pop s and n move s where a move is a pop followed by a push in other words 2n put s and get s result in 2n push es and 2n pop s

15079756
put	get
so the amortized cost of a single put or get is one push and one pop

15079785
dsn	pervasive
i do see a .net framework data provider for odbc and if i put a dsn name for a pervasive dsn like demodata it works

15079795
tar	md5sum
tar generates a different file each time check with md5sum the reason is ordering is different

15079802
post	put
i put so much effort into this post just to find out it was a simple problem with command line compiling

15079808
getter	setter
then added the respective getter and setter to the order class

15079818
int	chars
you re then attempting to parse an int from the full string not just the first chars this is why your call to parseint is failing

15079825
mouseover	mouseenter
you can bind to a hover-like event with mouseover and mouseenter

15079834
width	height
then you can set margins and so on for the datagrid to place it however you like and provided it has its width and height set to auto it will keep with its parent container

15079834
width	height
now if you have several other controls in the picture of course it s a bit more involved but i still recommend keeping with grids and splitting them into however many rows and columns you require then setting the appropriate values for their height width respectively - you can make some columns fixed in width or a multiple of other column or leave them as auto and they will take up the remainder of the space

15079845
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
seems to be working fine on google-chrome and safari ie and firefox have thrown a hissy fit

15079872
dictionary	map
you could use a dictionary or a collections.defaultdict to map yearmonth strings to a float representing the sum of the values

15079879
int	chars
you ll get a numberformatexception there because the int class can t parse the letter chars you re passing it along with the number

15079887
oodbms	db4o
if you are familiar in oodbms and your tables are small consider to use db4o

15079898
width	height
you can make the size of the .png dependent from width and height and change these with the slider-value

15079905
gitpython	pygit2
but most likely all you need is something like pip install pygit2 or pip install gitpython or something like that

15079906
for-loop	arrays
i am trying to shorten my code by using a for-loop and an arrays to define my declared edit texts but it won t work

15079909
getter	setter
your set a getter and a setter like this

15079909
public	protected
this will only work on public variables as private and protected variables cannot be accessed from outside of your class

15079909
codeigniter	cakephp
codeigniter cakephp etc

15079947
clang	icc
the above function call compiles and returns true on gcc 4.7.2 and gcc 4.8.0 beta while it won t compile as i would expect on clang 3.2 and icc 13.0.1

15079958
dao	facade
if you write your own dao you probably will create your service just how you need so writing a facade is an indication you did it wrong

15079958
dao	facade
if the dao is built by a third party and is more complex than your needs then you can facade the service

15079958
dao	facade
a facade could wrap up the dao layer but i don t really see this happening in a useful way

15079958
dao	facade
if you write your own dao you should never need a facade

15079996
width	height
given the grid cell square size width height number of columns and number of rows i d like to dynamically generate the grid on the screen

15080008
spaces	delimiter
desired output delimiter by tabs or double spaces is fine

15080049
typedef	struct
your struct typedef is basically saying if i had a status field in my record it could have the value call or the value wait

15080076
dbcontext	objectcontext
also what version flavor you re using - dbcontext or objectcontext

15080112
post	get
as per restful services guidelines we should use get for reading a resource post for creating a new resource delete for deleting an existing resource etc

15080116
hide	show
the keyboard show up ok but i can t hide it the back button closes the programme

15080122
cpu	affinity
i don t think setting process cpu affinity is the way to go as it can be easily changed at runtime

15080144
hide	show
iam trying to show hide a div based on the radio button click in yii form

15080148
put	get	post	get	post	put
i can get post put delete models in these collections with impunity

15080167
realloc	malloc
otherwise you run the risk of trying to realloc something that you have never malloc -ed in the first place

15080170
post	get
i would like to attach this text using the post method but i get the following error

15080187
width	height
in order to prevent resizing of elements when the embed is generating you should also explicitly set the width height of the container element

15080193
jar	manifest.mf
our project jar definitely includes the jruby-complete-gems-1.6.8.1.jar and its manifest.mf file includes the correct bundle-classpath directive

15080217
folder	directory
in this case idle.app uses your documents folder directory as its working directory in shell notation documents also spelled users your_login_name documents

15080229
free	realloc
it is bad to set matrix realloc since you will never be able to free it in case realloc fails

15080239
int	chars
a chars with a leading zero is put into the 4th byte of the int write and the next chars is put into the 3rd byte of the int temp

15080281
folder	directory
i set up everything according to the instructions created the php and cache folder in my root directory loaded the library and php auto-loader.php file into the php folder and set the permissions to 755 on the cache folder

15080286
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
on ie9+ it looks normal like on google-chrome firefox and opera too

15080305
google-chrome	safari
safari doesn t seem to mind but google-chrome is throwing a this is probably not the site you are looking for

15080358
multiplying	multiplication
so cleverly skipping over the actual matrix multiplication i ll just tell you that multiplying our world transform and our model points just ends up with our model points again albeit in this fun new 4-dimensional vector representation which i won t touch here

15080358
width	height
the ratio of width to height for the lens you re looking through typically your screen resolution

15080360
put	get
you can rule out get and delete for obvious reasons and you would only want to use put for an idempotent operation

15080363
int	chars
hrs from your struct is just a chars type and vhrs is an int type

15080363
int	chars
however an int can hold a lot more data than a chars can this is going to give you a warning about overflow and you should listen to it depending on the implementation chars holds -128 to 127 where as int holds âˆ 2 147 483 648 to 2 147 483 647

15080363
int	chars
decide what data type you really wanted here and either make hrs an int or vhrs a chars then just do the assignment

15080404
qtoolbutton	qpushbutton
i m trying to design a simple button qpushbutton or qtoolbutton either can work that would essentially be a rectangle of the colour it represents

15080463
int	double
a 32 or 64 bit int value of 1 is a substantially different value than a float double value of 1.0

15080476
width	height
i stripped the width and height from so css could take over

15080498
getter	setter
use private fields and public getter and setter to allow the class to have more control over just what can be seen and what can be done

15080529
jtable	jlabel
the jpanel is the basic outline of a calendar i ve stripped it way down for simplicity s sake and it consists of jbutton components a jlabel and a jtable

15080593
google-chrome	safari
also if i try and view this on a mobile platform it does not work it will spit out a ton of garbage constantly in google-chrome mobile and in safari mobile it will only show one frame of the picture

15080601
int	chars
i have a bunch of different datatypes i want to pass to chars but when i do the usual format for passing int

15080615
portrait	landscape
and if you consider portrait devices separate from landscape devices you ll also find the inverse of those ratios 3 4 2 3 5 8 3 5 and 9 16

15080670
disk	ram
it would be hard to give you an estimate but i d say since you are going through duplicate relationships what can fit on ram vs disk etc

15080695
width	height
note that i have tried setting the background color of the webview to white via a short html string with the body set to a white background color as well as setting the height and width of the control to zero then resizing it to the correct size after the html it is supposed to display is passed to the webview control but the issue still occurs

15080723
int	chars
a chars is an int type which means it can be converted to and from int less than 256

15080725
division	modulo
the answer is to convert the date and hour to number of hours since midnight 1 1 2013 and then convert these to series using integer division and modulo

15080753
width	margin
margin auto inside the wrap will center the wrap so as long as it isn t width 100 it will center without the inline

15080755
width	height
another solution is to use regex to replace height and width in the src

15080769
rtsp	sdp	rtsp	rtmp	rtp	rtsp	rtp	rtmp	rtp	sdp
rtsp rtp sdp rtmp

15080796

15080890
implements	extends
i recommend you to extends listbox and implements takesvalue interface

15080909
integer	unsigned
this first generates an unsigned integer slightly larger than would fit into a signed one

15080909
integer	unsigned
the second line shows the result of modulo with a negative number such as irandomheight will sometime be applied to an unsigned integer larger than fits into a corresponding signed one

15080930

i m trying to get the width and height of a canvas in pixels

15080943
for-loop	arrays
in this case make an object variable before the first for-loop to hold all arrays

15080944
for-loop	arrays
in that case you will have to create one new arrays that holds all the cacatesarray s from first for-loop

15080944
for-loop	arrays
now in the code i have posted we are storing every instance of catesarray1 in another arrays and your values persist out side of the for-loop

15080949

next to for-loop indicates that loops contents are empty and hence the empty contents executed 10 times as in loops and for each looping the value of i gets incremented and the final value 10 gets printed as output

15081426
asterisk	freeswitch
if you want to run an independent and standalone service i would recommend freeswitch instead of asterisk

15081443
margin	height
anyway this simplified model is enough to describe why the height does not change a negative bottom margin will affect placement of the next box but will not make the box itself bigger

15081494
put	get	post	get	post	put
a full rest api like with java s jax-rs contains definitions for defining a path for a resource uses the full get post put requests

15081622
versioning	upgrade
i have also faced a similar problem and as per my knowledge i don t think that 1.6 vm can run any 1.7-generated bytecode but i think the reverse is possible as 1.7 is a upgrade versioning of 1.6vm

15081689
button	checkbox
however i will point out that it seems that the logic for deciding seems to lend itself more towards radio button than checkbox since each option is mutually exclusive

15081993
waitpid	posix
you can call waitpid from within the signal handler posix says it s safe to do so but you really shouldn t do anything else in the signal handler as it could lead to very subtle bugs say sigchld is raised during a call to malloc ---any code in the signal handler that results in a call to malloc will lead to very nasty problems

free	malloc
you might consider using boehm s conservative garbage collector then you ll call gc_malloc instead of malloc you won t need to call free or gc_free and you could use gc_size p to get the approximate size of the previously gc_malloc -ed memory zone starting at p but i don t recommend using gc_size

i m assuming this is because the mouseout triggers when the button is hidden and because the cursor is still in the same place when mouseout triggers it triggers mouseover

15090133

all you need is then a simple web.xml config entry or some config file such as an ini file in shiro

15090619

15091246

15091246
rtsp	sdp

i tried to put this but does not work i get error

15091574

15091574
getter	setter
whereas when you create an ivar you have to create a setter getter for it

15091604
min	max
i m guessing by your description that the attributes are just arrays you should be able to do the following to get the data for each attribute and then calculate the min and max like any numpy array

15091604
min	max
so if you wanted the min max of each attribute you can just do a for-loop over the attribute names or you could use

15091613
valgrind	callgrind
then i would like to activate valgrind callgrind only for the last 10 messages

getter	setter
if you override the default setter and getter and you dont provide the synthesize and as well you dont access the _ivar no variable is created for you by the compiler

15091771
getter	setter
a more userfull usage can be if you have a facade for other classes and you use this setter getter to set get those

this allows you to update the paypal review page with shipping options insurance and tax information during the checkout

15094154
versioning	upgrade
also in case you need to upgrade infinispan itself you might need to dump data out and restore or see rolling upgrade which at the moment requires hot rod clients and to use at least versioning 5.2

15094154
put	get
also infinispan query makes the query aspect quite powerfull but at a performance penalty on write operations to update the indexes it works faster if you can re-think your model to work with just put get operations

15094154
put	get
you could have a look at hibernate ogm to map structured entities in infinispan including relations using only put get operations

15094164
put	get
i am trying to minimize the interaction the end user has to make to get the file encoded i don t want them to have to put the image into the database and then also have to drop or file-chooser the image again in the web viewer

equals	gethashcode
to use an object as the key of a dictionary it s important for it to have implementations of equals and gethashcode that properly define what equality means for your object

15094520
put	get
once you have sensible implementations of those methods you can use the dictionaries indexer to put a car instance in and get the boolean value associated with that car

15094530
width	height
the javascript solution i came up here with uses real-time updating percentages to set the width and left attributes of the percentage based block as well as initializing the static height and bottom attributes

15094530

this function will add a div with an attribute with corresponding width height left and bottom values all in percentages

15094773
metaclass	subclassing
assuming other methods of dynamically adding properties to a runtime object expando subclassing groovyinterceptible mixins and other metaclass manipulations is not viable and i would really rather not have to manually code getters for every possible unit and si prefix combination

on h2 download site there is a database upgrade helper file for upgrading from 1.1 to a newer versioning

15094844
mouseover	mouseout
bind those two functions to the jquery hover method an alias for mouseover and mouseout

15094846

the reason that 16 777 217 is the first unrepresentable integer is that the ieee 754 32-bit binary format uses 24 bits for the significand fractions portion

15094858
tinyint	boolean
so either you only want to store a boolean value and therefore the checkbox in the view or you need to change your field to tinyint 2 to allow some kind of enum more than just two definite states

15094920
keydown	keyup
after digging around for answers and writing some custom test code i believe i have determined that this is because those events fire in chrome on keyup instead of keydown

google-chrome	firefox
it does exactly what i want in ie and firefox but not google-chrome

15094927

15095191
vsto	add-in
when creating a .net-based office add-in without vsto it s necessary or at least desirable to use a com shim that loads the add-in to provide process isolation so that the effect of any crash is limited to that add-in

15095260
subtraction	modulo	subtraction	addition	division	subtraction	division	addition	division	modulo	addition	modulo

google-chrome	firefox
the site i m currently working on isn t picking up my styling for devices under 480px in google-chrome but is working in firefox google-chrome is picking up the media queries for 800px and 1200px and i cannot for the life of me figure out why it isn t picking up the 480px media query

15095347
put	get
you can get files from the network but read contents only if they are from the same origin or allowed via cors and file protocol doesn t allow it indexeddb database and chrome s sandboxed filesystem which is not user s filesystem â it only contains files you ve put there yourself

15095354
google-chrome	firefox
in your comment you say â œit s working only in firefox and google-chrome not in ieâ which you should have added to the question

15095379
getter	setter
attr is getter and setter function

15095453
folder	directory
once you ve downloaded the zip just drop that dll into the plugins folder for notepad++ which is going to be under the install directory and re start notepad++

15095464
pull	push
i recommend setting up a project on github so you ll get use to the push pull issues involved with git

15095478
serializable	deserialization
when i make this change i can do proper serializable and deserialization

15095501

if you use fixed dimensions for both width and height you ll get a square but you lose the nice auto-sizing linearlayout does

15095512

that ll find the next element after the hovered that s got class popup and show hide it

15095527

15095574
multiplying	subtract
short answer subtract analyser.mindecibels from every value of the float32array to get positive numbers and multiplying with analyser.maxdecibels - analyser.mindecibels to get a similar representation as with getbytefrequencydata just with more resolution

15095590
oncreate	recreate
you will probably have to save some information about your image in your onsaveinstancestate callback and then restore it in your oncreate callback assuming that your activity is indeed being destroyed and recreate but that does seem to be the case

15095593
width	height
one thing to remember is that if your picture s width height is already changed from its original size you will get that new size from width and height functions

15095630
width	height
the two colored views are not stored in the nib as having a size width height or position top left corner instead they are stored with constraints representing their layout

15095630
width	height
so in that case the constraint is switched to depend on the absolute height or width of the view

15095630
move	drag
i believe that s a bug in interface builder in xcode 4.6 and since layout contraints are a relatively new part of cococatouch i m not surprised that the interface builder support for auto-creating constraints as you drag and move items around is buggy

15095667
fadein	fadeout
javascript is executing the loop twice instantly so all the fadeout fadein functions execute after 2000 2400 milliseconds respectively rather than being executed after a timeout as expected

15095667
fadein	fadeout
i also utilise the callback second parameter of the jquery .fadeout function so that the fadein is started after the fadeout has finished

15095718
post	get
however on drop down change i don t know how to post back and get those cities

15095746
pdu	smpp
i realized after some research that it not possible to embbed custom information within smpp pdu

15095749
for-loop	loops
now since you have a return statement in your if you know that if you reach the end of loops without returning that none of the characters in word was a vowel so you can just return the word unchanged outside of the for-loop

15095778
next	except
step logo is a thumbnail and the rv logo next to it is the same except it is being hovered on at this point view project and a blue see-through background appear

15095805

implement design logic for your menu architecture in the same view with hide show methods which will be react to respective delegates

15095805
hide	show
and this singleton menuview instance will request for show hide as per requirement from the custom toolbar button

15095805
hide	show
on request of show hide apply respective animations with expected logic

15095805
hide	show
while requesting hide menuview will be removed from the uiwindow and next time when it requires to show add it again on uiwindow

15095816
google-chrome	firefox
it s also consistent between google-chrome and firefox so i don t suspect the browser

15095819
put	get
so i msut kill the new process the problem is how to get the pid of the process and how to put it in background in order to kill it

15095840
int	boolean
if you really want to use a dropdown for the renderer you can do it by implementing a treecellrenderer yourself that returns a unique jcombobox instance when public component gettreecellrenderercomponent jtree tree object value boolean selected boolean expanded boolean leaf int row boolean hasfocus is called

15095865
put	get
responsinator just put your live url there and get your website s responsiveness on different devices view-ports

15095869
nexus	artifactory
you should really run a local repository proxy such as nexus or artifactory

15095883
put	get
when i create a fruit_bowl an apple seperately and then attempt to put the apple in the bowl i get an error.

15095923

15095947
put	get
i want to get the value of the word like if user enter the sentence and it contain word able than it retrieve the values against it like 9 6 0 or 0 6 9 but now as a sample i just want that if i focus on only able#1 word in this txt file how can i retrieve values through it as i am just trying it in a way to split it and than just put queue on it

15095962
rolify	cancan
i want to restrict access for each partenaire with cancan rolify

15095965
width	height
you may convert the anchor tag to a div with specific width and height and on hover you can change the background image

15095966
superclass	subclassing
type safety the return type subfoo for getfoo from the type subclassing needs unchecked conversion to conform to t from the type superclass

15095970
int	double
however if you want to explicitly define the types being used like in my example with string int and double then yes you need to use generics in this case

15095988
superclass	subclassing
the superclass declaration you ve written allows the caller -- not the superclass subclassing -- to choose which subtype of foo it wants so your implementation in subclassing doesn t implement it properly

15095998
hide	show
but on nexus 10 system bar won t show after just hide

15096012
width	margin
i tried both margin and padding to create this 40px left spacing but in both the cases the actual div stretches out of the right side due to width 100

15096028
put	get	post	get	post	put
in the beging i thought that was permission on manifest but all the other methods post put get are working fine

15096035
post	get
for instance if you have a basic auth protected webservice you won t be able to request it from flash with get request because only post request can have custom headers

15096052
versioning	upgrade
see for example kevin blasko s answer at the good news is that the versioning that ships with vs 2012 allows them out-of-the-box so you won t even need to touch the dictionary when you eventually upgrade

15096080
int	double
it attempts to include comparable in e because both int and double are also comparable

15096101
integer	unsigned
therefore hardware developers generally provide a single integer aka a register most often unsigned 32-bit and state that for example bit #0 enables or disables data transmission bit #1 enables or disables data filtering bit #3 does some other magic and so one and so force

15096101
int	boolean
now imagine how convenient that is for software developers â instead of working with simple int or boolean programmers have to deal with bits that are generally not addressable by the cpu

15096123
int	double	implements	extends
notice that double and int not only extends number but also implements comparable

15096183
pull	push
or push new entry and pull the old

15096230
folder	dir	folder	directory
i d like to create the directory dir a b in test folder in one go with the following command

15096242
ssd	sata
i recently cloned a build machine renamed the machine on the domain and moved the machine from a sata drive to a ssd drive

15096242
vb.net	vb6
the application is a combination of visual studio 2010 c# and vb.net code and vb6 code

15096253
portrait	landscape
i made 6 other global variables cgrects each to hold the position of the different items in portrait and landscape imageoneportrait imageonelandscape etc

15096253
portrait	landscape
however i replaced the uideviceorientation with uiinterfaceorientation because the uideviceorientation was not sending the landscape portrait orientations i was looking for but faceup and facedown messages

15096259
width	margin
the problem with actually specifying width 100 as you have found out is that the horizonal padding and margin is added on top of the width calculation - if you leave the width as not specified the browser automatically works out the width required to fill the space which may not be 100 of it s parent

15096262
hex	binary
and then the mask 3f hex is 00111111 binary applied

15096283
width	height
by default browser looks on your code and check whether there is any blank element that does t have any child element or itself with a width and height defined

15096283
width	height
you have defined its width that is good but unfortunately it didn t get any height of this container

15096289
next	except
so basically it means the ui could just stay the same - except the next time submit is clicked the form is put instead of posted

15096298
put	get
i have tried to put labels next to it but that doesn t seem to work i can t get them aligned with the ticks - signs

15096337

debian	linux
2013-02-26 15 13 57 debian gnu linux comes with absolutely no warranty to the extent

15096353
icomparable	compareto
implementing icomparable means that it defines the compareto method not that the operator is defined

15096361
icomparable	compareto
since icomparable provides only compareto not

15096395
google-chrome	firefox
this bug occurs in google-chrome and ie9 but not in firefox

15096398
cpython	pypy

i should note that the reason i can t use top 5em is because the header will not have a fixed height - an image for a logo will be used inside of the text and that would be set to max-width 100 so that it shrinks to right width for an iphone and doesn t expand too much on say an ipad

15097861

15098266
google-chrome	firefox
just tested using google-chrome 24 on spoon.net and it renders the same as firefox

15098303
width	height
you could sort of deal with this in code by monitoring whenever the size changes and making sure that the width is always some percentage of the height

15098303
width	height
you can put anything inside of it with a specific width and height and as the available space for the viewbox increases or decreases it automatically scales everything inside of it

15098303
width	height
so start with a grid and give it a specified width and height then divide the rows and columns to make it look like your image above

15098303
width	height
start at whatever width and height you want but i suggest 1366 x 768 because that s the lowest recommended resolution for windows 8

15098307
width	height
i actually only recently discovered this myself but i think it does pretty much exactly what you are after - allows you to decode a region from a bitmap inputstream without loading the entire bitmap into memory you can also get the width height

google-chrome	firefox
with that in mind if i were in your position i would investigate writing either a browser extension google-chrome firefox or perhaps a bookmarklet all of which preserve the site s functionality while at the same time injecting javascript into the page that gets around the permissions issues that you are experiencing

15098703
google-chrome	firefox
if you d like the ability to have nice interfaces that act like part of the browser and don t require the user to activate the bookmarklet whenever it s appropriate then look into an extension especially if your target audience is google-chrome firefox users

15098783
opera	firefox
but to let it work in firefox and opera you should also set

15098798
post	put
to send post data you have to put it in the send method not the url they have to be in pairs and you should also encode them with encodeuricomponent also you have to set the content type to application x-www-form-urlencoded

15098916
ant	maven
the problem is that it s really hard to switch ant projects over to maven in a seamless manner..

15098916
ant	maven
maven has a standardized set of life-cycle actions whereas ant build scripts are free-form

15098940

dumbest way i would do it would be to have a image file and a js function linked to it that basically hide the image on click and show a div block containing the video

15099373

mouseout	mouseenter
the problem is that some of the li text contains other markup for example and when the mouseenter the tag it triggers a mouseout event and collapses the li

15099559
width	height
the window knows a minimum height and width but initially the layout doesn t know that

15099651

it uses css background-position and css background-size to achive the aim

15099666

i shall be doing other things inside this for-loop so i cannot change that to a foreach loops

g++	gcc
i am have programming experience in c for microcontrollers just and now i have not really idea about the compilation process of gcc and g++

equals	gethashcode
while it would be helpful for array to have itemsequal methods which would test whether all items of the arrays or certain ranges of items matched and it would be helpful to have an immutablearray type with a equals gethashcode members that would regard as equals two immutable arrays with the same content it is entirely right and proper that distinct mutable arrays compare unequal to each other regardless of content

15100494
google-chrome	firefox
there seems to be a difference with google-chrome and firefox

min	max
i m trying to find the number of weeks between two dates in excel vba with some min max functionality in between was getting type mismatch error run-time error 13 for the following line

15101756
put	get
so what i ended up doing to get my desired result is put all the above code in dispatch_async dispatch_get_global_queue dispatch_queue_priority_default 0 and sandwich it with the changes i want to make on the main thread like so..

15101762

this is further complicated on mac os x systems by the horrible mess of different postgresql packages - apple s ancient version of postgresql built in to the os postgres.app homebrew macports the enterprisedb installer etc etc

15101982
put	get
a very important point as hinted by freedom_ben in his own answer this code works because both get and put methods are made synchronised meaning that they will block all other threads trying to access the object through synchronized calls during their execution making these calls atomic with regard to each other

15101994
put	get
for example in the put method we are skipping the wait if valueset is true because that means that get has not yet run since the last time we updated the value of this.n

15102034
listview	gridview
i m trying to make two side by side listview act like a gridview to an extent

15102050
for-loop	loops
in fact your while loops can be replaced by a for-loop - it is easier to read

15102052
range	max	range	min	min	max
an alternative is possible in the last example since the list contains every integer between its min and max value i could loop through range min mylist max mylist or through set mylist

15102052
min	max
also would finding the min and max be slower than just creating the set

15102097
auto-generate	edmx
domain this project uses auto-generate dbcontext classes created using a edmx model

15102160
folder	dir
if your test folder is named tests and your dir in your phpunit target is basedir source you should only need to provide the relative path which would be test

ant	maven
if you use eclipse you can build your classes and run your program in eclipse without using ant or maven

in fact eclipse is usually completely ignorant of your ant build.xml or your maven pom.xml file

15102722
jar	war
if you have a continuous integration system or someone downloads your project and simply wants to build your jar or war file there s no way they can do it

15102722

ember.js	backbone.js
what you should be doing in backbone.js or ember.js is display logic

inherited	properties
90 if not all of the properties are inherited from a this general expcetion anyways

15117882
width	height
it seems that even though the iteration burndown chart accepts width and height parameters they are not reliable in any sense and often not honored at all

15117886
apache	nginx
the right thing to in a production environment is to use a web server apache nginx etc... to serve static files because web servers are optimized to do that

15117927
width	height
the image should fill the whole width of the widget that s the easy part and should fill 30 of the widget s height while respecting a maximum height of 80dip that s what i can t figure out

15117927
width	height
in the following layout the image scales properly to the width but not to the height

15117945
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the logo font renders correctly in google-chrome and safari but not in firefox

15117983
for-loop	arrays
i thought about going through the arrays and getting the entire length of strings using a for-loop

15118018
subtract	add
as a note random n seems to return an integer between 0 and - n 1 inclusive so you don t need to add or subtract things yourself to get a random element out of a list

15118024
integer	fractions
as the integer part increases in magnitude there is less precision left in the fractions part and you start to see artifacts

15118034
implements	extends
however you can create a global class that extends globalsettings and implements the catch all in the onrouterequest method

15118042
button	checkbox
as far as i understand your question you re saying as a user i would want to click some button for latin america and then a series of checkbox would become checked so portuguesecb spanishcb etccb.

15118076
min	max
for completeness reasons if your xpath engine supports xpath 2.0 or better just use max x respecting min x which will probably be faster and more readable

15118090
interpolation	splines
use the splines function in matlab to interpolation your data then integrate this data

15118102
width	height
thus it seems that when using javascript screen properties firefox retrieves the device width height whereas the native android browser gets the converted sizes

15118145
post	get
the problem is similar to this post documents deleted using google docs api still visible in google drive can t really get it working with the solutions suggested

15118157
free	malloc
since you are using c++ you should forget all about malloc and free

15118198
equals	gethashcode
thus it needs two arguments for equals compare two other objects and one argument for gethashcode get hash code of other object

15118211
iequalitycomparer	iequatable
it s the difference between iequalitycomparer and iequatable

15118211

i m trying to get the animation to work in this simple jquery hide show program

15118610
google-chrome	firefox
this works well in google-chrome but the alignment is way off in firefox

15118618
google-chrome	firefox
this doesnt apply to ie but firefox and google-chrome you can do this

15118634
serializable	deserialization
here you would need to create new formatter instances having similar settings as your normal application has so that they reflect the exact serializable deserialization semantics that your application would normally react to when actual requests are made and then try to hide the properties which you want to

15118653
getter	setter
in your case the way to go would be to use an abstract superclass for myclass to hold a private declaration for that field and then use a couple of getter and setter methods to let myclass work with it

15118681
jar	war
i use maven for both one configured as a jar project and the other as a war project

15118905
submit	submission
on the first run there is no problem it shows the form to submit but after the submission of the form it will show a problem

15118943
put	get	post	get	post	put
this would mean using ajax within a web page to talk to my web server using get post put and delete requests and the server responding with appropriate http status codes and non-html data probably json

15118950
firefox	safari
i use restler 3 with apiexplorer on safari firefox

15118983
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
my theory is that you have placed animation code in viewwillappear rather than viewdidappear

15119010
put	get
if i put a formula in the column h cells like then refresh the data connection the column h cell references can get messed up

15119023
getter	setter	tostring	getter
the only way to get a parentheses-less function call in javascript is to define a setter getter property or to override one of the special methods tostring or valueof

15119031
pop-up	dialog
when this is received i pop-up a dialog with a single edit box and ok button

15119035
free	malloc
also feel free to keep using malloc in c++ it is there for a good reason

15119035
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
converting all the c code to c++ by rewriting every single malloc to new is very prone to introduce lots of errors in your code unless you have the time to keep reading the code you are merging to find every single instance of malloc free calloc etc.

15119035
free	malloc
just don t mix malloc with delete or new with free or things break

15119044
ssl	https
most tutorials will agree that by having a mixed mode site both http and https you re defeating the purpose of ssl having certain paths require ssl then switching back to a non ssl connection

15119044
ssl	https
now if you try to login you ll get redirected so that you talk over ssl if you re not already as noted by the https moniker

15119044
ssl	https
even if you try to manually switch to not using ssl while you are logged in by removing the s from the protocol part of the url it ll still send you back to using https

15119044
ssl	https
just make sure your url s used to reference those external images are defined using the https moniker so that it uses ssl

15119044
ssl	https
update the reason you re getting two hits in the log like that is because you re login link is being requested over http the require https attribute hits first realizes you re not using ssl and redirects you back to itself with the https protocol

15119046
rss	feed
i ve used it with great success when parsing my rss as well as atom feed

opera	google-chrome
i tested in opera and google-chrome and is not valid

15119200
bionic	glibc
you ve built the binaries using glibc while android uses the bionic c library

15119224
free	malloc
also if this was an object like a std string then you will not call the constructor when you use malloc this merely reserves the memory for use with the pointer str so best always use new with c++ if you can also when you reclaim memory always use the appropriate way if you new then you delete and if you malloc you free

15119243
std	ostream
std ostream operator...

15119243
std	ostream
std ostream operator std etc

15119244
epplus	excellibrary
i tried using both epplus and excellibrary .net libraries however i m having trouble building the project

15119295
int	chars
since the pointer is to a chars the int will be truncated and the higher bytes will be lost as it is converted to the type of the lvalue

15119342
std	ostream
it s ostream that exists in the std namespace don t do that doesn t even make sense

15119344
width	height
you can also specify the sidebar width or height as a percent of the parent width or height

15119358
put	get
if the whole map is synchronized for get put operations adding threads won t improve throughput because the bottleneck will be the synchronized blocks

15119360
sorting	grouping
you can use this feature to get better performance by avoiding unnecessary column sorting and grouping

15119385
post	get
one which gets called when the httprequest is of get type and the other when the request is of post type

15119388
portrait	landscape
i thought it was being caused because the s3â s camera seems to only open in landscape despite my whole application being locked to portrait in every way google could tell me is possible and the orientation change was causing a refresh on the activity causing the reference to progressdialog to be lost

15119440
mouseleave	mouseenter
my suggestion is to simply replace with mouseenter mouseleave -

15119440
children	parent	mouseover	mouseleave
although this prevented multiple instances of my animation from being called i eventually went with mouseover mouseleave as i needed to determine when children of the parent were being hovered over

15119444
pexpect	subprocess
however if you need to wait for a prompt or interact with the subprocess in a more complicated way then use pexpect

15119456
google-chrome	firefox
edit this works in google-chrome firefox and ie9 i need it to work on ie7

when the user clicks on that button a second form pops up which has a list of checkbox that is dynamically filled based upon a db query of all the columns that are available for the user to have in their output report

15119652
udp	tcp
if you choose to use tcp and udp sockets which will be lower level than xmpp but also give you much more control over the protocol use this framework as a starting point

15119737
google-chrome	firefox
nothing plays in either google-chrome or firefox with the jw player though the player does display

15119740

ubuntu switched from ffmpeg to libav because the debian ubuntu ffmpeg package maintainer is a libav developer

15119832
post	get
for some reason everytime i use post as the ajax type i don t get a response but when i use get i do get a response

eigen	ublas	boost	eigen
i found several host-based matrix libraries boost numeric ublas eigen blitz but they do not have fixed-size matrices i could use with cuda on my kernels

15119897
try-catch	exception-handling
additionally not even the try-catch around the whole call catches the exception-handling it just slips through everything.

15119920
client-side	server-side
the server-side will not work but the client-side validation does work by using this jquery and adding the matching class name to the html for the checkboxes

15119985
hide	show
i am trying to get this function to show hide the text box element

15120040
ssl	https
ssl is enabled and is also being used via https for calls

15120075
width	height
they call a function named setdesignresolutionsize it asks for width height and a policy

15120075
width	height
however i m using cocos2d-x 2.0.1 i believe and this function only wants height and width no policy

15120157
integer	unsigned
so it returns an unsigned integer

15120157
integer	unsigned
when comparing its - unsigned - result with another integer the unsignedness wins the other value -5 is promoted to the unsigned type u_int32_t in this case it rolls over since unsigned integer underflow is designed to work like this in c - you ll get 2 32 - 5 and so an erroneous i

15120195
int	boolean
in python boolean are a subclass of int and when summed act as 1 and 0 for true and false respectively

15120208

15120540
portrait	landscape
the cgrects above used to move between landscape and portrait have origins defined but no size which was causing my views to vanish when set to them

15120540
portrait	landscape
fifth and finally make sure to do the size adjustment to both the landscape and portrait global variables when the slider appears disappears because if the device is flipped back with the slider there then by the code above the slider will obscure part of the webview

15120540
portrait	landscape
i still welcome any comments about how people handle landscape and portrait layouts

15120565
integer	unsigned
i have read the following vulnerability report in grep and the associated commit in which all the integer and unsigned integer are replaced by size_t

15120580
fast-forward	merge
he does a fast-forward merge and pushes his changes back to origin master as c2

15120581
folder	directory
for example you ll probably want to get the user s top-level folder in the skydrive directory

15120584
boost	stl
my initial thought is to do something with stl and boost similar to the following

15120600
int	chars
i also tried not casting the nativekeycode as a chars instead using int for the codepoint and it still gives an error

15120619
int	chars
i don t know what the deal with all the chars s is but i d suggest using int or floats for volume and indexes

15120624
boost	eigen
all the other dependencies are header-only eigen boost except one - libboost-thread

15120631
swt	swing
the fonts will look different regardless of the changes you make as eclipse is based upon swt and netbeans on swing

15120632
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer never overflows

15120632
integer	unsigned
so no replacing unsigned integer won t with size_t won t avoid any overflows because there weren t any overflows to avoid in the first place with unsigned int

15120632
integer	unsigned
for example when the standard states an example of undeï ned behavior is the behavior on integer overï ow. it isn t suggesting that unsigned integers cause undefined behavior when the value can t fit inside the data type

15120632
integer	unsigned
because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is

15120642
udp	tcp
i am to new networking this is chat server which means than suppose there are 10 clients all are connected to the server when one of the client send a message the server should send the message to all the clients except the client which is sending i done this using poll program written in tcp what are the changes that are to made in order to convert into udp and how to poll in udp as there are no nsfds i.e mean accept call

15120834
ssl	https
https is http on top of ssl tls

15120834

google-chrome	firefox
ie 7 8 firefox google-chrome all render properly

15120888
width	height
i m a bit baffled at why there is no aspect ratio option keeping height and width constrained to each other which would work much better for us

15120899
inherited	properties
it s like the fluent api for ef if you ve ever used that but covers the validation facets that fluent api doesn t without having to resort to data annotations which as you mention makes it impossible to compose classes if the validation for a particular properties will be different somewhere in the inherited chain

15120903
selecteditem	selectedindex
if you work with mvvm you can memorize your selecteditem or selectedindex and restore it after the reload is done by binding

15120903
equals	gethashcode
make sure you override equals and gethashcode in the underlying objects if you use it

15120910
folder	directory
since the directory of the file i cam calling is closer to the root than the current php script i just want to say c folder script.php

the above section works fine the element is show or hide without problems

15120996
hash	salt
i have a simple password encrypter that gives me a hash salt password to store in my database when a user registers

15120998
aggregate-functions	sum
you will just need to use the sum aggregate-functions and group by each order id

15121009
int	chars
if you call int 0x10 and haven t set up the idt to handle that as a call into uefi to write a chars to the screen then you re just using undefined behaviour

15121060
hash	salt
when the account is created you would have a password hash column which would be populated by generatehashwithsalt password salt

15121060
hash	salt
the salt would then be stored alongside the password hash

15121148
post	get
so you ll be wanting to get a post array like this

jar	war
on the other end if i generate the whole war everything works fine but because of the size of it i d rather like to be able to provide the patch as a jar file

15121257
post	get
what you mention here is not truly a glitch because csrf is working as intended to prevent cross site forgery but the problem is something else which most fix with a post redirect get prg pattern this way hitting back would either redirect or have an invalid csrf and allows you to flush the data from the session or post if you are not using the flash data

15121303
ready	each
having a buffer allows the scheduler to deposit jobs in the queue and still remain responsive to user input or network traffic or whatever because it does not have to sleep until the worker is ready each time it schedules a task

15121365
getter	setter
the galaxy class will contain member container variables which contain pointers to solar systems planets and moons in addition to the appropriate member getter and setter functions for those container variables

15121365
getter	setter
the solar system would have a similarly designed member container variables containing pointers to the contained planets and moons with the getter and setter and so forth with the planets as well

15121365
getter	setter
make a template base class primitivegalaxy primitivesolarsystem primitiveplanet primitivemoon which contain all of the container variables and relevant getter and setter from which all further classes inherit

15121365
getter	setter
this would include container variables to the relevant pointers as well as their getter and setter

15124688
ssl	https
from what you write the connection should be secure https ssl

15124730

there is an open bug report to enhance sort member functionality in eclise sort members doesn t provide a means to group getter setter pairs

15124982
hex	binary
ive seen on here before ways to convert hex to binary but my question is that is it possible to convert hex values inside of a byte array into binary values and put it into a big string

15124982
put	get	hex	binary
like get the binary values for each hex number then put it all into on huge byte array

15125000

for whatever reason i have found that the largest i can get most all of the standard reports is height 599 and width 999

15125062

my advice is - refactor the code base to use non-clashing naming convention instead of generic function names like add and subtract and the rest

15125108

i just re-create the opengl render buffer to match the new width and height once the rotation completes

15125360
postgresql	mysql
i know that there are several options mysql nosql postgresql etc. but i have no prior experience with databases

15125626
quicksort	heapsort
unstable sorts like heapsort and quicksort for example do not have this property inherently but they are used because they tend to be faster and easier to code than stable sorts

post	put
when i first time hit the service the service gets called with the type post but the second time it sends the put instead of post

15125672

15125869
post	get
you re confusing post and get

15125883
getter	setter
it acts much like property does in python in that you can specify a getter setter and doc but no deleter is specified in this context

15125884
post	get
in that case pg is a get variable not post

15125926
post	put
backbone does post because it doesn t know the specific url to put the thing to

15125926
post	put
this is all in accordance with how restful urls are supposed to work and the intent and meaning behind non-idempotent post requests versus idempotent put requests

15129154
elf	dwarf
alternatively you could get the debugging information in dwarf format and parse it perhaps using libdwarf from the elf tool chain

15129154
g++	gcc
you could also use the libbacktrace from inside a recent gcc which is designed to solve your problem it is interpreting the dwarf format of the current executable which you would compile with g++ -o -g

15129561
stderr	fflush	stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush
if you don t want to force line-buffered or unbuffered mode then you must use fflush to get reliable interleaving of output to stdout and stderr

children	parent
the way i thought about the addchildren method is that i would pass the raw json object coming from the server into the constructor of the node object and then in case it has any children which essentially have the same properties as the parent addchildren will be called which will in turn create a new node for each element

screens	hdpi
with that you can pretty much use the screens guidelines to figure out if your device is pulling from the respective specialized resource folders hdpi xhdpi large xlarge etc.

15133770
mdpi	hdpi	screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi
320dp a typical phone screens 240x320 ldpi 320x480 mdpi 480x800 hdpi etc

15133770
tablet	mdpi
480dp a tweener tablet like the streak 480x800 mdpi

15133770
tablet	mdpi
600dp a 7â tablet 600x1024 mdpi

15133770
tablet	mdpi
720dp a 10â tablet 720x1280 mdpi 800x1280 mdpi etc

15133776
width	height
this will return the absolute value of the width and the height in pixels so 1280x720 for the galaxy siii the galaxy nexus etc

15133776
mdpi	hdpi	screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi
you get the density of the screens using metrics again in the form of a scale factor for the device which is based on the android design resources for mdpi hdpi etc

15133776
width	height
from this result we can calculate the amount of density independent pixels there are for a certain height or width

15133776
mdpi	hdpi	screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi
320dp a typical phone screens 240x320 ldpi 320x480 mdpi 480x800 hdpi etc

15133776
tablet	mdpi
480dp a tweener tablet like the streak 480x800 mdpi

15133776
tablet	mdpi
600dp a 7â tablet 600x1024 mdpi

15133776
tablet	mdpi
720dp a 10â tablet 720x1280 mdpi 800x1280 mdpi etc

15133776
tablet	hdpi	screens	hdpi	screens	tablet
however this doesn t always give you an exact match especially when working with obscure tablet that might be misrepresenting their density as hdpi when it isn t or that might only be 800 x 480 pixels yet still be on a 7 screens

15133776
width	height
this will return the height and width of the device in inches

15133776
width	height
this again isn t always that helpful for determining what type of device it is as the advertised size of a device is the diagonal all we have is the height and the width

15133776
width	height
however we also know that given the height of a triangle and the width we can use the pythagorean theorem to work out the length of the hypotenuse in this case the size of the screen diagonal

google-chrome	safari
- google-chrome and safari seem to have this issue

15135431

15135497
int	chars
why is it that when i define int i am getting 4 chars in the server side and 1 when i use chars

15135543
hide	show
it would be better if you created the element say and initially made it display none then with jquery you can simply use show and hide like so

15135616
width	height
how can i get those album s width and height each 7 image

15135617
vsto	add-in
the thing to understand is a vsto add-in installer isn t a 64bit msi it s a 32bit msi that deploys an anycpu dll with registry entries for either 32bit or 64bit office

15135641
int	chars
i am aware that the main function can take two arguments int argc and chars agrv

15135648

the easiest way for customizable checkbox could be using jquery ui button

15135670
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox i could not find any such imprints

15135701
mouseover	mouseleave
i have used jquery ui tabs to dynamically add and remove tabs in my website the content of the tab contains two buttons which upon mouseover dissappear and become visible on mouseleave of the relevant link at the bottom

15135708
int	double
you don t need to cast it will be casted automatically in your operation gives you a double value just cast once in int which will be final value

15135763
int	chars
then i want to convert this to an int number from chars in order to pass it further to my functions which will read the value stored at that location

15135763
int	chars
so what i need is something like convert chars into an int

15135804
google-chrome	firefox
however now the problem i have is that with google-chrome the output is as i wish for it to be writing with the cursor at the back however when i write from a firefox browser the space button is ignored when i press space the cursor goes back

15135819
mouseleave	mouseenter
that s because mouseenter and mouseleave only work for items that exist in the dom on page load

15135837
hide	show
there are .show and hide methods and a .visible property that allows to show or hide a qsystemtrayicon

15135842

15136051
post	put
cross domain issue would come when you re trying to post put some content in your blob storage

15136056
int	double
however since there is an implicit conversion in scala from int to double i can also do the following

concave	convex
you re looking for the terms concave like a c vs convex like an o contours

15136100
hex	binary
however completing the post while the address has been recorded in a hex format and transferred as a string it actually is an address that is interpreted finally in binary format

15136161
puts	gets
i have an adapter that gets a list of items from an api and then puts it in a listview

15136178
getter	setter
the way you have it you are declaring an instance attribute and then you are saying you want to automatically generate getter and setter

15136189
int	double
and for the division you need to cast left to double first if not you will be doing an int divide

15136215
rdf	owl
i need to convert my rdf graph document into owl 1 or 2 recognized by protege 3.x

15136215
rdf	owl
there is a w3c recommendation for mapping owl 2 web ontology language mapping to rdf graphs which says that to declare object properties from rdf graphs one should add the rdf type owl objectproperty element

15136215
rdf	owl
i have found problems for expressing owl object properties with rdf graph formalisms in the following code

15136252

sorting	filtering
sorting filtering ...

15136274
width	height
also in width and height of an image you usually do not use units

15136277
jar	war
use the sling launchpad war file instead of the jar file

15136320
superclass	subclassing
and you want a subclassing that has another table in its view plus the table that the superclass owns

15136323
width	height
i think the best solution would be to use setonitemclicklistener and increase the size at runtime with setlayoutparams new layoutparams width height

15136371
jboss	glassfish
if you re on servlet 3.0 tomcat 7 glassfish 3 jboss 6 etc then your best bet is to use programmatic login with httpservletrequest#login instead of a jaas form

15136390
udp	tcp
the examples at the url i linked show udp and tcp while tcp examples should work for you

15136393
int	double
of double int ... and explicit where you create your own converters

15136409
textview	imageview
the problem is that i can t get pointers to the views inside the layout imageview textview so that i can change then at runtime

15136434
accessor	properties
a properties is really just a promise that the class provides certain accessor methods

15136434
accessor	properties
also because synthesized accessor are by far the most common and because the compiler will use any accessor that you provide even if a properties is marked synthesize that became the default so that you no longer need the compiler directive

15136438
folder	directory
i m trying to write a script that will track when something is copied to directory a and then copy that to a folder we have that is used to move the files to a private network

15136449
portrait	landscape
i have array of images which i need to display on the landscape and portrait mode

15136449
portrait	landscape
what i have done is that i have created a array of images and displaying on the scrollview to see one at a time ..but problem is that when i move to landscape to portrait or vice versa images get split ...view comes with the half previous image and half next

15136492
x86	64bit
most likely a mixture of anycpu and x86 assemblies that would work fine on a 32bit clr not so on 64bit clr as anycpu is loaded as 64bit which breaks dependencies on x86 assemblies

15136507
folder	directory
i am obliged to change the directory name each time i have multiple folder for data merging and sometimes over 30 directory

15136624

what i d like to do is before my for-loop and before processing files in any way to check if more than 3 files were dragged and if so just slice the arrays to last 3 elements

15136657
hide	show
i want the list1 element to be show and the list2 to be hide if type is 1 and vice versa in case type is 2

15136657

i want them to be hide and show dynamically without reloading the page or any interaction with the server

15136659

it can be used in firefox 3.5+ safari 4+ google-chrome 3+ internet explorer 8+ and anything else using one of the same engines

15136669
uibutton	uiappearance
that will allow you to use any uibutton api on the uiappearance proxy

15136721
put	get
so i guess what i am trying to say is that regardless of how you get your names you are going to have to organize them in some type of array to put them into the spinner if you want to keep it simple of course

15136721
put	get
now once you get the names put into your array and you can click the spinner to show them all you now want to trigger an event that pulls the data you would like to show beneath it

15136721
hide	show
once you have all of the information you can dynamically create layouts and add them to your current view or you can just have a single layout that you change occasionally and to show and hide

15136721
hide	show
this seems to be a little more difficult for new android developers though so don t feel bad if you have sketchy if else statements that just show and hide xml layouts

15136725
translation	globalization
for the purpose of globalization i need to translation buttons in jquery dialog but when i try to pass variable i don t get value of variable just name of it

15136767
post	get
but when i try to get to post url it look like the following

15136780
google-chrome	firefox
now this works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome

15136803
int	double
in your example the fact that you can do 2.double has nothing to do with the fact that there is an implicit conversion from double to int in predef

15136803
int	double
i thought i understood this intuitively 2 can be interpreted as the int value 2 or as the double value 2.0 in the first place so my intuition was that 2 is somehow already a double in this context

15136818
google-chrome	firefox
however i am finding firefox google-chrome and ie do not have the chance to free up memory

15136823
google-chrome	safari
the sound playing should be handled by javascript and you can do that with html5-compliant browsers that support mp3 google-chrome safari ie9 with the following

15136823
mp3	ogg
if you want to support older browsers then use something like jquery or mootools for the dom stuff and if you want to support older browsers with your sound use soundmanager2 or use multiple audio sources for better support ogg and mp3 sources

15136848
clang	llvm
by grepping for this method call in the source of llvm clang you can find many examples for using it

15136885
getter	setter
this sets up a getter and a setter for a classification attribute

15136913
put	get
- i don t know where did you get the proxy information that you provided but if it s right you should put as you proxy

15136931

getter and setter methods are generally frowned upon

15136973
uicollectionview	nsindexpath
the scrolling is lagging when a new row of cells needs to be shown and collectionview uicollectionview collectionview cellforitematindexpath nsindexpath indexpath is called for each

15136987
gitolite	gitosis
the answer is you alone can determine that path because gitosis like gitolite only manage bare repos which as their name suggests bare are without working tree

15136987
gitolite	gitosis
use gitolite instead of gitosis obsolete and no longer maintained

15136990
implements	extends
i really think the only class you should extends is arrayiterator because it already implements

15137035
put	get
i know that for that i also have to put a variable into the where command instead of -- id get automatically

15137037
put	get	for-loop	arrays
in other words you create a new arrays each time you call permute but everything you get in for-loop is lost as you are not passing it to next permute calls --- eventually you return an empty arrays in which you didn t put anything

15137064
maven	pom.xml
i have configured my eclipse with maven and testng pf my pom.xml below

15137153
google-chrome	firefox
the in google-chrome everything works fine but if u make the window smaller width in firefox you ll see that the social-icons dont stick to one row as they do in google-chrome in the yellowish socialbar

15137153
google-chrome	firefox
also the socialicons in the footer gets to a new row in firefox but not in google-chrome

15137159

15137164
submit	submission
if your computer has an installation of grid engine you can probably write a job submission script to submit your work as an array job and let grid engine take care of parcelling the work out to the individual machines tasks

15137268
hide	show
what i am after at is similar to hide all li elements and show the first 2 and toggle them by button - but i need the more less links to show hide all the time slots for each doctor ie the more less links should show hide all the times over the 7 columns for each doctor with one click

15137270
serializable	deserialization
is hand-crafting the serializable deserialization code the only way

15137289

15137690
fflush	gets
i believe that it gets called during a commit or a fflush

15137697
width	height
the orientation is depending on the relationship between width and height

15137697

if height has a higher value than width the browser will be in orientation portrait

15137697
width	height
height width portrait

15137697
width	height
height width landscape

15137708
int	double
required to set proper value for getcolumnclass to int long or double

15137728
put	get
then to get the string with the highest value you simply put all your strings in a list and use collections.sort providing the comparator

15137741
filtering	grouping
depending on how you filtering and what your grouping level is add modify the partition by

15137754
converter	multibinding
hard to say without seeing the code for the converter but i would be inclined to get rid of the unnecessary multibinding and simplify to

15137765
jobs	cron
however if you prefer to do less coding and setting up your system to perform cron jobs and etc then you could just sign up for paypal s recurring payments recurring billing services which would allow you to just make an api call to paypal to set up a profile

folder	directory
i want to display an image logo.png in img folder and link a css file style.css in style folder that i put in root directory

15137995
for-loop	loops
the for-loop preincrements i before the printf hence giving it a first-pass value of 1 and the increment continues until i+1 128 - which flips the sign bit in a signed integer then runs loops until ++i causes i to be 0

15138094
post	get
the call i m more concerned about is gr get post 337 related to calls are too cpu intensive

width	height
i looked at changing the width height with percentages but it didn t work well so i scraped that route

15138196
folder	directory
until the issue will be fixed the workaround is to simply remove that folder and remember to also remove the bin directory as it might still have references to it

15138218
width	font-size	width	height
you can always change the width height and font-size of things and even animate it

15138219
put	get
i don t care about the relationship back from child to parent but if i add parameterset ds.belongsto app.parameterset to the app.region model then i get 2 put requests to the regions url for the two new relationships which is not really what i want

15138446
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mousemove	mousemove	mouseout
it recently started inhibiting the mousemove mouseover mouseout events so that the page behavior would more closely resemble that on a touch-enabled pointer-less device

screens	tablet
an example could be the following you want to use a different css file depending on the screens width one for phones one for small tablet and you could do so like such

15138750
put	get	post	get	post	put
what i mean is why just let the put and delete as same as get and post

15138769
width	height
just set the css width to the value you need the height will be automatically adjusted to maintain the aspect ratio

15138777
google-chrome	firefox

15138870
hide	show
you can inspect and set the text of the more list item to switch it back and forth between less and more and hide show as needed

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
html5 video mp4 and ogv problems in safari and firefox - but google-chrome is all good

15138905
emacs	sublimetext	emacs	textmate	textmate	sublimetext	textmate	aptana	sublimetext	aptana
btw i would recommend to use simple editors such as sublimetext textmate or emacs instead of aptana

15138906
children	parent
the variable of ival translates into the total number of children to the parent and loops through each to determine to add a class or not

15138909
children	parent
this creates two selectors parent and child and uses an ischildnode join criteria to ensure that nodes in the child selector are children of the nodes in the parent selector

15139013
width	height
you ll want to take the shortest of the two width or height and use that to build the grid upon

15139066
for-loop	loops
you may just want to try changing your loops structure from a for-loop to the jquery.each method

15139069
width	height
you just need to add half the width height of the rectangle to get its centre

15139109
udp	tcp
it works as tcp server.in order to convert that into udp server i modified a line in creating server

15139232
google-chrome	firefox
if your browser renders it correctly that s probably google-chrome or firefox but ie will just show you html-ish kind of output

15139251
getter	setter
i am trying to implement setter and getter for an array of strings within a basic class like so

15139354
min	max
the default connection pooling for eclipselink when not using a data source is a pool of min max 32 connections with an initial of 1 connections

15139412
emma	jacoco
i am trying to get bytecode coverage analysis using a code coverage tool like emma or jacoco after testing with a gui based functional testing tool like hp quicktest pro or selenium

15139468
free	malloc
these free blocks could be reused for the next calls to malloc

15139503
integer	unsigned
mt_srand takes an unsigned 32 bit integer to initialize the mersenne twister

15139505
free	malloc
this is because otherwise the operating system have to alter the virtual memory mapping of the process each time you call malloc or free which takes time

15139513
hide	show
this code show and hide a html button when you click on another button

15139565
for-loop	loops
i m trying to put these commands that i usually run not in a for-loop into two separate for loops

15139572
gridview	formview
i m trying to build an address in formview that is dependent from a gridview which has a list of contact names

15139572
gridview	formview
when i click the select button next to bills name from the gridview it shows me bills addresses in the formview

15139622
google-chrome	firefox
when i view this in google-chrome the button looks circular as it should but on firefox and ie itâ s square

15139640
google-chrome	firefox
both engines have long supported the border-radius property without a vendor prefix by the way â google-chrome since 5.0 and firefox since 4.0 â so unless this is for a reason donâ t bother using those.

15139663
outputstream	inputstream
c# app starts your node app and you do ipc by writing to the node process inputstream and read it s outputstream

15139698
google-chrome	firefox
of course everything is fine in google-chrome firefox is the problem but the game must run smoothly on all modern browser

15139705
post	get
now i need to get the id of the post in the cell and load it dynamically

15139715
put	get
do free theorems require that get and put do only trivial things in this case too

15139719
google-chrome	firefox
it seems to be working perfectly well on firefox google-chrome and ie7+

15139725
profiling	debugging
i would also point a profiling at the code before blaming the runtime - your debugging code is running unoptimized unless you tweaked the flags and as a result any performance problem in the code with be magnified because the compiler did what you told it to do

15139726
rss	feed
but all i got back is an rss feed of videos that are already uploaded published

15139727
chown	sudo
you will either have to run this as root or do a sudo chown your_username dev tun12 to be allowed to open the device

15139750
punctuation	words
you should note that this doesn t handle punctuation the longest words in this is a test. would be test. or 5 chars so if you need to filter out punctuation that would be a separate step

15139774
put	get
i want to get the resource file from dependency and put it to my classpath or another directory

15139809
keydown	keyup
by the way - when i m changing event.type keydown to event.type keyup - everything works but in thi case i cannot access event.unicode param to get pressed key

15139815
inherited	properties
in subversion properties are never inherited

15139820
oncreate	onstart	onresume	onpause
according to the lifecycle of an android activity after a onpause - onrestart -- onstart -- onresume is gonna be called if the app comes to the foreground again and onresume is called after oncreate - onstart when is launched

15139834
swt	swing
swt was created as a response to the sluggishness of swing around the turn of the century

15139854
width	margin
when a margin or width is applied to the body and the user zooms ie7 incorrectly treats the left edge of the body as the edge of the viewport

15139855
versioning	upgrade
the new msi thinks newer stuff is on the machine chooses not to install its files but during the upgrade the old package removes the files it doesn t notice that the versioning are newer

15139909
portrait	landscape
does it think the portrait top is the landscape s left

15139922
int	double
i have to retrieve three inputs an int a string and a double

15139925
for-loop	loops
the outer loops is a trivial for-loop

15139937
google-chrome	firefox
uploading a blob to a container worked properly but i can t download it using firefox or google-chrome

15139937
google-chrome	firefox
the only thing i achieved was retrieving the content in the reponse firefox and i could download it only because of the google-chrome cache that is not valid for me

15139939
packets	pcap
scapy has the capability to modify timestamps on a per packets basis therefore am wondering why might be the best way to modify the the timestamps on a number of packets in a pcap by specifying a start value

15139939
packets	pcap
for example would like to modify packets timestamps in a pcap which contains

15139965
int	double
with no floating point arithmetic whatsoever thanks to how the casting conversion of double to int and int division work

15140072
matplotlib	colormap
i want to use matplotlib s colormap to map this number to a color but not plot anything

15140089
post	put
i put some code in blogger to redirect visitors to the right wordpress post page

15140109
put	get	post	get	post	put
update the reason i m trying to do this with rkerrormessage is that it automatically maps to the nserror passed into the failure block in the restkit get post put etc methods.

15140128
google-chrome	firefox
surly the input type should be text if the value expected is dublin -- google-chrome might be cleaver enough to recognise that the input is actually text whereas firefox and ie might be more gullible and not even try to set the variable

15140133
hide	show
i can t get the divs to show hide properly with or without the fade effects

15140143
directwrite	direct2d
now that ie 9 uses direct2d directwrite to render the text there is no visible text

15140149
fast-forward	merge
in egit 2.3 they ve added the no fast-forward merge ability according to their release documents

15140169
post	get
though you have called the interface method which has been implemented in you activity.so in order to get the control back to your ui thread you need to post using a handler.the control does not goes from the background thread to the ui thread by just calling the method which is located in your activity

15140192
getter	setter
and here is my model without setter and getter

15140205
fadein	fadeout
the fadeout and fadein effects contain an oncomplete callback optional

15140215
int	chars
the following code removes the leading zeros by casting the value to an int and back to a chars string

15140226
int	double
based on the question convert from float-point to custom numeric type i figured out a portable safe way to convert float-point type into array of int and the code works fine but for some values when converting from double to unsigned long long with precision that can be safely represented by unsigned long long the conversion fails not by compile-time error but with invalid value which is minimum representable value for signed long long or zero the conversion fails on visual c++ 2008 intel xe 2013 and gcc 4.7.2

15140261
glassfish	weblogic
also please see this related question migrating jsf 2.1 application from glassfish 3 to weblogic 10.x or 11

15140356
public	protected
if you want to access the back-end collection simply make delegate public instead of protected

15140362
folder	directory
uploads folder should be inside webroot directory

15140369
children	parent
in order to have a specific style for inheritance edges and to display children classes below their parent i use this setup

15140386
memcached	apc
of course if you have access to memcached or apc use that instead

15140416
post	get
there s whether this is a get or post action

15140426
min	max
you can t set the offset parameter dynamically so if a series updates and changes the min max x y values the axis no longer cross at zero

15140445
children	parent
the parent is then supposed to gather the pid s of the children and kill them harsh i know

15140483
width	height
i would like to set a fixed width and height of the image so its always 100x100px

15140483
width	height
the code below is what was already in the system i m not sure how width and height gets passed or if this code can be used to set the width and height to a fix size

15140495
super	implements
the super class arrayadapter will take that data array and transform it into a list for which the add and remove methods are not implements

15140496
width	margin
its a fluid width max-width 1056px with a 12px fixed margin

15140527
centos	linux
os centos 6 - linux

15140552
google-chrome	safari	box-sizing	border-box
the problem happens when i try to set the same outerwidth value with jquery on 2 divs with box-sizing border-box one having a padding while the other does not and the browser zoom is set with not round values 67 or 33 on google-chrome and almost every one on safari

15140583
post	get
anything that is passable in request whether it s post or get is spoofable

15140611
initializer	class-method
another important point to avoid further inconsistencies i d recommend you initializer your carfinderviewcontroller from the storyboard instead of directly through the class-method

15140667
nss	gnutls	openssl	gnutls
because there are many very high quality libraries in c with many many years of testing bugfixing etc. and it is crazy to try to reimplement everything in python i would never use cryptographic libraries in python one should use bindings to well tested and paranoid-developed c libraries like openssl nss or gnutls

15140684
width	margin
try using 1 for the margin and a bit less for browser incompatibilities in the width eg 23.7 instead of 24

15140726
google-chrome	firefox
i have images on my page which a liked using and when they are being displayed in google-chrome and firefox they work fine but on ie they have a purple ring around the images any ideas why the would be the case

15140728
box-sizing	border-box
adding box-sizing border-box

15140738
button	checkbox
my understanding is that the twitter bootstrap button toogle is intended to act in the same way as a checkbox

15140819
hash	md5
use a hash like md5 that is based on the input query page filter settings etc

15140838
put	get	post	get	post	put
the above link explains that post put should get a response of a 303 instead of 302 and since i am getting a 302 on a put rest assured does not support redirects for that

15140840
post	get
as you can see it is simply using the zrssreader plugin to load post into a div when the get post button is clicked

15140857
src	attr
i checked comparing src and data attr and they match

15140883
width	height
i want to determine the size width height of a framebuffer object

15140898
post	get
or they can send post get variables directly without ever having seen your form.

15140989
width	height
you may also need to set the actor s x y width and height --- see

15141058
vim	emacs	vim	notepad++
it s built into many other tools such as text editors and like vim emacs and notepad++ and version control systems like subversion mercurial and git

15141059
hash	salt
note password and salt are sha256 hash

15141138
setinterval	settimeout
addeventlistener settimeout setinterval

15141187
google-chrome	firefox
note it seems to be more of a problem in google-chrome firefox than in ie as ie does not animate the accordion open collapse

15141194
margin	height
also using margin will not affect your element s dimensions whereas padding will make your elements dimensions set height + padding so for example if you have a 100x100px div with a 5 px padding your div will actually be 105x105px

15141196
folder	directory
you need to save file from the resource to disk at run time and than call it from that location may need to adjust current directory if it expects to start from a particular folder

15141206
width	height
i have a div of fixed height and width 100px x 100px

15141220
width	height
for example when i use a 2x2 widget onappwidgetoptionschanged reports 154dp 293px width and 193dp 355px height but i measured 340px by 420px in photoshop

15141275
rubygems	rvm
i have bundle 1.3.0 rubygems 2.00 ruby 1.9.3p392 with rvm 1.18.15 on a debian squeeze machine

15141293
onresume	onpause
as such you should implement onresume to initialize components that you release during onpause and perform any other initializations that must occur each time the activity enters the resumed state such as begin animations and initialize components only used while the activity has user focus

15141317
post	get
but i tried to many ways but can t get the tablet to post or get any information i made a self signed certificate and added to local computer trusted zone so i wont be asked that its is not verified do i want to continue i tried connecting by browser and it worked fine and printed all the info that i needed but not through the app

15141356
min	max
if so there is a technique that will work in any database engine - the idea is to concatenate the key plus any desired result data perform a min max then extract the result data

15141363
portrait	landscape
i m trying to build an app that shows a book in portrait and landscape mode

15141363
portrait	landscape
so obviously there s 1 page showed in portrait and 2 in landscape

15141363
portrait	landscape
each of the mode works pretty good but when i change the orientation from portrait to landscape the viewpager try to get 2 pages from the portrait mode instead of trying to get 2 double pages from the landscape mode ..

15141363
portrait	landscape
in fact fragmentstatepageradapter keeps the 2 fragments created in portrait and uses them before creating 2 double page for the landscape mode

15141363
portrait	landscape
if i switch again in portrait mode fragmentstatepageradapter uses the 2 fragments previously created in landscape mode so i see again 1 double page instead of 1 single page etc

15141373
getter	setter
in spite of the actual meaning of your code i think the getter setter way is not that pythonic

15141373
getter	setter
second if you want to have some constraint or some other logic in the getter setter func it should have a more obvious name which indicate the logic

15141374
arduino	avr-gcc
you may also want to try using the avr-gcc 4.7.0 rather than 4.3.2 stock for arduino as it claims to be more optimizing

15141407
next	except
except that when i try to read something and go to the next form i get a objectdisposedexception

15141424
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the platforms include ie8+ firefox google-chrome safari android ios

15141473
setinterval	settimeout
secondly you should use setinterval instead of settimeout because it will recheck it every interval time

15141487
uiview	subviews
as a general rule you should bear in mind that subviews can be deceptive as there is stuff going on in uiview subclasses you are not normally aware of

15141504
pem	pkcs#12
convert the pkcs#12 certificate to pem format with the help of the openssl pkcs#12 command

15141527
punctuation	words
the select statement includes a reserved words or an argument name that is misspelled or missing or the punctuation is incorrect

15141577
put	get
i am assuming that i am getting errors because of something else because even when i put comments on part that i tought was causing errors i still get errors

15141579
submit	submission
to prevent the method from submission i added ev.preventdefault and resumed the method after setting the values with #new_player .unbind submit submit

15141604
width	margin
this reduced the border right margin whitespace to any px width i set as per the width of the inner container

15141648
qdialog	qwidget	qmainwindow	qwidget	qmainwindow	qdialog
it turns out that for a window to be draggable by the extra space on it you need to inherit it from qmainwindow or qdialog not just qwidget

15141654
put	get
alternatively instead of trusted put sysop to mean sysops are the ones who also get to edit the main namespace as well as deleting pages and other sysop permissions

15141657
versioning	upgrade
if you are upgrade keep a new versioning separate and compare and update to your upgrading site

15141688
hide	show
upon page up or down show next or previous page and hide the current page

15141699
put	get
may be you can put in in preview step and get it in upload step

15141749
width	height
the flot plot function needs the width and height of the plot placeholder div to work

15141762
subtract	add
i tried to use the add subtract the offset from utc but i don t know how to counter daylight savings

15141763
vsto	add-in
i ve signed the clickonce manifest of my vsto excel add-in project type in visual studio project with it and everything worked

15141772
rss	feed
i have the rss feed on my phone and on my desktop so i see when someone pushes a commits to any of those libraries

15141782
ubuntu	linux
to tell if you have 64 bit linux run in ubuntu

15141833
google-chrome	firefox
however i m having a very strange issue which seems to be specific to my samsung galaxy s3 browser as i m not seeing the same on google-chrome or firefox

15141867
post	get
can you check in fiddler to see if your request type is post or get you may have to stick an extra bit in your code

15141869
int	chars
well you are comparing an int due to with a chars so of course it won t match

15141869
int	chars
in the switch statement the chars 1 is equivalent to a value of 49 when assigned to an int

15141869
int	chars
you can also read a chars in instead of an int and keep things the way they are

15141875
int	chars
menuselect is an int whereas 1 is a chars which once converted to an int is 49 .

15141877
int	chars
you re fetching an int value but then comparing it with a chars value

15141877
int	chars
the chars values in the switch statement are being promoted to the corresponding int

15141894
mouse	keyboard
a keyboard or mouse action

15141900
lme4	nlme
earlier comments and code that was a bit off-target since lmlist in nlme is quite different than lme4 lmlist

15141915
powermock	jacoco
i can t use the default jacoco coverage tool for the unit tests as these use powermock which results in 0 coverage for classes using that

15141915
cobertura	jacoco
so what i need is for cobertura to produce a unit test report jacoco to produce an integration test report and for sonar to be able to read the lot

15141973
int	double
i m porting an application from c# to java and the original application has int and double that are either ref or out parameters

15141973
int	double
at first i thought i could pass in an int or a double and since that was a reference type the value would be changed

15141974
google-chrome	safari
i got webgl to work on safari but can t get it to work on google-chrome

15141974
google-chrome	safari
i was hoping there might be a way to enable webgl in google-chrome the way it s enabled in safari

15141982
put	get
you can then give them some code like this and get them to put it in their website where they want their form

15141986
portrait	landscape
i have some code that reacts to orientation changes and after a lot of debugging and frustration i realized that although when testing on hardware my code works fine when testing in simulator although the simulator is landscape oriented the code reads it s current orientation as portrait

15142015
width	height
i m facing a slight problem using a gmap component when i try to make component resizable to set map s height and width both to 100 with help of css the component shrinks and map itself become invisible

15142015
width	height
but if fixed height width are set the component works fine

15142044
slideup	slidedown
i had a similar thought to sylvanus re using slideup and slidedown but with a slightly different approach where you reset all menus before opening the new one

15142110
hash	hmac
there s added info below in the link i provided but i do not think it related to what i need i dont think im using hmac just a straight string hash however when i do it in vb.net i get the bytes from the string first the i has the bytes

15142176
opera	firefox
it s noted in the article that firefox will fail the check if it s done on the wrong element but i actually found only opera behaving that way

15142264
versioning	upgrade
i assumed you have mvc3 intranet web application when upgrade from mvc3 to mvc4 using nuget your application now references system.web.webpages.razor versioning 2.0.0.0 not system.web.webpages.razor versioning 1.0.0.0 anymore

15142269
floating-point	fixed-point
here s the key denormals are a fixed-point micro-format within the ieee-754 floating-point format

15142325
google-chrome	firefox
it could be that google-chrome prioritizes the method calls differently than firefox

15142345
getter	setter
however i have a getter and setter methods but i get an error error name has private access in classname

15142403
post	get
now the thing is that when i send a post request with all variables neeeded to this php i get this error

15142406
subtract	add
you probably want to add an if statement when subtract score in less you want to allow a negative score

15142419
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
i am completely baffled as to why this is working but it does in safari opera google-chrome and ie

15142454
rss	feed
i m trying to parse a facebook rss feed and use jfeed to do so

15142454
rss	feed
however when it comes to styling the rss feed to make it look good using jquery mobile css attributes it doesn t take into account the attributes ul and li markers

15142483
put	get
if you re sure you really want to get around this pull php s session id cookie out and put it on the query string for the request to the iframe

15142485
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
is it possible to use javascript in safari firefox google-chrome to search a particular div container for a given text string

15142566
flask	django
i can think of two relatively straightforward things you can do without ditching php though i have to mention that php doesn t have much to recommend it and you would likely be better off with python django python flask or ruby rails

15142576
width	height
the inline-block on the li will let it sit horizontally and declaring its width height creates the appropriate container for the a

15142576
width	height
the a then inherits the height width from the li container

15142671
addition	multiplication
addition is also easy in this but multiplication becomes very difficult

15142741
width	height
look for something that sets the height and width in code at runtime

15142785
devise	cancan
i m using cancan devise for user authentication permissions

15142795
width	height
this function returns an array containing the url width and height of the image

15142800
button	checkbox
when the user press a button the list view should save the the state of the checkbox

15142800
button	checkbox
the problem is for example under select1 when i deselect a checkbox so 2 out of 3 and save using a button the two functions give me two different results

15142847
mouseover	mouseout
the solution is to set those hard-coded values using the data- prefix attribute scheme and then handle the mouseover and mouseout events with jquery

15142890
uiresponder	uimenuitem
you d have to reinvent the wheel to get copy and paste working but you might be able to leverage some of the uiresponder uimenuitem and other text system features

15142930
put	get
i know for sure that only the updated values will be submitted but i don t know which ones are those and need to get them and put each of them in a php variable called the same way as the inputted field was called.

15142989
pop-up	dialog
if i type usertools resharper doesn t pop-up autocompletion or namespace referencing dialog

15143008
folder	directory
it is looking into a folder called images for graphics but because images is actually within the root directory i only get a very empty page but for some reason this is not the issue with the virtual directory of current-communities

15143038
width	height
php is server side and can t grab your screen width and height

15143042
pull	push
the problem is that if i have conflicts during rebase i cannot push to my remote developer branch on github after the rebase is complete until i pull my remote branch

15143129
google-chrome	firefox
reverting to google-chrome 24 or using firefox makes the problem dissipate

15143157
queue	fifo
a simple fifo queue will not solve it as a single user can execute only one suite at a time

15143178
javassist	cglib
i have done something like what jeremy heiler suggested in my open source project funcito which you could browse the source code to see an example of what needs to be done to use byte code manipulation using either javassist or cglib

15143178
javassist	cglib
the general idea is that you use a code enhancer from javassist or cglib to proxy the class of interest as a subclass which has a method interceptor

15148338
unix	bsd
on unix systems including linux macos and bsd

15148367

tested on google-chrome firefox

15148585
rspec	capybara
i can t get capybara working with rspec

15148599
integer	unsigned
i m assuming this is what you meant - you d like to convert only the first two hexadecimal digits of a string to an unsigned integer

15148599
integer	unsigned
use strtoul to convert a hex string to unsigned integer instead

15148641
ant	maven
i would use the maven ant or gmaven then use groovy ant builder if you want to execute stuff

15148679
width	height
you can see my attempt using height instead of width at

15148691
bash	zsh
i use zsh but i m sure there are bash and sh equivalents

15148700
for-loop	loops
your for-loop s condition checks if zero is less than the row count which means that your loops will run indefinitely or until you access a non-existent index

15148717
free	malloc
they provide functions osal_mem_alloc and osal_mem_free which mimic the malloc and free in the standard c library

15148761
post	get
try looking for curl if you are looking for post or get type request that could be done too

15148775
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in google-chrome but fails in ie and firefox

15148870
for-loop	loops
try placing it inside loops also about incrementing the i you are doing it in the for-loop already so you do not need to do it inside loops

15148894
int	chars
if you are dealing with int factors or chars variables then will work reliably for the indexing

15148899
width	height
coz width and height are both int thus ratio is not accurate

hide	show
there is no supported programmatic way to override the system s default show hide notification icon behavior

15148966

after that it s still possible to easily add filtering sorting and other operations before actually executing the query hitting the db and returning the actual data

15148991
post	get
since you are not using the post template for any actual content you can rename your post show template to post and get rid of the show route

15148992
oncreate	setcontentview
however if you desire you can customize the screen layout by setting your own view layout with setcontentview in oncreate

15149001

15149068
apache	nginx
note that i m running unicorn on port 80 directly not behind another web server like nginx or apache

15149068
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the most bizarre part is that it only occurs in webkit browsers like google-chrome and safari but never in firefox

15149068
passenger	unicorn
it s worth noting that i installed the same app on another server using passenger and apache and this error does not occur - so it must be something specific to unicorn

15149069
strstr	strcmp
the problem could come from your that is not the same as string.h is for string operation like strcmp strstr etc.

15149076
icns	ico
i used the os values of linux windows and mac and in the icon tags for each os i added an href containing an ico file for linux and windows and an icns file for the mac

margin	height
because i ve given a height to shopping cart li which seem margin in open eye

15149082
width	margin
but i can t use the same technique for magazine menu i mean i can t use more big width for magazine menu to take as a abstract margin for its drop down menu

15149082
width	margin
because there are background colors and image at the magazine menu which takes place too if i use more big width instead of margin

15149084
super	self
i m curious why i can t call super thread self .__init__ instead of thread.__init__ self when my class inherits from thread

15149084
super	implements
if your parent class is a c extension class it probably doesn t have any ancestors and it probably doesn t implements super even if it does so you ll usually get an error that way too

15149093
stdout	stderr
if i remove the attempts to read stderr and stdout it returns but nothing is captured so it seems like there s an issue reading from the socket

15149126
multiplying	add
if tcomplex.multiply is declared with var params the function result of add cannot be passed into multiplying because a function result is an intermediate value not a variable that lives at a specific memory address which means a simple math expression like a + b c will not compile

15149141
awt	swing
j2se guis swing awt should be created and updated on the edt

15149149
google-chrome	firefox
i m testing it on google-chrome and firefox with testacular and while it passes on firefox it fails on google-chrome with an error saying that element is null

jobs	cron
i believe that what you need is wp_clear_scheduled_hook which un-schedules all previously-scheduled cron jobs using a particular hook name.

15149241
rspec	capybara
this seems odd to me since every example i ve seen for rspec and capybara didn t have that require but oh well

the plugin doesn t allow to override the min and max value via an select element you should use a input element

15149421
portrait	landscape
that is portrait without any tilt for most phone and probably landscape for tablet

15149473
free	malloc
you should also never mix and match new delete and malloc free

15149473
free	malloc
as a rule always delete memory that has been allocated with new and free memory that has been allocated with malloc and derivatives

15149482
int	chars
in practice this means that when you don t provide an initializer variables of primitive type such as int and chars retain whatever value was left in memory previously

15149492
for-loop	arrays
so i thought maybe deleting the entries in the interpolated time arrays would be faster instead of copying to a new matrix but when an entry gets deleted the interpolated time arrays changes size so this for-loop would cause it to access outside the matrix

15149499
uipagecontrol	uipageviewcontroller
if you want to add some sort of uipagecontrol to your uipageviewcontroller you need to use these 2 methods from uipageviewcontrollerdatasource

15149618
set	bag
books is either a bag or a set depending on whether duplicate books are allowed i ll assume it is a bag though it doesn t matter

15149618
set	bag
catalog.books is either a bag or a set doesn t matter

15149618
set	bag
then the size of the bag is equal to the size of the set iff no element was removed if every element was unique

15149633
ssl	https
when i run a query against the itunes search api over ssl most of the url s returned are provided via https

15149681

cos	sin
unfortunately z3 does not have support for transcendental functions such as sin cos and exponential yet

15149822
int	boolean
the reason i have two constructors is because i need to create those two arrays to hold the points for drawing the shape...and then i need to have them passed into the closedshape boolean int int int super class.

15149822
int	boolean
so....i m confused because if i m not mistaken which java believes i am... i made a super call with all the proper values and there is a constructor closedshape boolean int int int .

15149830
hide	show
i had a form with three sections and use back and next button to hide and show users only one table section at a time

so like using an 8 byte byte array with 64 bits in total it receives the hex byte array ad 12 45 67 c3 65 3a 66 transforms it into a 64 bit long binary string and flips whatever position

15149886
webkit	gecko
i have known that both gecko and webkit use hash map style sharing to speed up css selectors matching

15149917

public class rollupavrofiles extends configured implements tool

15150060
hide	show
on a page directive is actually correct since the browser doesn t have enough margin for them to show it will just hide them

15150095
coalesce	isnull
normally i would recommend coalesce over isnull

15150109
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller

clang	llvm
let s say someone wants to statically compile a given language using llvm what would be the biggest differences advantages and disadvantages to translate it first to c and then use clang instead of dealing with a direct ir translation

15150126
client-side	server-side
in other words the value needs to go from the client-side to the server-side and back to the client-side

15150133
activemq	rabbitmq
usually we use jms to connect message brokers like rabbitmq activemq etc

15150169
textview	simplecursoradapter
if you want to have compounddrawables in your simplecursoradapter you can extend the simplecursoradapter and override setviewtext textview string

15150261
coalesce	isnull
if you need to ensure a value is returned but don t want to have it marked as a key i believe coalesce column_name replacement_value will do the job of isnull without ef marking the column as a key

15150304
onreadystatechange	onload
also put your for-loop in onload or onreadystatechange property of xmlhttp object like

15150329

15150408
cldc	midp
i am using a configuration of cldc 1.1 midp 2.0

15150443
viewdidload	viewdidappear
and clearly if you re going to invalidate your timer in viewdiddisappear you probably should be creating it in viewdidappear rather than viewdidload to make sure you balance your creation of the timer with its invalidate calls

15150460
public	protected
access modifiers public private protected are simply a mechanism to allow different levels of encapsulation for those with source access

15150534
istream	getline
so use std getline for std string or istream getline for char to have similar functionality and your comparison will make more sense

15150692
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
it is a common misconception among developers that view state is somehow responsible for having textboxes checkbox dropdownlistfor and other web controls remember their values across postback

15150726
getter	setter
it does not have any side effect although its assumed by developers that getter and setter may not have any underlying code apart from getting and setting the variable

15150768
getter	setter
step 1 make sure that getter and setter for listnames are done properly

15150769
getter	setter
provide getter setter for name in your action class

free	malloc	strtok	malloc
following address 0x0 is not stack d nor malloc d nor free d of valgrind output i could rule out strtok as being responsible

15151124
for-loop	arrays
the only thing i do to this arrays is copy over some values from it individually in a for-loop in another routine which is verified to work correctly

15151132
versioning	upgrade
upgrade it to the latest versioning 1.4.4

15151153
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i check the orientation of the device in viewdidappear and viewwillappear and force the orientation by calling willanimaterotationtointerfaceorientation method

15151153
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
the problem i face is that tointerfaceorientation is remains 0 for both viewdidappear and viewwillappear method hence program crashes

15151242
google-chrome	firefox
although amusingly this seems to crash in firefox in jsfiddle for some reason but google-chrome works fine

15151244

15151383
mdpi	hdpi
4.suppose you put all your images in drawable-ldpi then images will pixelate in a tab.the correct approach is to put all respective images in drwable ldpi mdpi hdpi and xhdpi.but it is not a optimised way as this images make the app bulky

15151456
put	get
also as an aside once you get this working you might want to make sure you re caching the results because getimagesize will download the entire remote image before returning results which will put a lot of drag on your server

15151477
couchbase	couchdb
i would also argue the document databases couchdb mongodb couchbase allow you to store anything that is just too painful to normalize

15151487
post	get
make a page or a service in python which can accept post or get request and process the info and return back a response

15151493
simplecursoradapter	spinner
a method i sometimes use to add an extra record such as an empty option with a simplecursoradapter destined for a spinner is by using a union clause in my cursor query

15151519
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
as you mentioned the problem i face is that tointerfaceorientation is remains 0 for both viewdidappear and viewwillappear method hence program crashes

15151534
google-chrome	firefox
all browsers well i can vouch for ie firefox with firebug and google-chrome have good script debuggers

15151554
mongodb	rethinkdb
i am vetting non-relational dbms for storing potentially large email opt-out lists leaning toward either mongodb or rethinkdb using their respective python client libraries

15151554
mongodb	rethinkdb
the pain point of my application is bulk insert performance so i have set up two python scripts to insert 20 000 records in batches of 5 000 into both a mongodb and a rethinkdb collection

15151596
neo4j	titan
i would check out the titan graph database and neo4j

i am using the below code to open a local text file.it works fine in firefox but in safari i get the error as

15151753
orientdb	neo4j
for storing data in a structured way in json format or in graphs like mongodb orientdb neo4j and couchdbs do

15151776
swt	swing
if you read more about swt you ll see that it uses the native gui libraries of host oses to display graphical elements hence you ll be subject to the whims of the window manager which perhaps you wouldn t with something like swing

15151789
firefox	safari
all is working great in safari and firefox

15151807

15151825
hide	show
is there any way i can hide the browser popup and show my custom popup instead

15151845
int	chars
if this is too much for you you can define some helpers to get human-readable ascii chars and also to get the base pair compliment so you re not doing int casts all the time

15151904
post	put
i m trying to put some data in a hidden form field for a post

15151980

given a class or interface c the programming language allows the user access to a list of all classes which extends implements c

15152656
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop apparently treats strings similarly to arrays of single-character substrings

15152688
public	protected
public private and protected only matter in php if they are part of a function or part of a class

15152697
client-side	server-side

15152740
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue	nsurlconnection	nsoperation
a third approach is to marry the initwithrequest approach with an nsoperationqueue namely to wrap the nsurlconnection in its own nsoperation

15152740
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
there are some idiosyncrasies to properly implement this approach you have to schedule create a runloop for nsurlconnection if you use it in an nsoperationqueue

15152740
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
but i prefer a nsoperation -based nsurlconnection and would generally advise using afnetworking if you want to simplify your development effort

15152744

in may case i use the cobertura and reuse its report from maven site generation

15152750
getter	setter
now onto getter and setter

15152750
getter	setter
in your question you seem to assume that all getter and setter are written the following way

15152750
getter	setter
however getter and setter methods give you control over how your variables are being set by an external developer so you can instantly detect when they re going to make a boo-boo and avoid undefined behaviour later on

15152750
getter	setter
there is plenty of documentation about variable access and getter setter methods out there and it applies to a whole range of languages so don t be afraid to look up articles that were based on c++ c# vb.net they all roughly translate to the same material

15152769
int	chars
call atoi on one chars past where the comma was to extract the int

15152782
implements	extends
for that you have to write a user defined filter by implements filter interface and extends baseoperation class

portrait	landscape	width	height
the problem occurs only from portrait to landscape the width is actually good but the height is too high and i can t scroll.

15153216
min	max
instead you would use min max heights like this

15153216
min	max
ie they will take up the min height unless the content expands the container it will expand up to the max height value

15153238
pthreads	fork
also i was maybe thinking about using fork instead of a pthreads and have the child send data back to the parent through a pipe

15153241
comparator	comparable
the difference between the two is that the first one uses a default behaviour which can be specified in the object you will be sorting by implementing the comparator method specified by the comparable interface while the second allows you to pass a comparator object

15153316
execvp	fork
the proper way is to open a pipe when you still have one process fork into two processes parent and child and have the child call execvp

min	max
see the min and max are the same whereas i know that i have 1422 different plots for the first species for example with different value for the ba

i am having an odd issue which only seems to occur on safari and google-chrome

15161606
google-chrome	safari
i have created a slideshow using the jquery cycle plugin and i am getting this error when using safari or google-chrome

15161630
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested the site making sure that it works in google-chrome ie and firefox using a win pc and a win laptop

15161651
getter	setter
instead of setting the property directly set it via a setter method which triggers the callback function and possible use a getter method to access the property too like this

15161676
integer	unsigned
in your case there will be a proper type integer but there is no unsigned integer type which is why it s an error

15161682
integer	unsigned
basically in the first case unsigned integer is expanded to unsigned int which is a valid type name only certain combinations of type names and qualifiers are allowed in c and unsigned int is one of them.

15161682
integer	unsigned
in the second case however unsigned integer is not a valid combination of type names

15161717
getter	setter
the best thing to do it is a setter function you don t need a getter

15161729
width	height
the first would be to simply adjust with width height parameters on the element if you detect you are on an iphone the second would be to resize the element but also select a more appropriate bitrate video for mobile use rather than send the higher bitrate

15161729
opera	google-chrome
most modern browsers disable this unless it s a window you ve created yourself - see the javascript resizeto function not working in google-chrome and opera for more details

15161734
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
what i need to do is create an uitabbarcontroller which contains several uinavigationcontroller s with their respective rootviewcontroller

15161747
width	height
if all you want is to determine the required height for the label based on its text and current width then change this to

15161747
width	height
the returned size is the proper width and height to contain the label

15161777
for-loop	if-statement
if you re using a for-loop or a foreach use this in place of your first if-statement

15161786
hide	show
with zurb foundation 4 you can hide or show content based on small medium or large device sizes

15161786
screens	tablet
desktops when in full screens have a more detailed data entry experience whereas mobile tablet have a different experience because of device real estate is smaller

15161805
hide	show
also see this stackoverflow question if you want to just check to see where the mouse is at any given moment and trigger the show hide behavior off that

15161816
implements	extends
if you know that your inner class implements or extends a certain interface or class then you can use and myinterface instance instead of general objects

15161867
getter	setter
the best idea is to have setter and getter methods

15161867
getter	setter
but according to your previous implementation one could still alter your object properties without using setter and getter

15161874
serializable	deserialization
now i have after researching a lot settled on msgpack for serializable deserialization purposes

15161890
openni	kinect
i have found that the best way to get around this problem is to align both the images using built in library function in openni and kinect sdk

15161898
hide	show
notice how some calls show and hide have a duration parameter which in one case somehow overlaps the start of the next animation so timing is everything

15162005
hide	show
layouts automatically recalculate when you add remove or show hide elements

15162021
portrait	landscape
in ios 6 this works fine and the app responds and rotates properly so the user can load in both landscape and portrait mode and code works fine

15162021
portrait	landscape
the problem i have is this when loading ios 5 in landscape mode and while physically laying the device with ios 5 on a flat surface to ensure its landscape i get a orientationnotification that moves from landscape to portrait although the device didn t change

15162090
median	percentile
the requirement is to see percentile median and average mean summaries

15162090
median	percentile
however percentile and median are hard

15162143
width	height
what i want to achieve is what you achieve in traditional flash when setting the size to percentage â the scale to no_border and the align to top center with a min height and width

15162173
jobs	cron
but will this also prevent my cron jobs from executing it as well

15162203
box-sizing	border-box
updated given mydiv some padding and used box-sizing border-box

15162229
width	height
i needed to set a width and height on the images in the markup

15162327
background-color	transparency
just set the background-color css property to transparency

15162337
junit	easymock
i am creating some junit test cases using easymock

15162337
getter	setter
an example of the classes simple calls is below assume all getter setter constructors are valid and present

15162376
uiview	uipangesturerecognizer	uipangesturerecognizer	uicollectionview
once the uipangesturerecognizer activates in your uiview touches are no longer forwarded through the responder chain because of that your uicollectionview is not receiving the touches anymore

15162376
uiview	uipangesturerecognizer
you can try setting your uiview as the delegate of your uipangesturerecognizer and place the logic of whether the uipangesturerecognizer should activate

15162451
folder	directory
rails does not create files outside the directory so you just have to remove the folder

15162560
post	get
by cloning form controls and incrementing textboxes name and id properties.but when i post form only the first line get written to database

15162684
range	infinity
the way this works is that it looks for any character and captures it the dot then matches repeats of that character the 2 backreference 2 or more times the range means anywhere between 2 and infinity times

15162775
try-catch	exception-handling
if you are explicitly testing for the exception-handling then put a try-catch around the line you expect it to be thrown from catching the narrowest version of the exception-handling you expect and then set a boolean in the catch clause and the assert should be on the value of the boolean

15162830
for-loop	loops
i believe your new problem stems from the first for-loop you do inside your do loops

15162861
post	get
it is either get or post

15162861
post	get
to use post because get requests in json format are forbidden by

15162912
capitalize	capitalization
you forgot to add the index information for the colmodel in the subgrid you also need to pay attention to capitalization if the name is capitalize then so should be the index that way jqgrid knows that where it needs to put the data

15162938
versioning	upgrade
i can verify that a requests upgrade from 0.14.1 to versioning 0.14.2 cleared up the issues i was having with a similar error

15162945
children	parent
for in a parent child relation where child holds key reference to parent and parent has a list of children create and save parent first and child next

15162945
set	bag	children	parent
mapping in this case is a bag set of children in parent

15162971
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
i looked at javax.imageio.imageio but unless the doc i read is out of date it seems this class only handles gif jpeg png wbmp and bmp

15162983
profiling	instrumentation
i m trying to do an instrumentation profiling of a quite big project around 40 000 source files in the whole solution but the project under profiling has around 200 source files written in c++

15162988
mdpi	hdpi
then i put the 800 p wide image in the intended hdpi folder and the 480 p wide in the mdpi and it fixed it

15163000
int	double
your parameter of page in of data type int and you are passing page -3 in double quotes which tells jqgrid that it is string

15163085
subtraction	addition
i have already implemented the addition and subtraction functions on large numbers using string manipulation

15163149
portrait	landscape
i ve got a header brand image which changes between ipad and iphone but will not change the picture when changing from portrait to landscape which is really important that it does

15163154

it works with google-chrome haven t tested firefox

15163219
put	get
if i put the same awk command in a for-loop however i only get emtpy output files

15163243
libstdc++	libc++
libstdc++ and libc++ are largely abi incompatible even though they present to you largely the same api

15163243
libstdc++	libc++
in places where the abi incompatibility is known such as std string libc++ uses a different mangling scheme so that libstdc++ and libc++ strings are not accidentally mixed at run time which would cause hard-to-debug run time errors

15163243
libstdc++	libc++
if you see symbols that have std __1 in their name then those are symbols associated libc++ libc++ has where as libstdc++ has

15163265
sorting	filtering
so you can use dayofyear for filtering but you can not use it for sorting since this would mix up february 29th with march 1st march 1st with march 2nd etc

15163342
post	get
update #5 i found another post where some guy seems to be having the exact same problem that i am having now only difference is that i can t get the autocomplete to work even if i have the webservice in the same project

15163479
google-chrome	firefox
here is an example firefox on top google-chrome on bottom

15163504
post	put
the problem is that there are many attributes that users can search with so i m not sure should i use post method to pass values to other script or should i rather put all variables in url and make other script independent and accessible with only a link

15163576
post	get
you should go with get because post is meant to post create things from a form like an article

15163613
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
in all browsers i tested google-chrome safari firefox ie 9+10 it doesn t seem to work like this

15163784
hid	keyboard
you can get a bluetooth barcode scanner to work as an hid device essentially keyboard wedge in modern technology and it will work exactly as mentioned above

15163787
sys.path	distribute
in that case to get import to work one must make sure the module.__path__ of modules with distribute __init__.py includes all directories where one of the module s __init__.py are as well as making sure the correct directory is in the sys.path list

database sales cannot be upgrade because its non-release versioning 539 is not supported by this versioning of sql server

15163941
put	get
i was not able to get the flexible space to work in my situation but here is the code i used to be able to position the rightbarbuttonitem note i put a border around the uiview so you can see what it looks like with having the image in there

15163961

15164350
int	double
in the code there are two different types of values involved one to be stored as an int and one to be stored as a double value

15164350
int	double
taking a look at the assignment instructions you will see that the compiler figured out the right instructions mov to assign our int value and fstp to assign our double value

15164360
width	margin
margin will add to your containers width

15164360
width	margin
if you are using a width that is based on a percentage you should set your margin value a percentage as well

15164360
width	margin
in order to do so you need to subtract the margin from the total width

15164360
width	margin
if you want 1 margin left and right thats a total of 2 you need to remove from the total width

15164432

firefox	safari
i assumed it might have been a browser compatibility issue but tests on safari firefox and even sadly iexplorer proved this wasn t the case

15165290
hash	md5
as i understand the means it is hash using md5

15165290
hash	md5
what confuses me is that md5 generators i found online produce a hex value that is 32 characters long but the hash password in this case is only 22 chars long and definitely not a hex

15165351
viewmodel	caliburn
without caliburn and autofac i would simply create my own startup method load my data and inject it into my viewmodel

15165416
post	get
the trick if you want to get out something of the same dimensions you started with is then to use all slice indices as i did in the example at the top of this post

15165461
int	chars
i would recommend do this chars by chars the reason being there are all sorts of endian issues i would rather not even think about when dealing with rinterpretive int conversions

15165992
cos	sin
even if you do not want to implement fft which is a bit harder to understand and it s harder to make it work on data which is not in form of 2 n or use some open source code you can make your implementation a bit fast for example by seeing that is a constant outside of inner loop so you can compute it once for each k move it outside inner loop and then just multiply it by n in your cos sin functions

sctp	udp
sctp mapped over udp ipv4 allows more private hosts per public address but udp mappings in ipv4 nat gateways are notoriously tricky to establish and keep maintained due to the fact that udp is a connectionless transport without any explicit state for a nat to track

15166352
sctp	tcp
finally a lot of the internet is pretty much constrained to what can fit through tcp port 80 and port 443 so sctp of any flavor tends to lose there

one more slightly smelly solution would be to put it in tmp where it could get cleaned up and if it got deleted deal with it somehow

15168016

portrait	landscape
is it in the view did load method of the portrait landscape view controllers or in a different class

15169009
setinterval	settimeout
however it would be a better idea to re-write it using setinterval instead of settimeout

15169009
setinterval	settimeout
we could still do this with settimeout but setinterval is better suited for this job

15169009
multiplying	subtract
i did this because using the remainder operator is faster than multiplying to get the minutes as seconds and then subtract

i would try nsjsonserialization to save nsdata to disk

15169151

assuming you re targeting ios 5+ the most natural solution would be to use nsurlcache and nsurlconnection +sendasynchronousrequest queue completionhandler as appropriate

15169221
sudo	passwd
the only thing i can think of is providing my own passwd dialog and feeding that to the command line sudo binary via system or one of its less insecure cousins

15169261
sudo	passwd
either you use ssh-askpass which is installed on many systems or you write your own passwd prompt command which you then supply to sudo

15169261
sudo	passwd
this is still a bit twiddly however you don t have to worry much about communicating the passwd to sudo

15169280
hide	show
you can do the same with class but the identifier starts with . instead of # but doing it with class identifiers will make all divs with that class hide or show

15169624
width	height
if you don t want the table to have absolute positioning or if the height width are not known you have to use javascript

15169628
width	height
now every time the position is set the sprite s end up going where you would think they d go with setposition 0 0 putting it in the bottom left and setposition 1 height width in the top left

15169628
width	height
oddly enough this draws every sprite centered around the x y point which would make sense since width 2 and height 2 were subtracted from the position except not subtracting the values does not make setposition center the sprite via the bottom left corner - it s centered in a way i haven t figured out

15169687
vbscript	jscript
you can access wshshell via vbscript or jscript

the following example demonstrates how to change the focus transfer keys as well as documentfilter but i think either a documentlistener or focuslistener would sufice for performing your calculation method

15170020
portrait	landscape
use a flag to swap y-offset and width in portrait and landscape

15170021
ggplot2	lattice
in r many people rightly leave behind the base plotting functions and begin to turn to the more flexible wrapper packages lattice and ggplot2

15170021
ggplot2	lattice
one caveat though is that the lattice and ggplot2 packages are really more for data exploration than intelligent data visualization

15170021
ggplot2	lattice
i would have been hard-pressed to create a comparable visual using the lattice or ggplot2 packages

15170040

the width and height return correctly as well as the window location but the color is always 0xffffff white

15170078

15170332
post	get
a post request unlike a get request passes the form parameters in the body of the http request not in the url

15170332
post	get
moreover get is idempotent and post is not that means if you call get method on server nothing will be changed on server but if you call post then server will be changed may be a some additional data will be added in to the server so get is idempotent while post is not

15170332
post	get
you could use a get request to do pretty much the same thing as a post query

15170340
post	get
by convention http get is used for search forms while http post is used to change forms

weight_limits - min max pairs for each element in x defining the bounds on that parameter

15170564
min	max
use none for one of min or max when there is no bound in that direction

15170568
for-loop	arrays
you could initialize the static v variable to null instead and then before the for-loop that actually increments the arrays elements check for null and initialize with i+1 if necessary

15170573
uiview	subviews
i have a custom uiview subclass that adds a subviews programatically during initialisation

15170608
post	get
same result both with get and post

15170632

then i created an arrays of nodes without identifying them as being node pasted the code for the arrays into the index.html file and wrote a for-loop printing as many hello wolrd as there are objects in the arrays

15170738
tcplistener	tcpclient
i started off with some asynchronous examples for tcplistener and tcpclient and wrote a server and client class that is basically used in multiple places in my project

15170743
range	max	range	min	min	max
you can dynamically build this table by getting your min and max dates from getdatecollection to determine the overall range

15170743
range	min
because the logic surrounding dates is a pretty complex topic in of itself i d fall back on a library like nodatime specifically the arithmetic documentation start with the min date advance day by day until i found the first qualifying day first monday of the month and create a range 0 to that day - 1 as group 0 and push that onto an indexed collection arraylist likely

15170743
range	min
write a function that traverses the table comparing the dayofyear where x is the # of years the date you are comparing is from your min year of a given date against the items in the collection until you locate the range that day falls within and return that index of that item as the group number

15170743
range	max	range	min	min	max
an alternative data structure to the collection of range would be an array of ushort with length equal to all the days from min to max dates in your date range and the value for each day their assigned group number calculated with range as above

15170767

versioning	upgrade
the reason is that we don t want to accidentally break any existing projects that may be using the older versioning or force existing users to upgrade their packages

15171075
put	get
so when you put the logic in the code to access the same it will directly refere to that location and try to get the resource which makes it faster

15171083
rss	feed
so you have to merge the contents of the channel nodes of your rss feed

15171179
folder	directory
ravendb seems to work fine with that i can setup the whole server file directory on a dropbox folder on my machine and do the same on the other machine with the two drop boxes syncing while the ravendb servers read and write data from to the database that is stored within the drop box folder

15171391
strcpy	strdup
instead of using strcpy use strdup and assign this to

15171411
background-position	background-size
i am therefore using percentage based values for background-size and background-position

15171411
background-position	background-size
i suspect it is the combination of background-position and background-size with percentage based values which is causing the misbehaviour

15171445
put	get
let s use the classic definitions of get and put defined as

15171465
int	chars
normal strings won t take up one int per chars

15171587

i am using below code to set an image on a widget imageview using remoteview now i want to set height and width to imageview runtime

15171719
src	attr
the output indicates there are 12 img elements and prints nothing for attr src

15171732
portrait	landscape
first of all you have to put your all the widgets in scrollview if you want to support scroll in portrait or landscape mode

15171846

division	subtraction
what you re original post is trying to do is the division by repeated subtraction algorithm

15171955
google-chrome	firefox
if the value is not high enough it will not only keep broken on firefox but will also break once-working browsers like google-chrome so keep that in mind

15171955
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
tested successfully in firefox 19.0 google-chrome 25 and safari 4.0.4

15172006
hide	show
when the mouse enters your clients main-menu rectangle just show your container and hide it when it leaves this rectangle

15172029
getter	setter
assuming you want to generate the java source code and save it into a .java file you just need to iterate over the map and output the field definition and setter getter if needed

15172102
sse	avx
since i am quite weak in the area of intel sse avx instructions i welcome advice on how they might be better employed to speed up this code

15172126
ubuntu	linux
please tell me if this is possible in ubuntu linux and if yes how

15172188
versioning	upgrade
after upgrade you should configure your ide to use the versioning 1.7 as well

15172201
post	get
the 1st service is a get service returning json string and the 2nd service is a post service accepting this json string as an input and storing those data in database

15172202
express	node.js
you can find a couple of examples how to use socket.io with connect express or plain http node.js server on the socket.io page

15172206
octal	hex	octal	decimal
i m not sure why the author mixes decimal hex and octal though

15172218
width	height
which means the generation method must accept the size requirements at run-time and not always use width height declared in tag

15172223
peer	p2p
the following is the start p2p group formation with a discovered p2p peer

15172250
stdout	stderr
i am not clear about the stdout and stderr of ssh beacasuse if i execute say

3.the output is displayed on the remote machine stderr or stdout which i can see

15172251
folder	directory
i want the makefile to look in the directory plugins compile all the .c files found there with two different extensions .so and .o preferably into a separate folder

15172253
unsigned	short	int	chars
if t is an integral type bool chars char16_t char32_t wchar_t short int long long long including any signed unsigned and cv-qualified variants provides the member constant value equal true

15172255
tcpclient	recv
but when call send function and then call receive function in tcpclient side the recv function in tcp server side will be blocked at second time expected result is receving 0 byte

15172294
filtering	grouping
this code will grouping all the machine data out of a location tag filtering on the location s sequence value

15172312
stdout	stderr
in a local machine if you run a login shell say one of ctrl + alt + f1 6 it starts a new shell for the user and the output stdout and stderr goes right on your monitor

15172312
stdout	stderr
now let s take a look at your ssh case the steps are similar to last time with just one difference instead of sending the output again stdout and stderr to the monitor the server sends the data back to the machine from which you logged in - to the ssh client

15172312
stdout	stderr
but in case if you were to redirect the stdout and or stderr to a file when you re in a shell on the remote machine that file would be on the remote machine since the actual program you re running is executed on the remote machine

15172336
getter	setter
have corresponding getter setter methods in both actions

15172336
getter	setter
provided action2 has corresponding getter setter for the new parameters and given that params interceptor is configured in the stack action2 will get correctly populated

15172399
int	chars
if you passed a reference to a constant array of eight chars to ok instead of just a pointer to non-const int the compiler could have told you about one of the issues

15172406
try-catch	exception-handling
also try-catch results in instantiating of new object the exception-handling

15172425
httpresponse	request
here i monkey-patched httpresponse and wsgiresponse but you can replace self with the request instance

15172459
rss	feed
my site have support rss feed so the xml generated by site is like the following

15172459
rss	feed
i found google chrome rendering xml as text for rss feed is known bug as i understand we can not support xml format for rss feed in chrome

i wrote xml file that show imageview then listview then gridview

15172570
listview	gridview
only the listview scrolls and the gridview doesn t appear at all

15172570
listview	gridview
but it also doesn t work it shows the listview and gridview with very small height and the imageview doesn t scroll

15172578
width	height
i want to change height of linearlayout which used in listview how can i change the height and width for that layout i will put my code here but is not change the height of linearlayout how to do this

15172639
width	height
i don t think you can resize an away3d instance by simply setting the width height properties on the stage3dproxy

15172639
width	height
i implemented this by setting the width height on the view3d

15172642
hide	show
not very applicable when you want to hide and show many objects but in the case of one or two it works and is very quick to implement

15172663
rss	feed
all these controller will show rss feed coming from the website

15172673
pull	push
first git pull and then git push

15172694
width	height
and in your xml have just the layout and the image view with its width height and position

15172698
pull	push
so first pull the changes from the remote repository and merge then commit and push the merged revision

15172720
pull	push
you won t be able to git push if the remote received commits since you last did git pull

15172720
pull	push
so yeah git pull before you git push

15172750
submit	submission
you re using a and submission it and then overriding the actual submit except i don t think you are doing so currently

15172768
dictionary	map
note that the dictionary doesn t appear in the order of the tuples - that s because dictionary aren t ordered containers instead they just map a value to another

15172810
google-chrome	firefox
firefox uses sctp streams and google-chrome rtp

15172831
jtextfield	jlabel
my jframe contains a jlabel and a jtextfield

15172846
try-catch	exception-handling
if you want to log the parameter values for debugging purpose you can have a try-catch block inside downloaddatafromcore and log those parameter and just throw the exception-handling

15172849
listview	gridview
typical layouts which accept multiple subviews like listview or gridview have a recycling mechanism

15172872
jtextfield	jlabel
after you added a second element the jtextfield it replaced the last one the jlabel

15172893
pull	push
yes you must git pull or git pull --rebase before you can git push

15172896
getter	setter
if i do declare an instance variable it s with a leading underscore so it s obvious if i m referring to the instance variable or the setter getter method

15172896
getter	setter
with xcode 4.4+ you don t need to declare the instance variable or call synthesize and the compiler will automatically create an instance variable with a leading underscore and provide the setter getter method for you

15172928
unix	bsd
these specific instructions assume you are using a linux bsd mac unix but the same principle works if you are using windows.

15172999
listview	gridview
add your imageview as a header to the listview and your gridview as a footer

15173000
free	malloc
when i call malloc 128 1024 1024 on pc total free memory does not consumed or consumed a little because it not really used by application

15173000
free	malloc
but if i call malloc under openvz it is immediately consumes 128mb of free memory

15173010
google-chrome	firefox
however every now and then i hear about new features that are available in google-chrome but firefox doesn t have them yet

15173010
google-chrome	firefox
i get the impression that google-chrome s main aim is to be a faster firefox

15173016
integer	unsigned
5u is a literal unsigned integer -5u is its negation

15173047
unsigned	short
the results are converted to unsigned short

15173047
unsigned	short
resulting -5 will be implicitly converted to unsigned short using modulo

15173057
x86	mips
the c standard doesn t require that signed and unsigned types are the same number of bits nor that the computer uses 2s complement for representing signed numbers - obviously if it s not using 2s complement it won t match up to the value you ve shown so i made the assumption that yours is a 2s complement machine - which is all common processors such as x86 68k 6502 z80 pdp-11 vax 29k 8051 arm mips

15173133
google-chrome	firefox
as far as i see it google-chrome isn t just a faster firefox

15173133
google-chrome	firefox
afaik spidermonkey firefox and v8 google-chrome engines are reasonably similar in terms of javascript so you should be alright just using mdn

15173135
integer	unsigned
if the destination type is unsigned the resulting value is the least unsigned integer congruent to the source integer modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits used to represent the unsigned type

15173158
mdpi	hdpi
if i put my application resources in drawable-xdpi then it is automatically down converted for hdpi mdpi and ldpi by ration 0.75 0.05 and so on

15173158
mdpi	hdpi
suppose i kept my images in xhdpi and when app opens in hdpi it will reduce size to 0.75 when it opens in mdpi it reduces size to 0.5

15173186
keydown	keyup
currently i need to create a very simple keyboard filter driver that will prohibit some key combinations for illustrative purpose - it will prevent ctrl and a to be pressed at same time by filtering out a keydown in keys ctrl keydown was detected and to keyup yet

15173209
min	max
within a view you can use group-by and function to calculate min max sum avg count and others

15173216
children	parent
i ve got a listview who s items are listviews whose children are actually a list of string that is a member of the parent listviewitem

15173231
int	boolean
autowirecapeablebeanfactory.autowirebeanproperties object existingbean int autowiremode boolean dependencycheck

15173262
clang	llvm
so till now you can not refactor your c++ code and hope you will get it with new release of clang llvm xcode

15173310
post	get
this post was somewhat helpful but i still don t have a working solution - i get segfaults in insertnextpoint the case below infinite recursion in cheatechildnode when using vtkincrementaloctreepointlocator instead of vtkpointlocator or some vtk error like no points to subdivide when there are zero points

15173322
express	node.js
i have a node.js backend with an express server

15173329

i moved this folder to my home directory and renamed it smartgit

15173416
folder	dir
i simply deleted the .smartgit folder the dir tree with all the .xml files and ran the bin smarthg.sh script again

15173422
multiplying	add
then calculate the number of occurences of the last digit for multiplying by 10 add 7 times 7 and 6 for the error on the last one and do the same for the remaining digits here

15173457

opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
also this problem is in every browser including google-chrome ie opera firefox

15173504
post	get
if you could post how you ve assigned the values right up from the declaration you should be able to get help here soon

15173512
put	get	width	height
only if you put the file into the drawable-nodpi you will always get the same number of pixels for width height

15173568
post	get
a combination of ie and ntlm would work for a http get but give a bad request for a http post

15173577
hide	show
for example i have an overlay module that purely show and hide a background mask

afaik try and finally block are used execute a piece of code that might throw some exception we also add catch block if we are prepare to handle some type of exception and or are excepting them like fileioexception accessright or something

15173821
multiplying	add
the simplest and most obvious way is to add or multiplying the individual word vectors together

15173821
addition	multiplication
the bottom line of this answer is to stress the fact that while naive methods do exist addition multiplication surface similarity etc these are fundamentally flawed and in general one should not expect great performance from them

15173823
hide	show
if you have just a few controls on each page you can get away with putting them all on the dialog and just hide show them when you switch between the tab pages

15173856
unsigned	short
the reasoning remains much of the same if that happens until the conversion back to unsigned short for the assignment

15173856
unsigned	short
conversely unsigned short is allowed by the c99 standard to hold more than 16 bits

15173876
width	height
you can also set position height width etc of the button here

15173890
getter	setter
first of all you do not need to put your getter and setter in both class

15173950
free	malloc
malloc needs free

15173996
glut	sdl	mouse	keyboard
the exact implementation will depend on how you are interacting with the keyboard and mouse glut sdl etc.

15174001
int	double
if it fails it could be an int but too big try parsing as double if it fails return string

15174054
apache	nginx
you should use a simple webserver on your machine such as apache or nginx

15174107
email-ext	jenkins
first of all with email-ext you can configure a specific trigger to send the email notification - it can be on success or failure which is similar to the default behaviour of jenkins

15174120
getter	setter
i have my getter and setter in one package

15174121
bash	zsh
i m aware that typically the zsh syntax is different from bash s - i tried preceding it with a sh emulation command - emulate -lr sh - but it made no difference

15174150
udp	tcp
i ll use tcp sockets for text chatting and udp sockets for video and audio chat application

15174180

in firefox all is ok but in ie and google-chrome not works click in banner but link not work

15174189
xts	quantmod
via quantmod and trying to create an xts class which all seems to work ok but i can t seem to use date type indexes

15174205
hide	show
i want to show those li whose classname are same and hide others

15174235
put	get
those objects are then put into list created from their names and after pressing on any of this i can open the b activity passing this object and in activity b get some more info from this object

15174258
portrait	landscape
when i present the modal view if it s portrait it always come down from upper left corner and if it is in landscape it always come out as portrait and rotate to landscape mode it takes about 0.2 second quick but not pretty

15174322
width	height
by the way you have to use percentage for setting the column s width and row s height in that

15174327
min	max
appropriate min max axis value

15174327
min	max
using the number of gridlines to determine the min max values -- you

15174327
min	max
variable and your max to newmax and your min to newmin

15174337
superclass	subclassing
it is important to remember that exception subclassing must come before any their superclass

15174337
superclass	subclassing
this is because a catch statement that uses a superclass will catch exception of that type plus any of its subclassing

15174337
superclass	subclassing
thus a subclassing would never be reached if it came after its superclass

15174359
keyevent	onkeydown
onkeydown int keycode keyevent event is a method available is activity so you can override it

15174382
width	height
with updates i mean the bindings to the data width and height and other necessary information

15174424
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop goes through the different locations and then pulls out the 4 elements of the arrays

15174441

15174495
rspec	capybara
i am using rspec 2 and capybara and defined the basic integration test

15174508
width	height
and i think i have to set the scrollviewer width and height to the parent s width and height but that didn t work

15174542
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
you need to bind popup width and height to grid s actualwidth and actualheight respectively -

15174596
subtraction	addition
only random access iterators support addition and subtraction

15174632
versioning	upgrade
i believe there was a bug in earlier versioning of 1.5.x that caused this kind of problem too so if you re not on a reasonably recent versioning i would recommend an upgrade as well

15174655

floating-point	fixed-point
i assume you are asking this question because the platform you are on does not provide floating-point otherwise you can implement 15.16 fixed-point square root via the floating-point square root as follows this is c code i assume java code will look very similar

i mean i want to pull yii when i pull parent repo but don t want to push when i push parent repo

15184078
pull	push
to make root protected messages separate git repo so that when i push pull root git repo to do it for this one too

15184078
pull	push
in other words to push pull with parent one to 2 separate remotes

15184078
pull	push
to solve second problem i initialized new repo inside root protected messages but now they push pull separatelly

15184078
pull	push
i mean i want them to push pull changes to from 2 remotes at once

15184085
folder	directory
in order to pull a specific folder of yii of the entire git repo you might want to try out git checkout as suggested by this question on stackoverflow how to pull specific directory with git

i don t know if there is a cryptographically secure method of reversibly permuting a sequence of integers short of generating and storing a complete random permutation which is probably not feasible for a list of size 62 11

15184222
width	height
to get pixel coordinates you need to scale offset by the viewport such that the -1 to 1 ranges map to the width and height left and right as specified in the viewport

getter	setter
you can use broadcast receivers to pass data between activities create singleton on main activity or use static getter setter to acquire variables

15184368
post	get
the ampersand character is not allowed to pass by get method or by post method in php

15184397
width	height
i suspect that at the time you initialize your map the hero-unit element has not yet been given a height or width so its height is zero

15184397
width	height
as you can see before its parent is sized the map_canvas height is zero and its width is larger that you might have expected

15184416

as a result in firefox everything works fine and google-chrome fails to load vendor.js the same server instance thin and in the same time for both browsers

15184612
couchbase	couchdb
i think there are some essential differences between couchdb and couchbase server that need to be pointed out

15184612
couchbase	couchdb
i will not write about the advantages of switching from couchdb to the couchbase server because those are described pretty much everywhere see the future of couchdb by damien katz or

15184612
couchbase	couchdb
instead i will try to enumerate features of couchdb that you will not find in the couchbase server

15184612
couchbase	couchdb
all of the names relating to couchdb and couchbase can be really confusing so i ve updated this answer to begin with a brief explanation of the most important ones

15184612
couchbase	couchdb	membase	couchbase	membase	couchdb
there is couchdb couchio couchone couchbase couchbase server couchbase mobile couchbase lite couchapps bigcouch touchbase membase memcached memcachedb.

15184612
membase	couchbase
couchone formerly couchio merged with membase formerly northscale to form a new company called couchbase

15184612
membase	couchbase
after the merger of couchone and membase couchbase continued the development of the membase software and later changed its name to couchbase server

15184612
couchbase	couchdb	membase	couchbase	membase	couchdb
today i think most people believe that couchbase server is a new version of couchdb but it is in fact a new version of membase

15184612
couchbase	couchdb
couchdb and the couchbase server completely differ in their philosophy of building distributed systems and databases

15184612
couchbase	couchdb
this is what i found to be a list of couchdb features that are not supported by the couchbase server

15184612
couchbase	couchdb
no replication between a couchdb database and couchbase server

15184612
couchbase	couchdb
those features of couchdb may or may not be important to you so whether the lack of them is a disadvantage or not is strictly subjective but i think that the decision whether to switch from couchdb to couchbase server or not should be based on those differences and your dependence on those feature in your current couchdb deployments

15184612
couchbase	couchdb	membase	couchbase	membase	couchdb
because of that i would say that couchbase server looks like an evolution of memcached and membase not an evolution of couchdb and as such it looks like a great product if you are currently using memchached or membase

15184612
couchbase	couchdb
if you are using couchdb in the most basic way then you may consider using the couchbase server for the same things and it may or may not perform better if you don t mind the license restrictions

15184612
couchbase	couchdb
in any case make sure to read and understand the migration to couchbase for couchdb users tutorial before you think about switching

15184612
couchbase	couchdb
it s couchbase. that couchdb is somehow obsoleted by the couchbase server or that it is an old legacy version of couchbase

15184612
couchbase	couchdb
meanwhile couchdb is an actively maintained open-source project couchbase server is a completely separate project it is a newer project but it is not a newer version of couchdb - they are not even compatible and since even new tools for creating couchapps still keep being developed eg

15184612
membase	couchbase
couchbase server is actually a new name for the membase server the membase server was renamed to couchbase server somewhere around version 1.8

15184612
couchbase	couchdb	membase	couchbase	membase	couchdb
in addition to membase server and our new mobile products we also offered couchbase single server which was a packaged â œdistributionâ of apache couchdb

15184612
couchbase	couchdb	membase	couchbase	membase	couchdb
on top of that we began releasing developer previews of couchbase server 2.0 which incorporated couchdb technology into membase server â but this product was not compatible with couchbase single server or couchdb

15184612
membase	couchbase
... membase server will be renamed couchbase server 1.8 on its next release in january â a tiny step that simply alleviates â œnameâ confusion

15184612
couchbase	couchdb
while couchbase server 2.0 will incorporate substantial technology from the couchdb project it will not be upward compatible with couchdb and it shouldnâ t be viewed as a â œversion of couchdb.â emphasis added

15184612
membase	couchbase
membase server is now couchbase server

the reason is because i want to create a dock icon with automator that launches a new chrome window on a specific url without tabs toolbar etc

15185240
crypt	hash
it s pretty damn slow about 2800 times slower than python s built-in crypt on my machine which is already about half the speed of openssl s des_crypt but if you re just calculating the occasional hash that shouldn t really be a problem

15185258
mouseover	mouseout
the only way i can think you can achieve something similar to this is by capturing the mouseover event of that particular div and disable the wheel for the whole page and enable it again on mouseout

i ve successfully opened the drive and obtained valid handle createfile set offset for that handle to zero setfilepointerex and read the data to a buffer readfile

free	malloc
you didn t use malloc on so you don t have to free it

15185485
free	malloc
the name pointer is not alloced by malloc it points to a stack variable which is stored in the strings table of your binary file at compile time hence you can t free it

15185485
strdup	malloc	free	strdup	free	malloc
since strdup does a malloc see the manual you have to free it and you can update the string after its creation

15186251
getter	setter
i prefer to have getter and setter to validate input

15186251
getter	setter
the advantage that using getter setter affords me is that the object is really constructed step by step by calling on the external interface the object gives other than constraining the validation during creation which when an exception occurs renders the object unusable unstable

15186312
margin	height
basically you can make use of the height of element to offset the margin top for every loop

equals hashcode and tostring for each bean

15186919
post	get
these props will be added to your request either by get or by post methods as per configuration

15186923
serializable	deserialization
if you used code-first approach you wouldn t have this extra projection-copy operation between typed dataset class objects and your own poco objects on serializable deserialization and you would have full control over data object types pocos

15186925
width	height
then by height and width you can set the size of the container

15186945
hash	md5
just for an example of creating a md5 hash microsoft provided this code sample

15187036
x86	64bit
the a constraint is an x86 constraint indicating the return of a 64bit value in eax edx iirc

15187047
maven	pom.xml
if you are using maven and i would advise you to pick a quickstart from the list - the kitchesink is a good example and take a look at the pom.xml

15187154
post	get
my problem is that i just keep over riding the first post and i cant get my number to increment

15187173
integer	unsigned
i wouldnâ t index the actual address but create a new column with a crc32 hash of the address which can be a 32bit unsigned integer which only takes 4 bytes of memory

15187226
hide	show
it takes effect at first time subviews outside the masterview s bounds show but after first show hide animation they disappears and don t appear even if i call this method again

15187233
google-chrome	firefox
actually i would like my plug-in works for both ie and firefox google-chrome

15187278
g++	gcc
see the following code as an example compiled with g++ gcc 4.7.2

15187280

geocoding	geocode
i have everything set correctly but the geocoding does not work when i enter the name of a city in the form that i created then i click on geocode it nothing happens

15187419
mouseup	mousedown
i can explain it that there is a text node inside the anchor and when mousedown goes to the text node after transform mouseup comes outside the text node

15187419
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
i would like to notice that the issue is reproduced at least in google-chrome opera and safari and even if i put a link to href tag instead of handling click event

15187479
post	get
one possibility is to store the post data in _session post _post to persist the storage and get the posted data on the new page with _session post field

15187503
getter	setter
given that your two suggested fixes should by all rights be the same result assuming you re not overriding the setter or getter for selectedcellindexpath to do something strange i would guess you ve found an arc bug

15187505
integer	unsigned
in this case your ordering is based on a simple unsigned integer value with depending on the data you re dealing with probably a fairly small bound

15187537
builtin	isinstance
another way is as martijn already suggested to use the isinstance builtin function as follows

15187550
put	get
you can use .each api to get every text of .invoice-number and put it to array

15187551
post	get
at the post method i get the following error

15187633
google-chrome	safari
testing for hyphens auto support is not reliable both google-chrome and mobile safari support it with prefix but only the latter does hyphenation

15187639
getter	setter
you are accessing the _selectedindexpath through an ivar reference avoiding the getter and setter

15187672
folder	directory
how can i get directory info without getting readonly file or folder here is my code but this when the file or folder is readonly returns a error

15187687
ubuntu	mint
i have freshly installed xampp-linux-1.8.1 on my ubuntu 12.04 mint 13 maya operating system

15187702
setinterval	settimeout
due to how angular dirty checking works when you execute code outside of angular scope using settimeout setinterval or from within some third-party plugin callback the changes produced by that code invocation won t be recognized immediately by angular scope

15187741
width	height
when only a pixel s width or height of this image is visible it appears to be a moving dashed border

15187754
int	chars
when you using scanf d ... it reads chars and parses them into a int

15187801
jruby	mri
i d like to use jruby to create some xml files but it is not escaping characters in the same way mri ruby does

15187822
rss	feed
i am creating an application with mvvm pattern in which i need to load data from rss feed

15187902
hide	show
when i press the button frm2 must be show visible and in front of all other windows and form1 must hide

15187902
hide	show
when i press the closebox of frm2 frm2 must hide and form1 must be show reverse

15187902
hide	show
i ve tried alternating the order of show and hide and using of a new reference instead of owner i also used activate bringtofront focus but with no success.

15187928
ng-show	ng-hide
use ng-hide and or ng-show directive

15187950
boost	stl
when underlining the differences between stl and boost intrusive containers the documentation also says

15187961
post	get
so in a search scenario it is actually common to just use a single get request and not a post request since you are using it to get search results based on a particular query

15187965
portrait	landscape
try replacing not orientation landscape with and orientation portrait

15188023
disk	ram
the data have to be flushed from your graphic memory to the ram and then to disk and that takes a long time

15188027
jobs	cron
regarding the scheduling you are looking for cron jobs

15188027
jobs	cron
see for details describing how cron jobs work

15188031
google-chrome	safari
khtml like gecko google-chrome 25.0.1364.97 safari 537.22

15188053
children	parent
adds a node to the end of the list of children of a specified parent node

15188054
children	parent
adds a node to the end of the list of children of a specified parent node

15188062
octal	decimal
the thing is a numeric value starting with a 0 is treated as an octal by the cmd command processor so putting 1 at the beginning makes it to interpret the number as a decimal which it actually is

15188075
onclick	onsubmit
you don t want onsubmit you want onclick

15188086
postgresql	mysql
preferably for development choose the same db engine which you are suppose to use in production mysql or postgresql are quite typical choices as they are available in many environments and are open source

15188099
hide	show
as one of the previous answers suggests you ll need to use the booleantovisibilityconverter to convert from the bool value to the visibility value to show hide the progressbar

15188099
rss	feed
also the changes to your ui won t be reflected unless you do the work of retrieving the rss feed from a background thread

15188104

15188125
min	max
i m assuming you can calculate the zoom factor say k which would be the scale of your zoom and you can control the scrollbar min max current values via maya

15188205
children	parent
if i select any parent nodes it also selects its children nodes this is intentional and displays those

15188233
g++	gcc
you can get gcc g++ for both windows and linux

15188233
g++	gcc
so assuming you have gcc g++

15188233
g++	gcc
to compile a c++ code use g++ instead of gcc and of course your input file must have the extension .cpp and not .c

15188233
g++	gcc
the getch is not part of gnu standard c library please refrain from using it if you plan to compile your code using gcc g++

15188239
move	drag
i know the function works because if i try to drag the form with the mouse it is move to a valid position at once

15188263
armadillo	lapack
i try to compile and link armadillo with lapack and blas

15188263
armadillo	lapack
i try to compile and link armadillo with lapack and blas

15188277
oasis	ocamlbuild
myself i use a makefile and ocamlbuild if i m being lazy and oasis for everything else

15188277
maven	pom.xml
you only need to look at the _oasis file think of it like pom.xml if you ever used maven

15188286
folder	dir
the dir s command gives the total size of all files in the folder and its sub-folders but the output changes depending on your computers locale settings language

15188293
submit	submission
am using submit for form submission and i have to redirect my page

15188324
rss	feed
i have no problem with the jquery slider part but i have never worked with rss feed before and i am not sure if that need php to pull the data and format it ready for the front-end or if it can simply be done via jquery

15188339
width	height
change the height and width of the outer linearlayout

15188354
put	get
operations get and put assuming the hash function disperses the

15188354
put	get
operations of the hashmap class including get and put

15188354
put	get
containskey get put and remove operations

15188391
move	drag
the wm_moving message is normally sent while a window is being move by the user as during a drag operation

15188391
move	drag
the window responds to the message by adjusting the proposed window bounds and then the os either move the window to those new coordinates or changes the drag rectangle depending on whether the full window drag option is set

15188393
rss	feed
since an rss feed should be valid xml you can just pull the feed with a jquery ajax request and then feed the returned string into a jquery object via parsexml

15188400
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
they re virtually identical in appearance tested in ie8 9 10 firefox safari google-chrome opera

15188431
width	height
the images are not the same height or width so when they animate the animation is jumpy because the frames do not line up correctly

15188431
width	height
the frame width and height is the largest size of the largerst animation frame

15188431
width	height
in the commented out code the anchorpoint is half the size of the width and height of the frame

15188492
notepad++	sublimetext
as you can see i ve included the correct encoding charsets for both files and i ve double checked and i can confirm that every file used for this part of the code it s encoded as korean checked in different apps like dreamweaver notepad++ sublimetext 2

15188524
nswindow	nsbutton
is it possible to have a transparent nswindow but not for it s subviews nstextfield and nsbutton

15188531
free	malloc
when using malloc do remember to also free them after using them

15188596
asterisk	freeswitch
most of them have detailed documentation for configuring asterisk not so much so for freeswitch

15188666
implements	extends
i tried to create a class that extends multipageeditorpart and implements iresourcechangelistener and within it to create xtexteditor as the first page

15188775
hide	show
javascript is not much but i found a code to show and hide divs

15188775
hide	show
the effect show hide applies to everyone not just one

15188803
rss	feed
i have the following rss feed and it has information about other rss feed and ultimately it will have data

15188803
rss	feed
when user selects any rss feed i want to display the root rss feed s child rss feed by their names the information about the selected rss feed will be shown

15188830
folder	directory
in the resource base directory i have a web-inf folder that contains a web.xml file as well as quercus web-inf lib and licenses

15188861
post	get
you can equally use an asynctask which will allow you to update the ui after in onpostexecute or you can get this behaviour by creating a handler on the ui thread and post ing to it

15188877
lxml	elementtree
if you switch to using lxml an alternative implementation of the elementtree you can use more complex xpath expressions still including matching only model elements with and a stereo attribute

15188896
rss	feed
your code including xml parsing works fine but your url points to an html page that contains urls of rss feed not to an rss feed

15188920
webclient	httpwebrequest
you can use the httpclient webclient or httpwebrequest classes to send http requests in decreasing order of convenience

15188996
width	height
set width and height to match_parent for imageviews and set layout_weight 1 for all imageviews

15189047
folder	directory
i then extract the war to a folder quercus in the current working directory without any modifications

15189058
width	height
if it is then i draw the grid squares starting from the x y increment tile to the width height of the viewport +1 tile 1024

15189060
free	malloc
the stack frame is taken from stack memory at run time almost like a malloc and free

15189097
getter	setter
also it s discouraged to define getter and setter unless there is a very good reason which you don t have here since you re just accessing the variable

15189139
getter	setter
one of the main reasons to use getter and setter is to hide implementation details from the user of the class so you can easily change implementation without affecting the user

15189139
getter	setter
if you just use to hold some data together not having getter and setter will make the code shorter and more readable

15189139
getter	setter
but if the inner class is bigger and more complicated which is usually not the case then you should consider using getter setter

15189146
folder	directory
i have a directory structure in which my private bin... folder are in the same directory as my public html i can t elevate them above that due to a conflict with another site. i m trying to get .htaccess to deny all access to the folder unless the computer trying to access the files is the server itself

15189175
width	height
but the height and width returns zero why is it not working how to get the height and widht of my view

15189182
google-chrome	firefox
this works on firefox and google-chrome just fine but on ie the link is still clickable

15189184
children	parent
there is currently no way to select a parent via it s children using css

15189200
width	height
width and height of the view can be measured after drawing to the screen

15189200
width	height
so if you want get height and width

15189208
portrait	landscape
the main difference of my viewport-problem from other problems mentioned on stackoverflow is that i only access it in portrait mode so no rotating or landscape mode

15189208
width	height
so my maximum page width is equal to 320pt the height of all elements is until now 250pt

15189234
submit	submission
is it ok in jsf to render submit a form with conditionally chosen different input components but all submission to the same bean field like as shown below

15189264
post	put
i have seen many examples of using accepts_nested_attributes_for but only a few of them for json post put and none of them helped me

15189294
post	get
you would post to important not important post hopefully this will get you on the right track.

15189303
uiview	calayer
the actual animation is performed by core animation which works at the layer level â each uiview has a backing calayer instance that is responsible for animations and compositing while the view mostly just handles touch events and coordinate system conversions

15189303
uiview	calayer
because uiview is based on a calayer many of its properties are actually implemented in the underlying layer

15189341
for-loop	arrays
method 1 i take an input n split into into a byte arrays of its constituent digits sort it using an array.sort function and iterate over the arrays using a for-loop checking for element vs counter consistency

15189353
mouseout	mousedown	mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	mouseout
i managed to display the coordinates with mouseout and mouseover but mousedown seems only to work on the image shape that has been added to the stage but not the stage itself

15189365
installation	upgrade
i purchased asp.net web hosting through arvixe which provide umbraco installation one time free and charge for any additional upgrade like installing extensions

15189390
i2c	spi
i have implemented uart spi i2c and one wire bus protocol using msp430 launchpad in software

15189495
width	height
a lot of the plugins out there set width to 100 and the height to auto

15189495
width	height
this will not work as if the browser width is let s say 200px and browser height 800px

15189495
width	height
there will be a gap under and above the image so in this case the height should be 100 and width changed to auto

15189503
put	get
so i don t risk being able to just put any type in on either spot and only get a warning.

15189508
uitableview	nsindexpath
uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

15189559
dictionary	map
it s basically the equivalent of a map hash dictionary object similar to a normal javascript object with some convenience functions

15189607
equals	gethashcode
if not you need to override equals and i highly recommend to also override gethashcode

15189626
min	max
but also for max and min the value updated is 100

15189656
hide	show
also i attempted to throw the entire sub into a separate thread but noticed that when i did that the progressbar doesn t show until the end of the code - then it flashes briefly and hide again

15189663
ceil	sqrt
unless i am missing something i would suggest if you must do it this way using int ceil sqrt x

15189675
post	get
i am using query_post to get few post of some author the code is like this

15189680
locationmanager	clgeocoder
i am trying to complete the tutorials on locationmanager and clgeocoder but am having trouble understanding how these can interact with one another through classes

15189680
locationmanager	clgeocoder
now i am trying to have clgeocoder return information on that location but i am having trouble since locationmanager is in a different class

15189698
int	double
addition if you really want to do this with int rather than changing to decimal or double like many other answers recommend consider changing the sub-expression

15189707
width	height
they only have x and y coordinates not width and height

15189754
nsmutablestring	nsstring
but if you really want this to be on the string itself you either need to provide a method like stringbytruncatingtolength on nsstring or you need to switch to using nsmutablestring everywhere because nsstrings cannot be modified at all and thus a setmaximumlength method would be kind of meaningless

15189764
google-chrome	firefox
this happens on firefox google-chrome and ie10 i just didn t included prefixed box-sizing for firefox in example

15189803
put	get
when i run the x 3b command to see a 3-byte char array i get two different outputs depending on if i put a before the array name

15189813
width	height
i would say because the border attribute adds to the height width

15189857
google-chrome	firefox
i need a solution that works at least with google-chrome and firefox

15189867
popover	tooltip
when i decide replace the tooltip by popover i get some strange problems

15189871
implements	extends
what is meant by the comments above is to create your own tablemodel for example by extends defaulttablemodel and override implements setvalueat to update the db

15189877
getdate	dateadd
sql server has a function year so to extract year from dateadd s -1 dateadd mm datediff m 0 getdate +0 0

15189877
getdate	dateadd
just do select year dateadd s -1 dateadd mm datediff m 0 getdate +0 0

15189895
google-chrome	firefox
the best solution worked in three browsers ie firefox and google-chrome is

15189918
apache	nginx
examples would be apache and nginx

15189923
width	height
define bkgrnd empty-scene width height

15189939
g++	gcc
note if you re using gcc or g++ to compile your program you need to link against the librt library by appending -lrt

15189949
int	double
i just want it to compare two elements of the same type but whatever type the client gives it ex int string double etc... to see which one is greater then the other

15189986
for-loop	loops
if i were you i would choose while loops with condition as yours i mean the long one inside for-loop with body of incrementing

15189988
for-loop	loops
a for-loop can be converted to an equivalent while loops

15189990
comparator	comparable
the closest thing you can do to this is a comparator that can compare any objects that implement the comparable interface

15189990
comparator	comparable
but generally once you have comparable objects you don t necessarily need a comparator for example collections.sort can take either a list with a comparator or a list with comparable elements

15190005
int	double	comparator	comparable
on the other hand if you restrict yourself to string int double then they are comparable and you can simply write the comparator with the comparator method

15190014
for-loop	loops
although you were setting for the correct value of num you were checking the condition of the for-loop only in the next iteration of loops after the num++ statement is executed and hence your value of num was offset by 1

15190014
for-loop	loops
as many people suggested you could use the break statement to terminate the for-loop execution so that the value of num is what you want it to be when the control reaches outside loops

15190022
for-loop	loops
i ve got a big for-loop that loops for hundreds of times and at its end it produces this warning

15190054
ng-show	ng-hide	ng-show	ng-class	ng-class	ng-hide
having this in mind you should always try to make your functions idempotent pure always returns the same output given the same input and light because directive such as ng-hide ng-show ng-class and similar will always re-evaluate the expression assigned to them on every digest cycle

15190067
children	parent
children after parent for example

15190108
for-loop	loops
you must declare the list before loops and in the for-loop only add the elements to it

15190157
dpkg	apt
it allows user to manage packages through various programs like dpkg or apt on a system

15190177
uilabel	uitextview
please notice i used a uilabel instead of a uitextview

15190185
typedef	struct
typedef struct

15190198
cpu	processors
binding threads to cores prevents the operating system from moving around threads between different processors cores which speeds up the executing especially on numa systems machines with more than one cpu sockets and separate memory controller in each socket where data locality is very important

15190216
post	get
just read the latest blog post to get an idea on how to create dynamic content elements with those extensions

15190219
stdout	stderr
pipe stdout and stderr too

15190264
addclass	removeclass
have a look at this answer animating addclass removeclass with jquery since it is definately a better more efficient method in my opinion

15190298
for-loop	loops
you could change your for-loop to loops over i 0 ... 999 - and redirect the output to a file in order to see the whole output in case you use a terminal

15190313
width	height
i m always using a pot array width and height but whenever width height it doesn t work

15190326
width	height
take the minimum between the value you had calculated with the width height boundaries of the window minus the width of height of the div

15190340
google-chrome	firefox	margin	height
problem is that the li items does not not display the same between windows 7 and windows8 ubuntu on all browsers google-chrome firefox ie etc... i tried using different css properites such as line height padding margin etc but no matter what i do the layout of the items are not the same between the win7 and win8 ubuntu

15190340
google-chrome	firefox
i tested on various pc s and i tested between same versions of browsers latest google-chrome latest firefox ie9...

15190340
ubuntu	linux
or just ubuntu linux

15190342
multiplying	add
2 i want to overload the math operators to be able to add vectors multiplying vectors by constants etc

15190365
button	checkbox
one with radio button options one with checkbox and one with a textarea

15190365
button	checkbox
i used a table to get the questions on the same line but the problem i am having is i can t get the choices radio button checkbox and text area under each appropriate question

15190407
d3.js	raphael
smil raphael d3.js svgs are already in the dom

15190415
hide	show
for now this will show and hide the div

15190418
multiplying	add
2 i want to overload the math operators to be able to add vectors multiplying vectors by constants etc

15190457
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
as the title says i was under the impression that using something like virtualbox or vmware was actually parallels but i m told they are different

15190484
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
so if you have a canvas with elements on it positioned with the canvas.left and canvas.top for example you can use the mousedown mousemove and mouseup to allow users to drag reposition elements across the canvas

15190494
iboutlet	ibaction
you probably created an iboutlet digitpressed instead of an ibaction

15190531
portrait	landscape
they all display properly in the portrait orientation except for the 3000x4000 - it s size is reduced for displaying on the screen but gets flipped to landscape orientation

15190545
domcontentloaded	onload
domcontentloaded fires when the page is visible before onload does

15190552
hide	show
but i need to move the position of the drawing area ccrendertexture a little up to show a submenu that hide in the bottom of the screen so im using ccmove

15190570
pull	push
the idea is before each push to pull --rebase that branch from the upstream repo in order to replay your local work the commits you haven t pushed already on top of upstream branch git pull --rebase will fetch and then rebase your local work on top of what has just been fetch

15190570
fast-forward	merge
that way a developer will only push commits which will be merge on upstream as a fast-forward merge

15190621
google-chrome	firefox
with google-chrome the facebook login button will apear but if you get in with firefox it will dissapear

15190627

floating-point	fractions
even though the standard 64-bit ieee-754 floating-point format reserves 53 bits for the mantissa which is equivalent to floor log10 2 53 15 decimal digits a valid number in this format may need up to some 1080 decimal digits in the fractions part when printed exactly which is what you appear to be asking about

15197157
floating-point	fractions
so if you know where the least significant non-zero bit is in a binary floating-point number you can figure out how many decimal digits are needed to print the fractions part of the number exactly

15197193

15210695
switching	screens
i m guessing this is due to either my background images being too high of a resolution i wouldnt think so since its just the size of the screens or the fact that my images are png files that are 3-4 times larger than if i used high quality jpg files i m wondering if anyone knows for sure or has experience dealing with background images of the size i described without problems because i d rather just switching to jpg instead of having to lower the image resolution

15216481
width	height
my first thought was just to set the height of #title12 to 160px but this doesn t work if the element below it is the same width

15216481
width	height
if so add a filler block consisting of an empty block element with height and width equal to the row and column sizes you desire

15216501
setinterval	settimeout
on top of that you have the vagaries of settimeout and setinterval not running at exactly the requested delay so if the system suddenly gets busy say responding to a network request scroll action etc. the frame rate will slow or become jerky trying to catch up

getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
furthermore there are optimizations included so that when your selector is very simple like just an id or an element name the native getelementbyid and getelementsbytagname will be used which are extremely fast

15217164
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
this will use getelementbyid followed by getelementsbytagname and will be extremely fast

15217193

15217218
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
sizzle jquery s selector engine parses the string with regex and tries to speed up very basic selectors by using getelementbyid and getelementsbytagname

15217218
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
by breaking the selector string up into simple chunks that sizzle can parse quickly #id and tagname you re basically just chaining together calls to getelementbyid and getelementsbytagname which is about as fast as you can get

mouseleave	mouseenter
that happens because when your mouse is over any button event mouseleave is fired on panel so buttons are again invisible and mouse is back on panel thus firing immediately mouseenter and showing them back

15220653
mouseleave	mouseenter
edit here you have an example to fix your issue - mouseenter and mouseleave events from a panel and its child controls

15220658
children	parent
i have to drag children div with in parent div

15220674
subtraction	addition
then the addition task won t be accepted by the subtraction worker

15220678
width	height
so i figured that i specify width and height of the canvas directly in the script like this

15220782
nginx	lighttpd
this can be remedied by using a different web server such as lighttpd or nginx

15220794
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
on android ios devices tested google-chrome firefox opera skyfire board browser dolphin safari the button changes the image but i cant see the change because the graphic is changed too slow

15220805
google-chrome	firefox
i have a problem with my wysiwyg-editor it works in firefox but not in google-chrome

15220850
width	height
the xoffset and yoffset can be customised to your needs we need to subtract from the width and height of the window otherwise the canvas will go off the page

15220897
rss	feed
i m using simplepie to fetch rss feed

15220897
rss	feed
on the same page i m trying to display two rss feed in two different columns

15220910
width	height
i tried various values for width height viewbox and even preserveaspectratio on the root element without much success so far

15220912
hide	show
although really you should load both images at the same time and just use the click handler to hide and show them- it ll be a lot more responsive

15220975
printf	fgets
fgets will store n in variable first_name when you hit enter after you type mark so the string stored in first_name is mark n printf will just do its job and print the newline character

15220990
portrait	landscape
also to detect landscape mode or portrait mode you can try this

15220993
google-chrome	firefox

15221011
post	get
currently i dont know how to get the values returned dynamically using the select statements as before i had always used post to another php file and returned the values that way on a separate page but i think ajax would be a far better solution

15221053
children	parent
this is because the parent element would become these children s containing block as opposed to if it was static

15221053
children	parent
because of this any positioning of children elements would be in relation to the absolute parent

15221077
int	chars
the last line calls a function which can write multi_array s of any dimension and any standard number type int chars floats etc

15221099
viewdidload	viewdidappear
edit for storyboards move the code to viewdidappear - viewdidload is called before the view is visible and therefore no view controller is selected yet

entities	entitymanager
i m trying to generate entities from existing tables in database i keep getting the same error in a particular entity which is imported from a second database or entitymanager but i re-created this table in main database to use the same entitymanager and get the same error so i m lost about what is happening

15221155
django	web2py
so if i have to develop a web ui to display the stats how do i get the instance of that class which is running as an separate desktop app and display the stats in web which i would be using web2py or django

15221182
multiplying	add
the idea of the normalized cross correlation is that the similarity doesn t change if you add an arbitrary number to every pixel or multiplying every pixel by an arbitrary non-negative number

15221182
multiplying	add
multiplying this by 0 and add 91 - and you have a perfect match

15221182
multiplying	add
then you get more or less a similarity measure that doesn t change if you add an arbitrary number to every pixel or multiplying every pixel by an arbitrary non-negative number unless that number is very close to 0

15221209
hide	show
but despite the show and hide methods are working my own requestshow and requesthide methods were not called

15221225

i have a very unusual issue with tfs2012 we ve just migrate across domain and upgrade from tfs2010 to tfs2012

15221256
tabs	tabpanel
i saw on richfaces showcase that the best way to use rich tabpanel with dynamic tabs is with a4j repeat but this doesn t work in my application

15221265
google-chrome	firefox
i am forced to use both mootools and jquery and know the slick-uniqueid in htm atributes is from moo don know if it may be the same who edits the doctype but im sure it happens in ie browsers only google-chrome and firefox just work ok

15221267
subtraction	addition
here two extra operations addition and subtraction will be done for every number in the array

15221279
post	put
should probably put all of this into a blog post somewhere but i don t keep a blog

15221289
textview	imageview
the problem is that now all imageview and textview that have not a specified background get the app background and not the background of parent layout for example

15221296
cpu	irq
in source kernel irq proc.c 418 we can see that the counters of every interrupt gets extracted from global counters via kstat_irqs_cpu irq cpu

15221297
getter	setter
you re calling the lek property recursively in both the setter and the getter

15221320
button	checkbox
once i tap to check any of my listview items checkbox a delete button should appear

if i uncheck all checkbox the delete button should disappear

15221320
button	checkbox
problem is i have a delete button in my activity that should be visible gone whenever there is at least one checkbox checked or none.

15221379
treemap	linkedhashmap
linkedhashmap for order of additionn put and treemap interface sortedmap for order of keys

15221399
highcharts	highstock
it is possible to use inverted highcharts with datagrouping it of course requires highstock in files but just create chart using highcharts.chart

15221414

your two intermediate values are also unsigned or natural in the integer world

15221456
debian	linux
i am using linux debian

15221684
width	height
you image s actual width and height are overriding things

15221684
width	height
the browser will adjust an img element s dimensions to match that of the actual image once it s downloaded it and can tell what they are if no width and height are specified as attributes of the img or in the css.

15221684
width	height
with a normal div rather than an image you could reset the width and height back to auto if they were being set somewhere else but auto for an image takes you back to the actual image dimensions

15221684
width	height
if you just wanted the image to match the size of the container a 100 width height would fix things but that s not going to work if you want a different size implied by fixed positioning

15221686
post	get
using get params only with post request

15221710
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you can set the upload_max_filesize property to whatever value you want within either php.ini .htaccess or even httpd.conf

15221728
google-chrome	firefox
please view this page in google-chrome and then in ie9 firefox

15221728
google-chrome	firefox
as you can see if you view the code at the top in ie firefox the thumbnail images does not downsize the way they do in google-chrome

15221738
filesystems	hfs+
nsbundle is case-sensitive even if the underlying hfs+ filesystems is only case-preserving

15221745
knitr	latex
r and latex ... can be easily combined using sweave or knitr

15221810
put	get
and to send mms.how to get uri to put to intent or how to send the image attachment

15221814
width	height
put the img tag in a div give the image 100 width and height and then absolute position the container div

15221829
cout	cin
which leaves std cin std cout and std cerr

15221833
width	height
see the the div div#ipsko does not has its own height and width so it inherit its parent height and width

15221833
width	height
but the image has its own height and width

15221833
width	height
so you have to specify the height and width of image to make in fit in the div

15221906
for-loop	arrays
at the moment i have a for-loop creating the tiles and i was going to give a value to an arrays for every addition to the for-loop to give each tile an independant arrays value but i ve tested around and can t figure out how to do this

15221934
profiling	instrumentation
the problem i m facing is that i don t know whether i can trust the xamarin studio profiling when the xs profiling says something different to the instrumentation profiling

15221957
for-loop	loops
other answers have already given you the code you need to iterate though a string using a while loops or a for-loop but i thought it might be useful to explain the difference between the two types of loops

15221957
for-loop	loops
knowing that you can make a for-loop using only a while loops and a counter and knowing that you can access individual characters by index it should now be easy to access each character one at a time using a while loops

15222005
stdout	stderr
one of the simplest ways is to use the -cs command line flag - which tells the three standard filehandles stdin stdout and stderr to deal with utf8

15222089
google-chrome	firefox
when i try to accessing . test.html#page2 using both firefox and google-chrome it is expected to change to page1

15222106
instances	transient
when the casevisualimpairmentcauses contains value it returns the error object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing

15222132
inherited	subclassing
the specification iso iec 14882-2011 only requires static_cast to pointer to member of base if the base is not inherited virtually but in microsoft compiler it does not work even if the base class only has linear inherited but the subclassing has multiple inherited and the base is non-first

15222150
width	height
since you made your boundaries container to be absolute you can stretch it using its top left right bottom value and also width and height

15222186
uitableview	uisearchbar
in viewwillappear i have added uisearchbar as my headerview of uitableview

15222186
uitableview	uisearchbar
when view loads i hides uisearchbar under uinavigationbar using contentoffset of uitableview

15222209
rvm	bundler
if you use bundler you dont need rvm at all - rubygem itself supports multiple versions of single gems

15222249
hide	show
i would ditch the write a couple of functions to show hide my loader image and use the following hooks

15222254
google-chrome	firefox
i m using firefox 15.0 google-chrome version 21.0.1180.89 on ubuntu 12.04 x86_64

subtraction	addition
my question is how i can do operations like addition and subtraction with tbookmark object

15222344
getter	setter
this my getter and setter methods

15222435
width	margin
in css margin 0 auto let the center div fill the remainderï¼œ and width of the center div must be given

15222437
fadein	fadeout
i know you can fadein and fadeout on mouseover but i was just wondering how to do it when you add the background image to the css

15222441
google-chrome	firefox
this works just fine in google-chrome firefox but fails in ie 9

15222462
post	get
i have seen many post about tinymce and ajax but i could not get it working - not by triggering tinymce.triggersave

15222464
d3.js	raphael
d3.js is much harder to learn than raphael but in both cases you will also have to learn svg to be able to create better animations

15222464
d3.js	raphael
on the other hand normally d3.js visualizations need less mathematics than the similar processing or raphael examples because there are many prepackaged layouts already

15222464
d3.js	raphael
as it stands d3.js is not just better than raphael and processing in many cases but is also a viable replacement for jquery underscore.js and other frameworks

15222506
width	height
try to define a grid row or column and set the height width to so it will use as much space it can

15222528
translation	localization
in my current project .net windows forms application i have a requirement that the .net windows forms should be localized but the localization elements just the translation not the images or control positions should come from the database in order to enable the end users to modify the control localizable properties just the caption text as they wish

15222688
apache	nginx
you can run multiple sites using nginx analogous to an apache vhost

15222735
post	get
yeah i don t think this would be possible yet given html is stateless there s no way the server can post back to the clients as the clients only get responses to their own requests from the server

15222801
cos	sin
rotating a set of coordinates a little at a time for instance will give you imperfect results since the errors introduced by each rotation operation using sin and cos values that are unlikely to have perfect float representations will accumulate over time

15222826
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome and firefox too

15222838
width	height
because the nature of canvas element width and height need be used in pixel

15222885
width	height
i am also planning on creating another column for image width image height and for alt

15222908
children	parent
as an aside in the document you give in the question the b element is index 1 in its parent s list of children and the c element is index 3 because there are whitespace-only text nodes in between one between the opening a and opening b and another between the closing b and opening c

15222973
width	height
particularly to a set width and height and screen location top left corner

15222988
post	get
you can try doing fql query to get the post like so

15223023
implements	extends
you can use implements custom formatters by extends org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.optional.junit.junitresultformatter class

15223036
htmlgenericcontrol	contentplaceholder
if you do not want to create it on the server side you can change how you cast from a htmlgenericcontrol to contentplaceholder

15223138
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
instead you should store passwords hash by a salt one way hash function like sha1 or md5

15223146
google-chrome	firefox
note firefox v18 and ie8 the only version i ve tested with will crash after about 24-30 hours of the application running but for some reason google-chrome v25 seems to do alright

15223171
getter	setter
never mind a collegue pointet out a problem with the list-properties only getter no setter and they are based on a list of the baseclass that s also used by the listclass

15223202
sorting	filtering
there are no isotope classes applied to the items within and no form of sorting or filtering works

15223229
filesystems	ntfs
i am making a drive benchmark in c on linux operating system and i have encountered a problem on ntfs filesystems

15223248
put	get
if i set height auto in the css i still get the problem but if i put height 300px for example it centers the div on the page then

15223260
maven	pom.xml
in this case 90 of the time the solution is to simply update maven s pom.xml to point to the new version

15223261
subtract	add
since basiccalculations takes a single argument of type string it cannot be used to directly invoke your methods add subtract etc

15223283
hide	show
hi i know how to hide the values in textbox as show above but no idea how to hide values similarly in the picklist.if anyone have any idea please guide me

put	get
first find paragraphs then for each paragraph get out all the text with another xpath query and concatenate them without new lines and put two new lines just at the end of the paragraph

15223367

this works fine when i put it in a script and source it but when i put that function in a package install it and try to use it i get

15223386
folder	directory
here is the directory structure of the folder i use as a project

15223448
width	height
if you have a static height and width of your container you can do it with css only

15223465
int	chars
the bits can be represented in any way for example an int array of length n with values 0 or 1 or a chars array of length n with values 0 or 1 etc it doesn t really matter

15223539
portrait	landscape
that works perfectly in portrait and landscape mode as well

15223554
maven	m2e
to solve some long-standing issues m2e 1.0 requires explicit instructions what to do with all maven plugins bound to interesting phases see m2e interesting lifecycle phases of project build lifecycle

15223554
m2e	pom.xml
we call these instructions project build lifecycle mapping or simply lifecycle mapping because they define how m2e maps information from project pom.xml file to eclipse workspace project configuration and behaviour during eclipse workspace build

15223554
m2e	pom.xml	maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml
project build lifecycle mapping configuration can be specified in project pom.xml contributed by eclipse plugins and there is also default configuration for some commonly used maven plugins shipped with m2e

15223605
for-loop	arrays
code 2 trying to convert all values in the arrays battconfig to integer using for-loop

15223695
datalist	repeater	gridview	repeater	gridview	datalist
when binding data to a datalist gridview repeater its easier to just create as list of objects and bind that to the control

15223753
getter	setter
specifically they use the getter and setter

15223753
getter	setter
5 is direct access -- it does not use the getter setter

15223770
freemarker	velocity
there is a comparison between freemarker and velocity here

15223812
width	height
stackpane will get the current avaliable width and height automatically

15223825
int	chars
you need phone number which will never be contained by an int as its size is always be greater than 4 bytes and also it contains some special chars like +

15223938

15223979
curlpp	libcurl
i am using curlpp as a wrapper for libcurl

15224034
getter	setter
though i don t like much this solution because getter is supposed to return value symmetrically setter is supposed to set it and the convention usually requires specific prototypes

15224142
setcontentview	findviewbyid
write your code after setcontentview because you use findviewbyid for madview

15224168

15224596
multiplying	multiplication
you are most likely going to need to define you re own multiplication method for this operation or overload the operator to perform this depending on which fields in the point object you intend to multiplying the floating point number by

15224596
multiplying	multiplication
where the floating_point_field is the member of the class that you want to multiplying and it should also be of the same type as float otherwise you ll have to start doing something more involved to define the multiplication

15224616
post	get
converting the post to a get silently

the key point is that the qgraphicsellipseitem has a width of 320 and a height of just 5

15224761
base-class	subclassing
i ve subclassing qgraphicsellipseitem and put a large amount of padding around the base-class s bounding rect something like

15225422
width	height
the ms-viewport rule according to msdn doesn t support the setting of properties other than width or height

15225422

so you may have to use a combination of the meta tag and the ms-viewport rule but just override the width and height each time using media queries for the different layouts

15225477

15225750
shadowing	named
the question that is sometimes asked is why not adding a way to explicitly declare the scope of a variable like a let keyword thus shadowing other variables with the same named in enclosing scopes or make always introduce a new variable in that scope and have something like to assign variables from enclosing scopes without declaring one in the current scope

15225750
shadowing	named
because even if shadowing would be allowed it would be very confusing to have two variables with two different meanings with the same named one in an inner scope and one in an enclosing scope

implements	extends
this will help to understand extends v s implements thread

15226278
implements	extends
when you implements runnable you can save a space for your class to extends any other class in future or now

15226278
implements	extends
however one significant difference between implements runnable and extends thread is that by extends thread each of your threads has a unique object associated with it whereas implements runnable many threads can share the same object instance

15226278
implements	extends
when there is a need to extends a superclass implements the runnable interface is more appropriate than using the thread class

15226278
implements	extends
because we can extends another class while implements runnable interface to make a thread

15227009
pull	push
i have a need for clients to access via ftp sftp to push and pull files xml csv edi etc

15227043
children	parent
if you don t store in advance the index of the current node in respect to it s siblings though you can only search all the nodes of the parent in order to find the next sibling which essentially doubles the amount of work to be done for each node you don t just loop through the children but also through the siblings

15227081

if you are using google-chrome or firefox then you can view this error message by hitting control-shift-j

15227139

once that ajax call returns it fires a function that sets up the images as draggable and the two divs #imgbrowser and #imgqueue as droppable and #imgqueue also as a sortable

15227139
draggable	droppable
the problem i have is that the draggable droppable overrides the sortable when trying to sort the #imgqueue

15227490
google-chrome	safari
therefore i d prefer answers that work with google-chrome over safari

15227492
networkstream	sslstream	tcpclient	networkstream	tcpclient	sslstream
if the server does have a certificate an sslstream is setup and an insecure connection is made from a client when the first message is received from that client the code does correctly detect the sslstream is not authenticated and switches to the networkstream of the tcpclient

15227492
networkstream	sslstream
i guess the other solution is since the dropped bytes problem is only with the first message from the client after that i know whether to use it as a sslstream or a networkstream would be to handle that first message by directly calling the read method of restartablestream temporarily blocking the code then for all future messages use the async callbacks to read the contents as i do now

15227502
clang	llvm
if you would like to study compiler optimization and are agnostic to the compiler then take a look at the clang llvm projects

15227502
clang	llvm
clang is a c compiler that can output llvm ir and llvm commands can apply specific optimization passes individually

15227540

in the dynamic web projects in eclipse i import the jar files that i require by simply copying them to the lib folder in the web_inf directory

15227540
folder	directory
however with google app engine even after copying the jar files to lib folder of web_inf directory for a new web application i am still getting errors while importing libraries

15227576
portrait	landscape
even if i start in landscape then move to portrait for step 1 and go through the process it all works fine

15227588
nsstring	nsdata
perhaps it could be bridged to nsdata first and only then turned into nsstring with the appropriate constructor

15227636
switching	screens
so right now i have an app that displays a menu when its in 30 mode and when you click a button on the menu a popup informs you that it needs to switching to a full view in order to display the page the user selected to do this it offers a full screens button and a cancel button

15227662
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome apparently will propagate a click event up the chain to the next element however ie will not

15227683
width	height
in the loop you increase the width of pixel by pixel until the height no longer exceeds container height

15227725
implements	extends
i would like to broadcast data that this thread puts in the context however i m confused what class i would have to extends where i can implements servletcontextattributelistener

15227745

method which does some stuff with the parent and its children so i can t remove the notice this line here line

15227767
children	parent
this is how the children are declared in the parent

15227779
int	double
with your code as written in the true case you are computing a double converting that to an int converting the int to a text node wrapping that in a document node passing the document node as the parameter having this atomized to untyped atomic at the receiving end because the expected type is atomic then having the untyped atomic value converted to an int

15228053
put	get
i put the printf there hoping to get a hint

15228056
width	height
you can use jquery javascript and checking the client vs the scroll height keep increasing the width until it fits the text similar to the below

15228056
width	height
height and width and adjusts accordingly

15228081
width	height
right now the image stays the same width and height regardless of window size

15228092

to get the spell checking working i had to put

15228134
hash	salt
they then want us to pass the generated salt along with the hash security key which becomes known as the secret in the url

15228134
hash	salt
my understanding is the third party web app would then use the security key and hash it with the salt provided in the url to see if it matches the secret passed along in the url

15228147
screens	mdpi
i ve read about the differences in screens density and most documentation states that mdpi is 320x480

15228164
cpu	affinity
i have some doubts regarding the order of setting cpu affinity and scheduling on multicore systems linux 2.6

15228164
cpu	affinity
suppose a hypothetical situation i have a process and i have set it s affinity to core1 and i suspend that process put in sleep mode in between and while it s suspended i change the cpu affinity of this process to core2

15228175
super	implements
what made me think about that point is that we re talking about overriding the readobject writeobject methods while by definition we don t override them there s no super type of our serializable objects that already implements these methods

15228185
put	get
i want to know what line i need to put above some_func to allow it to get the same kind of retry treatment as my_func

15228252
screens	mdpi
mdpi 488 300 it properly fits on emulator and device screens

15228254
width	height
assuming that you have a button with id increasethem you can first find out current height and width of each child element and then iterate through them in order to increase height and width of each of them by 10px

15228266
put	get
if you want to get say ten random numbers just put that in a for-loop

15228272
rtp	rtsp
i m trying to work with the managed media aggregation c# library to handle a rtsp rtp stream from a freebox set top box

15228272

it works but the problem is iis thinks phrasecat is a real directory so all included files javascript css images do not get included because phrasecat folder does not exist and so everything is garbled

15228348
textview	imageview
i had to do this myself not too long ago and i did it with a relativelayout with an imageview of the cart icon and a textview for the numbers with a 9-patch badge as the background

15228348
textview	imageview
the trick is to align your number textview to the left and bottom of your cart icon imageview and then use the left and bottom margins to push your number badge to the top and right of your cart icon

15228376
free	malloc
local variables are out of scope when you leave the function so you need to do something else such as use a dynamic array via adding malloc free calls

15228381
getter	setter
i have assumed that these methods live in the class on which you want to invoke the getter setter and that fields is a of field names

15228400
post	get
i have tried even using post instead of get but i still get 200

15228412
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
my approach works perfectly for everything that goes through the fileoutputstream writing but it does not work for fileinputstream reading

15228440
google-chrome	safari
i m not sure but i m guessing that still won t work simply because a web app isn t native to whatever device you re viewing it on and the app you re actually in is a browser eg google-chrome safari ect and those are almost certainly going to have different orientations enabled regardless of what your web app is doing

15228454
free	malloc
also don t forget that the caller of this function becomes responsible for deallocating the memory that has been allocated by malloc the caller should call free on the returned pointer

15228467
put	get
to get what you were expecting you should put parentheses

15228549
xslt	schematron
the schematron version you make use of does not require xslt 2.0 however the file you have makes use of xslt 2.0 features

15228557
post	get
for the same exact reason you don t post your phone number emails address and citizenship id number of whatever country you are from on your stackoverflow profile just to get this answer

15228564
width	height
if you are setting the width or height of a listview to wrap_content it will cause this issue

15228564
width	height
setting the width or height of a listview to wrap_content will cause it to measure the first 3 items and base its dimensions off of those

15228572
portrait	landscape
then if they are equal set it to portrait else set it to landscape

15228597
google-chrome	firefox
i got an example when google-chrome html5 failed to play video but it was playing fine in firefox flash

15228602
shadowing	named
it s much easier to reason about your code if a local variable named has a single value within the entire lexical scope and shadowing is forbidden

15228623
try-catch	exception-handling
also try wrapping method with try-catch with most general exception-handling catch and seeing if it catches anything.

15228629

it works indeed as described but the article on msdn misses to emphasize that it only works if the children are loaded into the context as well not only the parent entity

i recently installed ssl certificate for my wordpress site http to https and now i m unable to access wordpress admin

15238315
ssl	https

15238334
folder	directory
you need to set each of the .resx files copy to output directory property to copy if newer or copy always. if you don t change this property for any of the .resx files in an app_localresources folder the entire folder won t show up in your resulting cloud service package and it won t appear in the project csx debug roles rolename approot bin folder when you debug locally either

but you can always use the other way to get at the bits put the float into a union with an array of bytes

edit it turns out if you re requiring rspec rails it will automatically bring in the correct capybara stuff for you

15253235
rspec	capybara

though an interface could ask subclassing to implements state it might be more convenient to use an abstract superclass to hold the state

15255262
next	except
it s a description of an individual and not a parameter to the next iteration except indirectly as it influences selection

15255266
accessor	properties
sidenote _myprop makes you access the properties directly while self.myprop will call accessor

15255279
screens	tablet
so for example on large tablet screens i would use layout-sw720dp and on medium tablet i would use layout-sw600dp

15255279
portrait	landscape
if you need different layout structures for portrait and landscape then you could for example add a folder for layout-sw720dp-land and layout-sw720dp-port

15255280
hash	salt
the problem is that the password_login will not work because when it is hash and the salt is added it adds a different salt

15255287
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome but seems to fail in internet explorer

15255309
width	height
with width 32px and height 20px

15255329
pop-up	dialog

15255550
google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to understand the behavior of code execution order in iframes and it seems to be different in firefox and google-chrome

15255550
google-chrome	firefox
the creation manager function is used to trace the order of execution and to uncover the difference in handling the order in firefox ie compared to google-chrome

15255550
google-chrome	firefox
basically in google-chrome the script in the iframe is executed in the stack of the creation manager call while in firefox ie it is executed after the creation manager call is completed

15255550
google-chrome	firefox
so my question is why is this different and is there a way to make google-chrome behaves like firefox and ie in this scenario

15255551
children	parent
however each child still has open the parent side of the pipes for all of the previous children

15255556
post	get
on the get post conversion if i understand your scenario correctly you are experiencing a classic http redirection issue

15255556
ssl	https
when hitting the ssl security constraint with an non-ssl request the server sends the client a http 302 response also known as a redirect to an https url

15255556
post	get
the implementation of this redirect is not exactly the same on all client http stacks but basically most of the time the redirection is handled by issuing a get whatever the original http verb was post or other

15255556
post	get
and http post request receives a 302 should the redirect-request be a get

15255556
post	get
the sad conclusion is that you can not count on the post nature of your original request to be preserved when a http to https in your case redirection is sent it will depend on the browser and there are many browsers that will issue a get whatever the redirection status code 302 307 and the likes

15255579
filtering	grouping
i am trying to filtering models in django given a substring of its attribute grouping

15255585

i have an unsigned integer

15255692
post	get
which i saw on another post on stack overflow but i wasn t sure on how to get separate bits out of the byte

15255729
rss	feed
then the view will display all of the rss feed and playable videos

15255739
client-side	server-side
since you re tracking this server-side in the session object you probably don t need to pass the value from the client-side anyway

15255744
direct3d	gdi
firstly wm_paint is for gdi painting not direct3d rendering

15255761
post	get
this is the post value which i get successfully

15255811
children	parent

this 2nd one un groups the parent from the children

15255817
int	boolean
strtotime is failing returning a boolean false which is seen as int 0 and translated to the unix epoch midnight jan 1 1970

15255861
post	get
i would post the code but you can just view source on the link to get a better idea

15255909
unsigned	short	integer	unsigned
in this declaration -5u is converted to unsigned short by the means of integer conversion c99 6.3.1.3p2 applies here and becomes a large value

15255909
unsigned	short
b value is then unsigned short unsigned int ushrt_max + 1 -5 which is unsigned short 65531 if ushrt_max is unsigned short 65535

15255927
folder	directory
place it in webapps folder in your tomcat directory

15255934
versioning	upgrade
we recently upgrade perl from 5.8.4 to 5.16.1 cgi versioning 3.59

15255950
public	protected
you will need to get the graphics instance from somewhere though as the graphics constructor is protected rather than public and the class itself is abstract

15255956
unsigned	short
short to unsigned short is a conversion thus having conversion rank

15255959

15255986
express	node.js
i recently started with node.js express and mongodb myself and it s true the resources out there are mostly outdated

15255993
post	get
i know http exposes get since it s such a frequently used method in the words of the authors of node up and running but i do not know why there is not a similar post method

15256009
unsigned	short
now when putting that in b it is truncated to an unsigned short 2 bytes usually so b 65531 which is 2 16-5

15256044
post	put
also if they do post then why not put and delete and etc

15256044
put	get
likely they put in the get wrapper and then thought there was no reason to keep doing that in the core

15256075

15257253
for-loop	arrays
edit2 - if you look at the following comparison you can see if we use a for-loop to push the incoming arrays into group the result is identical to the solution provided by corey but if we run the splice methods on both of those - the results are very different example 2 is getting spliced correctly - example 1 is getting spliced entirely that is where i am confused

15277645
freemarker	velocity

i would ideally like all the switching between screens to be smooth and all happen within the same frame

currently you are not defining height and width for linearlayout in both list_item.xml and list_item1.xml layouts

15278037
background-image	background-position	background-image	background-size	background-position	background-size
you are only re-defining background-image but you there is two additional css attributes that you need to redefine background-position and background-size since it is defined in kendo ui css files for offsetting k-i-arrow-s icon

15278063
pull	push
if you have multiple workers that do work on the same messages for performance you d want to create an intermediate worker that subscribes to that specific message type and binds a push socket where workers of the same type will connect to that intermediate worker also called a router with pull sockets

15278078
getter	setter
since your property getter and setter are trivial i suggest to implement it as auto property like

15278084
jar	war
the second scenario is where i have separated the aspect into its own project and compiled it into a jar file using i ve tried both ajc and ajdt and included the jar file in my war web-inf lib folder

15278084
jar	war
why would this work when the source is compiled with the war file but when it is included as a jar file in the class path it does not work at all

15278093
int	chars
i was thinking i could iterate through the string and for each chars convert to an int and add to array would this work

but the file_field call below results in the following error on google-chrome works on firefox and ie

15278304
width	height
it s width is variable in the same way an average div s height would be variable on a conventional site

15278304
margin	height	width	margin	width	height
the problem is that when i use percentage padding margin on my div.area it calculates the percentage based on the width of the div as opposed to the height even when setting padding-top for example

15278308
qbytearray	qvector
there are ways around that but you will find it much easier to just put your data into a container such as qbytearray or qvector rather than a raw array

15278323
matplotlib	scipy
i couldn t find such function rgb_to_hsv in scipy or matplotlib s documentations and google doesn t show pointers except activestate recipe which demonstrates rgb2hsv function though not usable on numpy array as is

15278330
rss	feed
looks like i can get the rss feed by doing this

15278385
put	get
this is simply demo code i put together because i wasn t able to get my markup to work when it was nested

15278469
google-chrome	firefox
if i go to a page using google-chrome or firefox not selenium the page works perfectly

15278484
hide	show
i can hide show a layer but i can t colorize just a part of it

15278493
width	height
the w3c standards dictate that any percentages for paddings and margins are a percentage of the element s width not height

15278493
margin	height
displacement from top by 50 css only and then offset by negative top margin that is half of the element s own height js-based calculation

15278495
getter	setter
this didn t really work so i tried putting the getter and setter in the registerbean and setting them to this format

15278502
getter	setter
in eclipse juno by default alt+shift+s r opens the getter setter dialog box

15278512
post	get
i faced a parameter encoding issue when submitting a form with the get method i can t use the post method

15278538
stdout	stderr
starting a process with inherited stdin stdout stderr in java 6

15278603
hmac	md5
instead it s a hmac md5 of the dict that you re sending in to your data parameter in your ajax call

15278631
children	parent
each node contains an opening tag value and closing tag all stored as string s plus relations to parent and children

15278679
getter	setter
eclipse s generate entities from tables... jpa code generator insists on creating an id field and associated getter setter methods despite the fact that these are defined in the superclass i designate in the wizard steps

15278679
getter	setter
as an example to delete the getter setter lines i have tried

15278728
google-chrome	firefox
this is for a firefox greasemonkey google-chrome plugin

15278749
aggregate-functions	sum
i need no aggregate-functions count sum etc. just a listing once per item

15278783
width	height
however top paddings when defined in percentages will be a percentage of the element s width and not height

15278783
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box	width	height	height	border-box
this can be circumvented by using box-sizing border-box which tells the browser to render the element as defined by the width and height attributes inclusive of all borders and paddings

15278783
width	height
more importantly top position offset percentages are based on the parent s height not width unlike padding

15278801
width	height
the text is adding fine and the field is scrolling fine when i add extra text but as soon as i an to it the image shows up but the fields inner height the overflow part does not adjust for the so i can t scroll down to see the rest of the image i even added a width and height but to no aval

15278838
range	max
think you re over thinking the array a bit you could key by max value in each range it s a little less data and less to evaluate but in all honesty it seems like a micro optimisation

15278862
children	parent
the problem is that killing the parent doesn t kill the children

15278866
post	get
i guess i could do this using a get steps one and two and a post step 3 but i m hoping for something a little more elegant because that includes a lot of bookkeeping on the server side a cookie per request or something etc

15278878
jms	jta
likely a database is used besides jms or another destination at which point you need xa-transactions and jta in other words an application server

15278885
width	height
percent only works for the width of an element but height 100

15278891
vbo	vao
i tried to study more about the vao and the vbo throught tutorials and the opengl wiki but so far i didn t fully understand how it works and how it should be used properly

15278911
pull	push
so you ll have to pull to your local machine and move some commits to a new branch in hg then push to your bitbucket

15278930
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
edit 2 i tried to use getelementsbytagname and getelementsbyclassname instead of getelementbyid

15278933
google-chrome	firefox
this is not an issue when using firefox and google-chrome

15278994
getter	setter
so is both a getter and setter in one so you can do

15279010
aggregate-functions	sum
when you use an aggregate-functions like sum the query is bound to return a row

15279032
width	margin
if you want to stop the contents from the right from flowing left underneath the left menu simply assigned a float to #main-view or use a padding that is equivalent to the width plus right margin of #main-menu

15279114
websphere	ibm
i have a java ee 5 application ibm rad websphere 7.5 oracle 11

15279159
google-chrome	firefox
this differences occur also when comparing selenium-2-chrome - google-chrome browser and selenium-2-firefox - firefox browser

15279185
post	get
the goal would be to get back the array and then post certain parts of it to different jquery mobile pages

15279200
chunked	transfer-encoding
your http headers should also contain transfer-encoding chunked

15279203
hide	show
best would be to use one button to show and hide the cells using jquery .toggle

15279243
getattr	setattr
you want getattr not setattr

15279243
getattr	setattr
where setattr is a way to set an attribute if you know it s name getattr is a way to get an attribute if you know it s name

15279257
super	implements
i want to implements the aes techniques in java for android application i search out many tutorial for this but that was not super

15279274

15279290
equals	compareto
note that compareto will return value 0 if the argument date is equals to this date

15279365
mouse	joystick
one potential solution for coding the joystick pygame is reasonably well-suited to draw an image take mouse input and move the joystick head to follow the mouse

15279381
getter	setter
some java classes need to have private properties with a public getter and setter in order to function properly

15279381
getter	setter
if it wasn t for those libraries there are probably some properties which should not have any getter and definitely not setter

15279396
put	get
or you ll need to get the zip file and put the new browser files in app_browsers manually

15279397
post	get
the short summary is that if a client browser expects to get an auth challenge it might omit the post body on a request for performance reasons until the server issues an authentication challenge

15279401
ant	maven
this looks short when you build your project from an ant maven script

15279426
converter	multibinding
you must specify converter in multibinding

15279480
mp4	h.264
the standard mp4 container format is commonly used for both aac audio and h.264 video + aac audio

15279513
ada	pascal
ada is not a superset of pascal

15279513
ada	algol
ada was instead a new language designed from scratch that borrowed from algol 60 s syntax in much the way that java borrows from c s syntax

15279513
ada	pascal
so asking for a pascal flag in your ada compiler is much like asking for a c++ flag in your java compiler

15279532
post	get
it seems like there should be a way to force wordpress to get the category after the query_posts so that it realizes what category it s on and will then display only the relevant post

15279534
post	get
first i m posting the data which works then on a successful post i m trying to make a seperate call a get request that request contains the callback which is supposed to alert me of the result however because it makes a 2nd call and it sends a get request the variable post is never set and therefore there is nothing to get back

15279621
post	get
i know this has been asked and answered a million times over but each solution seems to be a little different and i can t seem to get any of the scores of post i ve read to work for me

15279621
firefox	safari
it looks great in firefox looks crap in safari

15279627
mouseleave	mouseenter
it triggers functions on mouseenter and mouseleave

15279665
keyevent	onkeydown
since you are handling the key events yourself you should be returning true on the onkeydown implementation - otherwise the system may swallow your keyevent

15279667
hide	show
firstly you need to remove the show hide components of the first function and then create a button instead of using the hyperlink reference

15279670
min	max
if you re using xslt 2.0 you have min and max functions which do the work for you

15279697
children	parent
as you observe invalidity propagates upward so that if the parent root element has invalid children it will also normally be invalid

15279742
getter	setter
you could hide getter and setter by using an interface that is backed by that concrete class

15279754
textview	imageview
i have defined a layout containing a textview an imageview and a button

15279754
textview	imageview
that works correctly i can see my textview then my imageview then my button but sometimes the textview is too long and i can t see my imageview and my button

15279760
inherited	subclassing
you ll need to create your own subclassing that inherited the .net list class and override the tostring method there

15279763
post	get
post get to a server endpoint

15279763
hide	show
either way you can hide show the loader with javascript

i created testing image for developing and noticed that i get different values from png and gif image

15279863

15279885
getter	setter
i would make an opaque datatype with some getter and setter

15279924
width	height
resize addcardicon.png so that it has identical width and height and doesn t have any transparent padding on any side

15279959
width	height
you need to add units to your height and width style declarations

15279964
bmp	png
now this code works perfectly for png or jpg images however when i use it for bmp images it returns an exception that says bimagefromconvert is null

15279973
width	height
you need to specify the unit for width and height

15279981
spaces	delimiter
eg for 8-15 18 31-32 paste into a cell say a1 and data data tools - text to columns delimiter next check comma spaces and treat consecutive delimiter as one next select columns as required select text for each finish

15280008
udp	tcp

15280008
udp	tcp
tcp vs udp

15280027
profiler	pstats
i was trying to run a profiler on some handler code up on appspot and was looking for a way to show the pstats output without writing directly to the response body which is problematic for handlers responding with structured data such as json

15280053
width	height
this also has other implications such as it may have that ever so slight yet annoying effect where the viewport s page height will trigger the display of the scrollbar decreasing the width of the page just enough to be noticeable but only when the dropdown is visible

15280057
int	chars
would define a type for an int 2 chars and a float

15280093
mouseleave	mouseenter
i saw this so page menu mouseenter mouseleave click which may be a good start but cannot wrap my head around the implimentation

15280147
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the above function works well in google-chrome opera firefox ie9

15280165
printf	strlen
that is entirely pointless since in the cases where a precision for the printf would be necessary the strlen call will do the same invalid memory accesses

15280222
verilog	vhdl
i m developing a description of a bist engine and i ve been asked by my manager to transition from verilog to vhdl

15280233
icmp	tcp	icmp	udp	udp	tcp
icmp hole punching udp hole punching and tcp hole punching respectively use internet control message user datagram and transmission control protocols

15280303
serializable	deserialization
custom serializable is the process of controlling the serializable and deserialization process

15280303
serializable	deserialization
if the user wants to use custom methods during and after serializable the user should apply the custom serializable support using ondeserializedattribute ondeserializingattribute onserializedattribute and onserializingattribute attributes for customizing the data during serializable and deserialization

serializable	deserialization
it allows for updating the object before and after serializable deserialization

i m not sure if i should search for the nid of the referenced node its title or how i put it in the code whatever i try i get the print niemanic

15280469
listview	gridview
the interaction patterns that you describe are what is expected for the listview gridview controls namely

15280469
listview	gridview
the problem with the interaction pattern you re looking to add is that it fails in scenarios where the user might want to drag to rearrange the order of the items in the listview gridview think about how the start screen works

15280503
for-loop	loops
loops through your model items to put a checkbox has to be a for-loop for model binding to work

hash	md5
then it applies an md5 hash to the password and finally queries the local database to return true or false

15280597
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter and mouseleave are proprietary ms events that are actually pretty nice

15280597
mouseover	mouseout
if mydiv has no children using mouseover mouseout will have exactly the same effect

15280623
mouseleave	mouseenter
the mouseenter and mouseleave events are proprietary to internet explorer so if you aren t using ie they won t work

15280623
mouseover	mouseout
use mouseover and mouseout instead

15280623
mouseleave	mouseenter
by the way you can use mouseenter and mouseleave via jquery because jquery simulates those events for you on non-ie browsers

15280623
mouseleave	mouseenter
see this article for tips on how to simulate mouseenter and mouseleave for yourself

15280627
opera	google-chrome

15280793
folder	directory
if you use eclipse with m2e and maven-bundle-plugin you can simply sinchronize the target classes directory to the folder on your server right after saving the class as in that case manifest.mf is refreshed as well as soon as you save your .java file

15280807
width	height
old versions of ios has flexible margins and width height propertise for that

15282115
box-sizing	border-box
your #header container has a with of 100 and after that you add padding to it causing it to grow larger than 100 you could solve this with box-sizing border-box

15282232
hash	md5
i am trying to convert a user fed password into a md5 hash

15282267
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i like how in debian or ubuntu linux there is this thing apt-cache search or aptitude search that shows you which packages are already installed and which packages are potentially available for you system

15282288
post	get
this is not a question of using links it s a question of get vs post

15282316
width	height
i m simply placing it at half the width and height center rotating it by ang radians and scaling it to 4x

15282325

vb6	vba
see data type comparison between vb6 and vs2005 and how to do 64 bit in vba vb6

15282373
width	height
it looks like you haven t set a width or height on them

15282417
google-chrome	firefox
firefox vs google-chrome

15282417
width	height
not the best solution as you will have to have a fixed height and width for the but adding this could work

15282426
integer	unsigned
from my understanding size_t is an unsigned integer whose bit size is large enough to hold a pointer of the native architecture

15282428

it returns a boolean true false value never an int

15282565
vsto	add-in
i m working on a vsto add-in for outlook versions 2007-2013and minimum .net version is 4.0

15282587
gson	jackson
i am wondering if i can use java json frameworks such as jackson google gson or json.simple to read json from a different server

15282587
post	get
currently the only way i know how to do that is to use jquery to hit the server get the json back and then post that to a java utility

15282594
google-chrome	firefox
my issue is that it works everywhere else ie8 9 10 google-chrome firefox vs2008 with ie8 but in my particular case i m using visual studio 2012 and launching it from there with any browser causes a generic network error

15282617
implements	extends
additionally this example describes a method to implements jsonp in spring mvc 3.1 by extends the mappingjacksonhttpmessageconverter class and modifying the domain objects

15282631
min	max
first you need your random number and then the code for it to generate your numbers r.nextint max - min + 1 + min

15282631
min	max
this will include your min and max numbers now add this to your code

15282638
hash	md5
if you re really concerned about this you d have to precompute the same md5 on the client send it along with the uploaded file and on the server check the original md5 hash against the one paperclip computes

15282653
public	protected
they are defined by using one of the keywords public protected or private followed by a normal variable declaration

15282659
maven	pom.xml
when using jetty maven plugin the pom.xml config could like

r.js	mimosa
if r.js + requirejs is your thing and you want automated builds plus development aid help like linting minification concatenation asset compilation etc check out mimosa

15282802
google-chrome	firefox
has been working for years in firefox and google-chrome though

15282837
base	fractions
the fractions base 2 are .1 1 2 .01 1 4

15282851
filtering	grouping
the where goes before the grouping by and filtering individual rows that do or do not meet the conditions

15282875
base	fractions
decimals fractions bits in other base are surprisingly unintuitive considering they work in exactly the same way as integers

15282875
subtract	add
if we start with 45.25 that s bigger equal than 32 so we add a binary 1 and subtract 32

15282875
subtract	add
we re left with 13.25 which is bigger equal than 8 so we add a binary 1 and subtract 8

15282875
subtract	add
we re left with 05.25 which is bigger equal than 4 so we add a binary 1 and subtract 4

15282875
subtract	add
we re left with 01.25 which is bigger equal than 1 so we add a binary 1 and subtract 1

15282875
subtract	add
we re left with 00.25 which is bigger equal to 0.25 so we add a binary 1 and subtract 0.25

15282875
base	fractions
you can also do this same process with fractions 2.5 irrational pi or even imaginary 2i base except the base cannot be between -1 and 1 inclusive

15282898
base	fractions
might also be worth noting that it s quite often that the binary representation is infinite even when starting with a finite fractions part in base 10

15282903
jboss	weblogic
i am attempting to use greg to hold endpoint url s for services deployed into non-wso2 containers weblogic jboss

15282912
accessor	properties
you bind onetime against a counter properties from your viewmodel and in the get accessor of this properties you iterate the counter in addition to returning it

15282925
mouse	keyboard
so i need a solution that will have it from power on automatically run the script and be able to play the sounds with no keyboard mouse or monitor attached

15282934
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i experience the problem in both firefox ie it s fine in google-chrome safari

15282941
post	put
in your block you could put the data in a td then use the method described in this post to print the contents of that td

15282974
hide	show
unfortunately that doesn t work for me because it will just override whatever hide show i do there

15283007
button	checkbox
once they select the username from the list they need to put a check in the checkbox and then they can click the delete button

15283026
post	get
i ve managed to show the media manager dialog box but i can only see the insert into post button that does nothing anyway and when uploading images they don t get attached to the post

15283028
children	parent
that s because you asked for children that are always between the parent values

15283034
put	get
when you include a map entry key value they get automatically collected put into a hashmap and passed as the first parameter

15283064
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox - this works great

15283087
hide	show
you can see that the .inputs hide away but then after that has been done i want the settimein to execute which show my test paragraph

15283093
children	parent
inherited acls may not be active on the parent so the effective rights of the children won t match the effective rights of the parent

15283114
rspec	minitest
rspec does it with minitest unit testcase rspec matchers line 168

15283146
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
that s only working on firefox and safari but on google-chrome ie i don t have the scrollbar but if i want to go on the bottom of my tab i have to left-click to can scroll and see the botton

15283159
svg	vml
it s open source mit or gpl2 works with jquery mootools and yui and can use svg canvas or vml for rendering

15283201
super	self
it s also not really a super idea to self join a table with the condition that the primary key is not equal to itself you are essentially squaring the size of your dataset

15283223
clang	llvm
when i compile with clang -emit-llvm -s -o3 test.c gcc would also work but the llvm ir is more readable in my opinion i get

15283232
equals	gethashcode
update as chasemedallion commented and inlined in the question this approach does not provide automatically generated gethashcode and equals methods unlike tuple approach

15283255
profiling	instrumentation
start your code in a profiling mode and select the cpu time instrumentation

15283286
xslt	xquery
saxon falls short of the idealized xsd processor that michael sperberg-mcqueen describes mainly because it is designed primarily for the needs of schema-aware xslt and xquery processing which don t require all the flexibility built into the xsd spec

15283287
int	chars
specifically the issue is that the php will read only int and ignore all other chars

15283304
getter	setter
since groovy treats getter setter pairs as a property you would use it like a real link

15283309
fadein	fadeout
that way it will be triggered right away preventing a nice fadein effect after the fadeout

15283312
portrait	landscape
at storyboard or by code set wantsfullscreenlayout flag to yes to both portrait and landscape uinavigationcontrollers

15283333
apache	nginx
it may be a wsgi server such as gunicorn or a real web server such as nginx or apache

15283333
apache	nginx
if you are running a reverse proxy such as nginx or apache you can bind static to a path in the filesystem and the rest of the traffic to pass through to django

15283335
vbscript	jscript
or use scriptcontrol that allow running vbscript from within jscript or backward opposite

15283388
pop-up	dialog
for instance my help dialog pop-up with

15283436
addclass	removeclass
i think you are using the addclass and removeclass from the standard jquery api

15283436
google-chrome	firefox
i checked out your site you are linking and even after using your exact forhover css it still works in latest google-chrome firefox and ie10

15283454
folder	directory
what i ve decided to do is just install the package and then look at the directory in the packages folder to determine what version i just installed

15283456
prepare	execute
when you execute a prepare statement you will get a output result

15283466
width	height
since that was the case there is no way you could have actually set the width or height of the image--you were just setting or trying to the width and height of the window

15283466
width	height
setting the width and height of the window wasn t even working in your example code because you didn t break the variable out of the string

15283466
width	height
width 450px height 600px resize 1

15283466
width	height
width largeimage.style.width height largeimage.style.height resizable 1

15283484
hide	show
and when you want to hide or show cell ask to reload it

15283489
folder	directory
i would ftp into your site with no initial directory set in your ftp client and make note of which folder you navigate into

15283507
width	height
elsewhere in your site s own stylesheet it s suggested you could set a height and a width of 1em and set display to block like so.

15283511
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
firefox and opera lag a bit google-chrome has it especially bad 1 frame of animation takes approx

15283518
atoi	strtok
next you can use strtok to separate the string into an array of strings omittied the separator which is in your case the comma then pass the array members to atoi

15283532
margin	text-align
i ve stripped all of the extra margin autos and text-align centers away to make this clearer

15283546
quicksort	shellsort
i m just trying to test this shellsort program vs quicksort built into the standard library

15283582
folder	directory
assuming that git is the root directory of your git repository and each user has a directory in that folder this will work for you

15283582
folder	directory
but if you are following a more traditional model you could link to a folder git in each user s home directory

15283584
int	chars
so int charmap.t would be a map from chars s to int s

15283602
ssl	https
what travis said is true for a ssl session and if the websocket used the same connection as the https document fetch then it would be correct to answer no

15283607
int	double
so that whether int long or double was given a long int long long or long double would be returned from multiply

15283613
int	chars
you said that you have to use a line of text separated by commas but you ve actually declared a chars array containing ten binary int

15283659
public	protected
if it were possible to make adjustments to source a class extension declared in a separate header file and #imported in both the class1 implementation and the class2 implementation file would be the way because then you can share not only private methods but also instance variables marked public or protected this way

15283659
implements	extends
briefly a class extension is a bit like a category sometimes called a private category but it can only be declared in the same compilation unit where the class it extends is implements and it can declare and auto-synthesize properties and instance variables

15283677
qtreeview	qabstractitemview
thanks to this thread i m able to add widgets to 2nd or later column of qabstractitemview in my example qtreeview of top level items of a view

15283684
haskell	agda
it is possible in other languages with type-class like constructs scala agda but it is not possible in haskell

15283686
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	mouseleave	mouseenter
you may use mouseleave and mouseenter also with adddomlistener the problem is that these events are not supported by all major browsers they should work in ie firefox and opera but fail in google-chrome and safari

15283695
width	height
the toolbar probably should be set to be 100 width and use only the height it needs and the grid should use all width and all height and width 1.0

15283695
implements	extends
either extends resizecomposite to get that notification or implements requiresresize and have that call the contentpanel s own onresize function or don t deal with composite at all but just implements iswidget and have aswidget return the contentpanel

15283720
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i have been wonder where a for-loop or a for..in loops would be farther on an arrays

15283747
int	chars
trying convert a chars to int to get the ascii value of that chars in most cases i get correct expected ascii code for particular chars in some cases i don t

15283754
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
basically what all i want to do is to query a local sqlite db for existing value of username and password + salt with md5 hash

15283763
mono	xamarin.android
i have to have mono compatibility because this is to be used on xamarin.android monodroid and monotouch as well in a mono server and then .net desktop applications

15283788
cpu	affinity
cpu time contention if the threads are scheduled onto the same core probably not your issue if you re setting affinity

15283811
x86	64bit
running a any cpu app on a windows 7 x64 machine will default to the 64bit x64 clr common language runtime unless you explicitly tell it to run in 32 bit x86 mode

15283811
x86	64bit
most likely the reason it is working on your xp machine is because you do not have support for a 64bit clr on that machine so it will allways run in 32bit x86 mode even though it s any cpu

15283830
typedef	struct
the problem is that you made the struct a typedef but are still qualifying it with struct

15283881
getter	setter
wpf ui controls tald directrly with the dependeny property without going through your getter and setter

15283885
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
view on top of everything uiwindow subview vs uiviewcontroller subview

15283894
inherited	properties
this statement will also go into the array prototype chain iteration through inherited properties and i think you do not need this or even do not know about this

15283894
for-loop	arrays
a for-loop will search for properties on the prototype chain too if they aren t found on the arrays

15283900
for-loop	loops
to explain why a for-loop is faster than a for in loops is basically understand the underlying data structures used to store the data in memory

15283915
typedef	struct
typedef creates a type alias which you use without the struct keyword

15283971
folder	directory
when you do a typical git clone you get a folder in the current directory with all the files found in that directory

15283999
ant	maven
if you choose to use the maven system dependency approach you may also wish to use the maven antrun plugin to embed calls to the javafx ant tasks as in this sample

15284041
jar	war
i am trying to get eclipse to recognize the war file extension as an archive type so that i can expand it and see the contents just like in a jar

15284063
linefeed	delimiter
you need to read the data from the text file then turn it into a return or linefeed delimiter list and do a repeat over the items of this list

15284106
put	get	post	get	post	put
it doesn t make sense for the server to have a consumes annotation on the get method as this is typically only used for put or post requests where the client is sending some content to the server

15284111
google-chrome	firefox
i tried a scaled down form similar to your posted form and it has worked for me in google-chrome and firefox

15284111
google-chrome	firefox
i did notice that firefox and google-chrome have different syntaxes for the path directory

15284122
width	height
when you try height and width at 100 it adds a bar on the top for the close button

15284124
rubygems	bundler
library rubygems 1.8 gems bundler-1.3.2 lib bundler rubygems_integration.rb 214 in require

15284160
switching	screens
for example would it not be possible to write code to switching screens off on or even the device s phone

15284170
punctuation	words
you can run through the resulting list change the words and then .join it back into a sentence with the same punctuation in the same places

15284178
ssl	ntlm
they are using ssl but they maybe using ntlm or anonymous authentication while my program uses basic authentication

15284185
put	get
so for example if you put the anchor for link2 somewhere inside the first fieldset you could get it to line up properly but it s not a clean practice

15284198
google-chrome	firefox
also with firefox and google-chrome

15284206
jtextfield	jlabel
now you could add the jtextfield to jpanel and add a jlabel as well and even error messages.

15284244
gson	jackson
the easiest way imo is use a json library such as gson jackson json.org etc parse de json into an object and create a new with the values of the properties you need

15284248
stdout	fflush
you might need to fflush stdout or equivalent

15284267
pop-up	dialog
it works fine but when the user clicks the download link a copy of the zip file gets copied to the root of the php folder where the php script is when the save as dialog box pop-up

15284325
children	parent
if you cancel the parent all children will be cancelled too

15284451
folder	directory
using below approach all projects are getting compiled and build folder is getting created for individual projects under each directory

15284481
portrait	landscape
in ios after dismissing a modal view controller which is being forced to only show in portrait orientation if the device is being held in landscape mode the view controller which presented the modal view controller doesn t rotate back to landscape correctly

15284481
portrait	landscape
so my subviews look like they should in landscape but the interface is in portrait mode

15284527
versioning	upgrade
some users who upgrade their ios versioning report that they can no longer use the email export in my app which uses mfmailcomposer

15284534
inherited	properties
the other answers miss out the easiest solution which is to inherited your min-height properties of the parent element

15284585
mongoid	mongomapper
i highly recommend checking out mongoid or mongomapper or just using the mongo gem itself rather than taking this approach

15284588
hide	show
i m trying to make checkboxes to hide show paragraphs but for some reason the paragraphs don t appear when i click the checkbox here is the javascript code

15284592
post	get
when i select images from particular albums like post profile photos see screenshot i m unable to get the image path in onactivityresult

15284612
versioning	upgrade
someday you ll spend hours trying to figure out why your script no longer works only to find that the upgrade versioning of your external program needs different command-line parameters and no longer works the way your code expects

15284684
folder	directory
i have a sqlite database file stored locally in the app s directory and when the app starts it is copied to the local folder and read and written to from there

15284700
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
in the for-loop a while loops was just wrong there we stored the count of the arrays once avoiding multiple calls

15284706
pull	push
i make some changes commit push he pull the changes

15284726
setinterval	settimeout
as stated here i could use settimeout or setinterval to give some time to javascript to process other events

15284726
setinterval	settimeout
i ve tested settimeout and setinterval delays on this jsfiddle and i observe the following result

15284742
hide	show
my goal was to allow users of my app to hide and show columns so i read this guide

15284743
width	height
the arrow is actually a square with width and height that is rotated 45 o

15284761
firefox	safari
it is my understanding that cookies from 3rd party domains are already rejected by safari and also will in the future for firefox

15284761
firefox	safari
the firefox safari issue was a guess so i m not a 100 sure

15284765
width	height
i know it s o v+e using bfs which is optimal i think but i m worried about the size of the intermediate queue as the graph width grows exponentially with height

15284848
put	get
here s something to get you going put this inside your .htaccess file

15284859
inherited	properties
prototypical inherited seems to confuse beginners because in classical languages if class a extends class b then all of a s properties are copied to b - this is not the case in javascript

15284893
folder	directory
now we should have a folder in the same directory with the image files in them

15284936
min	max
i m having some trouble with an algorithm to find the max and min values not the algorithm itself but the implementation let me explain

15284936
min	max
and now what i have to do is compare by pairs so since i already used n 0 i start comparing n 1 and n 2 to find the max and min values between those 2 and then compare it with y global min max values then n 3 and n 4 and compare the

15284936
min	max
but this wont work if my last element is only one as on the example above so as you can guess if the min or max is the last element on my list it will be ignored

qtablewidget along with qtreewidget etc. uses the mvc framework but it encapsulates it all to a handy package useful for most purposes but if you need to do something different you will have to crack it into it s component parts and reimplement the bits you need

set button params through constructor like buttonparams new layoutparams height width instead of setting through buttonparams.height height and so

15291111

15294934
hash	md5
1 create another field to contain hash of text value md5 text_value

serializable	deserialization
my problem now is that a very large set of data was returned for one report which threw the error error during serializable or deserialization using the json javascriptserializer

15294977
outputstream	inputstream
if you just want to pass along char data than inputstream and outputstream should do it but if you want to pass along more structured data than it will be more tricky

15294977
int	chars
i have used datainputstream and dataoutputstream for int chars and string but it was not fun and you have network by ordering issues to deal with and it is not going to be portable

15295009
qlineedit	qlabel
in it i have added a sequence of qlineedit qlabel objects

15295009
qlineedit	qlabel
currently when the no of qlineedit objects 500 qlabel objects 500 the gui is significantly slow for greater values does not operate properly

15295037
hide	show
it hide the div quite alright but it does not show them when a selection is made

15295041
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
you are using objectinputstream and objectoutputstream which are designed for java objects they can t take anything else in

15295041
outputstream	inputstream
instead use another inputstream outputstream and you should not get this problem

15295048
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this script works perfectly fine in firefox and google-chrome and on my phone so i guess safari too

15295048
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome that url just opens in a new page with a bunch of json data

15295085
portrait	landscape
and it works fine but when i rotate screen of device content view width changed fine but then when i scroll table then width of contenview get changed it take size in calculated in delegate method tableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath indexpath .one above problem and second question is after scrolling and then rotate back to portrait form from landscape width of content view get small

15295157
strlen	strcpy
anyway you need to stick to the old-school c-style functions strlen strcpy and strcat

15295159
ocp	principles
let s talk about ocp open closed principles aka the o in solid and the impression i m getting in how simpleinjector breaks this particular principles in some cases

15295209
post	put
you will need to put the code which runs the post inside your call back function and check whether you have all the data you need each time the callback function runs

15295275
portrait	landscape
still you can base your calculations for the size see point 2 based on the self.interfaceorientation you can then store those values portrait and landscape on a dictionary which will then be used by the

15295336
puts	putchar
on the other way putchar just puts one character to the output stream stdout

15295336
put	get
thus there is no buffer magic involved here you re just getting what you would expect to get a perfect copy of what has been put in stdin in stdout

15295373
hide	show
it looks like you want to show hide categories when clicking on them

15295427
autocomplete	typeahead
issue 1 i don t think its a issue because on first tab it autocomplete the typeahead and on second tab cursor goes to next field because in case if you want to change your selection then you are still on same field to make any changes like in my case i triggered an ajax request on typeahead complete and updated some field in my form if user wish to change selection then user can delete previous selection and try some new value so i think it makes to put cursor on same field

15295427
google-chrome	firefox
issue 2 i tried you js fiddle on google-chrome 24.0.1 and firefox 16.0.1 and its firing only 1 event in both cases may be your firefox version have some issue

15295509
implements	extends
all editpart s have their own adapter extends org.eclipse.emf.ecore.util.econtentadapter or implements org.eclipse.emf.common.notify.adapter

15295509
children	parent
this results in an editpart structure where nodeeditpart s are children of the grapheditpart and edgeeditpart s are orphans they have no parent

15295516
cpu	affinity
a context switch will not necessarily be avoided by setting affinity to one cpu

15295518
width	height
second you div has no size so its almost impossible to click so i added a width and height to it

15295524
portrait	landscape
it s just something that apple decided split in landscape popover in portrait

15295525

google-chrome	firefox
but i noticed that there is a nameditem method in optele var in ie and firefox but there isn t in google-chrome

15295718
implements	extends
just because you re extends the interface doesn t mean you have to add throws exception it s ok to declare your implements class as throwing less exceptions than the interface

15295718
superclass	subclassing
if you want to catch exceptions thrown by the subclassing you have to rearrange your code so that methods of the subclassing are called by the superclass otherwise the superclass doesn t have the opportunity to catch anything

15295737
width	height
i haven t set a width or height

15295754
width	height
you could add a container around your image and set overflow hidden to prevent images to get bigger than the defined width height

15295796
mongohq	mongolab
for mongodb you can use mongohq or mongolab with space 0.5 gb for free

15295803
udp	tcp
as i know ios allows only tcp connection to remain open in the background but most of the sip providers are supporting only udp

15295834
clearinterval	settimeout	setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout
i realised that in current dart sdk version 0.4.1.0_r19425 methods like settimeout setinterval cleartimeout clearinterval aren t part of window class any more and they all moved to workercontext

15295871
width	height
set the images css max-width and max-height values to the width and height values of the surrounding div

15295924
textblock	itemscontrol
i tested itemscontrol between the textblock.inlines tages but it returns textblock as default and i wasn t able to set run or inline as itemtemplate

15295939
hash	md5
there is a programs like winmd5 that scan the md5 hash for program

15295939
hash	md5
we can re-co pile the program and bam we got a new md5 hash

15295945
versioning	upgrade
which is why when you upgrade the server from an earlier versioning to 4.1 or higher you receive the authentication error message

15295948
width	height
i have set width and height for a paragraph element but text is still going outside the box instead filling up the element.example

so regardless of thread affinity the same cpu setup work has to be done whether it is the same cpu core which was used in previous slice when your thread was running or another one

15296067
solaris	bsd
i m using ubuntu and would like the code to work also on solaris and bsd

15296083
x86	64bit
this is because of the paths in the path environment variable the directory to the 32-bit program files programfiles x86 is listed before the directory path to the 64bit program files programfiles

15296105
int	chars
otherwise if your chars is signed the variadic default promotion converts the value to int and the result may be negative.

15296112
firefox	safari
did right the opposite used firefox instead of safari and the button worked

15296178

15296274
int	double
i tried with double int and long but it the same result

15296290
width	height
which looks funny if you work with an object of limited width and height zoom-in at one end zoom-out at another end and we moved forward like an inchworm

15296313
hash	md5
small changes are enough to change the md5 hash value completely md5 was designed that way

15296336
division	modulo
note that and are integer division and modulo operators

15296349
portrait	landscape
when starting an ipad master-detail application in xcode 4.6 in portrait orientation there is a dismissible menu in landscape it is always on

15296357

background-color transparency

15296439
uilabel	uitapgesturerecognizer
you need to use uitapgesturerecognizer for making uilabel clickable

15296445
free	malloc
while it s getting better in dealing with core foundation functions if you have code that is doing manual memory allocations such as via malloc and free the static analyzer may be of limited use

15296483
rss	feed
i try to create a rss feed with rome which has enclosures for a podcast

15296511
x86	64bit
both on sparc and x86 cpus solaris can run 32bit applications even if the kernel itself runs 64bit but there s no emulation shim layers that d allow you to run sparc binaries on x86 or vice versa

15296511
x86	64bit
on solaris therefore you ve got to decide whether the application needs to run on sparc and or on x86 and second whether it needs to be compiled for 32bit or 64bit

15296516
range	max	range	min	min	max
i wrote caldroid library that is simple to setup and have many features such as setup min max date disabled dates select date range etc

15296534

i wrote caldroid library that is simple to setup and have many features such as setup min max date disabled dates select date range swipe to change month fully localized support rotation properly etc

15296552
width	height
full width of the screen but with the height adjusted to the size of it s contents which is 2 buttons and a textblock

15296563
vbscript	jscript
you can either download and use grep as rojo suggests or you could switch to a better scripting language like vbscript jscript or powershell

15296563
spaces	linefeed
it uses repl.bat to convert all spaces into linefeed and then pipes the results to findstr

15296590
put	get
i have made a product key text input where users can put in their product key and it will add it to the xml so they do not get prompted for it during installation

15296627

binding nsdictionarycontroller with nstableview by nssearchfield

15296633
firefox	safari
this behavior is consistent with how firefox safari and omniweb perform

15296638

firefox won t show and hide my table properly

15296638
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in google-chrome but not in firefox

15296660
gif	png
we support png jpeg and gif formats

15296676
min	max
then use max to find the largest starting point and min to find the smallest end point

15296705
getter	setter
right now the only thing processing.js exposes on your sketch is functions so you can write a getter setter

15296717
rss	feed
my syndfeed was an rss 1.0 feed which apperently does not support enclosures

15296731
for-loop	loops
if you can t generate the values using a for-loop then you can also look at the foreach loops

15296777
width	height
what happens with the code below is that image width is scaled to 100 as expected and the height also scales as expected keeping the aspect ratio correct

15296777
margin	height
issue is that there is a margin at the bottom and that seems to be the height of the original contentheight of the image

15296814
pull	push
either you use a fixed-width footer push it below the content and then pull it back with a combination of negative margin and padding

15296831
width	height
i ve got the div s width and height set to a however i m having trouble with the text size

15296851
implements	extends
a service needs to be declared in the androidmanifest.xml and the implements class must extends the service class or one of its subclasses

15296865
for-loop	loops
your for-loop doesn t have this issue since you explicitly specify the type of loops variable - the compiler inserts a cast on your behalf for each item in the sequence

15296877
rtl	verilog
verilog rtl does not have a concept of a file system you would need the fpga driver to break the file down and send it over byte by byte or load it into a memory for the program on the fpga to read

15296895
width	font-size
this would change the font-size depending on the current width and would have it lower for smaller resolutions

15296899
getter	setter
1 you have a java class with private variables and no getter setter methods

15296911
width	height
why would you make absolute change its height width

15296940
cobertura	jenkins
i have been conducted successful tests generating code coverage data on a c++ project using gcov gcovr and cobertura jenkins plugin

15296949
button	checkbox
going forward i need to also support other field types like radio button checkbox selects etc

15296959
getter	setter
you have a java class with private variables and no getter setter

15296959
getter	setter
my response would be that you don t need specific setter getter and you d just modify them in other non-specific methods

15296959
getter	setter
setter getter can be viewed in many cases as exposing the implementation

15296963
width	height
i m working with grocery crud for some operations on the backend and i need to upload 5 pictures 3 of them with the same width and height and the other 2 with diferents sizes but when i try to upload with set_field_upload all the files are uploaded with one size

15296999
unsigned	short
format describes what type of data is stored char unsigned char short etc... so the program can correctly parse it

15297004
hide	show
the code above is working fantastic to show content below a title like having various related blocks in the sidebar that you can hide show

15297033
getter	setter
for instance now the interviewer could say that the class is part of a third-party framework and you do not have the source code for it so it is not possible to provide getter setter methods but you are forced to read wrtite some private state of a given object of this framework as workaround to solve some issue

15297041
put	get
psst next time you have some code that doesn t work put what you did get in your question as well as what you expected

15297143
fadein	fadeout
im trying to use jquery fadetoggle for smooth fadein and fadeout

15297214

15297253
min	max
make use of max and min functions

15297260
hash	md5
print the md5 hash if someone submitted the form

15297260
hash	md5
it says if there is a post value with the key input then trim any leading and trailing whitespace and print the md5 hash of that value

15297262
google-chrome	firefox
parameter e is the correct event in google-chrome firefox and ie 9 but undefined in ie 8 and ie 7

15297282
floating-point	integer
from an integer type or unscoped enumeration type to a floating-point

15297283

note that these will be get and not post requests

15297503
debian	linux
how would i do that with pyinstaller or similar system the binary will be executed under linux debian

15297524
client-side	server-side
and using the hijax scheme i have written the server-side logic but now i want the client-side code to be maintained using the backbone framework for javascript

15297531
getter	setter
make sure inputform has getter setter and a no-arg constructor

15297538
actionscript	mxml
that is the proper way to convert the mxml code you provided into actionscript

15297564
rvm	bundler
i got rvm setup with chef-solo on a vagrant vm just fine however i am confused on why bundler can not be found in the rails project

15297567
hide	show
it is certainly possible to hide or show content in an email using simple media queries

15297569
google-chrome	firefox
why does work in google-chrome while throw an error firefox

15297572
put	get
other than that a quick and dirty way to get it to work would be to remove the functions dduserclicked and ddentityclicked from your view and put the following at the top of the partial view instead not inside a script -section though

15297592
children	parent
the parent class shouldn t know anything about its children subclasses

15297604
setinterval	settimeout
you can t pass variables like this using settimeout or setinterval

15297623
firefox	safari
i have built my entire portfolio site and when i preview it in safari and firefox it looks great

15297729
subtract	add
the trick is to apply leftpadding to your values that you are printing count the number of characters that a value contains subtract them from a fixed amount and add the same amount of spaces to the value

15297773
vbo	normals
i can switch between normals and vbo rendering with an #ifdef use_vbo

15297799
onclick	onchange
you need to use onchange instead of onclick

15297799
hide	show
here is a complete solution which does not care what the ids are as long as the values of the parent select match the ids of the selects to hide and show

15297823
prepare	pdostatement
if the database server successfully prepares the statement pdo prepare returns a pdostatement object

15297834
width	height
in chapter 2 we defined the life grid adt to use a fixed-size grid in which the user specified the width and height of the grid

15297921
post	get
i have to use post since the json length is way over the get allowable length

15297924
tiff	png
gettext pcre readline png tiff x11

15297946
width	height
you could break apart the code to figure out how it s being handled but essentially the drag event is updating the panels width and height percentage

15297965
prepare	execute
first use the prepare method to create your query and then execute it with the query method

15297972
prepare	pdostatement
when you try to prepare an invalid sql statement like this prepare returns false not a pdostatement object

15297984
versioning	upgrade
but if feature a can upgrade to versioning 2.0 while feature b remains at 1.0 you will encounter provisioning conflicts if you have singleton plugins

15297986
vim	emacs
your probably not going to get a very good unbiased answer as these two camps are much like the emacs vs vim war

15298004
portrait	landscape
i have to check the video is landscape or portrait before rotate using ffmpge

15298007
allocator	stl
stl containers may not assume that memory allocated with an allocator can be deallocated with other allocator of the same type

15298030
prng	random
of course this depends on the fact that you seed your prng properly with random data

15298034
children	parent
so i d rather not have the application call a service call a dao to retrieve the parent only to move their children and then call the same service call the same dao to merge these changes into the database

15298095
google-chrome	firefox
indeed i m getting a 107 error on google-chrome and a the connection was interrupted error with firefox

15298095
apache	nginx
why i say node is portable compared to other web servers like apache or nginx i can keep a simple script in the repo root instead of a configuration file somewhere in the filesystem

15298126
filtering	grouping
i ve created filtering for each grouping

15298128
folder	directory
it works but only with images stored in supporting files xcode project folder and i d like to be able to display images from the app s documents directory

15298163
valgrind	memcheck
valgrind memcheck reports no problems

15298274
distance	polygons
finally we assume that the distance desired is the minimum distance between the point and all of the infinite number of points on the perimeter of the polygons

15298274
distance	polygons
we can assume that the shortest distance between the polygons and the point outside the polygons will always be one of two things a vertex of the polygons or a point on a line between two vertices

15298312
width	height
set the width and height to 100 position it absolutely and set the display to hidden

15298335
zoo	xts
i suspect this is because prices is an xts object not a zoo object

15298409
int	double
double is much slower than int

15298409
int	chars
fast sorting on int and chars is pretty good because those are done using a counting sort

15298439
put	get
i put an iteration counter in the loop to determine what kind of input the program should get either or

15298445
client-side	server-side
we ve had mvc3 code in a production environment for over a year that has used a combination of client-side and server-side validation

15298445
client-side	server-side
the bulk of the validation is done server-side but we ve had the client-side validation turned on for required fields so a trip to the server doesn t have to be made if one of those is missing since client-side stuff gets checked first

15298445
client-side	server-side
the field that was throwing the client-side error only has server-side validation because it s part of a complex set of properties that have to be checked together

15298477
folder	directory
this directory contains a web-inf and all the files in it i would like to publish via scp to a different location so that all the content of the build web-inf folder will become the content of the target folder

15298519
google-chrome	safari
the dropdown is displayed perfectly in 4 major browsers google-chrome mozilla ie9 safari

15298528
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
the bootstrapper uses the upgrade code in the msi file to uninstall the previous versioning then install the new versioning

15298550
google-chrome	firefox
learn to develop on google-chrome or firefox with firebug and then see if it works on other browsers

15298557
nsstring	nsdata
in objective-c you would convert nsstring to nsdata

15298568
google-chrome	firefox
update i followed blesh suggestion and i could realize that it works well in firefox but not in google-chrome

15298621
put	get
if you go that route it becomes easiest to put the login scripts outside of the protected directory so you don t end up requiring users to be logged in to get to the login script

15298624
post	put
the database projects however seem to want to put these statements in with the rest of the schema as opposed to post deploy so i d still like to know what if anything i can do to resolve this weirdness

15298676
division	subtract
you could compute the left amount and then compute the right amount by subtract from the left amount from the total amount or you could compute the left as the floor and the right as the ceiling of the division

15298689
ant	maven
you should try to run your test cases with maven or with an ant script

15298689
ant	maven
there should be a jenkins plugin for that or just call ant maven from a command line build step

15298717
setinterval	clearinterval
i ve created a factory called timefunctions which exposes setinterval and clearinterval

15298738
versioning	upgrade
if you have a versioning below 4.0.2 upgrade your php versioning

15298773
width	height
the column is still tied to the non-rotated image width and the row height is tied to the non-rotated image height

15298826
ienumerable	iqueryable
this makes it up to the caller whether they want the iqueryable methods to be used or the ienumerable methods to be used

15298838

width	height
won t work since this element is not yet rendered to the dom so there is no height width for this element

15298845
free	malloc
in c have a look at malloc and free if you want to control the lifetime of your arrays

15298854
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
if you used malloc calloc simply use free

15298857
free	malloc
if you ve allocated the array dynamically with malloc you just use free to de-allocate it

15298860
motionevent	onlongclicklistener
the onlongclicklistener responds by adding an ontouchlistener to the same view to listen for motionevent

15298889
calloc	malloc
creation of the tab malloc or calloc functions

15298918
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
if you have allocated memory using any of memory allocation techniques malloc calloc since it is allocated by you should be free by yourself and you use free ptr for freeing allocated memory block

15298922
width	height
hence i d like to make the width of the column fix with expand ratio but the height of every row should be variable according to its content - the string

15298933
sorting	filtering
this is reqired for filtering because it creates a place for storing your temporary filtering data and it may well be used for sorting as well

15298975
hide	show
i have a show hide functionality for the video and faq section on the following test page code

15298991
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
most browsers firefox google-chrome safari opera will probably redirect to the full url atm without the quotes but internet explorer ie10 too will discard the part after the second semicolon without the single quotes

15299019
min	max
you can use an aggregate function to get the max or min value of the second column and then apply a group by to col1

15299088
google-chrome	firefox
i don t think will be enough as an ipad user might be using google-chrome and an android user might be using firefox etc

15299104
udp	tcp
kryonet is a java library that provides a clean and simple api for efficient tcp and udp client server network communication using nio

15299113

15299165
put	get
i still get the 501 put - jquery error

15299165

here you can change the color text size and width and height of the elements in the spinner by modifying this textview

15299305
public	protected
your run method was protected i made it public and changed to any

15299331
fadein	hide
because the default state of the .team-text elements is hidden we just hide them with every click and then use the hidden filter on the fadein to keep it from fading in an already visible element this is so we can hide a tile if a user clicks on it twice

15299359
installation	upgrade
we are trying to upgrade our mootools installation from 1.2.4 to 1.2.6

15299381
folder	directory
a non-empty directory will not set cnt to a filename therefore if cnt is empty the folder is empty

15299404
hide	show
since code is now visible with your case you could make separate fitboundstovisiblemarkers method to be runned always after show and hide methods

15299457
superclass	subclassing
reason why is that a constructor in a subclassing doesn t override a constructor in the superclass and isn t used polymorphically in the way

15299457
superclass	subclassing
therefore any subclassing that override that method can t throw exceptions other than those declared on the superclass any more than they could change the rest of the method signature

15299491
getter	setter
i have getter and setter methods in one class and the button and field in another class

15299541

serializable	deserialization
the result is wrong registration and serializable deserialization

15299727
hide	show
i think the best option would be to show hide required markers then loop through all of them and add them to a new bounds object if visible

15299744
respond.js	modernizr
or you can use modernizr to test if the visitor s browser supports media queries and if it doesn t load respond.js

15299747
google-chrome	safari
everything looks like it does in the picture on that site except for the actual search box which instead looks like this in both safari and google-chrome

15299770
int	double
i ve noticed that functions with return types like double int etc can be called as statements like voids can

15299777
public	protected
since a is a parent of a_base1 i m assuming extended you can make the function call that accesses b public or protected and then a_base1 or a_base2 can use the same function a does to call into b

15299824
qapplication	qmessagebox
i could be interpretting qapplication notify wrong but i m getting the impression that you re attempting to create a gui object qmessagebox when the qt event loop crashes

15299824
try-catch	exception-handling
for exception-handling safety my understanding is that you have to wrap the whole qapplication exec function with a try-catch sequence as in the exception-handling safety docs

15299853
width	height
you should determine the width and the height of the window

15299924
folder	directory
in my current location i have created a folder called server folder where i will have files that the client can transfer i will be transfered with the same name to the workspace directory but every time i try to access it it fails

15299944
serializable	deserialization
i m using simplemodule to register the mixin with serializable and deserialization

15299944
serializable	deserialization
so mix-in registration with both serializable and deserialization configurations was unsuccessful

15299952
width	height
undesirable in most cases use the scalemode setting of strectch and specify both width height so that the area is filled this will not preserve the aspect ratio

15299952
width	height
pps one other idea if you know the original aspect ratio of the image is to calculate a new width that will be closest to the desired width but naturally preserves the width to height aspect ratio

15299952
width	height
for example the width height ratio is 4 3

15299952
width	height
therefore if the original aspect ratio is 4 3 you can set a width of 500 and a height of 375 to scale the image and not have any black areas

15300058
hide	show
if you chose to do it without hitting the database each time a notion improved in datatables by a process called pipelining then you d spit out divs of information based on the amount to display then show and hide them based on the page you want to be on

15300059
width	height
what i would like to do is to make the img display using the div s width and stretch its height

caliburn	prism
here s a really crude example showing how different wpf controls can be shown in a single wpf window using contentcontrol and binding which is what a toolkit like prism or caliburn micro does

15300203
getter	setter
i had to revoke the accepted answer creating getter and setter dynamically via object.defineproperty since though i thought it would solve my problem it doesn t really

15300203
getter	setter
and those objects are usually updated via the getter not the setter

15300203
getter	setter
as far as i can see i have no chance to notice changes done in this way with my dynamic getter setter implementation

15300205
children	parent
in qt especially in qstandarditemmodel children are stored relative to their parent not relative to the model

i have a idle event handler so from there i printed out the value of while i hide and show the application

respond.js	modernizr
you could certainly take a roll-your-own approach and write custom javascript for each case or you could use modernizr to test if the visitors browswer supports media queries and if it doesn t load respond.js or use modernizr to test if the vistor s browser supports geolocation or html5 forms or certain video formats ... and if it doesn t conditionally load a cross browser polyfill

now a simple fix is to write a simple function if statement that either returns the value or 0 or if the item s value is dbnull but i m wondering if it would make sense to somehow inherited the datarow object and create a new properties itemorempty or whatever you want to call it that won t raise the error and return the correct value back

secondly web services also make me think of serialization a process that will often call property getter and setter without your knowledge

15302893
getter	setter
but obviously this doesn t work with properties so they would have to be implemented using getter setter methods

15302961
width	height
displaying components that know their own aspect ratios height as a dependent of width

15302967
min	max
simple fix would be to pick a width for your dropdownlist and set max and min lengths to your textbox values so you can control over the size of your submissions

15302978
google-chrome	firefox
as a workaround try using firefox or google-chrome if you were using ie

15303000
children	parent
the idea is to store inherited class information in its own table and at the same time a derived class can have reference to a parent and a list of children that also derive from the baseclass

15303001
post	get
session_start creates a session or resumes the current one based on a session identifier passed via a get or post request or passed via a cookie

15303021
children	parent
i want to keep that div and its children and remove everything else even its parent

15303107
cpython	pypy
so far some of the options that i have found while googling seem to be nuitka cpython and pypy rpython

15303159
versioning	upgrade
i m in the process of testing a large number of schema changes to upgrade our db to run with the latest versioning of a packaged product we have

15303172
width	height
when width of the image is greater than height set height to a fixed value and auto stretch width

15303228
getter	setter
if you really want a capital letter use the jsonproperty annotation on the setter or - for serialization - on the getter like this jsonproperty mdreqid

15303288
clang	llvm
i am trying to generate ptx code for nbody sample program s kernel nbody_kernel.cu using clang llvm version 3.2

15303293
portrait	landscape
an example would be calculating and perhaps storing for future use the aspect ratio of an image to determine whether is it in landscape or portrait mode

15303306
nstextview	nspanel
i set some default font and color to a nstextview inside of a nspanel

15303338

15303633
keydown	keyup
i tried dispatching keydown keyup keypress textinput events

15303648
put	get
we put this all together and can get much closer to a solution in the 2-d space

15303678
margin	height
i don t really understand what it means that the problem is making that height dynamic so i can space the elements properly. but if you want to not have to declare a height on .hcontainer you can use a negative top margin on .h2white to place it on top of the red h2 instead of using absolute positioning

15303691
noclassdeffounderror	nosuchmethoderror
i believe that if you re dealing with user supplied code that you can assume nothing about then you should catch throwable in both cases consider linkage errors that don t affect the whole system just the executing code like nosuchmethoderror or noclassdeffounderror

15303701
int	chars
the resulting type of a defined enum variable can be chars int or unsigned int as long as it allows for all the possible constants in the enum

15303739
sorting	grouping
you are not selecting sorting or grouping by any other column so data can come straight from the table which is a very fast process

15303739
innodb	myisam
mysql can use a number of storage engines including but not limited to innodb and myisam

15303753
int	chars
end points to a pointer that will be set to the chars immediately following the long int in the string numberappended

15303801
google-chrome	firefox
unlike google-chrome the transition property is applied to properties inside an animation in firefox

15303801
google-chrome	firefox
remove the property and your css3 animation will work fine in both firefox and google-chrome

15303808
children	parent
a slightly alternative approach to that provided by dystroy in that the following moves the element you wish to keep placing it as the first child of the parent from which you want to remove all other children defaulting to the body element if no parent is provided as opposed to the alternate remove everything and then put it back approach

15303876
hash	md5
since an md5 is composed of exactly 32 hexadecimal characters and sometimes the hash is presented using lowercase letters one should account for them as well

a valid lowecase md5 hash

15303876
hash	md5
a valid uppercase md5 hash

15303892

.htaccess	httpd.conf
put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory or in httpd.conf

15303940
google-chrome	firefox

15303951
folder	dir
hidden + system folder don t showup when you do dir or look at files in explorer but it does not mean they are not there

15303958
mp3	ogg
i have written a function to play either an ogg or mp3 assuming i have both versions on the server

15303958
google-chrome	safari
this plays successfully in all desktop browsers but produces nothing on ios safari or android google-chrome

15303965
libs	buildpath
make sure that the required libs log4j and spring-web are available on the buildpath of your project

15303969

tried casting width and height to floats and using separate matrices for transformations

15303970
rss	feed
i want to create an rss feed using data in excel

15303970
rss	feed
how do i directly convert this data in excel into an rss feed

15303978
next	except
it works well except if they click for the pop up and return to the page the next click updates the first pop up window and the user must find the window that contains the image they selected

15304078
width	height
i didn t have time to test would possibly the first scenario work if height width were given or if it wasn t the dynamic image

15304081
submit	submission
change the submit to button or link - it will stop submission form

15304152
width	height
the c server sends height width and bpp

15304258
serializable	deserialization
i am writing to you with an error in website error during serializable or deserialization using the json javascriptserializer

15304295
width	height
you ll want to report a width and height that s based on the preview aspect ratio and you might need to trigger a relayout of your ui when you configure the camera preview size to update the view sizing

15304354
hide	show
then instead of setting the selected state of the button you simply call that method when you the image to show or hide

15304368
draggable	droppable
i have a grid 5 x 5 of droppable squares and then also several draggable squares which are links like

15304368
draggable	droppable
when moving them between the squares on the grid there is no problem but i also have a trash droppable square where if the user drop a draggable on it is delete it

15304388
children	parent
your trouble is going to stem from trying to animate an automatically calculated value height so i would scrap that idea unless you want to use hard coded size values on your parent children or just assume for example that if the app is restricted to portrait mode only....then your to value is 800px except i imagine that s not what you re looking for

15304393
strtol	atoi
the first argument to your program if given will be found in but as a string so you need to turn it into an integer with something like atoi or strtol

15304431
mouseover	mouseout
i m going to use the mouseover and mouseout events

15304431
mouse	keyboard
by depending on mouse events the context menu will not work when you use the keyboard by focusing an element using javascript or the tab key followed by pressing the context menu key

15304437
express	node.js
i have recently started working with node.js express mongodb

15304439

15304497
highcharts	highstock
i am trying to pull financial stock data of multiple companies from csvs and display the data as separate series in a highcharts highstock line chart

15304520
for-loop	arrays
the following line produces a cell arrays ind just as your code did the arrayfun command does have an implied for-loop but is considered vectorized

15304526
packets	multicast
we are porting a product currently running on ios to the android platform which basically takes in multicast audio packets and plays them

15304568
setinterval	settimeout
i ve tried with settimeout setinterval and requestanimationframe but neither of them fires during the inertial scrolling phase

15304597
hash	salt
i ve already got the necessary functionality to store passwords securely with a hash and salt in a database however i m now moving from the testing phase

15304597
hash	salt
instead i m opting to create a simple asynchronous tcp socket server that listens for a username sends the salt from the database back then the client hash the entered password salt is stored locally temporarily and sends that back to the server

15304605
post	get
if the site is either static or has a consistent url query mechanism we say in html the web query is a get as opposed to a form post ... you can use a nice parser oriented language like python using a library that accesses web pages

15304616
post	get
simple request get post etc. gives

15304622
rdms	acid
although you can shard a mysql database there are issues with sharding and enforcing acid properties when a rdms is on multiple machines will be very challenging nosql solutions like cassandra are famous for their ability to grow without problems with some cases managing 400 nodes in a cluster without a problem

15304662
width	height
i had to set the width and or height of the container

15304663

the if checks whether the browser is an webkit browser google-chrome or safari and if it is it sets contents of the editable div to the data being pasted

15304691
folder	directory
media_manager invokes with folder and the directory you passed

15304763
hash	salt
then the client hash the entered password salt is stored locally temporarily and sends that back to the server

15304763
hash	salt
if you salt and hash the password yourself and send the result to the server then this result will be your credential

15304826
put	get
note when you put a float into an int you get floor automatically but you can add it to the first two if if makes you feel better -

15304834
getter	setter
check out john ressig s javascript getter and setter blog post for some good examples

15304930

the tuneup.js library is in a folder called tuneup_js which is in the root of the directory which contains my test script an instruments trace file and i don t get any import errors on start

15304935
google-chrome	firefox
this happens on ie8 firefox and google-chrome

15304984
google-chrome	firefox
the app works fine with google-chrome and firefox but it stops receiving ping packages using ie9 after 10 minutes of establishing the connection with no apparent exceptions or errors in the log but if i send manually a response package to the server my code catches a closed connection event

15304989
clang	llvm
note that the projects i am building is a makefile project with clang llvm for the compiler if that is relevant info

15305015
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it seems that ie firefox google-chrome all send the cookie along with the request for the audio file however in osx safari the request is sent with a different user agent string containing quicktime and no cookie

15305030
strcpy	strncpy
use strcpy or add a null terminator after using strncpy

15305030
strcpy	strncpy
strncpy does not add the null terminator 0 where as strcpy does

15305030
memset	strncpy	strcpy	memset	strcpy	strncpy
adamip maciejowsky - strcpy or doing memset destination 0 lengthofdestination and then calling strncpy will result in your output being adam as well

15305062
couchbase	couchdb
for example elastic search mongodb couchdb couchbase all more or less work with json

15305066
put	get
but if another function is called which has a local variable it will put a value in that space which doesn t get cleared

15305149
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
in firefox google-chrome and safari the site renders fine and allows 10 x 10 sets of the rows to appear as a larger cube each row of 10 broken by a br tag

15305167
filtering	grouping
when the submit button is clicked it then passes the value of my search to the control to filtering my grouping

15305167
filtering	grouping
the routing in my project is set up so that if i were to type a value after local host it would then filtering the grouping just as my search button does

15305176
hide	show
when the user clicks onto the combobox the base control hide and the dropdownlist control show up

15305182
put	get	post	get	post	put
you should think of it in a crud fashion where each entity supports create read update and delete typically using get post put and delete http verbs respectively

15305222
post	get
default form method is post so you need set the form method to get in order to see the search string in the url

15305292
integer	fractions
modern postgres versions use an 8-byte integer internally to store up to 6 fractions seconds âµs resolution

15305333
integer	unsigned
now i know i am inserting no value for some fields that has a type if unsigned integer but that is okay as i will be updating this at later time

15305345
unix	bsd
in other unix flavors bsd for example errors set the carry flag

15305367
jar	manifest.mf
i like the idea to edit manifest.mf file but it looks like it only works when i convert my jar to exe at least from what i found

15305440
int	chars
the truncated incorrect int value problems and you are selecting from a chars value and putting it in an int column but some vyes are blank so you need to handle that

15305512
width	height
default constructor level int width height

15305512
width	height
resizes the vector to the correct width and height and fills it all with .

15305518
onclick	onfocus
if you want to handle event onclick just remove because it works on onfocus or just add the condition otherwise if use onclick event same as onfocus better remove the onclick event handler onfocus is enough

15305538
width	height
i solved the problem by setting the focus on a fictive button width 0 height 0 before displaying a popup

15305542
for-loop	arrays
your outer i for-loop needs to stop iterating when it reaches the length of the matrix arrays not the length of the i th inner arrays

15305542
for-loop	arrays
similarly your inner j for-loop needs to stop iterating when it reaches the length of the arrays

15305555
int	double
it should have a whole lot of other candidates for extracting into int and double and strings and other types

15305562
hash	salt
2 your use of salt and hash is messed up and it no longer solves the problem that it s meant to

15305562
hash	salt
hashing must be done on the server so that the value the server accepts over the wire is irreversibly hash and uniquely salt transformed into the value that appears in the user store

15305573
ubuntu	linux
the far better but also far more work way find a virtual machine host software like vmware fusion and install a linux server like ubuntu 12.4

15305577
hash	salt
they would need to understand the hashing of the username password salt to break authentication then have that hash version of hte username password for the master key and then use that to decyrpt the data

15305598
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

15305609
stdout	stderr
the script runs fine and i m even able to redirect stdout and stderr to display within my own window

15305614
put	get
to get by this stupid bug i did not implement sethidesbackbutton at all but in viewdidload i put the following

15305621
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i ve tested in google-chrome firefox and safari with the same results on all 3 browswers

15305625
post	get
as i mentioned all short text post work just fine but i start getting this error message the longer the text post get like exceeding 2 lines in my text box

15305635
stdout	stderr
otherwise it will print an error on stderr and nothing on stdout

15305639
int	double
i stored numbers as string because that you should convert it to int or double or what you want to using it in map

15305689
hide	show
in addition touch devices may selectively offer to show hide the password for usability purposes

15305707
vbscript	vba
i ve been running my excel 2000 vba program with task scheduler and cscript and vbscript for about a year now

15305726
bash	zsh
in bash it isn t so perhaps you re using csh or zsh

15305748
folder	directory
#include name looks first in your project s folder and then checks the other directory

15305784
sse	avx
the method i thought of was similar to what intel had proposed for sse and which works with avx too

15305787
lsp	principles	implements	extends
i have already implements a class that extends widget and i need to implements a validation system for this class but i believe that is not compatible with field class because i have applied custom render method and maybe this violating the lsp principles not sure

15305809
ssl	https
i have web site that has installed ssl so it is working under https with firstdata.com

15305809
ssl	https
i mean to use ms windows service somehow with https to interact with firstdata.com under ssl

15305815
tunnel	vpn
note that with ipsec you can create tunnel and these can then be forwarded on to other hosts so you can move your vpn management onto a computer other than your db host

15305869
folder	directory
ssh ing and viewing the directory shows only the .git folder and none of the pushed changes.

15305982
typedef	struct
if scene_t is a typedef for a struct or a non-array built-in type you should just write

15306012
m2e	pom.xml
if you can get it to play nice and bind with a lifecycle like validate or something then you can use the m2e plugin with eclipse and it just might play nice and read dependencies straight from the pom.xml and install the jars as needed to the local repo

15306023
repo	egit
we have searched over the net and most of the guides for egit either assume you work alone or that someone else clones and branches off to their own repo

15306023
repo	egit	pull	push
now i cannot push or commit or even pull because of conflicts in the files repo vs local which egit complains must be resolved

15306044
width	height
i can get the height width and extended state number

15306044
width	height
for example if a window is maximized the height and width returned are not what it would be after returning to a normal size

15306071
jar	war
i was including the aop.xml in the war file meta-inf folder instead of the included jar file

15306125
stateless	stateful
i m new to ejb and try to write a implementation for ejb stateful bean but when i try to do the transaction its returning like a stateless bean

we re using bigcouch a fork of couchdb managed by cloudant that provides a cluster of couch machines to store our data and then using touchdb for ios to replicate data down to mobile devices

15306144
memcpy	strcpy
otherwise small strcpy memcpy calls would often be translated into open coded data movement instructions on x86-64

15306144
ubuntu	debian
it takes more steps on ubuntu and debian

15306144
ubuntu	debian
this rpm dpkg rosetta stone page have links to instructions for fedora ubuntu and debian search for debuginfo

15306236
repo	egit
because of conflicts in the files repo vs local which egit complains must be resolved

15306239
int	boolean
if your preference is a int or boolean getcharpref wont work you would have to use

15306258
folder	directory
the view engine starts checking in for a file named _viewstart.cshtml within the same folder as the view being rendered and then walks up the directory tree until it gets to the root of the application

15306265
children	parent
i have to retrieve a list of children so i am adding the parent and creating the ones missing

15306322
rubygems	rvm
rvm rubygems current

15306364
postgresql	greenplum
the above statement does not appear to be true for greenplum who implemented their own cte support on top of a postgresql 8.2 codebase or did a non-straightforward backport of the 8.4 cte feature with significant changes

15306392
stdout	stderr
containing the program s output stdout + stderr and its exit code

15306426
internationalization	localization	implements	extends
don t extends your calss from resoucebundle class and implements your own localization internationalization framework then you will have a complete control on your design approach

15306500
width	margin
give the container a fixed width and margin 0 auto

15306527
folder	directory
if the image is just not showing up then it s probably because the image isn t actually in the right path for it to show properly you should grab bg.jpg and put it in an images folder one directory up from the html css folder

15306554
versioning	upgrade
personally i keep the archives on hand for the current versioning previous versioning and next versioning in my upgrade path

15306560
put	get
the problem with put obb files in anywhere else is that they will not be removed when users uninstall your app which tend to get them into a bad mood to state it mildly

15306562
width	height
that should help with explicitly setting the width and height of your image

15306568
post	get
it uses methods other than get or post

15306569
width	height
rather then persisting just the width and height of the frame try also to persist the preferred size information as well

15306573
listview	gridview
wrap your gridview listview and listview in a scrollviewer and set the following properties

15306581
lodash	underscore.js
if you don t want to use underscore.js or lodash you can do it yourself by adding the following to parent s constructor

15306619
ilist	iqueryable
if you are not a fan of iqueryable you can expose the dtos as ilist

15306620
put	get
i m coding in objective-c using xcode 4.6 on a macbook pro and i want to know how to use the same button in my storyboard to get connected to two different screens i mean i want to put a condition estructure to decide to which screen the app is going when the user press the button for example if x 1 go to view controller 1 else go to view controller 2

15306686
width	height
and fixed width x height y settings should be removed from your config.lua file

15306687
typedef	struct
your struct is actually an unnamed struct typedef-d to node but you re trying to refer to it as struct node later which is not the same as your node typedef

15306687
typedef	struct
or if you prefer and this is completely stylistic remove the typedef and correct your other references to the struct

15306707
fadein	fadeout
but i wanted to add a jquery fadeout and fadein to give a transition effect of the switching process

15306713
folder	directory
that folder looks like root of a filesystem with a include and lib directory

15306715
cpython	pypy
the stackless variants of cpython and pypy have this exact property

15306820
pop-up	dialog
there are no warnings or pop-up dialog for self signed certificates

15306851
typedef	struct
typedef struct nodetag

15306854
hide	show
show and hide are both working at the same time

15306854
hide	show
to avoid the conflict and not hide then show the content that s visible if the user clicks the same item twice show the one you want and hide the others by selecting them using siblings

15306871
hide	show
second note that the hide statement and the show statement will have a race condition since they will both apply to the element that s being hidden

15306871
hide	show
it would be better to show the item in the callback to the hide operation or exclude it from being hidden

15306893

subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
3 - use the two number to do your transaction add subtract multiplying

15311771
getter	setter
this is one reason why use of overridable getter and setter methods are preferred to direct access to fields

15311776
public	protected
fields insatnce variables are not overridden in your sub-class.they are only visible in your subclass if they are marked with either public protected or default

uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
a uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller are based on fundamentally different paradigms

15311857
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the uitabbarcontroller is intended for the uiviewcontroller on each tab to exist independently of each other and for the user to choose which they want to view

15311857
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the uinavigationcontroller is a stack of uiviewcontroller where each is related to the one above and beneath itself

15311857

15312019
nav	affix
i use jquery to call the affix on the side nav

15312042
typedef	struct
i think the root of the problem is that record is a typedef name for struct database and the first error using the struct keyword with record is leading to the later errors

15312077

width	height
while it appears that the imagecontrol width and height increases decreases during rotation the image is still being clipped

15312426
width	height
combined with the imagecontrol width height calculation the image size is retained during rotation by also setting its stretch property to none

15312444
for-loop	arrays
just be careful you don t generate an indexoutofboundsexception which is why it s a good idea to check the arrays length in a for-loop

15312506
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome using advanced rest client extension it gives status of 403 forbidden and content-type is text plain whether using local or remote server so it won t work at all unlike the firefox addon

15313016
apache	nginx
you can also set it at the server level in your apache or nginx or whatever configuration

15313025

appdata	uninstaller
3 write to microsoft and point how how ridiculous it was for them to a abuse the registry for things they should have used the appdata folder for b not create proper tools to clear all registry keys for a product their existing standalone uninstaller will leave practically all keys untouched c write installers which swallow error messages entirely without alerting the user forcing them to dig through log files and d the registry system as a whole

15313844
integer	fractions
however if your value is the result of a calculation which at one point involved any sort of non-zero fractions part then you will need to be concerned that you may have something very close to an integer but which isn t really exactly to-the-last-bit the same

15313911
salt	md5
i would recommend using a key and salt to encrypt your password using sha256+ as md5 is very weak

google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome all works fine while in firefox i see only a full white page such if the mask covers all the image

15313952

or use some suitable inline assembler or transcendental code to calculate selected sin cos etc values and compare those with the sin and cos functions provided by the library

15314543
getter	setter
at that time the objective-c language didn t sport the property keyword - to emulate properties it was necessary for the programmers to declare and implement getter and setter methods manually this applied to apple s code as well

15314543
getter	setter
you can see that recently added classes do in fact feature declared properties instead of getter and setter but that s not true for older classes

15314543
accessor	properties
it s just an unrelated fact that properties are accessed using accessor methods in objecive-c

i understand that the height and width of a view aren t going to be available immediately after i call setcontentview

15318909
width	height
i m also somewhat unclear as to how i actually read the height and width

15318909
width	height
i haven t been able to find any way to do that in xml so i figured i could read the height and width at runtime compute the right width and set it

15318917
min	max
you could actually compare and look for the min and max numbers while the user is inputting them instead of having a separate loop since i presume that they are the same numbers

15318918
cashapelayer	uibezierpath
i m trying to animate a uibezierpath and i ve installed a cashapelayer to try to do it

then you can use that group_id when you generate your menu make it an extra condition in your database query to get only post that are allowed to this group to be seen

15319046

now this works fine in firefox and google-chrome but in ie8 i get the following error

15319097
width	height
the problem in that the css needs to work when the image is larger on width and when it s larger on height

15319097
width	height
i ve found this solution using max-width or max-height but it only works for one option larger width or larger height

15319099
getter	setter
since you are defining a property and in the getter and setter referencing to those same getter and setter

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the fonts wouldn t display properly in firefox but they were fine in safari and google-chrome

15319152

15319286
getter	setter
don t skip using getter and setter to provide encapsulation to your code

ntfs fat any other filesystems on linux

15319593
median	max
if it is less than the current median it goes to the max heap

15319593
min	max
if the sizes of the heaps differ by more than one element extract the min max from the heap with more elements and insert it into the other heap

15319638

google-chrome	firefox
i have noticed this issue in google-chrome but not firefox or ie

15319700

in fact chrome is performing a get but it is tying the post and the get together -- i suppose there is some optimization involved

15319700
post	get
note that there will be a 302 post and a 200 get

15319700
post	get
however according to the standard a post should stay a post and a get should stay a get source

in any other kind of program scheduling the gui-creation task is usually the last thing the initial thread does so it doesn t matter whether it uses invokelater or invokeandwait

15319742
invokelater	invokeandwait
also it says about the usual practice if gui-creation is not the last task being done by the initial thread would still it not matter if invokeandwait is used or invokelater

15319756
post	get
the post redirect get pattern appears to be broken resulting in the confirm form resubmission dialog even if a response.redirect is issued

15319774
int	double
here 22.0 is double so the division becomes floating-point division even though 7 is still int

15319774

for-loop	loops
i have a for-loop with a settimeout function inside of it intended to delay each iteration of loops

public	protected
i would suggest to read understand access specifiers in java public private protected and default

15320976
public	protected
in the example above you have declared instance variable surname with default access implicit access specifier used if not specified as public private or protected

15320976
getter	setter
moreover as a good programming practice it is advisable to declare variables as private and write getter setter methods to access them

15321021

don t mix swing japplet awt button components without good cause

15321782
octal	hex
i should also add that if your input might contain octal or hex literals some further processing is needed

15321793
int	double
it may be worth looking at the source code of that to see exactly how it manages to screw up exponentiation with int see unlike c s exp it takes two int instead of two double

15321793
int	double
but there s no double pow int int in the standard

15321876

15322199
width	height
but since i resize the picture according to availabe space so i can show the full height of the picture at all times the width of the displayed image changes and that method of centering is no good

15322215
int	double
it turns out that when you use c unsigned int index variables the generated code grabs the data directly from the array buffer and calls pyfloat_fromdouble which coerces it to double

15322242
packets	multicast
i will receive all packets with destination ip being this multicast group of course i also need to join this multicast group this is case 2

15322255

15322587
unsigned	short
uint is at least for me much more preferable to either unsigned or unsigned int in the same logic you also have ushort which is preferable to unsigned short int

15322618
integer	unsigned
the unsigned keyword can be applied to any integer type and long long is indeed an integer type

15322618
int	double
there is no such thing as unsigned long double because long double is a floating point type as opposed to an int type and there is no such thing as unsigned floating point types reference 1 reference 2

you could create a scaletransform that scales from logical coordinates to viewport coordinates by using the grid s width and height as scaling factors in x and y direction

15323221
actualheight	actualwidth
in order to get a uniform scaling you may simply bind both the scaletransform s scalex and scaley properties to either the actualwidth or actualheight of the grid

15323221

mouse	keyboard
there are many types of events that might occur but typically we re interested in those generate by the user via mouse clicks and keyboard input

15327132
post	get
if you want to set the value in session after it is clicked you have to send the request to a different page http get or post request or an ajax request to set the values

15327152
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
so far in testing the new font works in google-chrome ie and safari but not in firefox

15327177
for-loop	loops
however the for-loop enables you to declare local variables that exist only for the duration of loops

lan	localhost
i was running my asp.net application on localhost in the internal iis for visual studio and for testing purposes i was trying to host my website on my lan at home

15327222
strcpy	malloc
you have to use strcpy the way you have written this program because you have already allocated space using malloc

15327238
hide	show
when you want to hide it and use show

15327265
int	double
a few compilers don t like it when you compute a double using int and there is no reason to not use double here since the program is small

15327277
kobold2d	cocos2d-iphone	versioning	upgrade
i use kobold2d and i just upgrade from versioning 2.0.3 to versioning 2.1.0 this means that i ve gone from cocos2d-iphone v2.0 to cocos2d-iphone v2.1

o reilly book node.js up and running - part 1 chapter 2 doing interesting things let s build twitter working code for express 3.0 and ejs embedded javascript for node renderer without partials

15327327
hide	show
you have here the possibility to call hide or show method and according to your proposal

15327336
getter	setter
finally note that getter and setter are not always the appropriate alternative to public fields

15327345
getter	setter
i d say make everything private by default and then expose only those parts that absolutely have to be public or just use getter and setter

15327350
qtabbar	qdockwidget
afaik it s qtabbar + qdockwidget based

15327355
int	double
5.1 says something similar about mixing int fp data types but curiously not singles and double

15327355
floating-point	integer
when writing simd code that works for both integer and floating-point data use

15327355
int	double
perhaps they internally use different registers for int single double operands so they can be located nearer to the respective vector units

15327409
jar	war
after symlinking the jar to war web-inf lib jenkins is able to access the class

15327423
put	get
i need it to be in one dict for upper and lower but cannot figure put how to get both into one dict

15327433
getter	setter
i think this is good to have this possibility excluding static final constants because you can use this to solve some problems quickly instead of defining getter and setter you just need to be careful here by breaking encapsulation rules

15327442
post	get
monkey patch the method to do what we want post with an empty body otherwise we would receive http error 400 http get can only be used for select queries

15327447
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately on both firefox and google-chrome this does seem to be the case

15327554
viewdidload	viewwillappear
add in an implementation of viewdidload and viewwillappear along with that each with their own i m here nslog statement and trace the flow of that second view controller appearing

15327582
rdf	owl
there are some old files starting some mappings between rdf owl and openmath views of the world for example

15327582
rdf	owl
the openmath list at is probably the best place for getting in contact with people interested in openmath mathml and rdf owl

15327601
put	get
that makes them different from the initial ones and then you try to use them as if you have put some value in them that s why you get the errors

15327630
accessor	properties
also you can write binding to selecteditem properties of the datagrid and in the set accessor you can invoke your command but the first solution that i presented you above is better

15327652
textview	imageview
probably the best place to declare your imageview is where your textview is so you can replace your textview with imageview

15327652
textview	imageview
then in your code you will have to inflate your imageview similar to the textview

15327690
fink	macports
the maintainers suggest you use a version from fink or macports if possible

15327721
google-chrome	firefox
using curl i can see the location header being set but google-chrome and firefox encode the url into which leads to the 404 error

15327761
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on ie9 google-chrome firefox

15327765
punctuation	words
you could speed this up a little further still and make it more accurate if you turned your lines into a set of words set line.split perhaps but that won t remove punctuation as then you could use set intersection tests against wordlist also a set which could be considerably faster to find matching words

15327770
mockito	jmock	mockito	easymock	easymock	jmock
it has a clear advantage over older frameworks like easymock mockito created and has very effectively implemented a far nicer model for mocking than the old record replay verify process that easymock jmock and others follow

15327770
mockito	easymock
searching for easymock mockito comes up with many results for migrating to mockito from easymock and none in the other direction

15327770
mockito	easymock
there s more details of the exact differences between easymock and mockito at

15327788
for-loop	loops
your loops is processed creating 6 timeouts and immediately after that will show your alert code to be executed after completed for-loop

i am searching a way using javascript to find visitors browser window width and height but i want also find the maximum window sizes so if the user make the window smaller or bigger some elements change automatic position or size like facebook chat

15327856
hibernate3-maven-plugin	sql-maven-plugin
to achieve the result i wanted i had to chain in maven the execution of hibernate3-maven-plugin s hbm2ddl on process-classes phase with another execution of sql-maven-plugin on the process-test-resources phase

15327873
width	height
each box has following style given below the width is fixed 400px which is 1 3 of my screen but height is not fixed

15327878
width	height
the maximum browser size width would be the width and height of the screen

15327959
width	height
i would like to get the height and width from this string using javascript

15327963
int	double
next notice the double parentheses - since both int and input are functions so we need to show that by doing that

15327982
bbpress	amember
so here s the deal..i have wordpress + bbpress integrated with a membership software amember

15327982
bbpress	amember
the reason why i want to show wordpress roles instead of bbpress roles is that my membership software amember allows me to set different wordpress roles depending on the user s subscription

15327988
width	height
a png file starts with the bytes 89 50 4e 47 0d 01 1a 0a followed by the ihdr chunk that contains the width and height and must be the first chunk

15327988
width	height
ihdrâ s content starts with a 4-byte width and a 4-byte height so a pngâ s width and height are always bytes 16-24

15328002
post	get
c use a semaphore initialized with a max_threshold count to represent message-tokens in a similar way to b - producer has to get a unit before queueing up consumer post a unit when it s done with a message object

15328074
for-loop	loops
i have loops in my shopping cart page creating problem for the size query because of for-loop repeating only one row

15328081
superclass	subclassing
base class has common methods and its implementation which i want to use in subclassing but i want to use subclassing member variable instead of superclass

15328084
width	height
but when i use my converter byte to imagesource the bitmapimage has 0 for width and height

15328090
rspec	capybara
for later versions of capybara and rspec it s important to check for type being feature

15328120
submit	submission
my idea is that once the user logs in and submit the information on the form they have to fill out the submission of the form would trigger a script to close the browser window in 5 seconds

15328121
google-chrome	safari
the page runs a processingjs script which runs ok in google-chrome and safari

15328167
hide	show
have both images already on your page and show or hide either one based on a logical condition

15328222
rss	feed
i try to format a rss feed from my dnn site and make it look nice

15328275
google-chrome	firefox
this works nicely on firefox and i can see the progress bar while waiting for the page to load but it does not work on google-chrome or ie

15328285
for-loop	loops
so obviously if i call fork in a for-loop each parent and child process will then go through loops calling fork on their own

15328353
int	chars	int	boolean
the way you check a single chars to be digit is not with integer.parseint that one returns an int not a boolean

15328481
getter	setter
after requestbody you must write one object which contain model class getter setter

15328482
portrait	landscape
if my app supports both portrait landscape modes and i start my app in landscape i see that the uiviewcontroller s view frame size is still dimensions for portrait in viewdidappear

15328491

for c++11 clang with libc++ and gcc with libstdc++ are both pretty good but not perfect yet

15328510
nunit	moq
i m using c# 4.5 nunit and moq

15328511
daemons	launchd
generally speaking to prevent people from starting the specific program s from command line the nix way is to chown the binary file s to be owned by the daemons that launchd it and also to be of owned by the group say no_command_line

15328608
mouseover	mouseout
i have a set of nested dom elements with mouse event handlers mouseover mouseout

15328639
g++	gcc
you can confirm that by linking with -t if you re linking using gcc or g++ then use -wl -t to pass -t through to the linker which prints the name of each file as the linker processes it and you ll see it doesn t process the nested archives

15328663
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works fine on firefox and safari but doesn t update on google-chrome and i m wondering if i ve done something wrong

15328698
button	checkbox
thus button and checkbox are sisters of the same mother control

15328698
button	checkbox
how can i tell that listofcontrols 0 holds a button and listofcontrols 1 holds a checkbox

15328700
innodb	myisam
do this using but do be aware of the differences between myisam and innodb

15328705
children	parent
either you can structure your processes so that each one forks a relevant number of children for example the parent will fork n times the children n-1 their children n-2 etc. or you would limit the forks so that only the parent keep on the loop that would be the simplest case

15328758
jar	war
resources on the classpath could be present in a directory structure or in an archive such as a jar or war

15328819
sorting	grouping
assuming you want to grouping together the first with the first and the first and similarly the second 1 with the second 2 and second 3 and so on using pk_id as the order you could use variable assignment to number sequence values then use the resulting numbers for sorting

15328840
junit	testng
the java test cases exported don t compile because they require at least the selenium library to compile and may need junit or testng as well to actually run

15328840
put	get
you need to get the client jar called selenium-java-2.31.0.jar out of this zip and put it in the lib directory of your new java project in eclipse

15328890
box-sizing	border-box
the value you would use is box-sizing border-box

15328932
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
everything works fine on my mac under my facebook account on google-chrome safari opera and firefox

15328932
google-chrome	safari
one of them on my mac under safari and another on my friend s wife s pc using google-chrome

15328976
int	double
i am having a difficult time thinking of a way to extract a number such as an int or a double from a string extracted from the getline function

15329013
mdpi	hdpi
instead make different sizes for ldpi mdpi hdpi and xhdpi and put your icons there

15329069
put	get
i know xml is case-sensitive and when i put the request back into soapui and change the case correctly i get the correct response from the web service

15329084
folder	directory
copy tij4-code lib directory to your new eclipse project folder

15329084
folder	directory
go to file import choose general file system select the unzipped folder tij4-code as your from directory

15329096
inline	inlining
i think there might still be one exception where you can t disable inlining and that s for completely empty methods since the inline method size would still be 0

15329112
modifiers	sealed
in this paper it is argued that it would be great if java had a sealed access modifiers

15329146
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome safari the response content is returned as a javascript object

15329222
put	get
i know that leiningen is reading my profiles.clj file since if i put an intentional syntax error in the file i get an expected compiler exception

15329239
cout	cin
for cin cout and endl you need to you forgot to do that in your 2nd .cpp file

15329275
post	put
if that s the case remove the offending pieces of data and put them in the form served from a so they are sent along with the post submission

15329276
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
as it s still a relatively new api it s available as webkitmatchesselector in google-chrome and safari and mozmatchesselector in firefox

15329292
google-chrome	firefox
it works just fine in firefox and google-chrome but ie testing with ie9 seems to ignore the setattribute method because it only puts in the text and the button but without the formatting class was not applied and also clicking the newly created button does not remove the objects either id was not applied or there is some additional incompatibility with portions of the code that remove the objects

15329294
division	multiplication
however since shifting is very similar to multiplication or division by powers of two you can probably get portable behavior by using an appropriate multiplication or division instead of a shift

15329316
post	get
another way i wouldn t mind doing it is if could get jquery to post the save request in some way that would bind an 8 field byte array to a byte back in the model but everything i have tried doesn t work

15329362
post	get
i get all the other post fields ok it s just the ch_result

15329387
havok	physx
i also develop with the big three physic libraries physx havok bullet

15329387
havok	physx
so while my expectations of the king of physics sim being physx havok and bullet in that order i see the reverse in reality

15329424
wordpress	joomla
i am migrating from joomla 1.5 to wordpress and my client does not want users to have to re-register

15329424
salt	md5
specifically md5 password salt salt

15329460
scatter	graphing
from the calculation there will be some value that will be have same value to each other when plotting in graphing i used scatter plot

15329463
udp	tcp
tcp s and udp s error control are a single checksum covering each packet

15329537
gif	png
most likely the generated code from those third-party hosting sites has not an image extension jpg png gif so fancybox doesn t know what type of content needs to handle

15329538
post	get
there is no appreciable performance difference between get and post but there are very important functional differences

15329538
post	get
get requests should thus always be safe to repeat but for a post there is a risk that an action will be taken that affects state and cannot be repeated without further affecting state

15329545
int	double
you re passing the literal for an int 5 so somewhere an implicit conversion is required to turn it into a double

15329559
getter	setter
in the above example creates a fetchedresultscontroller getter method and a setfetchedresultscontroller setter method both using the fetchedresultscontroller_ instance variable for storage.â

15329613
post	get
according to mitmproxy it makes post requests to to get its data

15329671
submit	submission
before submission and use .ajax ... data mydataobject to submit the data to the backend instead of the form

15329824
put	get	arduino	avr-gcc
i ve tried disassembling the executable generated by the arduino software which compiles it with avr-gcc but i can t seem to get anywhere in my efforts to find the code i put in

15329832
setinterval	settimeout
i think that you want to use the setinterval function as settimeout only executes one time

15329863
google-chrome	firefox
the menus work fine with later versions of the android web browser i ve tested 4.0.3 and 4.2 in the emulator as well as in ios 6 and on a computer firefox and google-chrome browsers tested

15329881
width	margin
without an example of your code is difficult to say but make sure that you do not have any elements with fixed width padding margin borders - a div with width 500px

15329938
width	height
i first imagined an 11 x 8 rectangular grid and then i used a with the same width and height as the square images and with no border as placeholders where the images are not meant to appear while displaying each square image with a solid border of 1px where they are meant to appear

15329959
post	put
although you could put the error log in your post

15329976
folder	dir
src is a folder within root dir that contains headers and cpp files sconscript is in the root dir

15329985
width	height
i am developing an android epub 2 reader my reader running smooth except on slideshow it always have excess 5 pages.my slideshow has 15 images with 270px height my first conclusion was all the image in my slideshow adds on the total length of my epub then it was divided in 728px the width of my webview that s why i formed a condition that will total all the height of the images then i subtract it to the total length of my epub and divided to 728px but answer is insufficient to display the exact pages

15329985
width	height
but this is already resized to width 462px height 270px

15330002
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
however i have stumbled across an issue with ie8- google-chrome safari firefox etc all working perfectly

15330009
jar	war
a better servlet 3.0 api dependency entry in pom is available here - you should also mark the scope as provided otherwise the jar will be included in your final war which will interfere with the jar provided by the container which is what seems to be happening in your case

15330047
put	get
and then print out name age and wage respectively i get exactly what one would expect the same thing as i put into standard input

15330055
opera	firefox
in opera 12 and firefox 19 concatenating empty strings is rediculously faster 95 in firefox 19 - or at least jsperf says so

15330069
backtracking	greedy
s matches non-whitespace characters and it s a greedy match it s not going to backtracking to see if some other match is possible to match non-forward slash characters use

15330093
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
so in a way if you want some code executed when the back button is pressed you should put that code in the viewdidappear or viewwillappear method of vc1

15330106
hash	md5
common hash functions include md5 sha-1 sha-256 sha-512 and ripemd

15330109
versioning	upgrade
my emulator is not starting and i suspect the main reason is the upgrade to higher versioning of android sdk

15330134
awt	swing
using swing awt components will let you make this with your own gui elements as you ve pointed out

15330136
post	put
placing this attribute on the operation webinvoke uritemplate supports post by default but you can pass a parameter specifying other verbs such as put delete etc

15330146
openni	kinect
if you use version 1.5.4 i think there is no problem because openni interact directly with your kinect xbox

15330146
openni	kinect
however if you use openni version 2.x it will interact with your device via kinect sdk since there is no kinect sdk on linux you can t make openni 2 to recognize your device

15330173
submit	submission
natural html form submission with a submit handler which validates form values and returns either true to allow form submission or false to suppress it

15330173
submit	submission
a submit handler that submit form data by ajax establishes a .done handler to handle the http response and returns false to inhibit natural html form submission

15330202
int	chars
however there seems to be some trouble in detecting when there is no more data to be parsed because ftell often gives me an int value higher than the actual number of chars within the file

15330231
queue	fifo
after a module js file loaded the content inside it will be evaluated not sure when but will be evaluated in the order of js file loaded then requirejs will push the factory and dependency list in a fifo queue

15330237
fgets	getline
this is why many people myself included recommend against using scanf or fscanf and prefer to use fgets or perhaps posix getline to read a line from the user and then use sscanf to analyze it

15330265
folder	directory
it will contain a folder called working directory expand it

15330265
folder	directory
there will be a folder inside the working directory folder called .git expand it

15330394
ubuntu	debian
this is the procedure for ubuntu debian systems

15330403
hash	md5
i have two similar tables in postgres with just one 32-byte latin field simple md5 hash

15330419
stdout	stderr
i know that i need to run my cli backend in a subprocess and then send the stdout and stderr to a textview

15330442
comparator	comparable
since you want to have your treeset contain bitset s and bitset does not implement comparable you need to give your treeset a custom comparator

15330448
versioning	upgrade
some of the projects we re working on have strong roots in jquery 1.4.2 or earlier and somewhere between lacking the performance edge or syntactic sugar of the latest releases the humiliation of using now-deprecated methods and the discomfort of deploying a 3+ year old versioning of an actively maintained library an upgrade is now imminent

15330518
implements	extends
public class elementc extends auditableentityc implements element

15330518
int	chars
create table type type_id int not null name varchar2 200 chars not null descr varchar2 500 chars constraint element_type_pk primary key type_id

15330543
autocomplete	typeahead
i am using twitter bootstrap typeahead for an autocomplete field

15330557
int	chars
this converts a digit chars to an int value of the corresponding digit

15330571
width	height
if your draggable element is absolutely positioned and your container is absolutely positioned you can set the dragged element to a fixed width and height

15330587
google-chrome	safari
this worked flawlessly in google-chrome but testing in safari or internet explorer led to the problems shown here

15330587
google-chrome	safari
the image on the left is google-chrome the image on the right is safari

15330658
google-chrome	safari
only works with webkit browsers safari google-chrome

15330675
width	height
and set width and height of your blocks it will work like this

15330711
distance	polygons
i have also been reading a bit about haversine formula and it appears it does not use polygons it is basically two-point distance from my understanding

15330722
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
just use a single objectoutputstream and objectinputstream directly for the life of the socket constructed directly over the socket streams and call writeobject when you want to send an object and readobject when you want to read one

15330789
maya	blender
modelling environment blender 3ds max maya milkshape and etc.

hide	show
so what i want to do is this when i click #cglink and then decide to click on #balink the #cg div should hide and #ba div would show

15330855
hide	show
what i would recommend is writing your media-query css to show hide divs containing the ads as needed

15330913
quartz.net	log4net
i have downloaded the newest version of quartz.net and try to configure it with common.logging and log4net dlls by using below configuration based on this example

15330914
width	height
the code i have here is pretty much exactly as it is in a java for dummies book i have with the exception of a few things such as getting rid of constants for the size of the applet this.setsize 500 500 vs this.setsize width height and declaring width and height earlier

15330981
int	chars
if the type is unsigned then you can never store a negative value in it or more accurately if you attempt to store a negative int into an unsigned chars it will be truncated to the least significant 8 bits and will be treated as positive

15330981
getchar	fgetc	int	chars
note that functions such as fgetc or getchar are defined to return chars as positive int and eof as a distinct negative value

15330981
int	chars
next chars is present the fgetc function obtains that chars as an converted to an int

15330995
ubuntu	centos
what we do in both ubuntu and centos is that we always use the tar.gz from oracle jdk website extract it to a subfolder in opt like opt jdk_1.7.0_09 make a symbol link to the folder like and set the environment varibles where we point java_home to the symbol link rather than the actual folder

15330995
ant	maven
same way works with 32 and 64 bit jdks different versions of ant maven gradle etc

15331001

15331082
width	height
image string source number x number y number width number height api

15331147

15335653
mouseover	mouseout
i think you made the mistake of thinking that click like hover accepts two functions for the differing states - unfortunately no - mouseover and mouseout are unambiguously state trackable however alternate clicks are not unambiguously state trackable hence jquery click doesn t offer this facility

15335835
width	height
windows bitmap objects have fixed width and height

15335835
width	height
when you create an hbitmap you have to decide once and for all on the height width and indeed other properties such as pixel format

15335835
width	height
so of course when you modify the width and height property of a delphi tbitmap then the implementing hbitmap will need to be re-created

15335835
width	height
it seems that you are asking to be able to create an hbitmap that has width and height properties that can be modified

i have an abstract-class superclass which has a substantial number of subclassing each working on a different business object but in similar fashion

15336206
superclass	subclassing
the obvious way here is to add an abstract getter in superclass for the attribute and have every subclassing override it so that it can send the correct attribute when called

15336348

the width and height are how big the is

15336348

width	height
- it should stretch to take the whole screen width and stretch for the full height

15336783
implements	extends
i think implementation of methods of the same signature in different classes having some sort of inheritance relation either using extends or implements is method overriding and also polymorphism because in this way we are achieving many forms of the same method signature

15336831
implements	extends
i was expecting the service implementation class to implements the service endpoint interface instead of extends javax.xml.ws.service

15336854

gave up and switched to sharpziplib as it doesn t blow up on simple extract but sure would be nice to know what was wrong with dotnetzip it has a nicer api

15337233
post	get
looking at the above if you wanted to do a redirect after making a post in the last line of your post instead of rendering a template you would simply redirect the user to the get part of the handler with the following line

15337247
whenever	resque
get rid of delayed job and use either whenever or resque

15337282
ssl	https
encryption for free encryption is already a solved problem https ssl both with regard to transport as well as with regard to what you have to implement on your end and it s just a matter of setting it up

15337282
ssl	https
server authentication for free https ssl doesn t only solve encryption but also server authentication so that the client can verify whether it s actually talking to the right service

15337282
ssl	https
and as a last remark this puts additional constraints on your client side https ssl implementation you can even use client side ssl certificates which essentially allow authenticating the client to the server

15337450
post	put
also you could put this validation logic into a reusable validation attribute as i have shown in this post

15337466
int	boolean
also in the method getvalue you expect it to return int and then in the second line of the method you are returning false which is boolean thus the compilation issue

15337475
versioning	upgrade
i m using .net 3.5 and entity framework 3.5 also cannot upgrade to a recent versioning

15337478
int	boolean
one more thing is that in your following method you must return int instead of boolean

15337482
integer	unsigned
edit i just realized your output type is a signed 32-bit integer but the original type is unsigned 8-bit integer

15337483

it s most commonly used in the post redirect get pattern but could apply here

15337763
public	protected
that is the whole point of private members - they can be accessed by any member of the same class be they public protected or private

15337776
public	protected
the base member functions will be visible through the derived class if you used public inheritance but only to the derived class if you used protected or private inheritance

15337790
hash	md5
we currently use md5 to hash keys that we want to lookup in memcached

15338296
affinity	processors
you can mess around with processors affinity for your application but at the .net level that s hardly ever a winning strategy

15338296
affinity	processors
now the default .net host does map threads 1-to-1 so if you want to depend on an undocumented implementation detail then you can poke through the abstraction and use p invoke to determine drive your processors affinity

15338316
width	height
how about the precise x y coordinates of a particular phrase string along with its width height so that you could highlight it somehow

15338340

15338629
try-catch	exception-handling
first i had my whole method in a try-catch block where catch exception-handling ex and no matter what was the exception-handling i just returned error loading image

15338629
try-catch	exception-handling
i get to the conclusion that i can either - use several try-catch blocks to handle those parts or throw an exception-handling and handle the exception-handling from where the method is called

15338629
try-catch	exception-handling
also now there are two try-catch blocks but if in the future the logic changes i might want to throw more different exception-handling which is another reason to keep the exception-handling handling in the method itself rather where it s called but on the other hand.

15338641

15338837
switching	screens
i m using media queries to apply these styles but to avoid the site switching to the mobile design when resizing the window i now also add a class on page load if the screens is large

15338856
for-loop	arrays
as stated i think the issue has to do with the layout of your arrays and what you try to check against in your for-loop or perhaps some php setting

15338858
daemons	launchd
i have a daemons that needs to run as root and is started by launchd

15338858

15338876
post	get
and the other post get me nowhere

15338879
g++	gcc
compiler the c++ library is compiled using g++ the c project using gcc - both from mingw

15338897
getter	setter
use for this a public function from your base class setter and getter functions

15338924
try-catch	exception-handling
if you have parts in your code which are very unlikely to cause any exception-handling if at all then you shouldn t embrace them in try-catch

15338924
try-catch	exception-handling
additionally using several try-catch -blocks to catch different exception-handling is good too

15338954
width	height
essentially with identical width images with varying height the masonry works as expected but at certain breakpoints the grid only will have a two column layout as opposed to the usual four

15339176
width	margin
to make the margin position the div at the center the width attribute must be set

15339200

i do set page permission for modifying sys_call_table entries and mentioned scheme works well for another syscalls chdir mkdir and so on

15339379
stdout	stderr
which should print a line to stdout a line to stderr then wait for user input then another line to stdout and another line to stderr

15339379
stdout	fflush
the test.c stdout stream is buffered and when run in a terminal as soon as a n is reached the buffer is fflush but when spawned in this way with node the buffer isn t fflush

15339379
stdout	fflush
this could be resolved by either flushing stdout after every print or changing the stdout stream to be unbuffered so it fflush everything immediately

15339379
stdout	stderr
however both stdout and stderr are merged together as you would see when running the program in a terminal and i can t think of a way to separate the data from the streams

15339445
google-chrome	firefox
also you can use the network tab in the f12 development tools in ie or google-chrome firebug in firefox or fiddler to debug ajax calls

15339467
children	parent
a way of doing this is using display table on the parent and display table-cell on the children

it seems that even if mongoid document includes activemodel validation you have to define a separate key for the translation

15339750
post	get
the get post actions index and createremark are both in the same home controller by the way

15339801
put	get
in your second sheet you can put several formula at the top to do vlookup using rollno to get mark4 mark5 mark6 mark7 mark8

i subscribed to the main canvas sizechanged event and applied a scale transform so that the canvas and its children would shrink and grow in a zoom like fashion when the control is resized which is working but for some reason the parent canvas is shrinking at a much higher rate than the children making the children fall off of the canvas at a certain point because of the scale rate

atomic	compare-and-swap
there are three common styles of atomic primitive compare-exchange load-linked store-conditional and compare-and-swap

15347920
atomic	compare-and-swap
while using ll sc to implement something like an atomic increment directly would be more efficient than using it to implement a compare-and-swap and then implementing an atomic increment using that compare-and-swap implementation in situations where one would need to do much between a load and store one should generally use ll-sc to implement a compare-and-swap and then use that compare-and-swap method in a load-modify-compareandswap loop

google-chrome	firefox
you can actually get the master-key data that you need from both firefox and google-chrome

15348252
jline	readline
this should disable jline and allow you to use the readline method the way you would expect displaying characters typed as you type them

15348258
children	parent
you can find the tag grab it s parent and find your upc in its children like this

15348271
mouse	keyboard
but i don t want people to have to move their hand from the keyboard to the mouse

15348310
free	malloc
the printf family function uses malloc and free so heap space is mandatory

15348394
post	get
this has definitely sparked my interest though and when i get a chance to work on this again i ll gladly update this post with any new information

15348416
oncreate	ondestroy
be sure to handle your thread properly though oncreate ondestroy etc

15348416
onresume	onpause
i also have a method in the surfaceview which sets it to true false which is triggered in the surrounding activity s onresume onpause

15348447
folder	directory
the only thing i came up with is to create folder permissions on the directory in which the visualsvn admin tool is located to only allow execute permissions to the two admins

15348464
pow	math.h
now if i call my version of _pow instead of pow from math.h the output is displayed as excepted

15348464
pow	math.h
if not pow from math.h can t be working correctly

15348467
mouse	keyboard
i came across code that adds custom events to detect input text changes originating from either a keyboard or mouse event

15348488
many-to-one	one-to-many
in our project developed using netbeans 7.2 we have several one-to-many relationship and we would like to navigate them the same way we navigate many-to-one ones

15348488
many-to-one	one-to-many
this represents our main entity person that has among the others a one-to-many relationship with email as well as with phone and a many-to-one relationship with accounttype

15348535
int	double
otherwise the problem you have is because pow returns a double or float while you compare it to an int

15348569
portrait	landscape
the entire content area must be split in two sections 50 each where each section must be a button without any rounded corners or spacing that can decrease or increase in size according to the device used and the layout of the device portrait or landscape

15348583
post	get
exploiting dom based xss and android is possible however the attack vectors are more limited because usually an attacker cannot exploit one of these vulnerabilities using a simple get or post request

15348607
width	height
i would like to modify the coordinates of this region thus increasing the height and width in a suitable way in order to extract a subimage with a specified aspect ratio

15348607
width	height
in order to avoid cutting the object incorrectly the width and height of the region must not be reduced

15348607
width	height
the width height ratio of the subimage should be approximately equal to the specified aspect ratio

15348607
width	height
width 392 and height 783 so the aspect ratio is equal to 0.5006

15348607
width	height
width 392 and height 784 so the aspect ratio is equal to 0.5

15348643
folder	directory
ok so i had a project that i wanted to completely restart so i deleted the folder in my workspace directory in finder

15348648
hid	joystick
to make your project appear as a joystick device in linux you ll want to present it using the bluetooth hid profile

15348648
bluetooth	usb
the bluetooth part of this is actually mostly just a thin wrapper around the usb hid protocol

15348682
accessor	properties
this.id is an expression since it is a properties accessor therefore it is a syntax error to use this.id as a formal parameter name

15348716
put	get
i put a breakpoint on the joptionpane line and when i click on the menu item in debug mode it doesn t even get to it

15348768

settimeout and setinterval are not defined in ecmascript specification because they are not javascript features

15348776
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this works in latest firefox google-chrome safari win and opera

15348843
post	get
the post redirect get pattern is one of best practices to design your web application navigation flow

15348857
opera	google-chrome
right now only opera google-chrome and ie10 are capable of rendering this layout

15348873
for-loop	loops
but another problem is that your inner for-loop can t be parallelized in this way because you re setting the tem variable from the value computed in the previous iteration of loops

15348912
width	height
the idea is to extend the width or the height

15348912
width	height
if w w then the resulting region is of width w height h and center p

15348912
width	height
else the resulting region is of width w height h w r and center p

15348989
integer	fractions
96-bit integer and specify what portion of it is a decimal fractions

15348989
integer	fractions
integer number and specify what portion of it is a decimal fractions

15348991
iboutlet	ibaction
i think that your problem is just that you have set the wrong file owner is login controller that holds the xib file thus it has all the iboutlet and ibaction bound

15349004
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
on the other hand if you just need to save and restore byte arrays you ll have a simpler time with just an objectoutputstream and objectinputstream

15349050
post	get
i don t know of a definitive one-liner in asp .net but you can get pretty close as shown in this forum post

15349065
button	checkbox
i am using uniform js for changing the background images of checkbox radio button select box

15349088
try-catch	exception-handling
shall i just try-catch the exception-handling in databaseadapter and add it to log

15349114
textblock	itemscontrol
my idea would have been to use an itemscontrol and set the itempanel to wrappanel then insert textblock or contentpresenters for each item

15349166
hide	show
currently i m trying to hide some table rows and have a toggle link that show and hide them when the link is clicked

15349310
ubuntu	linux
i do the following at it works correctly on ubuntu linux and windows 7

15349383
lwjgl	jogl
java game studios and developers who seek the best performance can archive it by tightly controlling opengl by using jogl or lwjgl directly

15349451
hash	md5
wordpress will for legacy compatibility reasons default to an md5 hash

15349451
hash	md5
basically when a password is passed to word press it runs the wordpress phpass hash this will fail for something like md5 123 then wordpress will try other simpler hash algorithms like sha1 and finally md5

15349451
hash	salt
apparently wordpress is running salt appended blowfish hash about 8000 times over to generate the final hash result

15349460
equals	tostring
i am asked to create an override file for equals .compareto and tostring

15349474
portrait	landscape
all i am trying to do is switch from landscape to portrait orientation in the same document

15349514
src	attr
by using attr src function i v the old value gets passed in as an argument and you can return the modified inside the function

15349555
min	max
for parametric equations you should iterate over t from t min to t max

15349595
put	get
when i put fusion into unity view i get a strange and very annoying behavior from vs 2010 as i type when an intellisense window pops up it steals the keyboard focus

15349609
superclass	subclassing
an instance method in a subclassing with the same signature name plus the number and the type of its parameters and return type as an instance method in the superclass overrides the superclass s method

15349609
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
the ability of a subclassing to override a method allows a class to inherited from a superclass whose behavior is close enough and then to modify behavior as needed

15349616
portrait	landscape
as i mentioned in my comment to him stageorientation.default refers to the default orientation of the device but you don t know if that is landscape or portrait

15349616
width	height
you simply see if the device is in default upside down orientation and check that against the width height

15349658
folder	directory
i also tried getting to the specific htdocs folder for my mamp directory and when i did ls -a in the terminal this is what i got back

15349668
folder	directory
in git we can rename the directory and then commit but the history will still show the older folder

15349692
post	get
when i attempt to implement code similar to that described in the codex i either get none of my post or i get all of my post

15349696
width	height
a fairly simple programmatic approach would be to add an event listener to the window resize event and calculate the height width and appropriate resize the image div

15349701
equals	tostring
every java class inherits equals hashcode and tostring from the class object

15349701
equals	tostring
try to write new implementations of these methods in your class so tostring returns the romannumber as letters equals to return if the other object is als a romannumber and has the same value and respect the contract that two equals objects need to have the same hashcode

15349709
punctuation	words
my problem is that it shuffles words with punctuation at the beginning or end of words incorrectly

15349709
punctuation	words
i need it to shuffle so that the punctuation remains in the correct index and then keeps the first and last letter of the words and shuffles the inside of the words adding punctuation at the end if there is one

15349719
telerik	radcombobox
i ve two telerik radcombobox controls while adding of their items using the following code

15349777

15349811
versioning	upgrade
i would suggest the easiest option for you is to upgrade to the last stable versioning of sf1.3 sf1.3.11 and using the bundled sf10compatplugin to help you emulate the sf1.0 features you use in the existing app while adding the sf1.2+ features you desire from the sf1.3 core

15349836
google-chrome	firefox
after thinking about what i was asking and wanting to do is pretty much what we already can find on the built in browser web developer tools such as google-chrome or firefox

15349851
folder	directory
supposed everything is in the gallery folder which itself is located in the www root directory

15349885
prop	each
it gives orderby for each property prop that you might want to order by

15349937

post	get
i have a collection that needs to post some data to its url to get the data it needs

15349949

but firebug still shows me a 404 error that is happening because a get is being executed against the url in question and the underlying rails route only allows post

15349996
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in google-chrome firefox ie7 but has weird spacing in ie8 ie9

15350015
post	get
actually the functions get post delete and so on were present

15350023
hash	md5
you also find out in your reconnaissance that the database is using md5 hash and is not

15350095
folder	directory
that under the directory . node_modules socket.io node_modules there appears the folder redis

15350107
hash	md5
md5 is a one-way hash function and theoretically cannot be reversed

15350107
hash	salt
if you know for a fact that the password hash were not salt then you would have to use a rainbow table to seek out any possible matches

15350107
hash	md5
there are numerous online tools that do this such as ben ramsey s reverse md5 hash lookup

15350110
post	get
in such a scenario all the low level stuff is handled by the external hardware and is offered to you by a web-service like interface via get post

15350139
folder	directory
or you could even have it where if the program was started initially as a superuser then it saves it to the system folder otherwise it saves it to the user s application directory

i m not sure what a --quiet cron job is and i m also not sure of the difference between like wget and curl again i know zero about cron jobs

15350298
uicollectionview	uitableview
as long as you use default ui components uinavigationcontroller uitableview uicollectionview etc. you usually don t need to worry about the status bar height at all

15350298
portrait	landscape
most devices up to the iphone x have a 20pt height in portrait landscape

15350310
width	height
zooming has a similar effect to resizing the window so i think correct me if i m wrong but you can use a resize event to update the overlays width and height

15350421
post	get
you defined your route to respond to get requests and your form is sending a post request

15350421
post	get
try changing the method of your route from get to post

cron jobs are nothing mysterious

15350507
width	height
note that you do not need to be specifying any of height auto position absolute width 100 as these are the defaults for the elements where you had them applied to

15350545
hide	show
show hide

15350590
oncreate	onstart
this is obviously wrong as oncreate is executed before onstart

15350609
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
my initial idea was to use a discriminator based mapping for modelling the inherited with each subclassing containing a join with a properties ref i.e

15350633
rss	feed
the other thing you can do is publish the the spreadsheet to an atom or rss feed

15350647

the relationship between order and item is not many-to-many probably not the case because orders and items usually have a one-to-many relationship

15350689
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
then generate methods that will allow these numbers to add multiplying subtract and divide

15350689

15350767
postgresql	mysql
don t use mysql specific syntax it s outdated and can get you into real trouble later on especially if you decide to use sqlite or postgresql

15350767
prepare	execute
now you should construct a query that can be used as a prepare query that is it accepts prepare statements so that you prepare the query and then you execute an array of variables that are to be put execute into the query and will avoid sql injection in the meantime

15350776
int	double

goto	break
then he decided to get rid of the goto s and change it to break from a do while loop

15350874
goto	break
it just uses break as a goto mechanism to jump to the code after the do while loop

15351016
uiview	subviews
this uiview has a weak pointer to a subviews uiimageview

15351057
uiview	subviews
you use weak property on subviews when they re expected to be created and directly added to a view subviews hierarchy uiview addsubview already keeps a strong reference to the view

15351082
subtraction	addition
i was hoping there would be a better way that doesn t require the needless addition and subtraction

15351098
uiview	subviews
this uiview has a weak pointer to a subviews uiimageview

15351098
uiview	subviews
if the uiimageview is a subviews of the uiview then the uiview has a strong pointer to the uiimageview

15351205
floating-point	integer
moving the integer part of y into the exponent field of a floating-point encoding

15351223

15351422
width	margin
the bars extend to the width of the page and the text div is overlaid on top of them with a margin around it

15351431
strlen	strcpy	memcpy	strcpy
i use this solution mainly for performance reasons when i have frequently called functions and want to save strlen calls or replace strcpy with simple memcpy

15351448
ioexception	bufferedwriter
you can use a bufferedwriter instead which will throw ioexception or you can do something like what i ve done here and make a copy of bufferedwriter that throws unchecked exceptions

15351450
profiling	benchmarking
so if you have lots as in 10gb or so of small pieces of data then it might be worthwhile compressing the data by yourself but always profiling and benchmarking first

15351494
multiplying	add
you should add log probabilities instead of multiplying probabilities

15351505
rsa	aes
the jre 1.5 and above ships with standard encryption algorithms such as aes and rsa

15351598
sequence	permutation
strictly speaking those are not permutation but rather sequence over a finite domain

15351617
webchromeclient	webviewclient
instead of creating a webviewclient you probably want a webchromeclient

15351715
put	get
so on the previous html page they put in 2 value their name and location then the php code above would get me their info what they inputted and will store it in the userswhobought.txt

15351728
submit	submission
if this form submit fails and the user clicks submit again two form submission requests are fired because the subscriptions stack in amplifyjs registered two subscriptions for registerinterest

now when the project is opened in eclipse it will have the egit decorations that show the repo branch status etc

15351795
mouseleave	mouseenter
also its better to use mouseenter and mouseleave see documentation mouseenter and mouseleave

15351802
postgresql	mysql
instead of looping through the data you need to directly manipulate the post data and then you can use it however you want but i would suggest looking into a database option like mysql postgresql or sqlite - you can even store data in nosql options like mongodb as well

15351838
int	boolean
i ve setup the new project called inno json config which allows you to work with simple json config files like shown below and which allows you to read and write string int and boolean values

15351842
rtsp	rtmp	rtp	rtsp	rtp	rtmp
it supports rtsp and rtp and not rtmp however it could support rtmp with some changes

15351849
int	double
i have a double split up into an int array however the problem i am facing is that i need it to fill in from the back like this

15351896
int	double
i use the following premises along with understood semantics such as that the int value of a b will be converted to double for the comparison with the other operand of

15351896
int	double
all int values are representable in double so ieee 754 requires that converting int to double be exact

15351896
int	double
each int at this magnitude and below is exactly representable as a double

15351915
rtp	rtsp
rtsp actually rtp can be used for streaming video but also many other types of media including live presentations

15351915

well it s cool code anyway...use select_by_single_pk one requires tuple support postgresql maybe mysql the other one strings out and or as well as a single pk approach

15352009
subtract	add
so i should be able to add subtract them then assign them to an index in the preallocated b array

config	ini
don t trust the php ini config the automatic expiration doesn t run on every request and you don t want it to it runs through every session on disk not just the current one

15352039
