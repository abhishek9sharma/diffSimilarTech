as it turned out the only way how i could get the info i need is just to manually install uninstaller all the frameworks to try all combinations combinations which make sense to determine the prerequisites

5765048
getter	setter
in your implementation or forgot to write custom getter and setter methods

5765066
superclass	subclassing
this superclass needs some device specific code so i was thinking of subclassing that and then ending up with the superclass automatically allocating or instantiating the device specific subclassing that s most suitable

5765352
getter	setter
events are in fact ready for consumption put very simply declaring an event is actually defining a getter setter for the underlying delegate and it is therefore not necessary to define explicit getter setter

5765388

i have a website that renders perfectly in safari firefox google-chrome and opera

5765497
hash	md5
as to the second question md5 sha1 password will actually reduce security compared to just using sha1 because the hash size will be reduced

5765532
put	get
when using jackson one of spring s default options for json processing you can specify renderedattributes so that not all fields of your model get put into the response json but only those you explicitly specify

5765567

rss	feed
i m working on a life-streaming type app in rails and am constantly parsing several different rss feed using feedzirra

5765598
rss	feed
ideally i d like to cache the array of results the rss feed returns and do some post-processing to them before i send it to the view

5765603
rss	feed
the easiest solution would be to get the rss or atom feed of the website you are trying to get data from

5765603
rss	feed
those are well-known formats and extracting informations from such xml feed would be much easier than getting it from an html page with rss atom you ll just have to parse the xml feed and extract the tags that contain informations that interest you

5766139
udp	tcp
this is not a client server that will be using udp tcp sockets

5766179

i m uploading some pdf files and .doc docx files in a project

5767092
gif	png
function works with solid jpeg gif and png images

5767183
setinterval	settimeout
since this is a repeating function execution you could use setinterval instead of settimeout and have a single repeated function call that checks to see if it should increment and re-display the count.

5767358
width	height
for example by default the width and height for glteximage2d must each be powers of 2 or powers of 2 plus 2 if you are using a border

note that the former limitation does not exist in ocaml because subtyping is structural instead of nominal so the structural type is easily refined via unification as type inference progresses

5767729
put	get	post	get	post	put
just because you have a result design doesn t mean you have to restrict yourself to only crud verbs that map 1 1 to get post put delete

margin	height
the layout i m looking for is one such that there is always a fixed padding margin height on the top and bottom of the page no matter the height of the content

5768031
width	height
this can result in problems when the width height ratio changes

5768033
division	multiplication
if you merely change multiplication to division in the function which results in a rational rather than integer result then this auto-compile does not happen and table is faster

5768186
button	checkbox
if you want to add only one radio button then use checkbox instead

5768193
int	double
primitives don t behave this way so if you were to do the same thing with a double or an int for instance it would behave the way you expect

google-chrome	firefox
it s working in firefox google-chrome and ie9 but in ie8 and below shadow is being applied to the input fields rather then the form itself

5768207
floating-point	fractions
also to get your calculation to work out right you should make the fractions you re multiplying by a floating-point number

5768219
google-chrome	firefox
once you sort that out ie and firefox should display the xml directly while google-chrome might need a bit of assistance

5768220
matlabpool	parfor
after that there s really not much redundancy left in what that code does so your only room left for improvement is to parallelize it if you have the parallel computing toolbox convert your outer loop to a parfor and before you run it say matlabpool n where n is the number of threads to use

5768284
ppl	tbb
since you already learned c++ you should use something more serious such as tbb or ppl

5768355
mouseleave	mouseenter
since the code i was using to simulate the dragging of an object involved getting the mouse position anyway i capitalized on the opportunity and wrote a code that checked whether or not the mouse s position on the canvas was mathematically within the boundaries of each of the objects i needed mouseenter mouseleave for

5768355

5768528
implements	extends
you can only inherit directly from one class extends but you can implements an arbitrary number of interfaces

5768628
for-loop	arrays
you could use a single for-loop and use the in_array construct in php to look for the value in an arrays -

5768642
min	max
so whenever i get a new point i do this assume i already got 2-10 and i get 3-15 then i pick the max of start and min of end so this case it is 3-10 and increment this interval s count to 2

5768642

5770757
return-value-optimization	nrvo
this optimization is typically called nrvo named return-value-optimization and it is slightly less common for compilers to implement it

5770757
return-value-optimization	nrvo
msvc always implements return-value-optimization and performs nrvo in release builds

5770757
return-value-optimization	nrvo
i believe recent versions of gcc always perform both return-value-optimization and nrvo

5770763
return-value-optimization	nrvo
of course the compiler could easily apply return-value-optimization nrvo here anyway because it can statically determine that you never call the function with nullptr and in addition the function could be trivially transformed so that return-value-optimization nrvo can be applied even if that couldn t be proven and finally that doesn t even prevent return-value-optimization nrvo as the result can still be constructed in

it s safe to use inherited when both subclassing and superclass are in the control of the same programmer but implementation inherited can lead to a fragile api

5770974
superclass	subclassing
as you mentioned if superclass implementation changes then subclassing can break or more worst - will do unintended things silently

5771487
hash	hmac
it is called hmac and involves two invocations of the underlying hash function but one of them is on a short input so this is efficient nonetheless

5771487
hash	hmac
security of hmac more precisely how hmac can be considered to behave as a random oracle can be proven reduced to some hash function internal properties which are believed true in the case of sha-256 see new proofs for nmac and hmac security without collision-resistance by mihir bellare for the gory details

pull	push
however i would want to at some stage allow users the ability to push or pull nations cities from each other s database

5771763
client-side	server-side
i have not personally built anything where i ve used the same template server-side and client-side but here is one way that i can think to do this

5771802
yesod	hamlet
27 816 downloads hamlet -- yesod framework templating

5771820
width	height
you can calculate the aspect ratio by doing window width over height if you wish

5771847
awt	swing
quite likely the java application actually uses swing not awt

5771880
goto	break
putting an empty gamedata.dat file into that dir on my mac and running it on the simulator now finds a file run it on the simulator but a break point in there and look at the full path and goto that dir in a shell and try it

5771918
udp	tcp
i ve always wanted to learn tcp or udp i hear udp sucks though in c# but i can never find any tutorial that can teach it

5771962
google-chrome	firefox

5772071
udp	tcp
they have a lot of tutorials with pretty good code samples about tcp udp communication among other things

5772075
put	get
but also you re trying to get array extra however you don t put it inside intent

5772096
udp	tcp
i think it s difficult to find tutorials for tcp and udp specifically because they are specific protocols although very frequently used and microsoft are trying to abstract all these concepts so that your application is not dependent of the underlying technology

5772144
udp	tcp
now tcp udp are fully separate items

5772144
udp	tcp
saying udp sucks would be quite ignorant towards a lot of programs i know that would never work with tcp and require the fast and easy data distribution of udp which contâ rary to tcp also supports multicast

5772193
int	chars
i would like to store 4 chars 4 bytes into an unsigned int

5772210
pascal	delphi
to obtain the proper long pascal string you need to recast the string to a pchar and let delphi convert it back again properly to a string

5772309
perforce	svn	perforce	cvs	cvs	svn
at the company i m with now well in excess of 10000 devs but i doubt more then 1000 are on what most people would think of as a single project although they are that many on a single product we have used cvs for historical reasons svn because it was an easy migration path svk nice at the time but i wouldn t recommend it mercurial sorry no direct experience perforce ditto and git

5772309
cvs	rcs
unless you get warped into the past and trapped there i wouldn t recommend rcs or cvs

5772309
cvs	svn
svn is stable and mature and branching is way way way faster then cvs seconds not minutes for a large project

5772309
perforce	svn
my second hand info about perforce is it is kind of better then svn and kind of not

5772311
children	parent
i don t think there is directly method to get sibling but its not that hard to get index in list of children of parent and getting next item

5772323

get widened to int or double if the argument is a float first

5772354

getter	setter
i found out why it didn t work all of my annotations extended a base annotation the base annotation then had a getter and a setter that failed when used in the proxy class

5772417
google-chrome	firefox
to take into account firefox webkit and google-chrome you d need to do something like this

5772419
getter	setter
and in asp.net i can simple run the linq to sql command on my database and get the whole schema of my class without typing out a custom class with getter and setter

5772456
preferenceactivity	preferencescreen
so the workaround recommends creating top level preferenceactivity for nested preferencescreen and then invoking this new activity via intent

5772594
ienumerable	ienumerator
the class implements ienumerable ienumerator and ienumvariant

dr when an image takes up 100 width and height and the user resizes their browser down the width and the height of the document don t change because the image keeps it from shrinking

5772703
width	height
i have a dynamically drawn svg image created by raphaeljs that takes up 100 of the screen width and height

5772703
width	height
the space it takes up includes space that is not visible but can be seen by scrolling so it s not just viewport width and height it is possible for it to go beyond that

5772703
width	height
basically the getdocwidth and -height needs to ignore the dimensions of the image when it calculates the width and height of the document

5772804
put	get
but something goes wrong when i get this table into my app and put it in a datatable

5772882
git-rebase	undo
usually you would use git-rebase --abort but that does some extra resetting that you probably want to avoid it moves head back to the original branch and resets it back to the original commit which will undo some of the work we did above

5772885
int	chars
however in practice a comparison of a simple value type such as a chars int float etc is likely to be atomic

5772885
atomic	interlocked
if you want proper guarantees there are various interlocked functions on windows and the atomic builtins on gcc

5772903
hex	binary
to convert from binary to hex convert to decimal first and then that to hex

5772969
selecteditem	selectedindex
i ve constructed a simple example displaying how i would process the eventhandler function if i was going to use the selectedindex property however it s the tab that has mouse focus which may or may not be the selecteditem that i d like to reference and i haven t been able to figure out a way to do it

5772974

interpretation of cluster number 0 and 1 are also filesystems specific in case of fat cluster number 0 represents an empty cluster in the file allocation table and cluster number 1 is reserved

5774557

dictionary	map
dictionary map so you may store any strongly typed array also while not having to worry about needing to convert one array to another now it s just type casting

5774843
oncreate	onstart
it s more elegant to create an interface with oncreate and onstart methods instead if you need force others to override in their implementation

5774870
oncreate	onstart
however you can create abstract functions myoncreate and myonstart and call those in your abstract class implementation of oncreate and onstart

5774870
oncreate	onstart
you might also want to make oncreate onstart final although it s difficult to see what the benefit is of forcing myoncreate instead of oncreate

5775555
background-image	background-position
each li tag in the dropdown menu is a div that also uses background-image and background-position to have a rollover effect shown below

5775555
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the site displays and functions 100 correctly in firefox rollovers on the top-level options and the drop-down menu being displayed below the horizontal rule but unfortunately that appears to be the only browser both google-chrome and safari stagger the list which breaks the whole thing

if i add the detailview and a subview at the same time ie add the detailview to the splitviewcontrollers array of views then the sizes are correct but if i simple insert a subview onto the already existing detailview then the size either works in portrait and not in landscape or vica versa ie i think the autoresize does not work

5775975

put	get
currently we are migrating to put all the 3rd party libraries and headers into a 3rdparty subfolder into our repository - that way they are always in the same place and everyone is building against the same version and if you have to build an old branch then you will get the correct library versions automatically when switching to the branch

when fetching the texture but the following the same array with its width and height switched works well

5778144
dbcontext	objectcontext
efextensions are for objectcontext api so you will have to check if it is also usable for dbcontext api

5778209
folder	directory
if you want to give image path out of project directory you should have server root directory path and image_folderpath for example image folder is available at home ror image_folder like that you can access from that directory

5778300
automapper	structuremap
the code you are referencing looks like automapper not structuremap

5778311

my issue is to get the width height and position of all the child panels and pass them to the server side when i click on a save button

5778417
client-side	server-side
so you have two kinds of validation client-side and server-side

5778417
client-side	server-side
server-side is the most important and i view client-side validation of more as a feature

5778426
datalist	repeater
replace your lbname by a linkbuton and set is as a command in the ggridview_rowcommand event and use e.commandname and e.commandargument to manually bind the controls in the modal popup in code behind you may use a repeater or a datalist that bind to a datasource that return only one item if you don t want to handle all things manually

5778442
cos	sin
the nice thing about this is that you should also be able to extend it to simd easily so that you could compute the sin or cos of 4 values at one 2 if you re using double precision

5778453
n-gram	words
split each tweets by space into n-gram up to 3 gram if you want 3 words length array

outputstream	inputstream
i am on the stage of development where i have two modules and from one i got output as a outputstream and second one which accepts only inputstream

5778679
client-side	server-side
any variables declared in javascript at the client-side are totally oblivious to the server-side code hence the compiler is trying to find the convid at the server-side code and obviously can t find it

5778707
post	get
with jquery it s the same thing you just need to tell jquery which http method you will be using get or post and direct it to a php script that will process the data

the equals and gethashcode method i added but didn t help

5778723
atof	strtod
strtod and not atof

5778733
equals	gethashcode
it will depend on the implementations of gethashcode and equals on the medbaseid class

5778733
equals	gethashcode
whenever you override equals you must also override gethashcode for them to work correctly inside a hashing data structure like

5778739
equals	gethashcode
for to work properly either medbaseid must be a struct or you have to define a field based equality on your class medbaseid by overriding equals and gethashcode

5778747
width	height
traditional fiducial markers can only be read to 10x their width height so if you wanted to use markers to determine a building from far away they d have to be huge

5778757
equals	gethashcode
specifically in order to be considered equals two objects must possess the same hash code as returned by gethashcode and must return true for equals two virtual overridable methods found on the object base class

5778757
equals	gethashcode
override equals and gethashcode on medbaseid

5778787
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to versioning 1.3 and it got better

also here scroll to universal simd-mathlibrary if you need to calculate sin cos for large arrays

5779059
cos	sin
note that there is a nice sincos functions which return both sin and cos

5779069
cos	sine
quake 3 s source has some code for precomputed sine cos aimed at speed over precision its not sse based that thus quite portable both on architecture and intrinsic api

5779119
google-chrome	firefox
the problem here is that this code works in internet explorer but not in firefox or google-chrome

5779382
width	height
app is crashing when i set the scrollview width and height like this

for example if you always need sin and cos of the same value calculate them close to each other in the code and make sure that your compiler translates them into a fsincos assembly instruction see this question

5779386
google-chrome	firefox
tested in google-chrome firefox 4 and ie9

i would venture to say there is a hard and fast rule well as much as there can be - the post redirect get prg pattern

5779574
filtering	grouping
i can add a locale column or state field also add a column filtering by grouping

5779587

note the selectors api is only available in newer browsers starting with internet explorer 8 firefox 3.5 safari 3.1 google-chrome 1 and opera 10

5779610
rss	feed
universal feed parser is probably the best library for parsing rss feed in python

5779702
children	parent
i prefer not to do that because it kind of defeats the point of inheritance if i can t define in the parent half the fields that all children share

5779709
folder	directory
i ve checked the directory where all the code is and the sub folder

5779722
implements	extends
i have been given the task of running two threads one using extends and one using implements runnable the output is meant to be similair to this

5779823
dbcontext	objectcontext
objectcontext offers method which is equivalent of on dbcontext

5779852
for-loop	loops
well it turns out that for smaller values of k around 50 or less the for-loop solution actually wins out showing once again that for loops are not as evil as they used to be considered in older versions of matlab

5779854
implements	extends
i m not what this assignment has got to do with implements runnable or extends thread since they give you the same end-result

5779867

5779941
pull	push
the problem is missing triggers for push pull operations

5779983
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
my suggestion to you would be to find an appropriate malloc realloc free source code such that you can implement your own malloc_first alongside the others in the same source module and using the same memory structures which simply allocates and returns the first available block greater than or equal to a passed minimum_bytes parameter

5780003
queue	fifo
a queue is an ordered fifo data structure

5780011
opera	safari
of course how often older versions of opera and safari show up in the visitor logs varies with each site so may not be ideal for all

war	manifest.mf	maven	pom.xml
i need to have maven insert the version number from the pom.xml file into the manifest located in the war file under web-inf manifest.mf

5780428
jar	war
i was able to easily file documentation for doing this in a jar file using the maven-jar-plugin but that does not work on a war file

5780436
getter	setter
having magic handling like that can allow you to do some neat stuff like even making read only properties and can prevent you from bloating your class with a messy load of getter setter

5780457
getter	setter
in the tutorial you ve linked to the getter and setter get set up to automatically call the appropriate individual get set functions

5780472
getter	setter
if you make your own getter and setter you ll be making two functions for each property getpropname and setpropname

5780472
getter	setter
by using php s magic method setter getter you don t write individual methods for each property

5780472
getter	setter
i personally prefer to do as you do and write separate methods for each property that i need a complex getter setter

5780555
jboss	glassfish
so if you re using a servlet 3.0 container tomcat 7 glassfish 3 jboss 6 etc and your web.xml is declared conform servlet 3.0 spec then you should be able to access it as follows

qdialog	qwidget
to this end i was calling qwidget adjustsize on the qdialog before displaying it but it doesn t work as expected

5780659
implements	extends
the best you can hope for here is that if your various kinds of model classes all implements the same interface or perhaps all extends from the same abstract parent class you can put the interface or abstract class name as the return type

5780659
implements	extends
however if your various concrete model classes do properly implements a top-level interface or extends from a common abstract parent class then using the interface abstract as the return type will allow for some level of autocomplete to work in the ide

5780678
peer	p2p
create a peer program that is able to join the p2p network

5780708
int	chars
as you use fscanf to read input into a chars array you can iterate over that array and apply atoi to each element and put the output an int into your int array

5780742
opera	google-chrome
it works without problem in ff4 opera 11.01 and google-chrome 10

5780742
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox opera and google-chrome it works without a problem but in ie9 it now gets the values but it does not put them in the drop down menu it just prints them as actual text

5780752
int	chars
the hh length modifier indicates that the pointer is a pointer to chars very short int rather than a pointer to int

5780797
folder	directory
if your zend folder is at or above the level of your application directory then just using --directory path to application should help you document only your application code

5780797
folder	directory
if your zend folder is somewhere inside your application in your app s . lib folder then you can use the -i --ignore option 2 to tell phpdocumentor about any directory that it will see but should ignore

the only difference is this code is called from a get request while the problematic code above is called from a post request

5780856
post	get
when i changed this code so that it s called from a get request instead of a post request it works fine

5780899
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
if you are in the position to change browsers i would consider using google-chrome tested gives normal url or opera tested normal url but not firefox tested gives funky url

5780924
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the icons are aligned properly in google-chrome and safari but in ie and firefox they are not

5780924
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is because in ie and firefox the footer link text is larger than in google-chrome and safari therefore the margins that i ve set up for the icons do not work

5781284
unsigned	short	int	chars
â signed or unsigned can be combined with chars long short or int

5781328
children	parent
in the .net 2.0 provider container model you needed to explicitly add child objects to parent containers and finding a service would be a recursive check from children to parent containers

5781341
post	get
in fact you can trivially handle post requests with the app engine using the dopost method and you can very easily get the client s ip address in a very similar manner as your php script

5781355
google-chrome	firefox
in both google-chrome and firefox the dom produces either required as the attribute no value or empty value

5781355
google-chrome	firefox
the only thing i can think of is that my google-chrome v10 and firefox v4 are now both sufficiently advanced that they re recognizing the required attribute as an html5 reserved keyword

5781355
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox are perfectly fine setting if you use setattribute

some other things in lucene apply to a field as a whole or index as a whole and you should know that they can t be really changed on a per-customer basis if you grouping indexes together things like omittf if you set it on a single document for a field its omitted across the board for that field similarity in any released version of lucene you can only set similarity across the board so customers wouldn t be able to tune the ranking model spellchecking you would have to hack something up where each customer has their own filtering spellcheck index .

5785434

if it were strictly innodb i could do mysqldump with --single-transaction but that option warns me that myisam may still be changed

5785434
innodb	myisam
do a full dump of the slave while no changes are being made to it myisam or innodb

hash	md5
take the first 4 bytes of the md5 hash of the user s login name

5785572
hash	md5
take the first 4 bytes of the md5 hash of the user s login name

5785572
hash	md5
xor these together to produce the first 4 bytes of the md5 hash of the 14-digit binary string

5785572
hash	md5
there s a small chance that the first 4 bytes of the md5 hash of all those 14-digit binary strings will not be distinct

5785572
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
if you re concerned about savvy users being able to fake their own progress codes by undoing the xor of someone else s progress code and re- xor ing with the md5 hash of their own username you can always salt the usernames first by appending a fixed string known only to you to each username

5785576

java works similarly to using byref for all variables that are not primitive types such as int double etc

5785594

the size of a view is expressed with a width and a height

5786040
width	height
a view actually possess two pairs of width and height values

5786040
width	height
the first pair is known as measured width and measured height

5786040
width	height
the second pair is simply known as width and height or sometimes drawing width and drawing height

5786040

these values may but do not have to be different from the measured width and height

5786248
width	height
if you specify only the width of the image the height will automatically be adjusted to keep the aspect ratio and vica-versa

5786248
width	height
so remove the css height declarations or the width declarations depending on what should determine the size

5786248
width	height
eg tall skinny windows should have the width as the deciding dimension and height should be used for wide short windows

5786248
width	height
i think i got the css syntax correct and the width height would have to be defined using css not attributes

5786250

only give it a width or height and it will keep its aspect ratio

5792443
setinterval	settimeout
with a few exceptions it is generally considered a safer bet to use settimeout and invoking the settimeout again after execution of the callback instead of setinterval

5792443
setinterval	settimeout
and since the timers are only approximate anyway just because you specify 10ms doesn t mean it will happen at exactly 10ms you don t typically gain anything from using setinterval over settimeout

5792495
cstdio	iostream
yes iostream is slower than cstdio

children	parent
css selectors only select target children or descendants for performance purposes if you could target parent like in jquery the browser would have to wait to render any of the page until it had processed all child nodes

5792614

5793272
stdout	stderr
redirect your application s stdout stderr to the named pipe

5793291
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
as a best practise when making any content for the web you should be checking compatibility on at least the 3 main browsers ie google-chrome firefox and probably some of the others safari

5793291
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox and ie newer versions all have tools for this kind of thing and or free plug-ins

5793291
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
you will find in ie8 that the behaviour is better than ie7 and ie6 but still far from perfect but should notice that the behaviour across firefox google-chrome safari etc is fairly consistent

dpkg-reconfigure php or dpkg-reconfigure php5 works on debian linux -- which is the base for ubuntu as far as i know so give that a go

5793842
margin	text-indent
update - ive set the padding margin and text-indent to 0 but no luck

5793879
xsl-fo	xslt
xslt xpath and xsl-fo

5793889
getter	setter
well a lot of people will insist for example that you should never have public variables in your classes only public methods and that public variables should be emulated using getter setter functions

5793935
subtract	addition
when the alu gets a command to subtract it is given 2 numbers - it makes a not to every bit of the second number and makes a simple addition and adds 1 more because 2 s complement is not to every bit +1

i tried the sed version both on my mac laptop and my mac desktop and then i tried it on our solaris server and on our openbsd server

5794213
hash	md5
the two strings are base64 representations of a 128 bit value so it might be some sort of 128-bit hash of the input but it doesn t seem to be as simple as md5 of the input string

5794217
width	height
just copies and resamples the image1 into the first half width wise and then copies the second image into the second half width wise if you wanted to do it by stacking on height it would just be changing where the dest_h is

5794217
width	height
if they are laid horizontally then the width would be and the height would be and opposite if the images are stacked vertically

5794229
rfcomm	l2cap
it s l2cap but i guess it s also possible for rfcomm

5794270

int	double
like calling act int for all integral types and act double for all floating point types then you d be back down to just two required overloads per implementation plus whatever additional ones you need for that specific use case

5794537
int	double
or use boost variant and restrict yourself to int double and strings

5794539
serializable	deserialization
btw the serializable works just fine it s just the deserialization that doesnt work

5794574

5794578
fgets	fgetc
of course to get a full line of input rather than a single character you d need fgets instead of fgetc

5794620
ant	maven
but you can use maven with flex mojos or ant script to run tests from command line or you can write and support your own test suites and test runner manually and run tests as an ordinary flex application right from flash builder standard

5794633
keydown	keyup
i ve chosen blur as the update event because this event must occur when switching tabs as the source textbox will lose focus and it involves the fewest updates to other inputs compared to using something like keyup keydown or keypress

5794652

if your code is using a lot of activex stuff you might be in for a shocker that safari firefox google-chrome will not be able to do certain things

5794678
express	node.js
try to look at connect and express node.js modules

5794680
fink	macports
i believe the standard usr bin du takes care of this file system compression so if you do not use macports or fink to install an old version of du this should not be the cause of the problem .

5794686
serializable	deserialization
the actual class i want to deserialize to is exactly the same in each assembly version but on deserialization because the objects are serializable include the assembly name they came from the binaryformatter is complaining that it can t find the right assembly

because drawing is an expensive thing to do however it only gets done once per pass specifically at the end of the run loops which doesn t happen until your for-loop ends

5794986
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
you need to use a for-loop check the value of each item in the arrays and return true if you find one otherwise return false after loops exits

5794990

5795113
width	height
that s destination x y width and height

5795113
width	height
in my box example you change the width and height of fillrect instead here you should just be changing the dw and dh values of drawimage

5795113
width	height
so on line 32 of your transform.js file instead of 150 150 for the dw dh values there should be the equivalent of a saved and modified width and height just like in my demo

5795121
ienumerable	ienumerator
it s using the ienumerable and ienumerator interfaces

kde	gnome
something like the slider that appears in kde and gnome when you press volume or brightness control buttons

5796020

google-chrome	firefox
the results work great in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

exponent	modulo
i would check that the modulo and exponent match between the openssl version of the public key and the .net version

5796121
exponent	modulo
i m pretty sure that this order der order is what you find in the rsacryptoserviceprovider modulo array 0 0xb4 1 0x04 etc. also you can verify the exponent the second integer showing above as 01 00 01.

children	parent
first off the second part of the sentence is no longer true for qt 4.1 where a parent may paint behind its children

now about the second part of the sentence in older qt versions the child widgets would first fill their area with the background color image thus effectively clipping the parent s painting to outside the union of all children s geometries

5796327
getter	setter
prefer having an instance field called firstname that has a getter and a setter rather than accessing the string values directly from the httpservletrequest

something not mentioned yet is that inlining of big functions into other big functions can cause excessive register spilling hurting not only the the quality of the compiled code but also adding more overhead than was eliminated by the inline and it max even screw up global and local optimization heurstics iirc msdn has a warning about this under __forceinline

5810513
outputstream	inputstream
writing file from inputstream to outputstream by reading bytes

5810524
inherited	properties
you cannot treat scale as a is-a product if the important difference is additional properties - that makes the exposed interface of scale different than product and at that point inherited simply gets in your way

if you use a separator that the .net serializable framework emits then obviously you will make it difficult if not impossible to correctly determine where the breaks between objects are leading to deserialization failures

5812376
bufferedreader	printwriter
t_recv is a thread that receives from bufferedreader in and t_send sends using a printwriter out

5812404
hash	salt
the reason it doesn t help hackers too much obviously knowing how one is made is beneficial is that if they find a password to a system that is hash 2fcab58712467eab4004583eb8fb7f89 they need to know the original string used to create it and also if any salt was used

5812449

5812498
cpu	processors
in a 64-bit computer most recent amd and intel processors fall into this category the cpu is optimized to handle 64-bit values at a time

5812498
16-bit	64bit
conversely on a 64bit platform 16-bit integers would need to have 48 bits zeroed 32-bit integers would need to have 32 bits zeroed and 64bit integers could be operated on immediately

5812498
cpu	processors
each platform and cpu has a native bit-ness like 32 or 64 and this usually limits some of the other resources that can be accessed by that cpu for example the 3gb 4gb memory limitation of 32-bit processors

5812498
x86	64bit
the 80386 processor family and later x86 processors made 32-bit the norm but now companies like amd and then intel are currently making 64bit the norm

5812640
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i have ascertained that one or more items is being shed from the main form s components while this loops is executing so eventually loops tries to access one past the end of the arrays once this has happened presumably it would be better to code this as a downto for-loop to prevent this

5812646
textview	imageview
in an activity i have three views among others a textview an imageview and a linearlayout--the latter i call controlsview

listview	gridview
i am assuming you want to get the phone numbers from a form which contains a listview or gridview and write them to a file or some other control

5812888
for-loop	loops
the fix is to use a copy like greg says or you can fake a c-style for-loop with a counter and a while loops

5812916
xlib	xcb
in fact xcb was created precisely because xlib was too high-level masking too much underneath so it was easy to make mistakes and making it difficult or impossible to have full control

run this clever o wh algorithm for determining the largest rectangle but instead of tracking just the single largest rectangle for each x y location record in a w h matrix the width and height of one or all of the largest rectangles whose top-left corner is x y updating these values as you go

5813015
width	height
loop through this matrix adding each sufficiently-large rectangle in it to a max-heap ordered by area width height

5813015

the first function will show the text on first click and the second function will hide the text on second click and so on.

5813280
free	malloc
however if you choose to use malloc to allocate a block of memory you must use free to deallocate it

5813280
free	malloc
using delete on a malloc d memory block or free on a new d memory block results in undefined behaviour

5813280
free	malloc
in fact some implementations of new and delete use malloc and free under the hood but that s compiler-dependent so don t ever do it

5813280
free	malloc
note that you can use malloc and free in the same program but that is not recommended because you could easily forget which one allocated a specific block of memory and use the wrong deallocation function on it

5813356
sorting	grouping
i feel that perhaps your problem is how to grouping or select on time + 1 hr rather than sorting

5813385
melt	reshape
you can do this by combining melt from reshape package upper.tri etc.

5813393
ready	each
try a social engineering approach to your managers desire to not use branches - use git with each feature done in it s own git clone and pushed into the release clone when it s ready

5813393

5813695
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
error along with runtimeexception their subclasses are unchecked-exception

5813695
try-catch	exception-handling
a programmer is expected to check for these exception-handling by using the try-catch block or throw it back to the caller

5813695
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
do note that although errors are unchecked-exception we shouldn t try to deal with them but it is ok to deal with runtimeexception also unchecked-exception in code

scriptaculous slide is working and jquery slide stops working

5813744
jquery	scriptaculous
jquery starts working and scriptaculous slide stops working

5813744
jquery	scriptaculous
that only forces jquery to work no matter what order it and it makes scriptaculous stop working

5813747
width	height
i want to resize images but it should keep the height width ratio when doing the resizing

5813747
width	height
what i do is first i check whether which side width or height is the long

5813747
width	height
if the width is long i ll give 150 to the width s size and resize the height without affecting to the shape of the image and vise versa

5813747
width	height
in this case one side of width or height the image is 150 and other side is less than 150 vary from image to image

5813785
implements	extends
and this textview has top be updated from another class which extends an adapter class and implements gesturedetector

5813964
submit	submission
i would suggest you to get the form of the row and submit it rather than submission all the forms using the form selector

5814086
lpwstr	bstr
i believe that the default marshaling chosen for strings is bstr and _tuchar should expand to wchar_t so i d guess that lpwstr is the correct marshalling method pointer to a wide character string

5814124
int	chars
it s casting the port pointer to a volatile unsigned chars 8 bit int

5814128
jquery	scriptaculous
i think this is what derek above was trying to say --- once you ve called .noconflict jquery releases the variable back into the open for scriptaculous to use for example

5814184
setinterval	settimeout
the second is the settimeout and setinterval functions available on the window object in a web browser

5814184

5814235
google-chrome	safari
i have same problems with google-chrome and safari

5814252
implements	extends
or make your loginthread extends thread instead of implements runnable

5814259
int	chars
the problem is that in c register originally meant storing values in a register which is why only int and chars can be used for it

5814272
atomic	interlocked
the atomic operation implementations differ depending on the specific target platform windows uses the win32 interlocked apis some platforms use various inline assembly etc

5814312
spawn	execv
in my program i am spawn child processes by using fork and execv

5814332
int	chars
so the chars will be converted to int which is 32

5814335
google-chrome	safari
to prove my point try actually going to google.com and opening up firebug or inspector if you re using safari or google-chrome and doing

5814350
queue	fifo
the only way to overcome this is to create a dual data structure which has all items in the dictionary mirrored in a queue for fifo or a stack for lifo

5814421
hide	show
this way you can manage when and what to show when to hide etc

5814440
int	chars
the chars has that value 32 on int you need to diference when put a blank or not

5814490
cvs	rcs

5814757
post	get
i have no problem to get login.html but i have a problem with post request on login.action

5814862
listview	gridview
if it s gridview or listview a lazy loading implementation will do the work

5814876
width	height
column s get a bit funny with items that don t declare their width and height

5814876
width	height
try hard coding the width and height in your image in your second example and it should work

5814900
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
it s just a bit of syntax that lets you specify the ivar that you want to use to back the properties for which you re telling the compiler to create accessor

5814900
accessor	properties
update as of the middle of 2013 llvm defaults to synthesizing accessor for properties so in most cases you no longer need to specify synthesize at all

5814905
rsa	aes
in both cases the plaintext has been encrypted using aes256 the only place rsa is actually used is to encrypt the key that has been used for the aes operation

5814970
children	parent
most nodes can be parent of children and children of other parent

5814992

i thought tsunami is based on udp but still having some features like that of tcp tcp fairness friendlyness etc

5815688
oncreate	recreate	oncreate	ondestroy
the expected behaviour for an unhandled orientation change is to recreate the activity which means going through the entire activity lifecycle ondestroy oncreate and so forth - obviously the reason your label is being reset

5815688
portrait	landscape
one activity is locked to portrait as it makes no sense to view it in landscape by setting the screenorientation flag in the manifest

5815704

i have experience with using mstest and nunit

5815939
nunit	mstest
from my experience mstest is much slower than nunit

5815939
nunit	mstest
note that i have run the mstest unit tests through the integrated vs gui which is probably why it s so slow compared to the light-weight nunit gui

5815939

5822594
onclick	onchange
you might want to use onchange instead of onclick onclick will probably be called before the value on the given checkbox is changed

5822657
int	boolean	int	chars
the reason std vector is nonconforming is that it pulls tricks under the covers in an attempt to optimize for space instead of storing a full chars or int for every bool taking up at least 8 times the space on platforms with 8-bit chars it packs the boolean and stores them as individual bits inside say chars in its internal representation

5822763
stdout	stderr
i have been trying to figure out a way to take the tomcat 5.5 stderr and stdout log files and roll them over when they get too large but i have been unable to do so

5822763
stdout	stderr
this is just the stdout and stderr logs that are automatically created by tomcat

5822763

free	malloc
otherwise you run the risk of using stdlib malloc in one place and then your own free in another leading to messy bugs

5822862
post	get
use post method in the form this is default in codeigniter - so action url will not be populated with the get string

5822867

the above code wont work because at first the element is empty and it moves to .show method.what i want to acheive is either on the oncomplete or onload how can i check using js jquery that the content or the element is loaded fully so that i can show if the content is loading and hide when the content is fully loaded

5822891
dlsym	dlopen
in linux for example in order for your functions to co-exist if you want to use system malloc in your own implementation of malloc you have to open the standard library manually using dlopen look up functions you need there using dlsym and call them later by address

5822935
let	curry
let s say i have a curry function

5822935
put	get

you can use a slightly different approach and derive once from elementhost and manipulate your wpf user-controls instances as they are instantiated

5823409
put	get
i would just get list of all .txt files is directory using os.listdir then read and parse all of them and finally put all information in some database

5823411
distance	polygons
you could just add two more planes at your depth buffer distance and use those to further filter out visible polygons

5823441
put	get
why you put in is the same object that you get back out

5823496
error-handling	exception-handling
errors vs exception-handling â â methods are inconsistent in which they use thanks again to cof design and error-handling is half-baked

5823539
disk	ram
if your ram is all filled up and your os is paging to disk your performance will be quite dreadful

5823633

you can choose between a get and a post in a form

5823793
public	protected
that varaiable need to either be public or it needs to be in the same package and not private or it must be a protected variable in a superclass

5823834

best practice code states that if the variable is not a static final then you should create getter setter inside the class

5823860
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

5823869
udp	tcp
udp sockets are connectionless so there is no real sense of openness state attached to them - this is unlike tcp sockets where a socket may be in any number of connection states as determined by the exchange of packets up to a given point

5823894
uilabel	uibutton
each one of these subviews is composited of several different components several uilabel a uiimageview and some uibutton

5823912
postgresql	mysql
the problem is that i need to make the code work for mysql mssql postgresql oracle and sqlite

client-side	server-side
you could do this server-side or since you are using html 5 and assuming you have the canvas available you could do this on the client-side

5824152
width	height
however this will make you have to have a static width height on theelement or it will change size when you change the text

5824155
icmp	tcp
regarding this async errors means if you send something and that send call results in an error occuring later when the tcp ip stack actually sends the packet or an icmp packet is later returned a subsequent send will return that error

5824155
icmp	udp
the linux udp 7 manpage suggest errors are returned whether the socket is connected or not but testing shows this is not the cases at least when a sent udp packet generates an icmp error

5824155
icmp	udp
if you connect your udp socket and send to a port noone is listening to an icmp packet is normally returned and a subsequent send call will fail with errno set to econnrefused

5824177
put	get
my initial thought is that there might be some way to put a buffer in front of the actual invokes to the ui thread to make sure that the gui does not get overloaded or when it does to back off the dispatches to it

5824201
implements	extends
implements a windowlistener or extends windowadapter use the windowclosing if errors in the process should prevent the window from closing or something like that or windowclosed method

5824209
post	get
wmi can be used to get the status of the web server see this post for an example

5824230
getter	setter
what i think is strange is that as soon as i remove the getter setter the application crashes on launch and spring complains about the missing setter getter which leads me to think that the xml-configuration is in fact correct

5824259
maven	pom.xml
the correct pom.xml file to do that is provided on some github project such as the maven guide fr

5824263
mouse	keyboard

g++	gcc
when i had a bunch of files mixed c++ and c code i just compiled everything using gcc because g++ by default treats .c as being c++ code which breaks the build when the c code uses such things as new as identifiers

5824645
g++	gcc
g++ is a program that calls gcc and treats .c .h and .i files as c++ source files

5824673

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
when i use another browser firefox safari or google-chrome s private mode both websites work well

5824882
width	height
because as far as i know theres no difference between loading the image with its original size versus adding height and width attributes to it

5824914
width	height
you just need the longitude and latitudes of the four corners and the width and height of the image

5824929
nhibernate	queryover
does anybody know a way to do compound from clauses - that are possible with linq to objects - with nhibernate 3 queryover syntax

hide	show
i would supply both the default and mouse-over values to the and use jquery hide and show to hide and reveal the value

5825396
virtualenv	setuptools
i think i always ended up solving it by indeed using a virtualenv or by accepting the fact that the global setuptools should be updated and doing that manually with something like sudo easy_install -u setuptools or maybe use distribute as package name

5825432
google-chrome	firefox
the above code works correctly in firefox and google-chrome but in ie8 causes it to make two requests to the server

5825432
google-chrome	firefox
the first seems correct and is identical to that generated by firefox and google-chrome

5825449

5825744
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the site looks like it should on webkit browsers google-chrome safari but for some reason cufon isn t replacing the font in firefox and i haven t had a chance to test ie yet so it may be happening there too

5825759
button	checkbox
the element will then also have a couple of data- attributes data-switch containing the id value for the checkbox or radio button or element that controls the toggling

5825823
children	parent
to get the columns of a particular parent element you could use the children function

5825823
children	parent
so pretending that you pass in the parent element of which you plan to resize all the divs that are children of this parent you could use this line

5825823
children	parent
pass in the children so that they will be used as the parent in the next level of calls

5825892
direct3d	directx
the tutorials i ve found for c++ and directx all use direct3d which to my knowledge is managed

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly locally on ie firefox and safari but not on google-chrome

5826123
comparator	comparable
another often overlooked condition for a comparator and comparable is temporary consistence the result of comparing two objects should not change as long as they are used as keys in the treemap or any other structure where you use the comparator comparable like a sorted array used for collections.binarysearch or a priorityqueue implemented by a minimum heap - even for arrays.sort you should not change the elements before the sorting is finished

5826224
docx	xlsx
for the newer formats you can just use xml open xml sdk is a fine choice but you can also just access the docx xlsx pptx file formats with system.io.packaging in .net if you don t want to be all that heavy handed with yet-another-dll

5826239
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
when i started implementing a piano keyboard i simply used a big image of the keyboard and worked out what key was being pressed in my controllers touchesbegan touchesmoved methods

5826239

the simplest solution i think is to go back to the original controller touchesbegan touchesmoved method

5826253
stdout	fflush
the following script works with chartbot.rb even without stdout fflush

5826283
implements	extends
it implements default regex validation logic in a regexvalidator and then extends these classes for other validations

i have found started a python script to do this code below but can t figure out how to write the captured x y max min into the shape file that is created for this

5826453
accessor	properties
note that thereâ s nothing preventing access to private class extension instance variables or the accessor methods for properties declared in a class extension during runtime

5826453
clang	llvm
edit using the clang llvm 2.0 compiler you can also declare properties and instance variables in a class extension.

5826462
accessor	properties
when you synthesize accessor for properties which don t have corresponding instance variables the new runtime os x 10.5 and later and all versions of ios i believe will create the instance variables automatically

5826470
g++	gcc
passing -e to gcc g++ stops the compiler after the preprocessing step which might also be useful

5826488
actionlistener	focuslistener
i searched through a few pages but most seem to be just having comprehension issues as to what static means.the problem i have lies in that we are using a static class focuslistener and actionlistener

5826503
rvm	bundler
even if you are using rvm it makes sense to use bundler to manage gem dependencies so that your gemfile can be tracked in whatever code repository you are using

5826512
rvm	bundler
so i think you should consider rvm as the configuration manager for your development environment and bundler the gem manager for an application

5826512
rvm	bundler
bundler on the other hand does care about those missing parts in rvm

5826522
yacc	bison
my other system had yacc symlinked to bison so i had to change the makefile to use bison rather than yacc

i want the minimum value and maximum values to be display on the color bar the max should be 2.0 and the min -0.1

5826597
hash-collision	key
it will only really matter if you have lots of hash-collision since then the get key call gets slower than o 1 - it gets o k with k being the number of entries in the same bucket the number of key with same hash code or a different hash code which gets still mapped to the same bucket - this depends on the capacity size and load factor of the map as well

5826599
prepare	execute
prepare a statement to insert new values it s execute later

5826606
multiplying	transpose
currently i transform the ray direction from primitive space to world space by multiplying the directional component by the transpose of the source objects inverse transformation matrix and then i transform the ray from world space to each primitive space by multiplying by the transpose of the destination objects transformation matrix

you never adjust the width and the height of the overlay box when you resize although you set it when you initialize

5826667
width	height
try using percentages for your width and height

5826674
rvm	bundler
what does bundler do that rvm does

5826674
rvm	bundler
there are many small things like these that bundler does but rvm does not

5826674
rvm	bundler
in general as the good people above explained rvm has a different set of goals from that of bundler

5826678
nerdtree	rails.vim
if you want a recommendation i would say vim with three plugins - rails.vim make vim more aware of rails and its structure command-t great for jumping around between files quickly and nerdtree - a graphical tree based file browser

5826680
rss	feed
rss readers load feed in background with assumption that user will want to read them sooner or later

5826731
portrait	landscape
it would be nice if when the application switches from portrait to landscape that it keeps the uilabels bools and other objects

5826797
strcpy	strncpy
from the man page the strcpy and strncpy functions return s1

5826815
post	get
i ve collected this data with jprofiler but i can t post the capture so this what i get

5826823
button	checkbox
there s a class that upon clicking on a button checks whether a checkbox is checked or not

5826823
children	parent
because the tree is traversed in-order this means that parent will draw before behind their children with siblings drawn in the order they appear in the tree

5826829
hex	binary
you would take the binary signed and unsigned forms then represent them in hex as you would any binary number

5826835
put	get
well you get what you pay for when you get your legacy code from overseas sometimes and the time it would take me to take apart their system and put it back together is greater than the time i have to implement the whole solution

5826853
xslt	schematron
or you could go with mixed and validate the structure outside of xsd with xslt or schematron or your own parsing code

5826861
hex	binary
for example you d have the following representations in signed 32-bit binary and hex

5826861
hex	binary
as you can see the hex representation of negative numbers is directly related to the binary representation

5826864
put	get	post	get	post	put
if so the answer is that the get and post are completely separate actions as far as your server-side local variables are concerned - the only state that is maintained across calls is whatever is round-tripped down to the client and up to the server which only happens when you explicitly put form elements in the view that will cause that data to be included in the html and posted back up to the server

5826864
post	get
the solution is to either replace the html.dropdownfor with an html.hiddenfor or else just repopulate the variable in the post action in which case i m not sure you d need to populate it in the get action at all.

5826915
actionlistener	focuslistener
by reading your code the only thing i see is that your class wellparameters implements the interfaces focuslistener and actionlistener not static classes

5826964
put	get
1 is to put the entire table as a variable in the application delegate in this case i need to use objectforkey twice every time i need to get a string

5826972
implements	extends
i think you can easily implements this by extends a fileoutputstream

5827011
for-loop	loops
sometimes it makes the most sense to return from the middle of a for-loop but frequently it makes more sense to re-write to a loops or loops instead

5827021
post	get
then change your jquery call to use post instead of of get

5827043
super	implements
this is pretty similar to how one would implements a thread pool by themselves if you are in the runtime you could do some other things to help you out but it s not a super big deal

5827053
children	parent
i m having a hard time figuring out how to have the parent tell the children where to position themselves and at what size

5827064
post	get
that s means a get post cookie gpc name do has been submitted

5827064
post	get
when you submit a request url with persistent cookies url-based get variables and post d variables from forms or other means your browser sends html headers that contain key value pairs that are identifiable by type gpc and then by name to get a value

5827069
post	get
it would be something submitted either via get or post

5827094
xwpf	hwpf
for word hwpf and xwpf from apache poi don t really do page level things - the page breaks aren t stored in the file but instead need to be calculated on the fly based on the text + fonts + page size.

5827095
inherited	properties
ie gets wonky on for in loops and includes all inherited properties and methods

5827105
mongodb	bson
user photo are both resources because they each have an id mongodb bson objectid on the server

5827123
post	get
i ve read dozens of post but can t get to the solution

5827144
filesystems	fat
for fat filesystems you can find some c code from microchip here as part of the microchip application libraries

5827160
stateless	stateful
web ui uses completely different paradigms because a web front end is stateless with unbound data whereas access apps are stateful and bound

5827164
folder	directory
edit so after messing with the file associations to use java.exe instead of javaw.exe thereby providing a window for print-outs then modifying the startup mechanism a little to print out the current working directory i discovered that the jar is running from c windows system32 instead of the folder on my desktop i put it in

5827174
post	get
my guess is that this is because you are using custom sql to get your custom post type

5827174
post	get
i would use this to get my custom post

5827188
inherited	properties
uitextview inherited from uiscrollview which has a properties called scrollenabled

5827256
put	get
the numbers needed to align the text may change if the controls get a custom template but you don t need to put a different margin or style on each element in the collection

5827261
draggable	droppable
i ve been trying to implement some simple draggable droppable code link below with no success

5827261
draggable	droppable
however when dropped in the droppable area the item gives the alert as it should but it is then no longer draggable

5827268
width	height
the problem seems to be that the span is being rendered with width and height of 0px regardless of what s specified in the css

5827277
hide	show	superclass	subclassing
i basically want to create a subclassing that hide methods on the superclass so that they don t show up in a dir or hasattr call and the users can t call them at least not through any of the normal channels

5827364
width	height
i am trying to precisely lay out a page so even if the image is not found i would like the alt text to occupy the given height width

5827377
width	height
if you re generating the page using php you can just fix the width height of the div

5827383
width	height
and add a style attribute to the wrapping div that states your desired width and height

5827445
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
if the md5 is a salt md5 there is a good chance it ll never be the same as a normal md5 hash

5827483
hide	show
you can adjust it to use toggle instead of hide show

5827493
opera	google-chrome
opera and google-chrome use the specified dimensions and display the alt text in that space

5827535
put	get
if i could do a group by name then put the results in a temp table and then select again and do a group by address then i would get exactly what i want - but that seems too complicated

5827569
gitolite	gitosis
and coming to access control i would advice you to keep it simple and have an access conf file svn or even gitolite gitosis and write simple hooks in the git repo in python ruby etc

5827643
groupbox	panel
i am looking for something like a c# or .net groupbox panel

5827674
websphere	ibm
there is a built in limitation of 2 mb for the ibm websphere mq jms interface

5827700
keydown	keyup
as for as i know there is no key movement involved so i would rule out keyup and keydown

5827764
google-chrome	safari
this also does not work in ie google-chrome safari i have used a few different machines to try to eliminate setting errors of some kind

5827784
pull	push
a dvcs like git or mercurial introduces a publication workflow push pull which is orthogonal to branching

5827784
pull	push
they can pull fetch + merge regularly in order to not diverge too much from the work of others on the same topic but they will push when ready

5827784
pull	push
those branches are available for active publication push by the developer or passive publication pull or fetch from an upstream repo without direct intervention from said developer

5827800
rjava	jri
copied the rjava jri examples rtest.java to eclipse jri src

5827800
rjava	jri
after examining the run shell script which comes with the rjava package inside . jri i have set up these in the eclipse run configuration

5827832
post	get
you want to do either a post or a get and i think you may want to pass back a string or json

5827864
width	height
then i ll check if it s 0 or 180 degrees after that i ll get the display height and width and see which one is longer than the other

5827864
width	height
let s say the user is rotating the screen as this piece of code is executing if the device changes orientation in between the time i use the getrotation method and check the width against the height with some if statements and what not i think it could throw everything off

5827865
pecl	pear
note yes i am already familiar with the pecl bbcode extension as well as the pear library

5827885
g++	gcc
g++ gcc are very important

5827899
aiff	caf
try converting one of the files to aiff caf or some other uncompressed format

5827938
mouseup	mousedown
from a conceptual perspective i ll be beaten with actual code no doubt shortly i would register the mouse coordinates on mousedown and compare them against the mouse coordinates on mouseup to determine the angle at which to move the div this would allow the div to continue moving in the correct direction even when the mouseup was close to the div

5827938
mouseup	mousedown
the easier way would be to just move the square towards the mouseup coordinates mousedown coordinates don t really matter in a small div but this doesn t work as well if the mouseup is very close to the mousedown

5827938
mouseup	mousedown
except on mouseup mouserelease instead of click ideally towards a projected point along the line between mousedown and mouseup at a specified distance

5827938
mouseup	mousedown
i ve included a prototype example below it s very rushed and could use plenty of optimisations + clearer concept on the differences between page graph y-axis as well as some better handling of steep slopes as well as calculating distance to fling based on distance between mousedown mouseup as fauxtrot mentions in comments as well as perhaps disabling fling after the first fling as you can keep flinging it around at the moment as well as out of bounds checks and perhaps reverse bouncing off the edges

5827966
inherited	subclassing
as i understand it you want to be able to have a base class then inherited the base class functions and define them in subclassing

for the xperia in particular i was unable to get adb to find the phone until it was upgrade to 2.1 so you may need to do this if you are using an older android versioning

5828072
post	put
you need to escape your post values before you insert put them into your query

5828082
fgets	getline

5828086
vmware	esx
for example vmware esx citrix xenserver or microsoft hyper-v

5828086
virtualbox	parallels	cpu	processors	vmware	virtualbox
vmware workstation server player fusion parallels virtualbox are all examples of type 2 hypervisors that support hardware-assisted virtualization - this means rather than emulating the cpu instructions the cpu instructions can pass through directly with no emulation or translation -- effectively running with no loss of performance if the processors supports it

5828110
folder	directory
the idea is to simulate handling files folder changing directory and so forth

5828111

also consider using the rtree virtual table of sqlite3 which is dedicated to speed up access to double min max multi-dimensional data it may speed up a lot your requests

5828424
post	get
as of right now i m populating hidden fields and using a post function instead of load to get around it

5828443
switching	screens
not sure what the memory implications are though is the view being disposed of when the window manager removes it from the screens upon switching activities but at least it will keep the hud up throughout the entire app

5828452
width	height
i d probably want to stick to powers of two for the width and height of the sub-images for ease of translating one larger sub image into multiple sub images but if i can find an algorithm which didn t do that it d be better

5828495
google-chrome	firefox
trim is not working in internet explorer it s working properly in google-chrome and firefox

5828753
ubuntu	linux
how to find a process start time on ubuntu linux machine using c language

5828894
put	get
this is a good use of case classes since what you put into the constructor also is what you get out when you use pattern matching match

5828922
integer	unsigned
for example if you are extracting an integer from a byte stream say 16 bits for simplicity with unsigned values you could do

5828926
opera	google-chrome
in google-chrome ie8+ and opera donâ t know since which version this is supported

5828957
inherited	properties
i assume because forms don t have any display properties themselves that either jquery or the ui.layout plugin are forcing those rows to inherited that lack of display

5828957
inherited	properties
maybe the form tag needs some display properties placed on it so those rows inherited it

5829081
opera	firefox
this feature is supported by internet explorer firefox opera and konqueror browsers.you can get it here

5829103
hide	show
i ve seen plenty of examples that are close to what i m trying to achieve but with the hidden div right next to the element that is to be clicked to show hide and that doesn t affect already open divs

5829142

jsf	wicket
in component based mvc frameworks like jsf and wicket it s an ui component that dynamically renders a html table based on a collection

5829805
profiling	instrumentation
if you use instrumentation to profiling your program youâ ll notice that about 50 of the processing time is spent on â i think itâ s safe to assume that nskeyvalueslowmutablearray is the proxy array and its name should be a clue of its performance

5829834
sum	coalesce
i m not going into coalesce thing - i believe it s unnecessary as sum shouldn t return null s

5829869
nginx	lighttpd
i tested the sample with lighttpd and nginx and the app handled only one request at once

5829926
put	get
the get and subsequent possible put are wrapped in a transaction to ensure atomicity

5830012

that works fine for get requests but i would rather post to the gateway to avoid issues with very large url s generated

5830023
typedef	struct
this is the particular corner case where the use of typedef when declaring an struct in c makes a difference in c++ as it will inject the name in the common identifier space

5830085
serializable	deserialization
you may want to try json.net a nice library for json serializable and deserialization

5830092

ibaction resolves to void and iboutlet resolves to nothing but they signify to xcode and interface builder that these variables and methods can be used in interface builder to link ui elements to your code

5830582
iboutlet	ibaction
if you re not going to be used interface builder at all then you don t need them in your code but if you are going to use it then you need to specify ibaction for methods that will be used in ib and iboutlet for objects that will be used in ib

5830582
iboutlet	ibaction

5832082

expander	grid
i set all grid and borders panel.zindex property to let s say 99 and the content of expander was set on zindex about 999

flex	osmf
look for a version of osmf that is explicitly compiled against the flex 4.1 framework

5832664
google-chrome	firefox

5832664
google-chrome	firefox
find or write a firefox or google-chrome extension which intercepts all outgoing connections and blocks them based on the url of the tab and the target url of the connection

5832664
google-chrome	firefox
as far as i can see only the firefox or google-chrome extension is feasible from the list above

nsstring	nsdata
as gstwitpicengine wrongly assumed deserialize error method accepts an nsstring instead of an nsdata

implements	extends
in java i have an abstract class with a method implements not abstract which i want to be accessible by other classes which extends it but not by everyone else in the package

5833035

using a normal html form has the same problem as packet sniffing could reveal the same data in a post or get header just as easily

the two fromats you need are webm royaltiy free supported by alternative briwsers mozilla opera google-chrome and others and h.264 for the big ones ie and safari

5833551
h.264	webm
you can use two formats instead of one to throw in webm or you only stay with h.264 and use flash on non-h264 browsers

5833565
google-chrome	safari
as far as i can tell it s just the way google-chrome and safari handle focus

5833580
ganglia	metrics
so if you re running ganglia straight out of the box the .rrd file and the ganglia graph for that metrics will disappear entirely

5833580
ganglia	metrics
if you d like to preserve the .rrd history of the metrics and or you want the ganglia graph to stay around but have the plot drop to zero you could edit the call to rrdtool inside path to webserver ganglia graph.d metric.php

i want to know if the syntax of the select query is different for myisam and innodb

5833592

in addition just as i had to remember to invoke super.validate as the first line of any of my children s validate methods i now have to remember to invoke some subvalidate method at the end of any of my parent s validate methods so that didn t seem to get any better

5833658

5833780
getter	setter
let s have bean class with 4 fields so we have setter and getter

5833782
aptana	radrails
when new project is created using radrails radrails execute the command rails beta -d sqlite3 which is older syntax and the new syntax is rails new beta -d sqlite3 so unless the aptana teams invokes new rails functionality the workaround would be to use the methods mentioned above

5833793
folder	directory
problem i don t know how to go about making such a script running always and have the mysql connection open just once while there goes on a constant scan of my known folder directory path to look for new text file and just keep reading info

5833823

i am trying to get an rss feed into my iphone app

5833823

i tried different areas but i couldn t get nothing at all although i m trying areas given in the doc neither using curl post

5833841
rss	feed
that is an xml feed rss is always xml

5833867
datediff	difference
use datediff to determine the difference between dates times

5833867
datediff	difference
for example if the start time was 8 55 and the end time 9 05 datediff hour ... would return 1 although the actual difference is much less just 10 minutes

5833867
datediff	difference
it s because datediff in essence truncates the times to the units specified and then calculates the difference

5833916
hide	show
you could hide the whole page and show it after the dom-ready element is fired up its a farily easy piece of work

5833954
width	margin
the idea is to wrap the tables in a container div with overflow hidden and offset them as needed i.e the first table is positioned to fill the div the second has margin-left equal to the width of the container the third s margin left is twice the width etc.

5833967
put	get
oracle maintains - you can use dbms_application_info.set_session_longops to put entries in there and to update them but oracle controls how they get purged

5833981
put	get
put it all together and you get my final code above

5834025
thin	unicorn
when nginx proxies the request to thin or unicorn using proxy_pass the application receives the modified url sent by nginx

5834037
implements	extends
if you want to get the best of both worlds you might considering implements the solution as a decorator pattern where subclasses can extends the functionality of a parent class and still stick to a common interface

5834058
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
use nscalendar and nsdatecomponents for that

5834086
addition	multiplication
you will need routines that perform multiplication and addition in the output representation

5834086
addition	multiplication
the multiplication routine can be written in terms of the addition routine

5834108
hide	show
i think you should wrap your tab widget in any viewgroup such as linearlayout or relativelayout and create a static function in your tabactivity to show hide this wrapper here s a little code might be helpful for you

5834129
free	malloc
you re calling free on a pointer you did not obtain from malloc or similar functions

5834152
free	malloc
undefined bahaviour passing to free a pointer not obtained through malloc

every times its width or height is changed or some children is changed its children might be repositioned update children before measureoverride and arrangeoverride is called

5834187
richtextbox	textblock
before you suggest that i use richtextbox or textblock deal with white space at the beginning of the lines note that label s and white spaces are just an example - it is little more complicated

5834190
google-chrome	firefox
the only good javascript documentation i ve found is the mozilla dom documentation which is great for firefox but not so much for google-chrome

5834201
accessor	properties
you really need to use the self.propertyname reference form everywhere in the code except in the accessor for that specific properties

5834220
debian	linux	hid	keyboard
i m using an rfid reader a small usb stick which imitates an hid keyboard on debian linux squeeze

basically my code does the following thing store resource entities into the datastore with url as a stringproperty and post get payloads stored in a dict as a jsonproperty fetch them later code not included

5834239
.htaccess	httpd.conf
ideally this could be done with an .htaccess that a user could simply drop into their web server document root rather than modifying the httpd.conf file but i could live with either approach

5834298
width	height
when the rectangle has been clicked i can figure out its width height x and y position with getbbox

5834300
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
if you still feel you need to use inherited then don t go overkill trying to make sure that every subclassing executes the validation logic inherited from the superclass

5834312
width	height
my image has the width bigger than the height so i want that the minumum zoom is the width

5834444
plot	heatmap
i am doing a matlab-style heatmap plot in android and decided to use an overlapping combination of a glsurfaceview to do the heatmap if you don t know what a heatmap is don t worry about it and a surfaceview to do the axes labelling bitmaps on top of the heatmap etc

5834460
int	double
64bit host which double the size of int and could account for your purported 2x difference

5834479
unix	bsd
in unix bsd 5 operating system do we have dispatcher a separate process with process id or its code is executed with context of some other process

5834483
put	get
you need to put the snippet you showed into the emacs lisp part to get that configuration at startup the .emacs configuration file

5834496
strlen	strcpy
strlen returns the length of the string without the 0 chracter at the end so while strcpy copies the string including the 0 character so it copies more bytes than you allocated

5834522
multiplying	add
i am using yii so my dreams should come true easily so i expect the answer should not guide me to add a special field to the data provider or access the pager and get the current page number and then multiplying numbers bla bla bla

5834545
post	get
links make get requests not post requests

5834550
listview	gridview
i would set this up in a databound control like a listview or gridview

try to surround the network loop with a try-catch statement and then catch for the different kinds of exception-handling

5834700
sharepoint	splist
for my sharepoint site i also have a data warehouse sql server 2005 which hosts the same data it is populated through splist eventreceivers itemadded itemupdated

currently the user of the custom webpart that displays the splist contents is allowed to select an spview to display the content in the way they would like filtering sorting and only showing necessary columns

5834739
jobs	cron
i have not really set up cron jobs so this i think may be the issue

5834769
ceil	floor
you could replace floor with round or ceil

5834788
cpu	hyperthreading
first assume you have just one cpu with no hyperthreading magic so on your machine only 1 thread is running at any given time

5834826
int	double
using double to store large int is dubious

5834826
int	double
the largest int that can be stored reliably in double is much smaller than dbl_max

5834843
jar	manifest.mf
decompress the jar file and look for the manifest file meta-inf manifest.mf

5834908
children	parent
everything with regards tob building the object works fine but when i try to test the deletion of one of the children or parent it does not reflect in the test

int	double
any number int decimal float are valid json data types and doesn t have to be encapsulated with double quotes

5835031
folder	directory
therefore i d like to compile it all as a single monolithic static or dynamic library so i can just add the library file to my project set the header search directory to folder that contain the aforementioned .h files and compile

5835073
firefox	safari
whenever i compile a widgetset with vaadin 6.5.6 or 6.5.7 in eclipse and then run the application it only works in firefox and safari

5835075
ant	maven
again use artifactory and ant ivy or maven

5835122
width	height
#img src width 16 height 16 alt delete

5835172
setinterval	settimeout
the alternative is to use setinterval which sets the function to repeat regularly as opposed to settimeout which schedules the next appearance only

5835212
move	drag
when you drag or resize the rectangles this function is called and move the corner divs over the four corners lines 116-126

5835261
post	get
because there s no way to make an actual post request from a link rails fakes it with a get request so that means if you try to pass additional parameters to some_path it builds it into the query string

5835271
jlist	jtable
it works for jtable so you d have to change it to use jlist

5835334
vbscript	jscript
related tags include vbscript cscript jscript wsh and wsf

5835338
implements	extends
an class may implements several interfaces whereas it may only extends one class abstract or concrete because java does not support multiple inheritance

5835373
cvs	svn
in contrast i believe cvs and svn give separate revision numbers to the individual files

5835373
cvs	svn
so in cvs or svn the tag operation goes out and attaches stable-pre-new-spec to file1 version 1.0.3 file 2 version 1.0.2 file3 version 2.0 file 4 version 1.3.7 etc

5835440
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

5835442
put	get
seems that i have to put the value into the jobdetail s jobdatamap twice to get it to persist this works

5835471

5835498
oncreate	setcontentview
i was calling setcontentview in oncreate and after rotation the â œoldâ labels would show up on the new layout bizarre

5835536
affinity	processors
that said it could be accomplished by creating a number of threads that matches the number of logical processors cores in the system set the processors affinity of each thread so that there s one per core and then just have each thread run code like this

5835536
division	modulo
the purpose of the rand call is to keep a compiler optimization from realizing that your loop doesn t actually do anything and optimizing it away and the purpose of the modulo is to prevent creating an overflow exception you could use simple division as well

5835536
affinity	processors
because i don t think you should do i won t share the code on how to determine the number of processors core or detect thread affinity

5835569
cpu	affinity
to make sure you are using every cpu i d suggest creating a process to run your cpu eater with the cpu affinity set or cpu 0 and then another for each other cpu the system has

5835577
mouseover	mouseout
what you need to do is either leverage a different attribute ie use dboxtitle rather than title or you re going to need to dynamically remove and re-add the title on mouseover mouseout so that the browser doesn t see it ref disabling browser tooltips on links and abbr s

5835579
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
update in firefox 12 and later and google-chrome safari - as alex says below you can use getboundingclientrect to take into account any transforms applied to an element

5835586
width	height
setting height width attributes in createview does nothing

5835617
int	boolean
the problem with that is that radiobutton1.checked returns a boolean value rather than an int value and thus the parse error occurs

your basically looking to find out the options for internationalization localization provided by .net

5835683

5835745
temp	tmp
i would like it to return ls for within tmp since in the previous command i had changed directory to temp

5835819
min	max
in other words only select the entries where the vid is max of the uid but keeping in min nid could differ

5835824
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
db access uses a stored procedure but you can use a objectdatasource with dal or just inline the sql statement on the sqldatasource etc

5835827
shadowing	named
it uses type as a variable named shadowing the built-in type

5835837

getter	setter
so i ve been reading up on coding best practices and the importance of using setter getter to access and change the instance variables of my custom classes rather than making the variables public and accessing them directly

5835961
getter	setter
for the non array instance variables bools etc i understand how to properly access them use dot notation and setter getter methods

5835961
getter	setter
i m accessing the instance variable mydata directly rather than using setter getter methods

5835961
getter	setter
but that seems bulky and still brings us back around to the question of the implementation within the class itself and how to properly use setter getter technique to access a dictionary s member variables instead of directly modifying the dictionary itself

5836261
int	chars

i have an asp.net gridview on a page when a buttonfield is clicked instead of select it opens a popup form my popup not asp s which contains the detail of the gridview row displayed in an editable detailsview

5837439
gridview	detailsview
this approach has been used because the grid contains 20 wideish columns and it is easier to edit update in the detailsview format the detailsview takes any amendmends and writes them back to the table fine but the underlying gridview is never visually updated unless of course the page is completely reloaded i tried to use the windows.reload function but i get the annoying winddows is trying to reopen etc error so that is useless

btw you must know var is deprecated in php5 you should use public protected or private

5837583
public	protected
in order to maintain backward compatibility with php 4 php 5 will still accept the use of the keyword var in property declarations instead of or in addition to public protected or private

5837583
public	protected
if you declare a property using var instead of one of public protected or private then php 5 will treat the property as if it had been declared as public.

negative base raised into a fractions power would result in a complex number which sql server does not support

5838248
base	fractions
or a positive base into a fractions power

5838263
base	fractions
when base is negative and power is fractions with odd denominator you can raise -base to the fractions power and then take the minus of the result

5838263
base	fractions
in other words ms sql simply doesn t support raising negative base to fractions powers

have a look at the uibutton s documentation it will reveal that uibutton is a descendant of uicontrol which implements the method to add targets

5843443
uicontrol	uibutton
uibutton inherits from uicontrol

5843465
webkit	gecko
i m also not convinced that we need to stick with qtwebkit on all platforms it might make more sense to use a different webkit backend depending on os or maybe even using gecko or shudder trident instead

5843466
photoshop	fireworks
i have also tried to find a way to automate this in fireworks and photoshop but it seems that these functions cannot be used this way

5843481
uuid	mac-address
rfc 4122 the rfc for uuid has three reference implementation see the first of which uses the mac-address in the unique node identifier but the other two uses random numbers instead

5843481
uuid	mac-address
usually the mac-address is hashed so you could compare the original to the generated but not decypher the original mac-address only from knowing the uuid

5843532
dirichlet	multinomial
since you want a random probability vector you should sample that from the conjugate prior of the multinomial distribution the dirichlet distribution

5843542
client-side	server-side	hash	hmac
hashing the password on client-side is not ideal because this prevents the use of hash passwords with keys on the server-side think hmac

5843543
hide	show
i m using this for a show hide div expander which is working fine however the html entities aren t being outputted

5843561
unix	solaris
i use this to get rid of m in files copied from windows to unix solaris linux osx

5843642
width	height
quicktime - change width and height in both cases

5843661
jobs	cron
i d like the images to be available instantly no cron jobs queues

5843712
hash	md5
this check digit hash can be used to verify the validity of the 9-digit number that the check digits are appended to much in the same way as md5 and sha1 hash can be associated with files and used to verify that the proper data was transmitted or that no tampering had taken place before during or after transmital

5843731
width	height
i have not tested it with height 0 and width 0 but it probably will still work

5843815
width	height
calculatearea width height

5843815
width	height
calculatearea width 10 height 5

5843897
int	double
suppose you want the third argument to be an int or double but you have to check temp1 or temp2 first to know which it should be

5843907
versioning	upgrade
if you go that method be sure to comment it extremely well and modify the code in such a way that it should be a matter of copy-pasting in order to deploy to future versioning of dnn every time you upgrade dnn for example

5843912
pop-up	dialog
so when you connect to your webserver with a browser it will pop-up a save as dialog instead of displaying the downloaded web page in the browser window

5843950
cpython	pypy
judging from the benchmarks posted on the pypy speed center it appears as if pypy is faster than cpython for all but two of the tests presented

5843950
cpython	pypy
cpython is faster than pypy on the two tests slowspitfire and waf

5843951
keydown	keyup
tinymce also offers a lot of events you can bind to particularly in your case the keyup keydown and keypressed events

5843988
daemons	launchd
launchd is a process management daemons similar to init

5844000
ones-complement	xor
this code probably wants to rotate val leftwards clockwise by 6 bits and form the ones-complement sum edit not the product as i d said before -- the xor -- of that rotated value and the current value of m_hash to yield a new m_hash

5844001
uiview	subviews
for example i have a factory method which sets up an uiview and adds it as subviews then returns the instance

5844010
post	get
on another page i want to trigger a javascript that will send different combinations of parameters to the url either by get or post and return each of the files associated with the parameter combinations

5844015
mvp	presenter
in tutorials on gwt google uses to different approaches to do mvp either the view specifies the presenter or the presenter specifies the view

5844015
mvp	presenter
this post touches on this subject mvp should the view implement a presenter #39

5844023
textview	imageview
since your textview has a height of fill-parent and the linearlayout is not scrolling unless is put into a scrollview you can t see the lower parts your textview takes up the whole screen of the activity and the imageview being under it is not visible

5844031
profiling	benchmarking	rspec	minitest
minitest has much more than most people know for example minitest spec has bdd matchers akin to rspec minitest mock is a mocking system and minitest benchmarking is for performance profiling

5844031
rspec	minitest
in my personal experience people who build rails apps tend toward rspec and people who build pure ruby code tend toward minitest unit spec mock benchmark and so on

5844036
qobject	qlist
creating custom classes derived from qobject and passing them as pointers in qlist and then deleting everything with qdeleteall

5844133
textview	imageview
your android src dont seem right for your imageview and textview

5844156
locationmanager	mapactivity
moreover i suppose i cannot use it outside the mapactivity hence i ll need to use the locationmanager anyway

5844159
submit	submission
i want to have one submit button run a function after the submission is complete

5844170
width	height
shape width height

5844171
affinity	processors
you must make sure you always call them from the same processors core set the processors affinity on the thread that calls them

5844182
qlist	qvector
in this case don t use qlist but a more efficient container such as qvector

5844182
qlist	qvector
in this case don t use qlist as a container but something more efficient like qvector don t forget to make good use of the reserve method

5844193
subtraction	addition
also i will need to do addition and subtraction like this.

5844193
int	double
maybe array for one vector where where values are int floats double

5844210
client-side	server-side
i don t need help for the server-side part that i will do in java only for the client-side javascript

5844221
put	get
note bundles have get and put methods for all the primitive types parcelables and serializables

5844262
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to add a lightbox via fancybox behavior to my site but inspecting with a js profiler after clicking on the image to be lightboxed with firefox or google-chrome i get into an infinite loop with this error

5844276
opera	firefox
as you can see from the chart jade doesn t get along with firefox 3 or opera

5844345
width	margin
you mean that in ie the div s are smaller.thats because in ie css border margin are included in the width declared.so if you have given a div width of 100px and a margin of 10px both sides then in ie the actual visible width of this div will be 100-10-10 80px.to solve the problem you can use child css decleration

5844353
uiview	calayer
you can t create a uiview with a non rectangular shape but you can mask it using a calayer with any random shape

5844395
children	parent
when you touch the screen the parent will see that the touch is outside of it s own bounds and so the children will not even asked

5844422
profiling	instrumentation
sort of a half-answer but if i was going to attempt this i d use the instrumentation power profiling + uibackgroundmodes location but set the desired accuracy to kcllocationaccuracyhundredmeters or less and see if that gives a reasonable power usage number

5844426
public	protected
there is no protected or private in interface everything is public

5844522
google-chrome	firefox
both firefox and google-chrome have a store where you can browse plugins and then a common packaging mechanism standard but i haven t been able to find the same for ie.

5844540
debian	centos
i run a program on both centos and debian

5844540
debian	centos
the output is exactly the same but in centos i get the 3 lines in bold while in debian i do not

5844582
ienumerable	iqueryable
iqueryable inherits from ienumerable so i think that asenumerable is unnecessary in this code

5844608
subclass	abstract-class
if your abstract-class only exists to subclass other activities you shouldn t need to include it in the manifest

5844613
debian	centos
i m guessing then that centos is using this and that debian is not

5844629
superclass	subclassing
i ve got a superclass model measurement and two subclassing weightmeasurement and lengthmeasurement

5844665
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i have a similar code fragment now sadly the length of the strinlist becomes 70....if i want to print all the strings of this arrays i dont have any other way....remember even though the size of mystring is 70 in class b only 5 of its components are properly initialized........so considering i am in class a and have no way to find out how many times did the for-loop in b executed......how do i accurately loops through all the elements of stringlist in a.......

5844705
skip-lists	tree
the data structure for key is going to be just an associative array implement it as a hash-table self-balancing tree or a skip-lists it doesn t matter from your keys to nodes in a tree for values

5844705
skip-lists	tree
the tree for values is going to be a self-balancing binary search tree or a skip-lists see edit below

5844732
google-chrome	firefox
i ve also noticed that this happens on both firefox ie google-chrome

5844765
google-chrome	firefox
for the client side i recommend google-chrome s developer tools integrated or the firebug add-on for firefox

5844767
width	height
here s a demo using the above css with your markup width height constraints on images dropped to make it display better in a small window

5844788
subtract	add
since your vely and velx are not defined it gives unexpected results when you try and add or subtract from it

5844808
hash	salt
the database password is hash using php sha1 database_password. salt

5844823
mockito	easymock
hasxxxhandlers are far too complicated to mock particularly when using mocking libraries such as mockito or easymock

5844892
keydown	keyup
subclass nsresponder implement keyup and keydown like in this answer

5844892
keydown	keyup
a problem with this approach is that keyup and keydown won t get called when the user presses only a modifier key

5844897
libjpeg	libpng
otherwise you can use image saving loading libraries libpng libjpeg etc

5844916
google-chrome	firefox
works in google-chrome and firefox 4

5844918
filtering	grouping
since you mentioned you wanted to omit grouping that have only single rectangles you can just filtering them out at the end

5844997
pop-up	dialog
the problem that i have now is that i want to inform the user if an error occurred during the transaction typically i d like to pop-up an error dialog showing the e- getmessage or the cause of the error

5845048
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i noticed that if i loops through the arrays using a for-loop ie

5845077
filesystems	ntfs
on ntfs the filesystems used by windows file size data is stored in the master file table

5845107
opera	firefox
it works in firefox and really alert my main page but if i run it in opera nothing happens

5845146
explode	implode
just like you explode d you can implode again

5845186
addclass	removeclass
but i think you ll get the idea and will be able to use addclass and removeclass like in the other answer

5845191
rsa	dsa
any random rsa dsa key you have ever generated for the purpose of protecting data creating custom x.509 certificate etc

5845194
disk	ram
any time you have data that can not be easily recreated on the fly then you need to make provisions to get it out of ram and onto disk

5845194
postgresql	mysql
at that point i d look into mysql or postgresql

5845197
ant	maven
if not you may wanna use maven or ant to create the package file

5845221
post	get
the same two list and filter views on my page but without any rest post just get and querystring

5845231
gdi	directdraw
many people opt for something like sdl simple directmedia layer that is an abstraction over opengl directdraw gdi and more but it s still kind of low-level

5845231
mouse	keyboard	mouse	joystick	joystick	keyboard
to audio keyboard mouse joystick

5845238
gif	png
any format is fine png gif etc

5845248
actionscript	mxml
i have main mxml this calls an as file layout is shown.that is working good.but i cant get the values from the slider dynamically into actionscript i.e if the slide the slider the need to get these values in actionscript so that i can change the layout based on the values

5845261
listview	gridview
here is the xaml for the listview and the gridview added to it

5845291
put	get
also i think put may lead new memory allocate in map and more time consuming but get not

5845334
for-loop	arrays
i decided to use simple text and created a for-loop to make them for me from a string arrays

5845342
superclass	subclassing
superclass receive this message before their subclassing

5845409
versioning	upgrade
i have come across a large issue that i am having that has suddenly come to light when i upgrade my silverlight web projects to versioning 4 respectively

5845437
mouse	keyboard
imo in terms of abstracting from the platform that you re working with ie getting a context getting keyboard mouse input etc glfw beats all

5845524
initializer	class-method
the advantage of going down this path is that through a single call to create a new instance of a class i can also build the associated dom element and once initializer the class-method that have been wired up will execute against the element to do things like position it relative to a target object respond to relevant browser events etc

5845533
qtableview	qabstracttablemodel
i have a custom qtableview connected to a qabstracttablemodel

5845575
opcache	apc
modern well-designed autoloaders won t break apc or php 5.5 s opcache and are not any worse for performance than require_once except for the function call overhead of course

5845575
profiling	benchmarking
check out this presentation by php creator rasmus lerdorf in which he increases the performance of wordpress through benchmarking profiling and careful removal of slow operations like stat calls

5845575
opcache	apc
it s only a major win when you disable apc.stat if you re using apc or fiddling with opcache s validate_ revalidate_ and enable_file_override ini options if you re using opcache

5845601
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested my scripts in google-chrome and firefox 3.6 windows xp and ubuntu without any success

5845604
ant	maven
groovyc ant task gmaven maven and gradle are all options

5845643
google-chrome	firefox
what it does perfectly in google-chrome 11 and firefox 4

5845643
google-chrome	firefox
i m only interested in google-chrome 10+ firefox 3.6+ and ie8+

5845691
width	height
when i did this it turned out that i didn t want my path to be exactly on the 0 0 since that sent it over the canvas as well -- might take some adjustment depending on the height and width of your element

5845717
width	height
mapwindowchecked was an obvious choice but i can t seem to find how to actually configure the width height

5845717
width	height
last time i called it i used xcb.xproto.cw.eventmask but none of the flags in cw seem to be related to width height

5845756
bluetooth	usb
while the base board will cost 2-3x what a small controller will once you have usb host you can take advantage of cheap pc peripherals that are typically cheaper than their spi or bare-bones embedded equivalents for storage networking i know you said no but its great for debugging you can disconnect it in application perhaps a cheap bluetooth dongle as an alternative to a more traditional wireless solution like zigbee etc

5845759
try-catch	exception-handling
you need to wrap it in a try-catch block that catches that exception-handling if it arises and then handles it in a way that s sane for what you re doing

5845762
subtraction	addition	division	addition	division	subtraction
i have created division through subtraction but i cannot figure it out through addition

5845786
apache-poi	docx4j
however if all you want to do is to transform to xml then docx4j and apache-poi for that matter are overkill

5845789
subtract	add
instead of starting from divide and subtract until you drop below 0 instead start from 0 and add until you exceed divide

5845836
typedef	struct
i have problem about referencing a typedef struct from separate files

5845836
typedef	struct
person.h typedef struct ... person

5845869
post	get
anyways if somebody knows a working code to get this done and then post it in a text field it would really appreciate it

5845894
base-class	derived-class
you ll only get into trouble if you instantiate a base-class object or a derived-class object with no override and then try to invoke virtualfunctionname on it because there s no definition for it so the linker will complain

5845919
tvos	ios
airplay is a streaming technology made by apple inc to stream media to multiple devices wirelessly or to the airplay sdk that offers deployment to many platforms including ios macos tvos watchos windows linux android symbian and more recently through the airplay arcade all major consoles and handheld devices

5845924
post	put
the program itself is too long and too messy for me to post it but if someone could please tell me whether it s possible to put textures onto indexed primitives or not and also give me a link to a tutorial i would be grateful

5845928
paramiko	pexpect
to login and run remote terminal commands through python you should use either paramiko or pexpect

5846014
mvvm	delegatecommand
the foundation of the mvvm pattern that includes viewmodelbase inotifypropertychanged and delegatecommand which you can find in via google

5846028
ubuntu	debian
i would speculate that this could be a acpi or power saving related bug in ubuntu debian

5846052
post	get
this way each user doesn t get an entry for every post - just per-thread.

5846074
union	distinct
as you said in your comment previously you were getting a distinct result set because of using union

5846095
x86	64bit
no dll exist for 64bit access to access database files so you must go to the project properties and on the compile tab go to advanced compile options and set target cpu to x86 i hope this helps

5846098
put	get
so if i print out the url and put it into my browser i get a nice json back - works perfectly

5846111
put	get
needless to say every place i ve tried to put it i only get more errors.

5846138
put	get
however you can create a package object and put type definitions in it so that you ll get aliases for classes you think are relevant

5846141
picturebox	mdichild
i have an mdichild and an eventhandler for draganddrop so when i drop an image file in my form a picturebox name dpic is created with that image

5846152
actionlistener	propertychangelistener
these methods belongs to actionlistener and propertychangelistener

5846161
getter	setter
in java java beans make a lot of sense to implement such objects declare all the properties of your object and create getter and setter for each of these properties

5846169
min	max
then you get the min and max

5846169
min	max
if you only need a min or max array_reduce might be faster

5846191
daemons	systemd	sysv	systemd
when i ve seen respawning too fast on sysv init systemd etc inittab entries it s been because the program in question was using the traditional double fork then exec strategy to become a daemons

5846241
cout	cin
this can be a bit more subtle than it initially seems because very little is guaranteed about the order in which global variables are initialized compared to each other so for example when the constructor for your global variable executes std cin std cout and std cerr may not have been constructed yet so if you want to initialize something based on input from the user you may have to take special steps to either ensure the order of initialization or else for example use c-style i o for that particular job

5846284
width	height
use a fixed position div that is the height width of the containing div uni-form and probably jack it s z-index up so it is definitely on top of the form when visible

5846368
nsview	ikimagebrowserview
while i haven t used nscollectionview myself my gut feeling is that there s probably going to be a greater overhead with numerous nsview s compared to ikimagebrowserview which uses the standard coupling of an nsview with an nscell -like reusable drawing mechanism to help improve performance

5846370
button	checkbox
i need the yes no button to actually be the approval value the checkbox is merely there so the user can select which entity to vote on

5846381
vim	notepad++
notepad++ eclipse and variants and even vim support xdebug

5846387
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in firefox google-chrome etc

5846404
google-chrome	firefox
btw this was the same on both google-chrome and firefox

5846442
implements	extends
if you want to extends it you must implements the unimplemented methods

5846446
google-chrome	firefox
i have it working great in google-chrome but when i tried it in firefox and ie it s not loading the image at all

5846452
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this will force safari google-chrome firefox reload every time you hit back button

5846461
google-chrome	firefox	mp3	ogg
the ogg file is for firefox and the mp3 file for google-chrome and ie

5846463
inherited	properties
however it seems that you want to create a base class planet and have other classes such as mercury and venus inherited properties from it

5846474
public	protected
regarding efficiency friend does not really relate to efficiency since the public protected private checks are applied at compile-time

5846495
oncreate	setcontentview
oncreate metho with super.oncreate setcontentview and extra code for the timepicker

5846503
fgets	strtok
if each of your lines corresponds to a polish sentence and if you re able to conveniently store an entire line in memory very likely i d guess then the simplest way might be to just read the entire line into a buffer with fgets then use strtok to build an array of pointers to each token and finally traverse that array from its end to its start basically reading the sentence from right to left processing each token in a manner similar to the pseudocode given in the aforementioned wikipedia entry

5846523
public	protected
friend is more like protected than public or private in that it grants partial or selective access

5846569
post	get
if not you need to learn about the difference between get and post

5846652
ssl	https
my guess every time a ssl connection start the proxy take my https request get the certificate let s call it ssl_chase for both ssl and the symetric key for data encryption from the website like chase change the certificate to our own it certificate let s call it ssl_it and send it with the respose to me

5846660
lifting	combinators
apparently the block above was causing the code to generate combinators which were calling the avfunctor.arr lifting method to be called -- something in there must be violating laziness

5846683
post	get
also even though i tried to change .getjson with .post ... json firebug is still showing a get request not a post so it s got me even more confused now

5846684
hide	show
furthermore in the current code the notion that the two functions either hide or show the same two elements is not factored out so could be

5846691
execvp	fork
i have also tried fork and then calling execvp

5846711
filtering	grouping
ext js provides a feature rich control with filtering grouping paging and much more

5846765
google-chrome	safari
i image the ie safari and google-chrome equivalents offer the same ability

5846808
min	max
it is interesting to note that both the solutions above use extra storage in form of arrays first one two of them and second one uses one array and then you find min and max using extra storage array

5846808
min	max
the problem of finding min and max can easily be solved with just two extra memory slots

5846823
folder	dir	folder	directory
from the error message you provided you have to have a virtual directory defined for your app with the pysical path pointing to your asp.net app folder and also have the virtual dir as an application convert to application in the context menu of the virtual dir node i think

5846839
factors	mean
if we re being strict about the notation it cannot mean the growth is bounded by a constant factors of infinity because infinity is not a real number

5846871
folder	directory
another approach could be find every image file in a directory or a tree of folder and convert them to jpg except if the image is already a jpg file

5846917
post	get
otherwise you can use html post get to post the data to your script synchronously you are on the right track by adding the value to an element

5846932
post	get
i m not entirely sure why you want to post fb user id s into a mysql database but assuming you were able to get the fb uid you should be able to use an xhr to post it to your php

5846932
post	get
that is first get the fb id client side then using an ajax post deliver it to a php db accessor

5846932
post	get
in your receiving php file you would get the the post var and use it to insert

5846970
profiling	benchmarking
do this by benchmarking and profiling your code to find real bottlenecks

5846971
ccscene	cclayer
i have the model as a custom class that subclasses nsobject the view as a cclayer which contains ccsprites and the controller as a ccscene which connects multiple models and views

titlebar	window
styles use dwmextendframeintoclientarea to make a portion of your client area into the window frame and then draw the titlebar yourself

5847029
versioning	upgrade
if you can upgrade to a later versioning of the compact framework you could use file.writealltext

5847095
portrait	landscape
in my project i am taking one textview and one button and when i am clicking on button i am displaying some text in the textview which i am geting from an arraylist and when i change the orientation to landscape i am using onsavedinstancestate ... and onrestoreinstancestate .. and getting the text displayed on textview and in landscape mode i am removing the text on textview and i am changing the orientation to portrait but i am getting the text on textview.plz help me.........

5847120
put	get
if you only ever get and put values then that s fine

5847160
vmware	virtualbox
you can use virtual machine software such as virtualbox vmware virtualpc etc to create what is essentially a second machine within yours and talk to that though the network topology may be very slightly unusual - something more to learn about

5847200
post	get
there s been some discussion on the dev list and bugzilla on what s needed and if you were to post to the dev list then we d be happy to help you get started

5847260
udp	tcp
tcp udp and the difference between them

5847276
pull	push
sometimes an error is returned when i do a push via magit usually caused by new code in the remote repo that i have to pull before i push

5847276
pull	push
in this case f to pull changes then p again to push

5847276
pull	push
honestly for some reason instead of pulling through magit i generally just ctrl-z in this situation drop down to shell git pull and git push

5847294
for-loop	loops
for-loop returns only two right values but loops returns 10 elements with 8 undefined

5847318
for-loop	arrays
i assume if you use on an arrays it uses a normal for-loop to iterate over it

5847325
for-loop	arrays
if you simply want to subscript arrays members use a for-loop

5847351
omnixml	nativexml
nativexml and omnixml are open source and popular xml libraries for delphi

5847431
children	parent
that the parent can have a relatively large amount of children 1000

5847431
children	parent
without querying the children table independently via a childrepository using the parent id

5854862
int	double
a consequence of this say a program only called f above with int arguments - depending on the polymorphic mechanism used and inlining choices the compiler might avoid generating any code for f double or generated code might be thrown away at some point in compilation or linking

5854862
int	double
for example you can add to int s and double s using the same notation and the compiler produces

5854862
int	double
to be polymorphic a must be able to operate with values of at least two distinct types int and double finding and executing type-appropriate code

5868125
postgresql	mysql

5868907
range	minimum
the second and i think more promising option would be to have a row represent a range of values with a minimum and maximum value

5868907
range	minimum
this would make queries a bit more complex i m assuming the query for checking if an identifier was in use would be to query for range with minimum lower than x and a maximum higher than x but would result in far fewer rows and would likely be easier to manage and update

5868913
int	chars
i have created a simple memory manager that supports some basic datatypes int float chars string array

5870416
ienumerable	icollection
if calculating the number of elements is expensive they should implement only ienumerable - not icollection

int	boolean
the problem is that my method accepts an int parameter and returns a boolean

5870545

the downside is i have to call this from my groupclicklistener and in order to get it to work i have to put it inside of a runnable and delay it by part of a second otherwise it will do nothing

5870813
client-side	server-side
if you re already running scripts on the client the only real benefit to generating html for ajax updates server-side as opposed to pure client-side dom manipulation is to reuse existing control generating code that you don t want to port to javascript

5870843
public	protected
even if you were to solve the current warning the next thing it ll probably hit you with or if it doesn t it should and fxcop definitely does catch this is that arrays should never be exposed as part of an interface meaning marked protected or public

5870851
int	chars
my idea was to create a judyhs array using an hash function in order to convert the string dna sequence which is 76 letters long and has 7 possible chars into an int to reduce memory usage 4 or 8 bytes instead of 76 bytes on many millions of entries should be quite an achievement

5870905
hide	show
in my app uitablevierwcell have an image gradient cell image and i want to show another image gradient cell image on same posotion in same cell at didselectrowatindexpath i want to show when i select a cell then current cell image gradient cell image should be hide and another image gradient cell image should be display

5871146
min	max
if you need to select 1 column from a table of 800 000 rows where that column is the min or max possible value and that column is not indexed then the unassailable fact is that sql will have to read every row in the table in order to identify that min or max value

5871165
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it is working in opera google-chrome and firefox as you can see here if you are browsing with one of these 3 browsers

free	malloc
i d like to use a custom malloc and free for some allocations in an ios app including those made by classes like nsmutabledata

5871210
nsstring	nsdata
i believe i need to replace malloc in order to do this because the sensitive data is stored in the keychain --- and i have no option other than to use nsdictionary nsstring and nsdata in order to access this data i can t even use the mutable versions

5871227
put	get
http s get put and delete are idempotent because in some network failure modes the client cannot know whether the request completed or how fully

lisp	scheme
these recommendations are books i ve read or started or am reading and mostly deal with scheme not common lisp but still might be of some interest

5871236
lisp	scheme
if you ve got no background in language implementation and have never had the pleasure of reading about the classic lisp and scheme metacircular evaluators i would recommend structure and interpretation of computer programs

5871236
lisp	scheme
in the last two chapters of sicp the authors present a few different interpreters for lisp scheme and a few variants as well as a byte-code compiler and a virtual machine

5871236
lisp	scheme
even though it s very short and intended for newcomers to lisp and scheme if you ve never seen a lisp interpreter written in lisp they do present one and it s quite a delightful book but might not be for everyone due to the cute style

5871236
lisp	scheme
lisp in small pieces presents a number of interpreters written in scheme as well as a byte-code compiler and a compiler-to-c

5871286
vb.net	vb6
the my namespace is a vb.net construct which is intended in part to be a bridge between vb6 and .net apis

this is a higher-level event than either keydown or keyup and as such different data is available in the eventargs

5871453
google-chrome	firefox
ie tends to be finicky about bad syntax wheres firefox and google-chrome tend to try to interpret your code and fix it up as needed

5871468
google-chrome	firefox
i m working on a joomla site have a mootools slideshow working fine on firefox and ie but does not in google-chrome

5871496
keydown	keyup
keydown then keypress then keyup is the order i find

5871517
postgresql	mysql
mysql will return a value at random from the rows postgresql likes correctness so it will throw an error

5871772
addition	multiplication
i m using system.windows.vector but any custom vector class will do as long as it supports basic multiplication and addition

5871781
width	height
i would set the width and height explicitly to ensure consistent rendering across multiple browsers platforms as there is no guarantee that every browser will implement the same default dimensions

5871799
submit	submission
my question concern is how to prevent a user from manipulating each field s properties using a code inspector tool such as firebug before submission the form remove the required class for the email id so that they can successfully submit the form without providing an email input

portrait	landscape
for example you can create bigger images for bigger screens or change the layout xmls for portrait or landscape

5871822

5871879
keydown	keyup
or perhaps you could respond to the javascript keydown keyup events for keyboard left and right and prevent the default

5871920
post	get
separate view functions for get post

5871962
width	height
the memory usage will be roughly width height 2 bytes or 4 bytes if the image is loaded in 32 bits. bitmapfactory provides a way to read an image s dimensions without loading the entire image

5871967
hide	show
use css on your to show the image you want and hide the text

5871984
getter	setter
i know someone already asked about writing getter and setter for bool variable

5872046
google-chrome	firefox
well on google-chrome and firefox all works great

5872065
actionscript	mxml
since it is not possible to pass parameters to a mxml component s constructor i figured i should create my list in actionscript

5872065
actionscript	mxml
i would prefer to have the list in mxml because it will be easier using states later but if i am forced to use pure actionscript so i can instantiate it and pass in parameters any help would go a long way

5872090
textview	imageview
but for example arrayadapter is based on textview only other on imageview only and so on....

5872127
serializable	deserialization
essentially if you want a custom construct to be serializable into the database and then reconstituted as your desired object object graph the transformable type lets you access core data s framework for storing complex formats objects in the database letting you code the logic that does the serializable and deserialization

5872150
free	malloc
in c dynamic memory is allocated on heap using the function malloc the same memory is reclaimed by explicitly calling the function free

5872234

5872248
post	get
then from within your post or get handler create a python dictionary with the desired data and pass that into the function you created

5872258

versioning	upgrade
i m attempting to upgrade my versioning of scriptsharp from 0.6.2 to 0.7.1 to take advantage of the new generics feature

5872273
getter	setter
i think the issue ids that your getter and setter names are not consistent

5872273
getter	setter
in your code it is assumed that the getter and setter are named -immediate and -setimmediate respectively

5872273
getter	setter
the point is that you do not need declared properties to use dot syntax but if you are going to use dot syntax then declared properties are the recommended way of declaring the getter and setter

5872406
ant	maven
and this is where i get confused because i have not worked with ant before and plan to use maven beyond this example

sse	avx
mixing avx vex-encoded and non-avx old sse encoding instructions in the same program requires careful use of vzeroupper on intel cpus to avoid a major performance problem

5872541
submit	submission
it is not advisable to disable a submit button onclick since that could stop the submission

5872551
goto	break
break the significant blocks up into functions and then rather than calling goto just call a function instead

the reason is the separation between server-side jstl and client-side javascript code

5872585
getter	setter
access through a public api getter or and setter

5872608

put	get
note the way i m going to get around this if i don t solve it is to use the database as a message queue and make the fast console app poll for messages and put results back into the database maybe a temp table i don t know by dumping the datatable out to xml

5876649
cpu	processors
to sum up what the above answers have said if you are in user-mode attempting to emulate a virtual processors at a specific frequency you should implement some sort of manual scheduling of the thread that processes cpu instructions either via sleep calls or more advanced functions and features like fibers in windows

you either use git-cherry-pick or maybe just git-merge to pull their changes into your testing branch were you test things and possibly make your own changes - or fire bug reports of to the develops and you re-incorporate their changes

5876774
client-side	server-side	pop-up	dialog
we ve developed an event-based ajax architecture for our application which allows us to generate a piece of content in response to the result of an action and essentially send back any number of commands to the client-side code to say use the results of this rendered partial view to replace the element with id x or open a new modal pop-up dialog with this as the content. this is beneficial because the server-side code can have a lot more control over the results of an ajax request without having to write client-side code to handle every contingency for every action

5876775
put	get
given you can put multiple classes in one file the latter will likely never be done. if you are used to the renamings being done automagically in eclipse like i am you re bound to get caught on this

the variables in the base class are read only and the non public functions are protected in case you need to apply some modifications on them when created another pre-defined ai

5876828
fgets	fgetc
if you re using any higher-level input functions like fgets or worse fgetc or fscanf enough time will be spent searching for delimiters or in function call or parsing overhead that the number of read syscalls really doesn t matter that much as long as the buffer is at least 1kb or so

5876829

since this property has no behavior other than being a getter setter for an integer you re essentially just testing that the compiler worked

post	get
post uses the message body to send the information back to the server as opposed to get which uses the query string everything after the question mark

5876875
post	get
it is possible to send both a get query string and a post message body in the same request but that can get a bit confusing so is best avoided

5876875
post	get
generally best practice dictates that you use get when you want to retrieve data and post when you want to alter it

5876875
post	get
conversely you can use post to retrieve data without changing it but using get means you can bookmark the page or share the url with other people things you couldn t do if you d used post

5876896
post	get
if you followed the above and have a specific wierdness then post the specific thing as a question and you ll probably get help

ant	maven
there are alternatives to ant ivy or maven xml that might be worth a gander

5877192
folder	directory
i have 2 classes directory and map and inside the directory class there is a local string variable that takes the name of the current folder of the directory and want to put it inside a rectangle in the map class that displays the graphics

5877194
move	drag
on windows when you use the mouse to click and drag in a scrollbar to scroll it up and down you can move the mouse approximately 120 pixels away from the scrollbar before the dragging stops working

5877194
move	drag
by contrast on the mac you appear to be able to move it anywhere on the screen and the drag will still happen.

5877197
memcpy	memmove
the main difference between memmove and memcpy is that memmove can be used to relocate a piece of memory to somewhere that overlaps the memory block that you re trying to move

5877219
google-chrome	safari
for it to work in webkit-based browsers google-chrome safari the fileupload has to be moved out of view but not hidden as in setvisible false which sets the css display property to none something like in css position absolute

5877220
stateless	stateful
you still might find stateless stateful or message ejbs useful even if you don t want to use entity beans

5877220
stateless	stateful
with that said you can create pojo components that are stateful stateless persistent or message-driven

5877299
width	height
right before the map control we add a element with the same width and height as map control

5877317
maven	pom.xml
i ve got a project with maven in which one subproject a wants to depend on another subproject b which uses pom.xml packaging

5877317
maven	pom.xml
maven best practices encourage you to use pom-packaged projects to group dependencies but with the added step of mvn install on the pom.xml project

5877317
maven	pom.xml
maven lifecycle documentation says a project that is purely metadata packaging value is pom.xml only binds goals to the install and deploy phases

5877369
division	subtract
you might be able to work something out where you constantly subtract the previous payment from the total amount and do the division rounding up to the nearest penny

5877369
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
this is obviously more math intensive than the add subtract code above since we divide and multiplying in every iteration

5877394
firefox	safari
however safari and firefox appear to suffer somewhat

5877407
coalesce	nvl
similarly i ve not checked whether it supports nvl - maybe it supports coalesce instead.

5877426
rss	feed
i am trying to use this function in functions.php to grab the thumbnail of posts and add them to my rss feed

5877465
multiplying	subtract
if you subtract 40 from the hours_worked with is also 40 you ll just be multiplying by zero

5877471
addclass	removeclass
you can do this by using the addclass and removeclass functions in jquery

5877474
mouse	keyboard
here is the question about capturing global mouse keyboard you can try using it in vb.net and test it though i guess you only don t want to be caught while playing games during work

5877522
hide	show
the easiest way to do this is to use javascript to show and hide divs

5877541
queue	fifo
recall that a queue is a datastructure that provides fifo behavior

5877543
rss	feed
edit i have just discovered that oracle provides an rss feed for timezone updates

5877579
google-chrome	firefox
it work for ie6 firefox and google-chrome

5877585
profiling	debugging
bear in mind that it s much easier to test debugging and profiling programs that are broken up into functions

5877588
zoo	xts
dat is a zoo object rather than xts

5877642
google-chrome	firefox
it work for ie6 firefox and google-chrome

5877664
int	double
but sometimes what i pass is an int like 7 and not a double like 7.0 so if i use tostring method then 7 will be 7 but i want it to be 7.0 now i also need to consider the culture because some times maybe french is using for decimal so it should be 7 0 .

5877683
width	height
i m designing a website where the administrator can choose some options like where to align the text font size for certain elements what height width of the thumbnails etc

5877696
width	height
you ll see that the width and height are tremendous and what s more the left side is a large negative number

5877698
nicedit	fckeditor
some nice ones are the fckeditor tinymce and my favourate nicedit

5877702
vmware	esx
im specifically using vmware esx

5877704
inherited	subclassing
how does one set the values of the validatable data structures at the subclassing level instead of in the inherited validatable class

5877707
throttling	throttle
first for cookied users throttle connections so you can see at most one page view per second but once your one-second timer is up you experience no throttling whatsoever

5877714
post	get
i would first define what style the administrator wants through get or post and then i would echo the html and the style

5877769
touchesmoved	touchesended
the touchesmoved would allow dragging of the selection box and the touchesended would allow tap selection

5877775
typedef	struct
the list is composed of link struct to be more precise it appears the link type is typedef d to be a pointer to the actual node struct

5877795
width	height
group 1 will capture the height and group 2 the width

5877828
rss	feed
we use this plugin extensively to republish content from other websites that s exposed in an rss or atom feed

5877905
pull	push
your clients can pull information from the server using a myriad of libraries or techniques i would recommend asihttprequest or the server can push via the notification services

5877933
free	malloc
memory returned by malloc may be nonzero but only after being used and free by other code in the same process

5877952
subtract	add
so you just need to do the math to add subtract what and when

5877977
opera	firefox
the code submitted looks good however i would include the extra lines to cover firefox and opera

5877982
m2e	maven-install-plugin	m2e	pom.xml	maven-install-plugin	pom.xml	maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml
configuring maven-install-plugin to run during the compile phase and copy the relevant pom.xml to the repository seems to accomplish what i wanted as far as maven itself is concerned though m2e still is not happy it throws failed to read artifact descriptor errors with no additional description for the pom.xml that has a dependency on the other pom.xml project

5878004
pull	push
so people in the know can push pull the secret overlay repo and people w o access to it can use the base repo

5878015
pull	push
the commands that move things to your server are push and pull which move very space efficient binary representations of only what changed

5878018
rss	feed
use the rss variant of google data api with any rss feed reader widget

5878064
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this issue does not happen google-chrome or safari or firefox 4.

5878079
width	height
how to make the width and height x2 using python regular

5878079
width	height
but if i put the height property before the width like this

5878101
inherited	properties
edit 22-apr-2014 in version 1.10 jquery includes a support.ownlast properties based on testing a single properties apparently this is for ie9 support to see if inherited properties are enumerated first or last

5878101
inherited	properties
this continues to ignore the fact that an object s properties can be returned in any order regardless of whether they are inherited or own and may be jumbled

5878101
inherited	properties
however some developers wish to create truly empty objects that have no inherited properties

5878157
min	max
this is what i have done so far but it is going from max to min so i have it subtracting 1 instead of adding

5878192
textview	imageview
i have a gridview that uses an adapter to set imageview and when i open up an alertdialog and focus on its textview the images in the gridview shift positions

5878209
put	get
and want to put text to about dlg or get at runtime

5878235
fadein	fadeout
i ve put together a quick example of a working fadein fadeout toggle loosely based off the code you provided

5878235
fadein	fadeout
jquery fadein fadeout demo

5878244
width	height
now it matches no matter if width is before height or viceversa and i think the 4 groups give you enough info when doing the replacement

5878244
width	height
i captured the groups height and width for you to know which value matched first otherwise if you obtain 111 and 10 you won t know which one is the height and the width but i don t think that s necessary in your case because all you have to do is duplicate both values but could be useful in case you want increment height and width in different values

5878263
disk	ram
no unencrypted data gets written to ram disk

5878281
createelement	each
i ask because i ve tried createelement and it seems that all of the properties that have to be added to each element slows things down

5878451
maven	pom.xml
if you do everything the conventional maven way then your maven pom.xml is generally very small and everything just works

5878488
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if the login is successful i want to then create a uitabbarcontroller with a navigation controller as the first tab whose root controller is a uiviewcontroller that i am creating

5878488
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the rootviewcontroller of my first uinavigationcontroller is actually acting as a delegate to the logincontroller so if a user logs in correctly it calls a method in my rootviewcontroller which is where i would then like to push a uitabbarcontroller onto the stack

5878579
hide	show
use progressbar.setvisibility view.visible and progressbar.setvisibility view.gone to show it hide it respectively

5878594
post	get
it is because i m using firebug and when i go to net tab under the post tab it shows individual parameters as well as a get string for post submitted requests

5878615
put	get
first to get the environment variable you need to put quotes around it

5878622
lxml	libxml2
always use tools like lxml libxml2 or beautiful - they will ever do a smarter and better

5878637
getter	setter
this piqued my curiosity so i went ahead and used peter hosey s suggestion of overriding +resolveinstancemethod to generate the getter and setter

5878647
put	get
now when it starts with a team who have good understanding of struts 1.x is that they will get the underlying system quickly.but before let me to put one point in a clear manner

5878677
put	get
google.com link which simply doesn t get recognized as a valid html link but does get the anchor tag put with it properly

5878730
hide	show
or create a dummy textbox for the password and have the real password box hidden -- on focus the dummy box should hide itself and show and focus on the real password box

5878739
rss	feed
i have a basic rss reader i made from three20 tutorials using ttlauncherview as a menu to different feed and tttableviewcontroller to show the feed list

5878745
put	get
if you don t want to get that in-depth with your users create the reports for them but put a few key parameters in the reports

5878746
try-catch	exception-handling
typically i prefer to put one time start-up code in the application start within try-catch and if there is an exception-handling then set the global error flag

5878760
hash	md5
md5 is a weak hash

5878760
hash	md5
edit as omg ponies points out you need to have consistency with the md5 or whatever hash check

5878788
hash	md5
the first one performs string concatenation for the variables e and p additionallying using the md5 function to get the hash of the password for comparison against the user_tb.user_pass column value

5878788
hash	md5
the md5 isn t any good if the values aren t stored as the hash - because there wouldn t be anything to match against

5878821
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i always follow this approach when i have both a uinavigationcontroller and a uitabbarcontroller

5878882
width	height
now for your use you will need to look at the resolution of the preview and then scale down the height or width accordingly based on that resolution

5878944
monkeyrunner	adb
the workaround as monkeyrunner does not do much that invoking adb in this cases is to use

5878963
width	height
now i want a piece of code that would give me the x y or any active current window opened say notepad and its height and width

5878965
width	height
it blindly performs its numerical replacement which results in erroneous results when the width is exactly half the height given the following

5878965
width	height
note that the width gets captured into groups 1 and 2 and height into groups 3 and 4 even if their order is reversed in the target string

5878973
touchesbegan	touchesended
i think you can make use of the touchesbegan or touchesended method as lostintransit suggested

5878991

5879064
getter	setter
the typical way to set c from an instance variable is to write a getter rather than a setter

5879087
fflush	gets
if you ran your command for long enough you d eventually see the file size grow in chunks of size 4096 or so possibly more or less as the buffer fills up and gets fflush

5879087
stdout	fflush
to force awk to fflush its buffer after every line regardless of whether or not stdout is a terminal add an fflush command

5879101
width	height
pls provide me the logic of how to fix the size of the pintch in out of image on the next page with the given image.eg....width 100 and height 150 then image is pintch in out upto that level and fix there if user is zoomed more then this size then also the image is fixed to that width height

5879103
min	max
you can find the indices of the columns responsible for the min and max values using blkproc or blockfun from the file exchange if you do not have the imaging toolkit

5879169
explode	implode
to be clear what im trying to do in this case is explode quotes capitalize every other letter in the array then implode them back

5879171

5879422
width	height
i m not sure what you could use although if you happen to be using sdl then that might have some event handling for it and may be able to return the screen width and height if glutget doesn t work

5879481
width	height
however i would like to return an image that is the same size as the width and height specified in the iframe

5879481
width	height
in that case i would need the width and height of the iframe to be accessible at the backend

5879503
width	height
in your example the page script can t get what the value of the width height is

5879503
width	height
but you can pass width height variables in the url like

5879556
folder	directory
for instance let s say we have the directory c folder and want to copy it over to d

5879559
jobs	cron
i need to keep on open the listener page if i do this from cron jobs they have limitation like cron job can run for few minutes only

5879571
width	height
you could use javascript demo is in jquery for cross-browser ease of implementation to inspect the iframe element and copy its size attributes into the url requested by the iframe the following will do what you need by delaying the url of the iframe being set until the width and height are determined

5879585
curb	libcurl
if you want to fetch pages you have a lot of choices everything from net http which is part of rails core to the curb gem which employs the libcurl library

5879603
memcpy	memmove
in the case of potentially overlapping memory locations which it looks like is the case in your code you should use the memmove function rather than the memcpy routine

5879603
memcpy	memmove
memmove takes the same parameters in the same order as memcpy and so can just be used as a drop in replacement

printwriter and printstream never throw ioexception

5880858
atomic	compare-and-swap
since atomic compare-and-swap operations are done with different fields enqueuing changes tail.next while dequeuing advances head stronger guarantees would require additional complexity not only in this function but at least in dequeue as well

5881396
width	height
as you d like to keep your code structure the main thing you have to do is to not have your ul and li elements display as inline inline elements can t take width or height but instead make the li elements inline-blocks within a block level ul in my fiddle example link below i ve taken your capty.css and your custom.css and changed the relevant bits i ve left your own css in my sheet at the bottom commented out so you can compare

5881396
width	height
the main thing after the inline problem was fixed was that the generated width and height for the capty-wrapper was 125px but in order to allow for your paddings and borders it needs to be slightly different to get the 127px you have on your div.picture example

5881401

if you could put a try catch arround the exception in startt1 and post us the exact exception you re getting this might help narrow down exactly whats going on but i think the above is most likely

5881476
rss	feed
i like to know how i could create a rss feed with json because right now i got to create one by following the example of kitchen sink

5881495
webclient	httpwebrequest
instead of using webclient you can use httpwebrequest so that you can access the content stream and feed that into your constructor

5881495
gif	png
finally note that you would only be using mime type here to verify that your content is an image - so you explicitly would not load something that is mime type application octet-stream into an image object - but only things like image jpeg image gif image png etc

the standard way to access server-side data from client-side javascript is to pass it out through a controller on the server preferably encoded in json and use ajax on the client side to request it from the server

5883331
client-side	server-side
there is no way to directly access server-side files since in general client-side code can t access the server s private file system

5883371

to perform such transformations you need not only xpath but also another language that is hosting an xpath engine -- such as xslt xquery or any programming language with dom api

5884000
cpython	pypy
as far as i know numpy has never been succesfully ported to pypy and it is not trivial to do so as the c api for pypy is different from the cpython one

firefox	safari
am able to find out if a particular span element is in selection by using dom range s compareboundarypoints method in firefox and safari but it will not work for ie

5884242
post	get
also post is generally considered better than get for ajax calls as it doesn t have the same string length limit slightly more secure too

5884270
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the problem is occurring on everything i ve tested safari google-chrome firefox mac

5884327

so to conclude what i am aiming for is be able to get a list of all the users that have posted a blog post but only grab their details once thus giving me a list of names and ids so that i can create a form using check boxes that the user can tick to opt in to receive updates

5884477
post	get
so i get post requests to my api with lots of fields and values

5884504
ubuntu	centos
centos 5 gives me utf-8 ubuntu natty narwhal gives me latin1

5884543

5884557
google-chrome	firefox
tests for firefox and ie are ok but only the google-chrome can not view these thumbnails

5884566
maven	pom.xml
the compiler level is taken from the pom.xml configuration of the maven compiler plugin

5884566
maven	m2e
but apart from that mvn eclipse eclipse shouldn t be used any more m2e is the way to go for eclipse + maven

5884582
google-chrome	firefox
but when i use the html5 attribute required on all of them the browser google-chrome firefox doesn t allow me to submit the form unless all of them are checked

5884605

try ordening the items in firefox google-chrome then test it in ie and we ll all facepalm because of bill gates

5884613
uiview	uiwindow
uiwindow is a subclass of uiview so you could just hook into those

5884651
hide	show
use regular visual elements to construct your own dialog and show hide accordingly

5884664
datamapper	activerecord
our schema is far from compatible with activerecord s defaults and it s too large to simply migrate the schema so i ve ditched activerecord and started using datamapper which allows us to hide the schema differences more easily

5884675
dictionary	map
since your numbers don t correspond in any mathematical way to the actual values you ll need to simply map them via a dictionary

5884676
google-chrome	firefox
i created this jsfiddle test and it s behaving correctly based on the specs for those browsers based on the specs like google-chrome 11 and firefox 4

5884681
for-loop	arrays
for example you could have and by knowing that every other character from 0 to 62 won t be 125 you can do a for-loop until you find 125 and return the size of the arrays

5884704
width	height
more complex animations can be built by animating other properties such as width and height including the use of easing functions and key frames

5884714
jar	war
the solution i came to was to build the javafx app using an ant task as it was a netbeans project anyway and including the resulting jar in the war by using this configuration for the maven-war-plugin

5884714
jar	war	ant	maven-jar-plugin
for those looking for a pure-maven solution instead of an ant task i was also able to use the maven-jar-plugin to specifically build a jar the project packaging type still war as well which i then include with the method included above

5884796
mdpi	hdpi
most likely you have icons with dimensions that are under the incorrect resolution level ldpi mdpi hdpi

5884837

5885009
asterisk	freeswitch
but so far i tried with asterisk yate sipx freeswitch and none does or allow this feature yet

5885009
asterisk	freeswitch
hammering my head h.239 is a nightmare if you are a developer dreaming sip none can do that asterisk yate freeswitch sipx opensip etc etc

5885009
voip	sip
otherwise you will just buy all those www.google.com fastest search engine results full of confusing hardwares and get trapped to fine tune with your voip switch which is mostly now a days sip

5885036
hide	show
this is unfortunately one of the pitfalls of obfuscation with no real workaround the whole point of obfuscation is to hide and obfuscate the very information that you are attempting to show here

5885043
folder	directory
your code looks ok.here the upload folder must he stay in the upper of the directory where you run the code.then it should to work.if your script folder like this test script abc.php then your uploads directory should be test uploads

5885044
nunit	mstest
can run mstest and nunit tests for c# projects

5885045
wakelock	powermanager
the only solution i ve found is using the powermanager and using a wakelock

5885127
nant	cruisecontrol
we use cruisecontrol in conjunction to nant that could satisfy all your need but cruisecontrol is still built in java

5885221
getter	setter
declare the property getter and setter in a default way for your property

5885236
width	height
you already have the width and height

5885245
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have managed to work around this issue by detecting when the user clicks on a tabitem and then committing edits on visible datagrid in the tabcontrol

5885290
qwebview	pyqt
i ve built an application in pyqt with a qwebview

5885318
screens	tablet
this function was used in an application that was called remotely with the help of citrix software set up on users tablet pcs and the application ran in full screens

5885323
for-loop	loops
trying to loops out some pictures using a for-loop and cant get them to be posiotioned directly beneath the previous picture i have set the height number in my xml where i get the pictures from

5885329
maven	pom.xml
maven will only manage dependencies specified in the pom.xml and any transitive dependencies ie

5885329
maven	pom.xml
if you right click on the pom.xml you can select maven - add dependency - which will search the default repositories

5885331
google-chrome	firefox
ie8 and ie9 are much better in terms of speed but they still lack some of the base functions that firefox and google-chrome offer

5885362
getter	setter
the above line tells the compiler that it should automatically generate the setter and getter methods for the declared property

5885362
getter	setter
you can leave that out but then you have to write your own setter and getter

5885423
stdout	stderr
if you want stdout and stderr both everything then the simplest way is

5885423
stdout	stderr
the means stderr and stdout

5885458
getter	setter
the synthesize is also doing quite a bit of work by creating the getter and setter for that property that also handle all sorts of memory management for you

5885510
children	parent
the reason for this is that when you set the color of red to the parent li the child ul and li inherit the color and this causes the color of the children to be red also

5885534
folder	directory
if i create the directory by hand then everything starts working even though they re empty so one obvious fix is to include a blank.html or similar in each folder so that they get created by the installer

5885545
free	malloc
and you ll have to manage dynamic memory allocation for malloc and free

5885571
pull	push
rather than using a blocking queue and having the worker threads pull from it give each thread it s own queue and have the i o thread push batches of work into each thread s queue

5885572
getter	setter
be sure to setup any getter or setter for accessing link if need be

5885584
free	malloc
certainly you can use malloc to obtain it and give the new thread the responsibility for free ing it

5885584
free	malloc
in many ways this seems like the simplest and cheapest way no synchronization required but the synchronization is actually hidden inside malloc and free and could be mildly expensive especially since most thread-oriented allocators ptmalloc and tcmalloc for example incur additional costs when the thread freeing the memory is not the same as the thread that allocated it

5885589
google-chrome	firefox
maybe some plugin tool used in google-chrome firefox or ie that someone can recommend

5885610
stdout	stderr
mind the difference between file descriptors and io streams such as stderr and stdout

5885626
hide	show
i use this in a hardcoded scenario to hide show some listitems in the listview

5885644
wakelock	powermanager
the only solution i ve found is using the powermanager and using a wakelock

5885644
wakelock	powermanager
please read the powermanager documentation and try a different wakelock

5885680
ubuntu	linux
the whole thing would be developed on a linux ubuntu gnome machine and then used on a windows vista computer

5885701
trie	dawg
i would use a dawg directed acyclic word graph which is basically a compressed trie

5885701
disk	ram

5885703
vsto	add-in
i m developing an excel vsto document level add-in using composite application guidance prism for visual studio 2008 .net 3.5

5885708
int	boolean
instead you should create them in the same way you would create int or boolean

5885711
inline-functions	inlining
a debug build disables inlining and also the linker options that discard duplicate code so you get lots of copies of every template and inline-functions

5885716
opencv	emgucv
also a .net wrapper exists for opencv - emgucv

5885722
nhibernate	queryover
the entityframework equivalent implementation is easy as they have an include string prop extension method but i dont see anything like that in either queryover or nhibernate linq

5885737
folder	directory
keep them all under the same folder and set this line in the directory s .htaccess file

5885756
addition	multiplication
i d like to do some simple addition and multiplication with asp .net textboxes and jquery if possible

5885756
multiplying	add
i d like the user to enter quantity 1 and quantity 2 in the text boxes and the script to add those quantities then multiplying by price for total order asynchronously

5885779
children	parent
if loaded children had access to parent a malicious swf could get server access through your loader swf for example

5885820
rpm	yum
my working environment is fedora 15 beta python 2.7.1 usr bin python pypy 1.5.0-alpha0 with gcc 4.6.0 in usr bin pypy installed from rpm using yum easy_install version is distribute 0.6.14 usr bin easy_install

5885854
actionscript	mxml
another usage of this metatag is offering events code completion by ide both in mxml and in actionscript when you re typing addeventlistener

5885866
google-chrome	firefox
for example calling firefox calls the slightly less secure version of the browser by less secure i mean it is running in more of the browser google-chrome than your average user and can do the relevant calls

5885908
codeigniter	pyrocms
i m new to codeigniter and pyrocms and i m stuck on 2 things

5885915
firefox	safari
no success in ie8 ie7 + chrom + firefox + safari everything ok - debbuging js everthing ok.

5885956
carrierwave	paperclip
if you need to able add images to your textarea through a ruby on rails library such as paperclip or carrierwave you may consider one of these

i am using nunit and moq

5886138
int	double
this version doesn t limit itself to bool int or double but a string comes out as

getter	setter
to get around this i removed the exception field and its getter setter from my exception handler class your myerrorprocessor class and replaced that with a method to manually extract the exception from the valuestack

5886145
interpolation	splines
a good way to implement this is using splines interpolation between control points

5886168
width	height
there is also height and width but not important here

5886222
lxml	elementtree
use xml parsing modules like lxml or elementtree in python stdlib instead of regex

5886237
cos	exp
the functions applied to the samples are non-linear but smooth exp ln cos etc

5886242
min	max	range	max	range	min
what this code does is use random min max to generate a random x and y value between the desired min and max range

5886244
width	height
the view s width is kept the same but the height is given the same value as the width giving a perfect square

5886244
children	parent
i thought that if you change the views dimension of the parent it would have been passed down to the children

5886254
hide	show
i am trying to hide an element then replace its contents while it s hidden with an ajax load and as a callback i would like to show that element again

5886283

5886621
put	get
i had to put a 1 second delay before clearing the console and couldn t get it any better than that

5886669
uiview	subviews
just setting the uiaccessibilitytraitplayssound accessibilitytrait on a uiview subviews doesn t seem to do it

5886683
puts	gets
your main page where you want stuff to be displayed simply gets the data back out and puts them into a link container nameofwebsite

5886692

if you create an abstract base class that your view models inherited from viewmodelbase which implements the ichangetracking and inotifypropertychanged interfaces you can have your view model base attach to notification of properties changes in effect signaling that the view model has been modified and which will set the ischanged properties to true to indicate that the view model is dirty

cfstring	nsstring
and at the same time nsstring is also toll-free bridged to cfstring meaning that you can switch before those two types freely just by casting

5895149
nsmutablestring	nsstring
i guess this was convenient from the implementation point of view â both nsstring and nsmutablestring can be backed by a common class less code duplication and this class makes sure you donâ t violate the immutability

ideally since you have set the viewport to 0 0 width height the image should remain in the same size

5895563
post	get
if i change form method from post to get then i get the form data

5895571

i searched the web for some solutions but the only thing i ve got is that i should put a img with width 100 and height 100 and put it as the background

5895591
children	parent
form2 is your main form parent mdi container form3 is the mdi children isn t it

5895617
implements	extends
should your decorated classes implements tnterfaces you should also implements them in the decorator but still delegate to the decorated instance for their implementation-unless you want to extends or override the base functionality

5895629
sql-insert	sql-delete	sql-insert	sql-update	sql-delete	sql-update
the mapping tags sql-insert sql-delete and sql-update override these strings

5895754
nsmutablestring	nsstring
developers use the opaque types cfstringref bridged with nsstring and cfmutablestringref bridged with nsmutablestring to refer to these strings so at first glance there are two different types of strings immutable and mutable

opera	firefox
this works perfectly in mozilla firefox but not in opera

5895793
children	parent
in an mvc 3 .net fw 4.0 project i have a data that relates in a parent child relationship i ve built up my model to contain a list of children with each parent record and displaying it as in the following example

and a twist to this is that this works fine in safari but not in ie firefox google-chrome

5895852
filtering	grouping
dynamic distribution grouping members are auto calculated based on the filtering and conditions you set

5895852
filtering	grouping
i imagine that the admin needs to set the attribute that you know is being filtering for the distribution grouping

5895942
getter	setter
you don t need to get the parameters from the request parameter map as long as you register your bean as managed bean and provide getter and setter methodes for your bean members

5895942
getter	setter
getter and setter example are given for stuno member

5896085
class-method	delegation
the intention is that both the abstract and concrete class-method can send messages to the single assigned delegation instance

5896085
class-method	delegation
i don t want to go there because then the super class-method won t have access to the same delegation property

5896092

5896101
setcontentview	findviewbyid
call setcontentview before you call findviewbyid

5896134
pull	push
so you could have a bare repository on the server where everyone push and pull from

5896134
pull	push
i strongly suggest that you have a separation between the live server and what you are currently working on another repository where you push your work too and pull from which works as an integration repository

5896162
innodb	myisam
the total time of execution is about 150 seconds but if i use myisam instead of innodb the time is about 0.2 seconds

5896162
innodb	myisam
is it possible to improve the inserts using innodb to get close to myisam performance or it s a engine limitation

5896177
filewriter	printwriter
printwriter is using this filewriter as opposed to creating its own with the file you pass it.

5896188
prepare	execute
the fact that the lone insert prepare statement seems to be execute against the database rather than being prepare points to either a poor implementation of php unlikely or the dbms not supporting prepare sql

5896188
prepare	execute
if the dbms does support prepare statements and the php implementation handles it properly there is some kind of issue with the insert being execute which also needs some investigation

5896216
implements	extends
list should not itself implements extends deque because adding to removing from the start of a list may not be something that can be easily supported by every implementation

5896225
spaces	delimiter
for that example and others where they are delimiter by a spaces how about

5896267
inherited	properties
fortunately this will allow instanceof to behave as expected when working with chains of constructors as well as allowing inherited overriding of properties properly

what i want to do is to get these values and put them into values of other input fields

5896305
superclass	subclassing
create a proper superclass that will need to be subclassing in order to perform the specific tasks you need it for

5896305
superclass	subclassing
if you would be like coding a game you could create a superclass that is called object which would be subclassing for specifying certain types of objects like props or ragdolls

5896356
nofollow	noindex
we ve got a module that you can select noindex index follow nofollow on the admin section of each page

5896369
innodb	myisam
innodb is often slower than myisam being a transactional db engine with acid properties

5896388
consistency	acid
like all transactional dbs innodb has to ensure acid consistency which takes a lot of work and also what kills your performance is that at the end of each transaction it has to wait for the harddisk to say ok the data is written as for the d durability in acid

5896465
innodb	myisam
myisam is faster than innodb when it comes to insert but not by a margin of 750 times which indicates you require innodb tuning

nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
but ok let s assume that this is a really extreme requirement usecase where poorly developed code is involved you know runtimeexception like nullpointerexception s are actually developer errors

5896814
integer	fractions
are they really fractions one integer divided by another integer in that case you might want to represent this using two integers

5896832

5897085
int	double
just to make it clear the value might be an int double decimal or anything else comparable to 0

if you need interactions you can implement the touchesxxx methods in your custom views you can also add targets to any uicontrol descendant such as a uibutton which may be part of your custom view

5897482
qmainwindow	qwidget
for a qmainwindow you use setcentralwidget qwidget unlike all other qwidget subclasses

uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
i would recommend reading up on major upgrade which will allow automatic uninstall of the existing versioning before the new versioning is installed

5897889
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
i can t write up the whole major upgrade solution here but basically it involves authoring the upgrade table of your msi to detect versioning to uninstall

5897889
versioning	upgrade
you need to change the package code product code and versioning number only 3 digits matter and keep the same upgrade code two msi files with the same upgrade code know they are related - i.e they are from the same product family

5897898
actionscript	mxml
i don t think it matters much but the component in question is a series within a chart that gets created at runtime so i would prefer a solution in actionscript rather than mxml if possible

edit the vectorconverter tool is php-based but uses xslt for the heavy lifting - vml and svg are just xml under the hood - so if you can t access the php libraries directly you could probably manage to reuse the xslt in the language of your choice

5898140
google-chrome	firefox
i think through that you can see the styles of anything in the google-chrome layer of firefox

5898152
put	get

an example is super- and subclassing where the superclass have one or more constructor-injected dependencies

5899161
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
the subclassing must usually inherited these dependencies even though they might only be useful to the superclass

5899161
superclass	subclassing
with an aggregate service the superclass constructor parameters can be collapsed into one parameter reducing the repetitiveness in subclassing

5899161
superclass	subclassing
another important side effect is that subclassing are now insulated against changes in the superclass dependencies introducing a new dependency in the superclass means only changing the aggregate service definition

5899202

min	max
i realize that some functions min max convert the dataframe into a vector and return the corresponding value for the entire df while mean and sd return a value for each column

5902183

5902994

min	max
i like it s functionality but i just want to define the fields the types and perhaps some extra information min and max value and have a list generated that match the criteria

5903047

5903251
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
browsers used by customers include the usual ie firefox safari and google-chrome but we may be able to limit clients to a particular browser so something that is not cross-browser may be acceptable but is certainly not preferred

5903279
hash	salt
the password hash is salt prestashop seems to be using the value _cookie_key_ in settings.inc.php for this

5903279

this code updates the model and view on google-chrome 11 and 10 but this does not work on firefox

5903281
getter	setter
when you use property it creates getter setter for the object

5903307
width	height
the variables width and height are private and the method duplicate is public

5903307
public	protected
the keyword friend is for accessing the private and protected functions outside of a crectangle object but duplicate is already public

5903354
getter	setter
if you are not using the dot syntax you are not using any setter or getter

5903354
getter	setter

i am trying to fadein fadeout my hyperlinks

5903451
post	get
this blog post should get you started

5903454
client-side	server-side
maybe you can try some jquery plugin that handles all client-side processing and take data from the server-side code

5903481
stdout	fflush
i guess that these lines have shorter output so the fflush frequency is lower i used the stdout line to print a deliberate help message

5903497
client-side	server-side
as alternative approach you can use some jquery plugin that handles all client-side processing and take data from the server-side code

5903544

5903601
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
queries with the aggregate-functions like min max sum count are running very slow

5903627
stdout	stderr
this error may appear when you use an interpreter that overrides stdout stderr such as idle though idle itself would give you a different error

5903627
stdout	stderr
it may also be caused by a library which overrides stdout stderr

5903627
stdout	stderr
anyway it seems that what you re trying to do with your code is to redirect stdout stderr yourself

5903631
explode	fgetcsv
ps fgetcsv is a bit slower then opening the file and explode the contents etc

5903651
spaces	delimiter
i can use spaces as delimiter up to the point of the 001002.

5903653
portrait	landscape
when in landscape - the application starts showing the correct default image but then the actual app starts in portrait

5903653
portrait	landscape
no matter what i do - if the device is in landscape the app starts as portrait

5903675
stdout	stderr
as a general practice when i write scripts log messages always go to stderr and data status messages results from an algorithm whatever goes to stdout

5903682
dbcontext	objectcontext
this is true for both objectcontext api and dbcontext api - it is by design

5903707
typedef	struct
rather than declare each type as a typedef use the struct keyword the same way you would a class

5903709
portrait	landscape
you can change the nibs starting position to be either landscape or portrait

5903711
typedef	struct
use forward declaration and define struct without using typedef as

5903751

5903775
post	get
take a look at the following blog post i did explaining how to use excel for looking at tfs data that uses churn as an example allowing you to drill down into folders and files - but you should be able to get the data that you are looking for

5903795
client-side	server-side
so from the server-side you need to render a script that processes the table in bulk and then manage the client-side interactions in a singular fashion

5903816
put	get
i know i could put the textbox.text into the downloadstringcompleted but i don t want it to because it will be used for a class later on and the result will have a get set method

try redirecting both stdout and stderr to the log file

5904068
put	get	pascal	delphi
anders hejlsberg from c# has been working on both delphi and turbo pascal earliser which certainly must have given some inspiration to c# he actually also expresses some regrets of not being able to remove features once they have been put into the language but that s another story. in the case of major languages i also guess the language designers read so and similar places to get ideas and inspiration

5904074
width	height
in the example below the lineargradientbrush gives a bit of a beveled look to the border the border is stretched across the width but the height is similiar to a average toolbar

5904094

5907792
int	double
by writing instead strange patterns like 0xdeadbeef most of code that will access in read mode those bytes will probably find strange unreasonable values the int -559038737 or a double with value -1.1885959257070704e+148 hopefully triggering some other self consistency check assertion

in classic asp using a post instead of a get is a matter of changing your form from method get to method post

5908848
post	get
access both post and get data

5908848
post	get
so to change the code from using get to post in the asp code you will need to change any request.querystring instructions to request.form or simply request

i ve tested this on google-chrome my primary browser and firefox and it hasn t worked properly on either

5908969
int	boolean
an association of course is the uml term for all kinds of references between real classes entity composite pk class enums etc. that is - as i understand it - not necessarily a reference to one of the java simple wrapper types like int string boolean etc

5908979
post	get
i am passing the paramter subsession id as hidden parameter and i m submitting the form as post because my application should not allow get requests

5909215
rubygems	rvm
rvm rubygems current

5909220
stdout	stderr
they also shine at redirecting stdin stdout and stderr for these in lots of ways and are pretty good at reacting to error codes returned by programs called

5909220
zsh	tcsh	bash	tcsh	bash	zsh
while shell scripts especially for shells that are properly scriptable such as bash or zsh certainly not csh or tcsh do provide lots of other useful stuff and allow writing just about anything a student i knew thought the numerics assignment was simply too easy for him so he wrote his code as a bash script â working fine of course the syntax is simply not optimized for that and you typically have to write strange line noise to even increase n by 1

5909223
postgresql	mysql
i have changed database from postgresql to mysql but i don t know how to transfer data from one to other

5909224
sorting	filtering
the reason of such strange at the first glance json data is that jqgrid is designed to support paging sorting and filtering searching of data implemented on the server

5909224
sorting	filtering
if you has small number of rows under some hundert for example you can use client based sorting paging and filtering if you add loadonce true parameter of the jqgrid but the server based implementation allows you to work with really large dataset having many hundred thousands rows of data with very good performace

5909259
equals	gethashcode
if gethashcode returns the same value equals is called

5909260
versioning	upgrade
the jquery validation plugin was upgrade with nuget at versioning 1.8.0 and jquery library to 1.6

i was looking for similar solution like the one used in blend and with your mentions i created simple behavior class with two attached properties width height that are applied only in desintime

5909397
hash	md5
our system uses md5 hash passwords but the latest version of phpbb3 has a different format phpass so i need to write a script that will replace the phpbb password with the account password for roughly 300 000 users

5909397
hash	md5
we used the same usernames and passwords for both so each record in our_db.accounts has the md5 hash of the same encrypted password in phpbb.users

5909402
post	get
what you are doing when in your first one is that you are sending it as a get that being said when you want to post like you suggested you need to set post to be correct as well

5909417

i have a set of drop down boxes which are bound to the folder names in a folder via getting all the directory and then their lastnames and then bind this array to the drop down list

i think it will be finding the chars a b c which is a string and failing to take it as an int

5909633
superclass	subclassing
i suspect you have a uiviewcontroller subclassing which does have that method but for some reason you re calling the superclass

5909667
post	get
it then looks to see whether the method was a get or a post it also receives arguments from the form in name value pairs also known as a query string

5909667
post	put
if the method was a post method then it is put into the request body

5909677
firefox	safari
a custom background plugin has started to cause certain browsers firefox ie8 9 safari to reveal an appended url string when viewing the index page - this mostly shows when not visiting the site directly but rather when going through for example google - ie utf-8 q dear+earth

i had to support linking both youtube and vimeo videos

5909930
put	get
i have the closest thing i can get to an enum in javascript which is basically a globally scoped json style variable with a load of constants it is used to describe event types so rather than every class that wants to raise listen to events having to put hard coded strings it can just use a constant from this enum variable

5910002
post	get
this is most commonly used in forms as the name that gets post d or get d through to the server side language

5910004
width	height
i cannot access the iframe cross domain â i just need the height width

5910013

5910032
dependencyobject	dispatchertimer
i started doing an dependencyobject with attached properties but i am not sure how to forward the property values like interval to the internal dispatchertimer

5910032
dependencyobject	dispatchertimer
silverlight doesn t seem to provide any events when the dependency properties change and dispatchertimer is not a dependencyobject so i can t databind directly to its properties

i also tried a combination of mouseenter and mouseleave but with this there is the same behaviour

5910137
equals	gethashcode
s implementations of equals and gethashcode don t seem to do this i think they re just the defaults

5910149
mousemove	mousedown
so your code will add an event handler to listen for mousedown when the dom is ready once it occurs it will add an event for mousemove - the document now has both event handlers registered so it will do stuff for both independently

5910149
mousemove	mouseup
what you want to do is remove the event handler for the mousemove on the mouseup event

5910182

5910535
put	get
in fact in your case the regexes differ only in the separator characters used so you could put them in a character class to get a common regex

the main reason is add has been implements as protected with no modifiers which becomes protected

5910552
udp	tcp
if the bus can be small you might like to work with http adapters or even lower like tcp or udp

next	except
where the basic question is how can i be sure that the next thread in the queue is alyways the thread who needs to be notified except in the trivial cases when there are only two threads in total or the code can safely assume that the only waiting thread is the thread who needs to be nofified pulsed

5911740

5911750
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
it basically wraps ie s safari s or the firefox opera native implementation which may not parse dtds in the browser you are using since external dtd parsing is sadly an optional aspect of xml even for entities and validation is even less certain

5911787
portrait	landscape
create different layouts for your views in landscape and portrait mode and put the landscape ones in res layout-land and the portrait ones in res layout-port technically you only need layout and layout- land port as layout is the fallback if no orientation qualifier is given

hid	keyboard
our scanners use usb hid if you select usb hid keyboard it installs as dual-interface unit where you have the hid pos as secondary interface

5912659

that means the scanner sends bar code data to the keyboard buffer and you can send commands via the usb hid pos interface to the scanners

5912673
post	get
an initial view is been created upon a get request and an existing view is been reused upon a post request

5912673
post	get
when a get request results in a response with a for post then the partial view is referenced by a hidden input field with name javax.faces.viewstate

5912674
stdout	stderr
as for the larger problem you can subclass popen rewrite __init__ to accept stream-like objects as arguments to stdin stdout stderr and rewrite the _communicate method hairy for crossplatform you need to do it twice see the subprocess.py source to call read on the stdin stream and write the output to the stdout and stderr streams

5912886
opera	google-chrome
this works for me in google-chrome 11 and opera 11.10

5913014
integer	unsigned
the program doesn t actually care if 0x00000101 as 5 decimal it just has an unsigned integer with value 0x00000101 that it can perform operations legal for unsigned integers upon and will behave in a given manner if you try to compare with or cast to a different type of variable

5913041
post	get
about post and get learn some http basics

5913068
post	get
as far as the difference in doget and dopost the only difference is the http method they respond to as the servlet api abstracts any differences between actual http get and http post methods away from the programmer

5913080
ready	each
you should split the high-level requirements into features to help estimate and prioritise them but leave the detailed scenario writing to just before you re ready to begin implementing each feature

5913115
zero	decimal-point
if the precision is explicitly zero no decimal-point character appears

5913148
namedtuple	dictionary
at its heart the namedtuple is an odd fit for json since it is really a custom-built type whose key names are fixed as part of the type definition unlike a dictionary where key names are stored inside the instance

5913148
namedtuple	dictionary
this prevents you from round-tripping a namedtuple you cannot decode a dictionary back into a namedtuple without some other a piece of information like an app-specific type marker in the dictionary which is a bit hacky

5913148
namedtuple	dictionary
this is not ideal but if you only need to encode namedtuple into dictionary another approach is to extend or modify your json encoder to special-case these types

5913148
namedtuple	dictionary
this tackles the problem of ensuring that nested namedtuple are properly converted to dictionary

5913153
rsa	aes
the encryption method i m implementing is enveloping data using aes and rsa

5913280
put	get
i now use this code to get the contents of the table after which i put the contents in a .csv

5913304
post	get
this can be get very complex due to the fact mvc requires all lists to be indexed and follow numerically otherwise on post backs you will be missing items aside i feel this was a terrible design decision

5913315
for-loop	if-statement
without an example it is hard to see what you want to do but you can always use an if-statement inside a for-loop

5913319

as you can see the frame is fine in viewwillappear but not in viewdidappear

5913511

5913768
cvs	svn
of commented commits percentage of the cvs svn commits that have a comment i know this is subjective as you can just enter update or anything else

5913794
stdout	stderr
ultimately i would like to capture stderr as below audio info is piped to sox via stdout and present it in as a gtk.expander with a similar look to synaptic when it is installing a program with the ability of the user to see things happening in real time

5913808
range	infinity
but if you consider a theoretical computer with infinite precision and period you brought up infinity then you will hit every number in your specified range given infinite time

5913844
ant	maven
maven is more of a meta-program that can use ant scripts and run your junit tests

5913844
ant	maven
true ant can also be used to run junit tests but maven does a good job of pulling all of that together as well as providing extra functionality example the ability to automatically find external dependencies and download them

5913844
ant	maven
while i am not familiar with teamcity i would be surprised if it did not have a way to integrate with ant maven junit

5913860
post	get
the drupal api has a drupal_http_request function which can make post requests as well as get requests

5913884
post	get
this is okay for some things but if you re trying to do background requests to gmaps that require no user input interaction feedback maybe getting long lat of their address when they submit a form then you can modify the code a bit to post when you get the response

5913920
folder	directory
actually i m pretty sure it s a better pratice to have your system and application directory out of the public_html folder

5913941
udp	tcp
but in theory it says that it uses both tcp and udp

5913944
google-chrome	safari
on a mac with safari or google-chrome you can save an html page with embedded svg to a pdf

the click 2 button refers to document.forms.fill and works in both firefox and google-chrome

5914228

here is the code that is doing it...it is really wierd cause when i debug it the number of children of each node grows by one each time as expected but then once all the parent nodes are added there is two of each leaf.

5914283
post	get
i have also seen this post but i can t get it to work

5914305
google-chrome	firefox

5914472
width	height
now i want my webview to set it s width as the screenwidth and resize it s height alone to fit the content

5914473
implements	extends	super	extends	super	implements
if you hard-code the subject-matter domain into your implementation by doing things like representing lands or artifacts by extends a super class or implements an interface there are always going to be things you run into that you can t do and fixing these problems may be hard or impossible

5914478
min	max
what i m trying to do is record the on screen x axis positions when you zoom in and out with the mouse as i want to work out the max and min values that are displayed

5914485
post	get
look into the documentation for your framework for a way to get the verbatim text from the post data

5914539
int	double
the floating-point unit fpu on modern x86 is natively double in fact it s even bigger than double not float the 32 in 32-bit describes the int register widths not the floating-point width

5914552
post	get
that being said you should use the input class to get your post data

5914554
pull	push
or she can pull bob s change and merge then push

5914574
hide	show
every solution i come across implements js and is to show hide the div and does not replace the show hide button

5914574
hide	show
the only difference between this and what i want to do is i want my button to be central also and show the trailer over the top of the button with no ability to hide the trailer after it has begun

5914587
post	get
namuol is correct your framework is trying to be very smart for you and applying its own escaping to everything passed through post and get

5914588
put	get
simply put these lines of code in your try block and you will get into the interactive python debugger mode

5914630
cpu	processors
unless you either target 20-year-old cpu s or small limited embedded processors floating-point instructions will be handled in hardware although not all architectures handle every datatype equally efficiently

i want to loop through images in an html document and set the width height if they don t exist

5914679

5914688
vim	notepad++
additional details when opening the file in notepad++ or vim it looks fine however when viewed in notepad it looks like chinese characters

edit in this particular app i have a table that shows up in portrait and a chart that shows up in landscape

5914730

5914755
client-side	server-side
so replace it on client-side then put it back on server-side

5914777
postgresql	mysql
the difference between postgresql and mysql is that postgresql sees it and complains as it should while mysql often just keeps on going with no stopping

5914778
client-side	server-side
you could use css3 media queries like described here but this will only let you add additional css rules client-side not adjust the image path server-side

5914779
tabs	tabpanel
with this markup i get what i need from both the first tab containing the list and any subsequent tabs templated by the hidden tabpanel ready for cloning .

5914790
post	get
functional tests are really just clients of a running application that make get and post requests and verify the responses so you won t have access to spring beans services etc

5914795
ninject	spring.net
like for example ninject spring.net unity or the members are already correctly initialized in the objects you are using

5914796
wicket	seam	jsf	wicket	jsf	seam
after that you might also want to look at more sophisticated frameworks like jsf or wicket and after that perhaps full-stack frameworks like spring or seam or other more focused server-side technologies such as enterprise javabeans

5914813
getter	setter
because jsf wants it private + getter and setter and the other java class wants it private static + get sets

5914837
width	margin
some of the body text is still spilling out to the right behind the sidebars so there may be a width padding margin problem there as well

5914849
min	max
if you do not have the min and max in different columns you can use the lead lag functions or a self-join to get both of them in the same row as in my test table

5914849
range	max
if you don t have a max value for the last range use nvl or the corresponding function to assign a really large value to define the range

5914862
qt-creator	kdevelop
i d suggest you to check out kdevelop and qt-creator

5914871
qnetworkreply	qnetworkaccessmanager	qnetworkrequest	qnetworkaccessmanager	qnetworkrequest	qnetworkreply
you will want to use qnetworkaccessmanager qnetworkrequest and qnetworkreply classes

5914884
google-chrome	firefox
works as expected in ie firefox google-chrome

5914902
put	get
sftpclient s get and put functions take paths and not file-handles which makes things a bit awkward

5914902
put	get
if it works the get and put functions should now take local file-handles rather than paths

5914916
keydown	keyup
i made a subclass of the nstextfield and i override the keydown event but my code doesn t work then i override de keyup event and the code works perfectly

5914952
subtract	add
you can use functions to add or subtract values like this

5914970
width	height
the above assumes your vm exposes a collection of points via a points property and that each point vm has x y width and height properties

5914979
int	chars
the unsigned chars of course takes up only 1 byte as apposed to the int 4 assuming 32 bit platform here but my understanding is that it would be faster for a processor to read the int value from memory

5914987
terminate	timeout
if you want the function s execution to be terminate after the timeout has been exceeded you might want to try code that has that capability

5915009
express	node.js
i am using node.js with express and have code similar to this as part of my routes

5915021
switching	screens
however c# provides the useful invoke method which allows you to automatically switching thread back to the gui thread to update something on the screens

5915077
cruisecontrol	jenkins	hudson	bamboo
by the way there s also bamboo cruisecontrol and hudson which was split from jenkins a few months ago

5915088
jobs	cron
when i run scrape.sh it executes as expected and puts the foosite.xml file in the .. feeds directory the directory exist and is empty when the cron jobs starts

5915097
put	get
you can use the gettext method of the jeditorpane to get the text that is currently in the pane then append the new text and call settext to put everything back

5915151
ubuntu	linux
when i use cxfreeze in ubuntu it automatically compiles the python script to a linux executable

5915207

5915213
width	height
instead of having to repeat height 4 width 4 dpi 72 with every call

5915221
inherited	subclassing
if you declare a function as virtual const or not it is inherited and can be overridden by subclassing

5915228
jobs	cron
cron jobs typically get a different shell environment than interactive shells so perhaps scrapy is missing in your path and you should use some full path to scrapy

5915271
soa	osb
osb is a lightweight and scalable integration platform that delivers low-cost standards-based integration for high-volume mission critical soa environments

5915280
post	get
get my_page you can have the server respond as an ajax call when it handles a post request but returns the full page with the main div contents pre-populated whenever get is used

5915299
hide	show
this solution also gives you the option to scroll data as well and to dynamically adjust columns or do show hide

5915304
onresume	onpause
ii recycle bitmaps in your onpause and decode them again in your onresume

5915350
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox

and a sigabrit here in the int main int argc chars argv line

5915395
width	height
have the .box divs fill width height the parent #container so the green borders should reach all the way out to the thick black border

5915403
getter	setter
yes you can however it is subject to the rule that your getter setter cannot have a less restricted access modifier than the property itself

5915412
aptana	radrails

5915476
put	get
get put etc

5915490
put	get	post	get	post	put
it means all http verbs get post head put and delete

5915490
put	get	post	get	post	put
the verb list can be either a comma-separated list of http verbs for example get put post or a start-script mapping for example the wildcard character an asterisk

5915495
width	height
in this cause you will need to set height and width on #container and make sure the .box es can never expand beyond it

5915495
width	height
note though that because width and height are set to 100 the borders will not work correctly

5915495
box-sizing	border-box
you will need to set explicit values or use box-sizing and set it to border-box this is not support in ie 8

5915511

folder	directory
i want to keep them in their own . dll folder but they re not being copied to the build directory properly

5915619
button	checkbox
this works fine...but what doesnt seem to work is if the page loads up and i check the grid view header checkbox to true and it selects all the items in the gridview then i click a button such as a delete button that calls some server side code

5915626
width	height
i think that i can write simple program that open the folder of images and read each file and get it s width and height and if it s very high change it and overwrite the image with the small one

5915656
mouse	keyboard
in terms of the actual api and programming like items to be used by the mouse and keyboard rather than the touch screen

5915677
solaris	aix
aix solaris linux have three divergent implementations of the proc file system

5915691
button	checkbox
delete one or more photos preferably with a checkbox to select some of them and then a delete button

5915707
button	checkbox
i doubt your gridview is rebinding on a delete button click because a click of the delete button loads the page first where it will rebind and your checkbox s become unchecked again

5915720
httphandler	httpmodule
this will bypass integrated mode validation which checks system.web httphandler and system.web httpmodule sections as well as impersonation source

multiplication	modulo
i want to calculate modulo of multiplication of two int numbers where they are almost in the stage of overflow.

5915820
width	height
the width of column 2 and height of column 1 will grow to fill as will the components in each cell

5915834
ant	maven
the command line and ant maven allow you to do some rudimentary selection too but then you can t specify a testng.xml

5915868
int	chars
asking how much memory unsigned chars takes versus int is only meaningful when it s in an array or possibly a structure if you re careful to order the elements to take care of alignment

5915872
uiview	catransition
i am trying to develop a simple catransition that shows an uiview appearing from the left

5915883
width	height
this may not be the best way but you can write a wrapper function with different height and width defaults

5915893
submit	submission
i m trying to stop a form from submission using the submit eventlistener

5915964
submit	submission
to prevent form submission i ve always used the onclick event to call a javascript method which will do something and then submit from there

but the bolgallery script parses this in php and is able to get the the title width and height values dynamically

5916090
gif	png
hmm in my demo it doesn t seem to work sorry an image i created fully red 20x20 pixels gives 0 colors for png and 3 colors for gif

5916104
versioning	upgrade
it looks like you need to upgrade rails because the error is stating a versioning conflict between the different gems rails uses

5916122
profiling	instrumentation
instrumentation means inserting code into a stream of instructions whose purpose is to measure something -- execution time function calls data access all sorts of things relating to profiling

5916149
int	double
nstimeinterval is actually a double and you are trying to print an int

as others have pointed out a repository write-look will prevent commiting during incoming push or pull operations

5916340
google-chrome	firefox
this was happening on google-chrome but not on firefox 3.5 so we didn t really care

5916340
google-chrome	firefox
but firefox 4 behaves just like google-chrome so we had to find another workaround

5916340
google-chrome	firefox
also i found a strange local workaround for google-chrome and firefox 4 using a greasemonkey script modified version of this one

5916443
button	checkbox
the only reason you d want to use checkbox is if you want to turn off all selections with radio button once you ve clicked a button one is always selected

5916456
button	checkbox
you can do this in interface builder too drag a uibutton onto a uitoolbar and it will automatically embed it in a uibarbuttonitem for you - then look for the shows touch on highlight checkbox under the button s settings

5916503
stdout	stderr
in production you ll want to add exception-handling and you can re-route stdout and stderr to be captured

5916530
portrait	landscape
i am trying to design my application so that it has one main.xml layout for portrait and one main.xml layout for landscape

5916530
portrait	landscape
from the reading i ve done it seems that the way to go about this is like so res layout-land main.xml for your landscape file and res layout main.xml for your portrait

5916530
portrait	landscape
that was annoying enough but it appears as though it thinks they are the same file because when it did let me make changes to one of them it would seem that the changes were often as not to the wrong one landscape when i was editing portrait and vice versa

5916581
uiview	calayer
trying to understand the relationship between uiview and calayer

5916585
versioning	upgrade
when we did platform upgrade os db versioning etc. we extracted the data from the meta and client-specific databases on one server and loaded it into the new server

5916605
hide	show
just hide away the view the jsp file in web-inf folder so that it cannot be directly accessed by the enduser anymore and reuse the very same servlet to show the login form via doget and continue processing the login form submit via dopost

5916616
int	double	int	chars
they are equality operators on int uint long ulong decimal float double any enum type bool chars object string and any delegate type

5916645
public	protected
replace protected with public and the code should compile

5916646
inherited	subclassing
b is protected inherited from a thus only subclassing of b knows it s an a

5916652
public	protected
derive b from public a not protected a

5916659
pylons	pyramid
i know that pylons is discontinued as such and is imported to pyramid

5916659
pylons	pyramid
however i really like to learn pylons and could not make my way through pyramid which is still rather premature and lacks begginer-friendly docs so i started to read the online pylons book which i think only covers pylons 0.97 and some of examples like the one about environ did need work for me in pylons 1.0 so i seem to have some bumpers in my learning curve that led me to wonder whether it really worth the effort

5916664
spaces	delimiter
the split method will split a string into an array based on a delimiter in this case a spaces

5916690
multiplying	multiplication
i was looking at this question how to implement multiplication without using multiplication operator in .net and actually had a lot of fun trying to think of ways to multiplying without using

5916711
post	get
i would post my code but i don t know exactly what parts to post so if there are any certain parts that will help just let me know and i will post them otherwise it seems like i have had this problem once before and solved it but it has been a while and i can t remember what exactly the problem was or how i fixed it so any help or pointers to get me going in the right direction will help greatly

5916729
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
the properties of inherited rules out the possibility of derivation of a protected parent class into a subclassing

5916729
public	protected
unless you change protected to public in line #10 so that the protocols are followed and the code looks like this

5916740
ceil	floor
then you have the option to use roundf floor ceil or other operations to shape the number

5916742

5916795
put	get
so i don t get into my backing bean i already tried to put the scope of my bean to viewscoped but no success

5916803
hide	show
for the converters if you still prefer to hide and show the buttons you should declare a new class that implements ivalueconverter

5916814
int	double	int	chars
as i mentioned in your other question the built-in operators are the equality operators on int uint long ulong bool chars float double decimal object string all delegate types and all enum types plus the lifted-to-nullable versions of all the value types

5916815
children	parent
after determining the location of our element we move our element up in case it has a greater priority than its parent in a similar manner to insertion or down if it has a lower priority than one of its children in a similar manner to deletion and update the modified elements locations in the hash map

5916848
folder	directory
but the directory structure contains a web-app folder as usual not webapp

5916908
hide	show
i think that if you want it to be really fast you could just show hide the options

5916936
hide	show
you can hide or disable ui elements that are meaningless without data while the data is being fetched then show them when the data arrives

5917024
chown	chmod
first you need to giving the program as root privileges use chown and chmod as root

5917142
getter	setter
other objects must go through setter and getter methods

5917182
width	height
width 8.28 160 pixels height 24.6 41 pixels font is arial 20 pt

5917182
width	height
range width 96 range height 24.6

5917182
width	height
i tried using pointstoscreenpixelsx and pointstoscreenpixelsy for all of the above values but they returned values which didn t match up with what the excel gui said 396 for row cell height 136 for column width and 224 for column width

5917276
hibernate	gilead
i have very similar problem - gilead 1.3.1 hibernate

5917277
postgresql	mysql
and it works on oracle mysql postgresql db2 etc

5917324
width	height
i am new to writing arrays and i was wondering if you look at the code below not really complicated how can i get rid of all the other stuff and just have the height and width be applied to cell_1 - cell_21

5917324
width	height
i just want to write all the repeating stuff in one line and use the height and width as vars

5917359
maven	pom.xml
maven pom.xml dependencies

5917359
sitemesh	jspx
didn t have to remove sitemesh at all but i can in the future whenever i m ready and i can migrate jspx files at my leisure

5917360
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
you could just be using bufferedinputstream bufferedoutputstream

5917366
width	height
this example determines the height and width in pixels of the selected cells in the active window and returns the values in the lwinwidth and lwinheight variables

5917419
post	get
one of the reasons i don t just want to do rest and use get post etc http verbs is that lower privilege users can only make change requests

5917420
width	height
and i d prefer to not have to declare a height for the containing element as this is for a lengthy image listing and the dimensions will vary but all with a certain max width height

5917433
portrait	landscape
portrait or landscape

5917433
portrait	landscape
for landscape images it works fine but with portrait ones it distorts them like crazy

5917445
getter	setter
to actually use the setter and getter that are synthesized according to your property rules retain etc. you must access them as follows

5917445
getter	setter
you are bypassing the synthesized setter and getter if you access the instance variables directly as follows

5917455
super	extends
you are much better off creating a class that extends textfield and write your own text function that calls the super then expands the height of the textfield to _textheight

5917477
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
this will also solve your problem with database versioning because .msi installation package keeps this information so you can create upgrade .msi which will know that it must execute only change script for database instead of creating a new one

5917477
versioning	upgrade
if you need to keep information about database versioning you can have special table for that and check the value in the table at the beginning of the upgrade script

5917479
width	height
setting maxwidth to 800 means height width 800 new height

5917479
width	height
on the other hand means setting maxheight to 800 and thus having width height 800 is new width

5917479
width	height
right now your using both the height width ratio instead of the other way around

5917483
width	height
basically it first calculates the image s proportions in rate based on width height

5917483
width	height
then it checks if the width is going to get out of bounds when resized and if it is - sets width to the desired maximum width and calculates the height accordingly

5917483
width	height
so if is larger than the width should be set to maxwidth and the height should be calculated based on it

5917483
width	height
if the comparison is the other way around just set height to maxheight and calculate the new width

5917492
width	height
you should switch height and width in the second part note the part

5917523
put	get
this information get s put in an array

5917523
min	max
in the next part of my program i am to retrieve min and max values from each data group even and odd store id numbers

5917566
versioning	upgrade
you will want the new versioning when subversion 1.7 is released so upgrade then too

5917566
versioning	upgrade
i read the occasional post here about people running svn 1.4 or older you don t want to be them - upgrade the subversion team is very good about backwards compatibility and painless upgrade but upgrading 3 or 4 versioning up isn t going to be as painless as upgrading 1 major versioning

5917623
for-loop	loops
pull your loops to outside of the function or return a tuple list outside of the for-loop

5917632
post	get
failing that require any non-idempotent calls to be post rather then get

5917643
svg	vml
it renders charts in html5 canvas svg and flash and vml for old ie fallback

5917658
hash	md5
reversing an md5 hash

5917659
stdout	fflush
you can avoid this by using this command sys.stdout.flush which will fflush the stdout stream which forces it to print

5917709
hash	md5
with n being the bitlength of the hash 128 for md5

5917734
hash	md5
a cryptographic hash like md5 is designed to be a one-way function that is it is computationally infeasable to derive the source data from which a given hash was computed

5917734
hash	md5
another weakness in md5 is that due to its relative small size large rainbow tables have been published that let you look up a given md5 hash to get a source input that will collide with the specified hash value

5917821
stdout	stderr
capture both stdout and stderr preferably as single stream without using which fails for some commands here

5917875
tablet	hdpi
my problem is when i m trying to support tablet i don t understand why android divide the resources in different folders hdpi ldpi mpdi large-mdpi ... when that qualifiers isn t useful

5917875
tablet	mdpi
i have several graphics sets according width but i m going crazy for example with the tablet 480x800 with density mdpi or ldpi

5917921
children	parent
protected methods can be called anywhere in the inheritance line of the object parent and children

5917966

beyond that do as mkfnx suggested and use a stack widget or just have a dynamic dialog where you subscribe to your button events using the connect function and hide show your widgets as you wish

5917994
post	put
i am trying to put two different custom post types into the wposts.post_type part which we can call type1 and type2

5918027
listview	gridview

if your bindings are more complex converter multibinding ... this may be a bit more complicated to implement

5918078
catransition	subviews
i am developing an application that uses catransition to improve the transition effects between different subviews on a view controller

5918078
catransition	subviews
however when i test this on my ipod touch 2g there is significant lag when changing subviews using catransition

5918137
ostringstream	std
you can use a standard stream like std ostringstream or define your own one

5918139
int	boolean
but both will just write the boolean directly behind the int value without starting a new line

5918143
post	get
replace y with either get or post

5918150
unix	solaris
i want to grep 2 patterns in a file on solaris unix

5918151
maven	pom.xml
if this is a maven based project you can add the jackson-mapper-asl artifact id to your pom.xml

5918156
ostringstream	std
it sounds like you are looking for std ostringstream

5918157
profiling	debugging
i solved this issue by in xcode going to targets edit scheme profiling yourappname and changing the build configuration from release to debugging

5918260
solaris	bsd
it will work with on systems with gnu grep but on bsd solaris etc. | is not supported

5918289
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
though i think this technique is ill-advised here s something i developed that i ve tested to work in google-chrome firefox safari and ie8

5918296
division	multiplication
learning the principals just like we did at school for long multiplication and division means we know how things work when we use a short hand

5918303
prepare	execute
a little background this is a database class i am building and the prepare method will help escape variables in the query before it is execute

5918315
jax-ws	jax-rs
you should write service classes with jax-rs jax-ws annotations transports exist for both

5918353
subtract	add
add or subtract a value

5918369
return-value-optimization	nrvo
if you mean nrvo named return-value-optimization as opposed to return-value-optimization return-value-optimization then the object has to be named inside the function

5918369
return-value-optimization	nrvo
otherwise it would only be eligible to return-value-optimization not nrvo

5918369
return-value-optimization	nrvo
some compilers like very old compilers won t do return-value-optimization or nrvo at all while other compilers may have different constraints on this optimization

5918397
google-chrome	firefox
using google-chrome or firebug extension for firefox you can inspect an element on your page by right clicking on it and chosing inspect element

gif	png
support of jpg png gif

5918487
sorting	grouping
i perform custom sorting grouping in the controller

5918497
ord	chr
however doing any kind of arithmetic would require you to use the ord function to get numeric values for individual bytes then chr to convert the result back followed by concatenation to reassemble the modified string

5918528
awt	swing
for a start in swing a jlabel is a swing component as apposed to the older awt library the recommended practice is to override the paintcomponent method not the paint method

5918557
google-chrome	firefox
this works with no problems in google-chrome and firefox 4

5918573
hash	md5
really though if all that script is doing is building an md5 hash and setting a cookie it should already be blisteringly fast especially if it s mod_php

5918588
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in google-chrome firefox opera and ie

5918612

instead of creating getter and setter for each property implement only one pair and provide the property name as a string

5918630
google-chrome	firefox
this is my website it works fine on google-chrome firefox and ie 9

5918660
width	height
this would create a 2d-matrix with width of 53 height of 71 each element is a 64 bit floating point single-channel value basically a double and all of the elements will be set to 0

5918688
subtraction	addition
everything seems to be coming along fine with writing methods of common math operators such as subtraction and addition

5918733
hex	binary
when i try to invoke xxd -ps -r on my hex output in powershell i don t get the desired binary xxd s output is empty

5918733
hex	binary
now i will write my own hex to binary converter in java which is ok for my project even better but i think i will eventually stumble upon this problem in the future so i want to be prepared

5918743
mouseleave	mouseenter
if you don t need the hover tracking effect just remove the mouseenter and mouseleave events

5918843

5918890
flex	robotlegs
robotlegs is a tiny framework for building actionscript 3 flash and or flex applications

5918996
content-disposition	content-type
fortunately i m behind a proxy i control so i just corrected the obnoxious headers content-disposition and content-type before they reached firefox

5919027
mutators	setter
you would just need to create a mutators override the method in this example verify that the method is a property setter with a datamember attribute on the containing property definition and change the visibility

5919175
profiling	instrumentation
i have a bit of a dilemma â no matter what i do i cannot get apple s instruments.app to symbolicate any of the included instrumentation while i m profiling on my devices it works ok in the ios simulator

ssl	https
off-topic you re probably already doing this but when transferring personal details you ve promised to keep confidential i don t know whether you have but hopefully so use https ssl

5919293
jboss	weblogic
i had worked on jboss for a year and on weblogic for more than a year now my experience with the web logic is good compared to jboss weblogic is more stable and robust it can handle more than 3000 concurrent requests without throwing a single exception where jboss failed to do so and admin console for the weblogic is excellent but i think weblogic is more complex then jboss

5919309
menhir	ocamlyacc
finally you should seriously consider menhir as a replacement for ocamlyacc

5919315

a new dialog pop-up showing all stored authentication data where you can chose which one s to clear

5919547
post	get
wee can t tell unless you post the code you are actually tyring to use to get the title but this clearly won t work

5919550
maven	pom.xml
i have tried in both my parent pom.xml and module pom.xml listing the plugins in the build section so that the scala compiler plugin is first and yet maven still insists on running the java compilation first which fails in some cases where i have mixed source

5919586
uiview	subviews
make sure both the image and the frame are subviews of a uiview

5919594
button	checkbox
if i select all checkbox click on save button then all checkbox are selected using ajax therfore page is not refreshed but when i does not check any checkbox click on save button i give a confirm box but when user press cancel button on confirm box the the page is refreshed and data will not change i want same but without this page is refreshed on cancel button

5919598
post	put
you can serialize the post variables and put it on one session variable

5919598
post	put
same thing you can json_encode the post variables and put in in one session variable

5919613
post	get
gets 2 links a post en ea returning get

5919686
google-chrome	firefox
it works good for firefox google-chrome but fails to load properly on ie6

5919724
folder	directory
the php files will also need to be organized according to your url directory like index.php staff.php in about folder

5919745
affinity	processors
you appear to be setting affinity to all 12 processors which is not what you intend

5919745
affinity	processors
if the user changes process affinity then you may end up with a thread that is not able to run on any processors

5919798
int	chars
probably the same reason why the functions in take int and not chars

5919798
int	chars
on most platforms a chars is too small to be pushed on the stack by itself so one usually pushes the type closest to the machine s word size int

5919802
int	chars
without a prototype you can t pass a chars to a function -- when if you try it ll be promoted to int when you pass it and what the function receives is an int

5919802
int	chars
it s also worth noting that in c a chars literal like a does not have type chars -- it has type int so what you pass will usually start out as an int anyway

5919802
int	chars
in theory memset could probably be modified so it receives a chars instead of an int but there s unlikely to be any benefit and a pretty decent possibility of breaking some old code or other

5919804
cpu	processors
each bit corresponds to a logical processors a cpu core or a hyper-thread

5919812
division	addition
the last of these points is particularly interesting in my view allowing things like a generic average method over numeric types with suitable addition and division operators

5919814
yslow	pagespeed
use tools such as yslow pagespeed or

5919867
temp	tmp
either create c tmp or c temp help directory says both are in the default value of the directory option on windows builds of vim or add an existing directory to the value of the directory option

5920012
unix	bsd
on unix that should include macosx linux bsd ... you can do something like this

5920019
post	get
you should use javascript validation for check validation of this form and if all fields having valid values then submmit form via post method.now you will get all your fields in

5920022
post	get

i m interested in finding a browser compatibility table that lists the parts of svg vml supported by each version of opera safari google-chrome firefox and internet explorer also konqueror would be nice in the vein of quirksmode

5920985
firefox	safari
the information in the first link seems to clash with libraries like raphael which claim to fully support animations in firefox 3.0+ and safari 3.0+ whilst the link suggests that the animation module isn t implemented till later versions for those two browsers

5920985
svg	vml
the second link simply doesn t go far back enough for me to be able to draw conclusions about which features of svg vml i can use to ensure compatibility with older browsers

svg	vml
as ie doesn t support svg i m interested in finding out which parts of vml the are supported in the different versions of ie

post	get
if your model is found to be invalid on the post then simply return the get method note you ll need to to pass in any parameters required to rebuild the view

5928044
post	get
if the model is valid then you could should perform a redirecttoaction to a get action this means if the user hits the refresh button it won t submit the form again this is called the post redirect get prg pattern

5928076
for-loop	loops
fix your loops to increment x inside the column for-loop

5928189
centos	linux
please tell me how to install easy_install via yum on linux centos server

5928196
width	height	portrait	landscape
if you scale with width and height but they would violate the proportions of the image and make it look stretched then based on the orientation of the image portrait or landscape one dimension will be used as the anchor and the other incorrect dimension will be recalculated for you transparently

5928206
interpolation	splines
approximate or interpolation a set of points using a curve or splines algorithm

5928249
firefox4	safari	google-chrome	safari

currently i m using x11 for the background xstart -solid grey which is great however as a test application i m running firefox which i see has no window decorations ie max min title or boarder neither for that matter does xterm

5928271
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
note that everything that qgraphicsscene draws is a qgraphicsitem if you call addpixmap it s converted to a ...graphicsitem behind the scenes so that s what you want to subclass

5928333
getter	setter
this is submitted to a struts2 action whch has getter setter for the field with operate on java.util.date

5928336
vbscript	jscript
the tool supports creating tests in the form of a keyword test or in the form of a script jscript vbscript delphiscript c#script c++script

5928338
post	get
i think i have got a script that will work for this but im struggling to get the value out into a variable and post it into a textview and eventually compare it to another integer

5928340
x86	64bit
now just because the cpu supports it doesn t mean the os supports it that s where you have either 64bit os or 32-bit os 32-bit is also known as x86 there s small technical differences in the x86 refers to the cpu instruction set but for most common usage x86 and 32-bit are interchangeable

5928349
int	chars
the deck has to consist of both int and chars

5928354
vim	emacs
i know a lot of people are having a lot of luck using emacs or vim along with ant scripts for building projects

5928368
int	chars
i m assuming that you need a container which is able to store either int or chars

5928368
int	chars
the contents of the chars and the int field in the union then occupy the same memory slots

5928368
int	chars
well the int uses more slots since chars are usually only one byte

5928368
int	chars
it is then up to you to set the type field of the struct to say c if you store a chars and to say i to store an int and then access the contents of the struct using the chars or the int field depending on the value of type

5928369
put	get
so basicly all i want to do is get all elements from my xaml page and put them into an array on the onload function

5928383
width	height
you could change the image width and height by javascript change its z-index so that it comes top of everything when user clicks the image

5928383
width	height
when user clicks the image second time change its width and height to normal

5928396
post	get
if i ve understood correctly you are sending data using http post and getting them in php using which refers to http get you should get data using in php or send data using http get in jquery

5928401
inherited	properties
the problem is that if you override a predefined properties of an interface it doesn t get changed in the interfaces that inherited from it at least in firefox

5928408
post	get
i looks like you are reading get from php and sending post

5928408
post	get
you can always just use _request which will give you both get and post as well

5928434
button	checkbox
now on server side i want to check if the checkbox is checked or not on submit button click event

5928444
vbscript	jscript
the example is in vbscript but it should be easy to implement the same approach with jscript

5928446
google-chrome	firefox
the main symptom is that the servlets do not see the session data when seeing jsps in google-chrome and firefox

5928446
google-chrome	firefox
however just for the same launch mode if i am trying to access the jsp servlets from external google-chrome firefox browsers - then the jsp servlets are found but the data seems not to be shared via http session printed the session id and verified that it is correct

5928467
children	parent
that is to say a parent class has no knowledge of the functions and properties that its children may choose to declare so as a result the following code will not work

5928469
post	get
in theory you could stream the assembler in a request to file call something external to assemble run it get results somehow and post it back

5928469
16-bit	64bit
in windows 64bit you d also need to run both assembler and result in a dosbox that emulates 16-bit assembler since 16-bit programs don t work in long mode

5928494
width	height
can i override the constructor of the cell so that i can pass in the width and height of the cell that i want

5928510
children	parent
and it is unclear and messy if we are setting parent level view from its children

5928514
jlabel	jscrollbar	jlist	jlabel	jlist	jscrollbar
i have a jframe with some jtextfields jlabel jlist jbuttons now the contents of my frame is more than the screen area so i want to attach a jscrollbar to my jframe but my srollbar does not work

5928562
pop-up	dialog
that s one set for the main window and more for each pop-up dialog box -- and that s too many

5928562
pop-up	dialog
how would i wire up a global utility class of such methods such that i can get to it from the main form s code and from that of a bunch of pop-up modal dialog boxes as well

5928583
filtering	grouping
how do i filtering sort or grouping by

5928583
filtering	grouping
to filtering and grouping you can replace

5928583
filtering	grouping
that dictionary then filtering and grouping

5928583
filtering	grouping
respectively and then filtering or grouping

5928590
bash	subshell
but here the parent of ps is the subshell bash

5928607
scrollable	panels
if you want to add working scrollbar to your panels you should look at the jscrollpane class and the scrollable interface which must be implemented by scrollable components

5928614
pascal	delphi
delphi free pascal

5928617
hide	show
the toolbar has a toggle button which when clicked completely hide region1 and show region 2 and visa-versa

5928624
superclass	subclassing
you only need the keyword when you ve overridden superclass members with subclassing members of the same name and you need to differentiate

5928624
public	protected
if there aren t any naming conflicts you can access public and protected members of the superclass without the super or class name qualifier

5928632
outputstream	inputstream
for instance this so post details how to write an entire inputstream to an outputstream such as system.out using an apache library

5928646
explode	substr
mysql doesn t provide explode equivalent however in this case you could use substr and locate to cut off score of a host and a guest

5928648
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
xmlhttprequest the jqxhr object used to send the ajax request

5928683
mouseleave	mouseenter	hide	show
the toggle method alternates visibility with no parameters and the hover method acts as mouseenter and mouseleave with a single delegate passed in so i think the suggestions to switch to separate functions for hide and show are unnecessary

5928738
polygons	mercator
polygons that wander outside -180 180 -90 90 actually it s more like -180 180 -85 85 because google uses mercator

5928741
execl	fork
i assume that between the call to pipe and the execl there was a fork that was omitted

5928749
sudoers	visudo
use the visudo command to change your etc sudoers

5928749
sudo	passwd
i have added the line which allows the apache user to run sbin myscript.sh with the sudo command without entering the passwd

5928749
put	get
after that you can just put the following in your php file to get the output

5928765
mouseup	mousedown
in the nsimageview subclass i would seriously contemplate whether overriding mousedown is the proper thing to do or whether you should wait until you receive mouseup to send your action

5928774
hide	show
here is my previous question simple javascript game hide show random square

5928774
hide	show
some square show and hide randomely for a few seconds and you have to click on them

5928774
hide	show
i can t make the hide show with the setinterval working for each square

5928782
google-chrome	safari
for example webkit browser like google-chrome and safari or mozilla browser

5928818
hide	show
no plan to use accordion but simple hide show to save screen space

5928822
bash	subshell
from your diagnostics it s impossible to tell the difference between a bash optimization where a subshell consisting of a simple command is optimized to a direct fork and exec of the called command or a fork of a subshell followed by an exec of the command called

5928825
printf	strcpy	printf	strlen	strlen	strcpy
that what c library assumes for string functions like strlen and strcpy and for s format specifier for all printf s

5928831
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicspixmapitem
at the moment i am using a qgraphicsscene and drawing using qgraphicspixmapitem but after few times when one pixmap overlaps another there is no need to keep the bottom one

5928844
openfire	ejabberd
the difference is that openfire and ejabberd have been around and tested for some time versus some solution you d build on your own

5928908
uitapgesturerecognizer	uibutton
you could add a uitapgesturerecognizer or you could use uibutton and design them to look like labels

5928931
n-gram	words
n-gram are frequency counts of words or combinations of words

5928931
n-gram	words
bigrams are usually constructed by combining two consecutive words and using them as the key so forth for trigrams and n-gram

5928932
bash	subshell
in the fragment ps -o pid ppid cmd it s obvious that nothing can influence the parent shell so there s an optimization in bash that makes it not fork a separate process for the subshell

5928934
getter	setter
each class should have appropriate private fields getter and setter

5928955
addition	multiplication	subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
implement basic arithmetic using the algorithms you learnt in primary school addition with carry subtraction with borrow long multiplication and long division

5928955
sin	sqrt
other algorithms are available if this isn t fast enough and for functions like sqrt and sin that can t be represented exactly with basic operations

5928984
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
then later i am going to add array1 to array two multiplying that by array3 and subtract that by array4 and divide that by array 5

5929011
implements	extends
first and foremost avoid extends the thread class and opt out for implements a runnable

5929037
uilabel	uitextview
if you use a uitextview instead of a uilabel it will automatically handle link detection

5929068
hash	salt
my basic idea is to hash and salt both the usernames and the passwords and also to add 1000 s of trap entries into the database for example random user names ending with _xxxx with random passwords ending with _yyyy which won t be valid for real users

5929094
pascal	delphi
all examples are in turbo pascal so it should be easy for a delphi coder to read

5929123
hide	fadeout
if the user says delete ok grab the cell by id and fadeout or remove it or hide it

5929133
implements	extends
but i cant use this code in mmxl components how i can use public class dialogtitle extends hbox implements ibindingclient in mmxl component code what are the way to use it sorry i am newbie if it is silly question

5929150
submit	submission
i ve got a submission table with an auto-incremented id property submissionid to identify each unique submission which may have multiple products for example a new customer may submit an add product form with epl crime fidelity and fiduciary but not redundant products can t have epl and another epl

5929153
post	get
the contents of the php file would be altered based on some post or get variables sent w the ajax call

5929199
actualheight	actualwidth
all other suggestions i have found are variations of these either involving actualwidth or its actualheight cousin or stuff involving relativesource and findancestor

5929216
prepare	execute
this ensures that the spring context will be prepare before your beforeclass methods are execute

5929218
post	get
iâ m going to post my code on codeplex to see if i can get some development help in wrapping up this project

5929220
sudo	passwd
i am using sudo appname but i want user to enter root passwd when application prompts

5929248
many-to-many	one-to-many
i d prefer category and place tables with a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship between them

5929251
hash	salt
and if the code can be hacked to see the salt static then the hacker will be able to see the database also with the hash and random salt d

5929271
xslt	xquery
in xpath 2.0 xslt 2.0 and xquery use exactly the same solution

5929271
xslt	xquery
when the above xpath 2.0 xquery expression or xslt transformation are evaluated applied on the provided xml document

5929280
hash	salt
if all accounts in the system use the same salt an attacker can brute-force calculate hash for that salt and break into all accounts with just one computational run

5929284
hash	salt
if you are not using a random salt then you don t make it more difficult for the attacker to attack your hash if they get their hand on the salt

5929300
hash	salt
secondly you might want to think about who you re protecting against and how - it s widely accepted that a good hash salt combination protects against most credible attacks

5929307
innodb	myisam
as kb_parent will be used for searching only i ll impement myisam fulltext and for the other table innodb

5929317
postgresql	mysql
well i don t know why mysql barfs so much on queries 1 and 3 which are pretty simple and easy in fact it should even beat postgresql using an index only scan but apparently not eh

5929323
vrml	x3d
this can create vrml x3d and x3dom xhtml files

5929345
client-side	server-side
i ve been developing some script controls in server-side with their client-side counterpart

5929352
hash	salt
if you use the same salt then in the case if website gets compromised the hacker can use same hash table for hacking all the passwords in your userlist

5929364
next	except
i noticed on windows xp that the group box has 1-pixel gray lines but on windows 7 there is a 3d effect created by having a gray line next to a white line the white line on the interior except on the bottom where it s below the gray line

5929382
dbcontext	objectcontext
once you execute both queries entity framework should ensure that navigation properties are correctly filled with related entities but this works only when lazy loading is turned off but entities are tracked by context well i never tried this with dbcontext api but it worked with objectcontext api

5929389
sorting	filtering
however i was running into an issue with sorting so i looked into using and added jquery s filtering method before the sort which makes sense

5929427
width	height
you might need to tweek it a bit so that you get the width height of the view

5929427
width	height
i m inflating layouts and specify the width height when i layout the code

5929436
postgresql	mysql
can be installed as multi-headed fully redundant system using zeo and relstorage zodb encapsulation in a rdbms datastore backend like mysql postgresql or oracle

5929456
google-chrome	safari
this does however work in safari but not google-chrome on a mac which appears to not care about signed unsigned sandbox mixing or something

5929476
filtering	grouping
having is for post aggregate eg after grouping by filtering

5929491
folder	directory
in this directory there are folder according to the phones language

5929510
post	get
i m coding a forum system and i m trying to get the last post in a topic

5929526
shadowing	named
secondly you re shadowing your ivars in your init method by declaring local variables with the same named as your ivars

5929592
subtract	add
but now we subtract too much and need to add back the multiples of 3 5 7 again

5929604
put	get
you could put it in main.cpp to get started but it would be more usual to put it in a separate gui.cpp .

5929620
children	parent
i have a hierirachy of my own object classes - a bit like the components on a form really in that any of them can have children and a parent

5929624
accessor	properties
all the code is doing is creating a separate name for the instance variable and the properties accessor

5929624
shadowing	named
also as jer pointed out you have an issue in your code sample with shadowing of your declared instance variables - in your init method you are creating new variables with the same named as your instance variables

5929689
subclass	abstract-class
the idea being that i could instantiate a presenter for a particular view with both classes relying on useful methods defined in the abstract base classes yet both knowing exactly what subclass of the counterpart abstract-class is in use

5929699
post	get
now to retrieve it and save it in your db you have to get it from the post variable

5929726
listview	gridview
in wpf if you use a listview control with the view set to a gridview the default foreground color of the items are dark blue

5929727
maven	m2e
maven scm handler for subclipse 0.12.0 from m2e extra s site sorry i would give the url but my new account doesn t have enough rep

5929752
implements	extends
update my thread is a worker thread it implements runnable and the data needs to ne send to a different class that extends activity

5929760
inherited	subclassing
one of the coolest features i ve seen in help viewers is the ability to hide inherited members so you can focus on only what that particular subclassing offers

5929770
submit	submission
manually submit the form elements that have changed in either a manual jquery call either through submission the data via jquery via json or explicitly passing in the form values

5929835
uilabel	nsstring
i know you can draw just the nsstring into a context easily but i want to retain the text size color and word wrap style of the uilabel

5929857
uiview	subviews
if by z-index you are referring to the order of subviews in a uiview each subviews has its own unique z index so you d have to create a new view for each image

5929865
folder	directory
if i m not wrong to create or delete a file from a directory you either need write permissions on that folder or write permission on that file in case you re modifying it

5929906
getter	setter
i created custom class witch have two fields string _name string _type and have getter and setter for these fields

5929981

i m looking at the cost of using mysql commercially and have decided for the time being that i may be able to use postgresql instead

5930071
postgresql	mysql
also has anyone here used both postgresql and mysql and decided to go with one over the other and if so why did you make the decision you did

5930100
pdcurses	ncurses
hey so i m trying to get addstr in the pdcurses library to work windows ncurses with the preferred string class so i made the function the following string_to_80char function which is supposed to take a string and return an 80 character long char array the number of characters fit on one line in the console since this is the only parameter addstr seems to accept.

5930117
width	height
i have a php script where i want to display some images inside a div but there are some restrictions regarding the max width and height

5930117
width	height
for example an image may have width 1000px and height 600px but the max width and height of the image should not be over 500 px in order to fit in the div

5930117
width	height
so i want to convert the dimensions so that the image fits in the div but the ratio between width and height remains the same

5930157
innodb	myisam
myisam supports full text search whilst innodb does not thus you use myisam for the table where you will use full-text search

5930166
unsigned	short
i ve read up on bitwise operations but i m still confused on how to deal with signed and unsigned and values that are larger or smaller that a short s range they are passed in as two ints

5930240

usr local rvm rubies ruby-1.9.2-p180 lib ruby site_ruby 1.9.1 rubygems config_file.rb 28 in

5930311
textview	imageview
making them very much alike compared to using textview imageview etc

5930337
range	max
range k max does not include max so you re really checking up to and including 998 while 999 is a multiple of 3

5930351
plone	buildout
for example the plone team has a good article running buildout on windows referencing their own script bin instance.exe

5930376
postgresql	mysql
this behavior is observed on ubuntu 11.04 any 3.0.x rails version 3.1.0.beta1 devise 1.3.1 and 1.3.4 mysql postgresql sqlite drivers

5930393

width	height
destination_postcode 0800 country au weight 600 service_type standard length 300 width 300 height 200 quantity 1

5930407
daemons	systemd
in practice this isn t a huge concern as best practices dictate using a deployment systemd like capistrano where a rule can easily be added to bounce the daemons on deploy

5930409
mouseleave	mouseenter
you just need to add the mouseenter mouseleave set the visual state of the control accordingly

5930467
fadein	fadeout
i would like to fadeout a button then fadein the response an ajax call

5930478
min	max
i bind progressbar to a class by means of several properties min max value all oneway bindings obviously

5930478
min	max
min 0 max 100 still has the lack of the glow

5930478
min	max
min 0 max 10 had the glow come back in its full vigor

5930523
put	get
the sql membership provider utilizes an auto generated stored procedure to put data into the membership user instance returned so just adding the attributes in the table will not be sufficient to get the attribute values to your application

5930540
internationalization	translation
internationalization of the interface is easy but the 1500+ exercices will not all be translation before a long time

5930555
google-chrome	safari
i ve taken it out of the page above but the problem version can be seen here - it works fine in google-chrome but breaks horribly in safari

5930564
google-chrome	safari
it could be an issue of latency firebug or safari google-chrome inspector tools will show this some issue in the javascript that is slowing down the event loop this is unlikely but possible you can step through the code in a js debugger or it could be due to the performance of the web server

5930564
thin	webrick
if you re running webrick then all bets are off in terms of performance but it is easy to solve by installing mongrel or thin

5930571
postgresql	mysql
plus postgresql tends to find much better query plans than mysql

5930654
wordpress	joomla
my website does not run on wordpress joomla or any other cms it was custom built

5930696
rtl	vhdl
i am working with mentor fpga doing rtl design with moduleware and vhdl

5930734
post	get
and also we can do the same with just 2 actions because we can use an if inside create_item for checking if the request is get or post so we are combining display_item with store_item

5930751
fputs	gets
fputs is not a dangerous function unlike gets which is dangerous

5930754
int	chars
chars is an int type

5930756
yacc	bison
for the 3. you should study bison or yacc lex and or any other grammar-parsers compiler-compilers

5930761
int	chars
this chars gets automatically promoted to an int in the expression this always happens with chars s in expressions in c and then this int is attempted to change to a

5930762
requestfactory	gwt
answered something similar here - smartgwt datasource with gwt requestfactory etc

5930807
powerpc	i386
-dmacosx -arch i386 -arch powerpc .

5930827
post	get
the pattern is to get a blank form modify the contents of the form then post that to the server which then sends a redirect to another page which is a get perhaps to a page saying form submitted successfully

5930827
post	get
with that redirect however they re on that results page via a safe get which will not result in a double post

5930829
stateless	stateful
that http is stateless and what is assumed while writing the code you re programming as if the application was stateful

5930886
folder	directory	ffmpeg	handbrake
i have a folder called media in the root of my c what i want to do is that when i copy some form of video media ex .mov file to that folder that it would detect the copy once completed fire handbrake or ffmpeg via the command line and encode pushing to another directory under media such as encoded totally automated so that i don t even need to think about encoding video

5930897
ubuntu	centos
this following code always throwing same error it seems to be working in ubuntu but not in fedora centos

5930923
postgresql	mysql
pdo is highly recommended though as you could later change from using mysql to postgresql if needed without changing all of your db queries

5930930
button	right-align
the button is right-align and the text items are left-aligned one after the other as shown

5930930
button	right-align
the closest i ve got which succesfully truncates the main text results in the n always being right-align next to the button even when the main text is short enough to fit

integer	unsigned
to get a guaranteed at least 64-bit integer you need unsigned long long

5931003
thin	unicorn	passenger	unicorn	passenger	thin
i m sure most experienced ruby devs use something else like thin mongrel unicorn pow passenger etc.

5931018
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome and ie9 all works well but in ie compatibility mode the element only rotates once first mouseenter then never again until page refresh

5931018
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter and mouseleave works just fine without the rotate

5931058
salt	md5
if yes use rand and store it....or if you want letters too use something like md5 time + salt

5931112
hash	md5
this assumes you re using an md5 hash password which is 32 in length

5931185
rmdir	mkdir
back in the days of 7th edition or version 7 unix there were no system calls mkdir 2 and rmdir 2

5931185
rmdir	mkdir
sections 2 and 3 are devoid of mkdir 2 and rmdir 2

5931185
rmdir	mkdir
nowadays the mkdir 2 and rmdir 2 system calls are standard and permit any user to create and remove directories preserving the correct semantics

5931185
unix	bsd
this is doubly true since symbolic links were introduced - they were not in 7th edition unix but were in the bsd versions of unix from quite early on

5931210
accessor	properties
while the usual mantra is don t use public fields use accessor or properties i noticed that properties are not yet supported widely across all browsers ie

5931212
rss	feed

5931233
implements	extends
if you want a different behaviour you could implements and extends arrayobject however

5931266
serializable	deserialization
the serializable method works correctly but the deserialization doesnt seem to be working

5931272
put	get	post	get	post	put
put simply they are attacks which trick administrators into visiting a certain url by get or post request

5931336
prop	each	getter	setter
there is no private keyword in javascript so wrapping each publicly-accessible prop in a getter setter method pair would be overkill

5931343
ienumerable	ilist
another problem with this design is exposing a collection through the most derived type - list as opposed to ienumerable or ilist

5931353
for-loop	arrays
later on i add data from xmllist to arrays which then i m looping in for-loop

5931462
post	get
as far as getting started with the basics there is plenty of other post around that will get to this point but for the combobox design the above should help

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am using the jquery ui.layout plugin and on osx in google-chrome firefox and safari all is hunky dory

5931487
google-chrome	firefox
however on windows 7 on firefox google-chrome and ie8 i am getting the following

5931489
getter	setter
you need to provide normal getter and setter methods

5931489
getter	setter
el won t access properties by fields it will access them by getter only and mutate them by setter only

5931498
pull	push
since web by design doesn t support push but instead pull for data ajax is the way that makes the most sense

5931501
x509	pkcs#1
there s sample code there for producing a pkcs#1 rsa public key from an openssh public key which is slightly different from jakub s solution which produces an x509 public key

5931569
typedef	struct
the use of struct there is just for backwards compatibility with c in which declaring would declare a type named struct foo and foo would only be a valid type name if you then used typedef struct foo foo

5931570
int	chars
so for example the chars 9 will be turned into the int 9

5931590
post	get
not a complete answer but you can merge this blog post with os.system to run handbrake and get a working system

5931606
google-chrome	firefox
i m testing it in firefox 4 and google-chrome

5931623
int	chars
an unsigned chars is just an 8-bit int type that can take values between 0 and 255 and a signed chars can take values between -127 and 128

5931623
int	chars
in the actual machine code there is no real difference except one when you do a right shift on a signed type using be it chars short or int it is carried out as an arithmetical shift meaning for negative values which have a 1 as msb a 1 is shifted in instead of a 0 and the above code will not work as expected

5931644
g++	gcc
you don t need either or to get the original code to compile or at least i don t on macos x 10.6.7 with gcc g++ 4.6.0

5931654
flask	django	flask	web.py	django	web.py
i d advocate python and one of the many web frameworks flask django web.py etc. as the syntax is very readable and is quite simple to modify

5931704
hbase	voltdb
i was thinking this may be the perfect application for a non-relation nosql database such as apache cassandra or hadoop hbase column family mongodb document voltdb community edn or mysql

5931748
client-side	server-side
alternatively consider caching your pages beginning with client-side http caching and considering server-side caching later

5931807
post	get
since the uid is different for each post i m trying to get the php code to parse and remove this via mysql

5931808
postgresql	mysql
depends because there is one big limitation from the rdbms which affects all databases including mysql postgresql etc.

5931811
ddms	adb
once the activity is running you can monitor the activity s log output from logcat using ddms or adb

5931819
int	chars
signed chars chars and unsigned chars are all int types

5931849

arduino	avr-gcc
while i don t know about the atxmega the 8-bit avr chips like the atmega328 used on the newer arduino use the avr-gcc compiler

5931887
arduino	avr-gcc
the arduino ide uses avr-gcc and avr libc library in the backend

5931887
arduino	avr-gcc
i wrote a blog post to try and give more in-depth details on the avr arduino and avr-gcc

put	get	post	get	post	put
to get around this i ve made a simple class for reading get post put delete request arguments

5932067
put	get	post	get	post	put
this class will parse the put delete params and support get post as well

5932120
rss	feed
right now i have a google site and the rss feed subscription works through feedburner

5932201
width	height
i want to create an inline-block that will take on some unknown width and height

5932203
firefox	safari
this code works perfectly for me tested in firefox and safari but should work for all

5932323
post	get
i used post not get but still data seems to get transmitted by the url

5932347
inject	interceptor
inject also has additional cdi-specific capabilities scopes interceptor etc. but those capabilities incur extra overhead

5932373
exponent	addition
a float at its highest limits binary exponent of 127 does not have sufficient precision 23 bits to show a difference of the largest possible char 127 7 bits and so overflow is not possible since addition will have no effect a precision of 127-7 120 would be required

5932379
width	height
ids #foo #zoo #soo #moo each id has different height width

5932379
width	height
if drag drop elements parent are swappable and different suppose drag_id.parentid #foo drop_id.parentid #zoo then swap it s height width to each other

5932381
width	height
also it looks as if it does something with the width height as well

5932394
htmlgenericcontrol	onclientclick
i don t think you can bind an onclientclick event to htmlgenericcontrol

pthreads	fork
the linux thread is also know as lightweight processes which is not generated by an fork call but rather the pthreads call

5932472
metaphone	soundex
as well as soundex which was developed as far back as 1918 there are also metaphone and double metaphone which were developed in the 1990s and 2000s respectively specifically to be be improvements over soundex

5932515
metaphone	soundex
metaphone fundamentally improves on the soundex algorithm by using information about variations and inconsistencies in english spelling and pronunciation to produce a more accurate encoding which does a better job of matching words and names which sound similar

5932517
plone	buildout
buildout and restarted plone but i didn t find the theme on the addon page

i am a jsf developer and recently heard about the seam framework but i don t know about it and what its benefits are

5932622
onresume	onpause
please write progress dialog code in onpause instead of onresume

5932651
sorting	filtering
you can use entitydatasource only if you are using entity framework for data access - it uses capabilities of underlying framework to support features such sorting filtering etc

5932659
jsf	seam
seam is a jboss framework that links jsf to their hibernate orm persistence technology

5932683
portrait	landscape
i then found the great ipad css layout with landscape portrait modes demo

5932689
integer	unsigned
i d like to take a value with an unsigned integer representation and somehow using floating point operations perform a rotate right shift bitwise operation

5932726
jsf	seam
seam tries to bridge some of the gaps between jsf and ejb

5932726
jsf	seam
so if you already know and like jsf and know and like either hibernate and or jpa then i d say you re off on a good fit to like what seam has to offer

5932773
int	chars

5932880
mouseleave	mouseenter
i tried mashappslabs s solution mouseenter mouseleave and i tried t.j

5932883
udp	tcp
what examples do you know - of protocols initially handshake in udp then conversing in tcp

5932925
public	protected
initializing public protected members of base class inside a derived class constructor is not allowed by current standard

5932936
mouseleave	mouseenter
you may know that hover is basically just a combination of mouseenter and mouseleave which are ie-specific events but jquery emulates them on browsers that don t provide them

5932936
mouseleave	mouseenter
but mouseenter and mouseleave don t bubble

5932936
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave
the related and not ie-specific mouseover and mouseout events bubble though so this looks like it might be is a bug in the mouseenter mouseleave emulation that s specific to delegated handling

5933011
floating-point	integer
hope that the hardware has some floating-point operations that operate on those bits the same way as the integer operations that sha256 uses

5933011
int	double
stuff your int into a floating-point variable with more bits put an int32 into a double which can hold 53 bits without losing precision and then implement the rotate-right operation using mathematical operations

5933011
multiplication	modulo
shl drops any bits that fall off the upper end which we can emulate by doing the multiplication modulo 2 b

5933011
floating-point	integer
it seems unlikely but not impossible -- adding two floating-point numbers with different exponents would require fast shift operations inside the fp hardware even if the integer hardware doesn t have fast shifts

5933016

read this so question to see the difference between fork execvp and system

5933179
short	base
in short while the objects are constructed the deriveda ones are registering themselves in a static vector in base which means they are accessible in derivedb once you are calling process on derivedb types

5933195
setcontentview	findviewbyid
txtothermatches is probably null because it doesn t exist in the current view.when you use findviewbyid the view must be in the contentview you ve set with setcontentview or added later tot the view

5933515
jruby	mri
mri 1.9.2 and jruby 1.6.1

5933543

you just have to set the height of the parent div and the width of the children div

5933640
google-chrome	firefox
while firefox and google-chrome works without these ie doesn t

5933669
multiplying	add
results are in pages of 4096 bytes so multiplying results by 4096 and you get values consistent with activity monitor you have to add speculative to free to get exact agreement

5933669
multiplying	add
to see the total memory you can add up free + active +inactive + speculative + wired from vm_stat and multiplying by 4096

5933672

5933842
mouseleave	mouseenter
use mouseenter and mouseleave check working example at and here is the code

5933885
google-chrome	firefox
the reason ie works but firefox and google-chrome don t is simple ie doesn t apply the sop when the origin is a local file and the resource you re trying to retrieve is on the web

5933885
post	get
the code you found that works isn t doing a real ajax call it s doing json-p which doesn t use xmlhttprequest at all and so bypasses the sop but only for get operations not post and only if the other end supports it

5933925
dlsym	dlopen
dlopen is for opening libraries as plugins at runtime and than they can only be accessed by fetching pointers to symbols using dlsym but if you want to access the library normally you have to link against it so the linker can resolve the symbols

5933925
dlsym	dlopen
if instead you wanted to use dlopen you must not include my_code.h in test.cpp and must not use anything it defines except by getting the symbols with dlsym

5933933
min	max
you cannot actually see the value of the scroll bar just by looking at it so in other words there is no actual difference between having min at the top max at the bottom and then just inverting the value when you access it

5933971

pocos are objects tha don t have to follow any particular conventions implements any interface extends any class having special attributes or naming convention etc.

5934188
uilabel	uifont
neither uilabel nor the uifont you set it to have character spacing options

5934191
hide	show
in this example we need to hide button when user is logged and show it when user is not so i made this converter

5934198
getter	setter
i m having a bean class employee having attributes id name along with public getter and setter

5934226
post	get
since ajax has asynchronus nature with each button click you would raise async event that would get post some data from to server

5934232
width	margin
your css for header specifies 100 of the parent s width but gives it a left margin of 165px

5934287
gridview	sqldatasource
the webpage the sql is on used on an sqldatasource gridview in asp.net is very slow and i ve pinpointed the slowness to this query - seemingly because of the sub select

5934323
portrait	landscape
if you don t have different layouts for landscape and portrait orientation you can easy use configchanges

5934357

the width of the floated element is constant but the height can change

5934739
prepare	execute
for your query to work you will need to write it as a prepare statement and then execute that

5934766
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome safari firefox and ie7 when the div get resized the table also is resized

5934768
width	height
the solution involves floating a empty spacer div right this spacer is first in source it should have the width and height of the content to be in the right side - in the link a solution including a bit of jquery to get the height - the position the actual menu over the top of the floated spacer

5934774
post	get
ok after a number of dead-ends i finally managed to get the functionality that i want by implementing the following in my message handler in order to post a message into the fragment s message handler and using show ... to show all the dialogs

or you can ultimately downgrade wamp apache installation from 2.2 to 2.0

5934821
client-side	server-side
basically server-side produces the rendered html for client-side your browser

5934836
jar	war
2 easier one package a jar instead of war and run it it will use embedded web-server so you won t have to install tomcat and deploy anything

5934840
dlsym	dlopen
note however dlsym is used very seldom and you may check if it s used via ldd and it s even more seldom to use it without a prior call to dlopen so in nearly all cases you may safely remove unused libraries

5934922
ubuntu	linux
i m running eclipse helios service release 1 with tomcat 7.0.12 in linux ubuntu natty narwhal

5934973
voip	sip
the problem is blackberry has no native sip or voip api so development requires the use of external api s for development

5934991
width	height
i would suggest you try first with only a single dimension scale only height so it fits one under another do not worry about width scaling for the first time

5935024
int	boolean
if i change how i group my boolean fields or remove one i have to regenerate all the int and overwrite the data for each item

5935304
getter	setter
protected and private fields can be accessed only through the getter and setter

5935313
integer	unsigned
if i understand your question correctly you should store them in an unsigned integer where you assign each value to a bit of the integer flag

5935346
junit	unitils
for the time being i have figured out to run unitils by creating a junit test with dataset annotation

5935366
titlebar	window
but this means that the window s content fits the screen perfectly without being cropped and my image is indeed fully displayed and is perfectly aligned on the left side of the screen and on top right beneath the titlebar without further ado

5935366
puts	gets
if i add your hack the image gets the given margin and this puts it 8px right from the left side of the screen and 8xpx down from the titlebar

5935371
int	boolean	int	chars
public void escape chars ch int start int length boolean isattval writer out throws ioexception

5935386
getter	setter
i think it may be again a problem of getter setter method naming

5935388
equals	tostring
it is always a good practice to override tostring hashcode equals and finally write a overloaded constructor that has all the fields that this class has as input

5935402
getter	setter
a javabean is defined by its properties its getter and setter methods not it s fields

5935402
getter	setter
getter and setter are what define a javabeans property

5935557
hide	show
i need to use the javascript functions to show and hide an element on my page but calling it from within a c# method

5935557
hide	show
edit got around this by using a hidden field boolean to determine whether or not to hide or show the elements

5935629
jboss	weblogic
the product in which i have to implement this user count is trying to be application server independent currently we support tomcat weblogic and jboss

5935635

started a new project from scratch converted to jpa my persistence provider is eclipselink added the necessary libraries eclipselink.jar eclipselink.jar javax.persistence mysql-connector-java-5.1

5935734
hash	salt
while best practice for password storage dictates that they should be stored in a hash format with a unique salt the original question actually raises a reasonably good point if you store the salt in a different location to the hash the impact of those hash being disclosed is lowered

hash	salt
2 if the passwords were hash with a salt and the both hash and salt were in the database and the site had sql injection then an attacker could crack the hash but would require more computational effort as there is no performance boost from pre-computed tables

i guess this is the image that s being replace by jcrop but it s a complete riddle why it puts 0 height width in there the first and the proper sizes the second time

5937222
hash	salt
for an approval e-mail you could send the user s id either in clean state id 1 or hash if you hash take time to add some salt like id 356a192b7913b04c54574d18c28d46e6395428ab to the group manager

although security researchers have found a way to make two blocks of text that result in the same md5 hash a collision attack there s no known practical way to create an a block of text that produces a specific hash a pre-image attack

5937509

i have added the required policy files clientaccesspolicy.xml and crossdomain.xml to my web service

guys i understand that that this is stupid question but i need to maintain this code now the code is written in the way that they have to call 50 getter and setter or calling constructor with 50 parameters

5937572
put	get
since the user base for this app will be very small i ve decided to put iads in to try and get a little recovery on the programming costs

5937572

however if i m in landscape or upside down yes it makes sense for this app then the iad displays in portrait but when closed my app is a mess

5937583
hide	show
but off the top of my head i d guess you probably want to create a set of panel s which would contain the appropriate controls then hide or show them depending on the options

5937612

opera	firefox
it works fine in firefox opera etc but not in ie8

5937771
setinterval	settimeout
2 you re setting all the settimeout functions at the same time in the inner call you probably want to call a setinterval and have that increment i

5937777
for-loop	loops
the reasoning is that the for-loop doesn t actually give you the value of i within loops only the address in which to access it

5937796
onchange	onkeydown
i would just add an onchange or onkeydown method to each text box and then write a method in javascript to update only that field

5937853
hide	show
i have some textboxes which i want to hide and then show on focus but it doesn t seem to be working properly

5937891
hide	show

uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you will be able to use uinavigationcontroller with uitabbarcontroller

5937996
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in addition if you drag table view controller to view controller inside the navigation controller they are exchanged and you can use uinavigationcontroller + uitableview + uitabbarcontroller

5938035
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged	inotifycollectionchanged	icollectionview	inotifypropertychanged	icollectionview
based on what you have said it sounds like you might want to review data binding and how you can leverage the inotifypropertychanged inotifycollectionchanged and icollectionview interfaces to enable two-way communication between your views and view models

5938212
setcontentview	findviewbyid
the most common mistake of encountering null via findviewbyid method is when you forgot to call setcontentview or called it for the wrong layout

5938262
screens	hdpi
the nexus s and galaxy tab both have hdpi screens

5938262
mdpi	hdpi
this means a 16x16 normal mdpi icon should be 24x24 pixels on an hdpi device to maintain the same size graphic

5938295
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
just to clarify you only need a crossdomain.xml file or a clientaccesspolicy.xml file

5938318
min	max
you re grouping and fetching min max values so there s no point in introducing a sort step to drop duplicate rows

5938353

rss	feed
i never needed to play a lot with rss but now i have a project to do and i wonder if it is possible to pull an rss feed of all the posts for a certain blog.

5938470
hide	show
you create the desired formatting in two separate sections then use a parameter to hide show the desired section

5938481
put	get
i get that you might want the model to be auto-generated from an orm but you can still put the viewmodel stuff in another file via a partial class and doing this avoids the considerable overhead of maintaining a viewmodel for every model

5938569
rss	feed
i am developing an iphone app in which i am extracting rss feed and then parsing them.my code is as bellow

trying pyopenssl i was able to generate the private pem serialization for rsa and dsa keys bu there is no crypto.dump_publickey method in pyopenssl

5938664
rsa	dsa
i am looking for suggestion of how to generate the pem serialization for rsa and dsa keys

5938664

5938976
uilabel	uibutton
for each image view i am adding a uibutton and a uilabel

5938986
super	extends
when extends it your derived class will need to call a specific constructor in its super class bufferedimage

5938991
implements	extends
you must implements one or more of the existing constructors for the class you are extends

5939001
superclass	subclassing
in a similar fashion if you create a subclassing for bufferedimage it cannot interface with it s superclass without satisfying the initialization requirements

5939018
superclass	subclassing
when extending a class the subclassing must eventually call some constructor of the superclass whether directly or chaining through other constructors it defines which ultimately call a constructor of the superclass

5939018
super	implements
how you obtain the parameters is often done by implements a constructor with the same parameters then passing them on with super

5939022
client-side	server-side
you re confusing server-side with client-side scripting

5939071
filtering	grouping
if it is not really a combination of all values that you want to filtering grouping on but the grouping conditions that determine the value of max depend directly on datetime

5939073
hash	salt
that s why salt was invented -- it creates always different hash

5939077
unsigned	short
where all struct members were of type unsigned short

5939097
rss	feed
rss would make it a little easier but if someone wants to steal the content he will steal it anyway with or without a full rss feed

5939118
int	chars
it now looks for an int followed by a space or one of these chars . â d and that followed by decimal minutes

5939123
crypt	hash
this scheme uses the operating system s crypt 3 hash function

5939123
hash	md5
it normally produces the traditional unix-style 13 character hash but on systems with glibc2 it can also generate the more secure 34-byte md5 hash

5939123
hash	md5
this scheme simply takes the md5 hash of the password and stores it in base64 encoded form

5939123
salt	md5
this improves on the basic md5 scheme by adding salt random data which means that there are many possible representations of a given plaintext password

5939166
post	get
the first 2 methods will receive to both get and post requests the 3rd will only respond to post requests

5939262
mouseup	mousedown
i have code to do this in the mouseup and mousedown event handlers

5939273
post	get
you could provide those values in every get or post request the user sends to the server but that s not a really good idea i think

5939333
inherited	properties
to stay dry don t repeat yourself you can inherited one view model from the other and add the additional properties

5939341
hide	show
i wnat to hide that red border for the initial state but show it when the user hits the send button if there is a missing field marked as required

5939351
post	get
this would obviously only work if you re only doing a get request for post and further requirements look into curl

5939373
integer	unsigned
assuming a language-agnostic setup in which the rand function has a flawless implementation and returns a very large let s say 128 bits strong random unsigned integer i should have fairly low chances of getting the same number twice considering the period of the rng would be astronomically huge

5939378
opera	firefox
you can see the behavior in this simple testcase in ie and firefox and opera

5939674
fadein	hide
hide the image via the css function then fade it in using fadein

5939690
hide	show
but if it is the full code you provided you could also hide show the whole div #related-section because it has no other visible content then

5939694
kerberos	ntlm
my understanding is that java 6 running on windows has built-in support for spnego but it seems that the java implementation does not attempt ntlm authentication in the event kerberos authentication is not possible

5939694
kerberos	ntlm
wcf is configured for spnego authentication kerberos and ntlm

5939714
cpu	processors

i assumed one could simply use objectoutputstream to save all the loaded plugins to file and later read these with objectinputstream

5939839
post	get
i can t get a working set of results - if you could post some dummy data that gives results that would help

5939917
nsstring	nsdata
if your dictionary consists of a limited number of classes specifically nsdata nsstring nsarray nsdictionary nsdate and nsnumber you can use nspropertylistserialization in particular the method

5939935
post	get
the problem is that the click is actually performing a postback using javascript with the limitations of php and curl you will need to inspect the http headers get post and cookies being sent by the browser and emulate them

5939961
typedef	struct
my interpretation is that the typedef struct is creating an alias to an unnamed type and that it thus can t be used as a template type parameter

5939969

i am working on a rss feed app that contains the title and the description in tamil language

5939983

i ve looked into method_exists but that s just not good enough even if i can filter out all closures and global functions because it will return true for private and protected methods as well as public

5940019
width	height
just size constrain your label to the width you need and the height will be calculated for you based on other attributes like font and font size

5940078

3 finally the post action to get and persist the order

5940089
post	get
the content is changed checking some variable from the get post method for each condition i load the page requested

5940093
implements	extends
you might want to look at extends urlclassloader or implements something similar to it

5940122
post	get
i say this because cgi common gateway interface with perl will expose you to the underpinnings of the the web namely http post get request variables server environment variables

5940132

this happens in safari and firefox

5940185
inherited	properties

md5 hash always contains 16 bytes regardless of the input size

5940311
post	get
then in your post action just get the product object and save it to database

5940378
children	parent
if you are forking a single program to create children and only the parent and the children will use the memory segment just be sure to map it before you fork

5940378
children	parent
the children will automatically inherit the mapping from their parent and there s no need to use a fixed address

5940378
boost	stl
if you aren t then the first thing to consider is whether you really need to use raw stl containers instead of the boost interprocess containers

5940378
boost	stl
that you re already using boost interprocess to allocate the shared memory segment suggests you don t have any problem using boost so the only advantage i can think of to using stl containers would be so you don t have to port existing code

5940378
x86	64bit
i suggest at least 2 48 since current 64bit x86 processors don t each beyond that range despite pointers being 64bit you can only plug in as much ram as allowed by 48-bits still a ton at the time of this writing

5940380
express	node.js
i am building an app on node.js using express and node-mysql driver

5940456
put	get
however when i put the following into the manifest i get the same error

5940467
post	get
update i have figured out that the first action method is called but because it returns a view the view engine is calling the podform action method as a post rather than as a get which is triggering the submit logic

5940476
bmp	png
the bmp format has size information and png format has size information for each chunk

5940477
rss	feed
i have a html output i m pulling from a rss feed it is somethig like this

5940532
rss	feed
this requires your rss feed to be very consistent though if the some text part were to contain marks this would mess up and you d get a wrong string

5940532
rss	feed
you could look through the array for everything starting with http or www to work around errors but again it requires a very consistent rss feed so you have to judge for you self if this would do the job good enough

5940536
hash	md5
the reverse it not necessarily true - if two files have the same md5 hash they could have different contents though the probability of this is very low

5940536
hash	md5
however it should be noted that for collisions have been intentionally created for md5 hash so the cryptographic security of md5 is considered broken

5940536
hash	md5
but since there are other hash algorithms available they should be used instead of md5 if you have the option

5940570
factors	mean
that may mean that it s not an access-specific issue but rather that the tables in your database have something in common with the table in this post and that common factors is what is preventing the tableadapter from working as it should

5941089
hash	md5
for example on this intel i7 laptop i have generating 999999 md5 hash from microtime takes roughly about 4 seconds and doing same thing with random numbers is second faster not taking a seeding of rand into account

5941105
hide	show
i can then use jquery to show and hide the buttons when the item is hovered

5941163
put	get
the nice thing is that you can use the cache provider with just a few lines of code to set up then call put and get for serializable key value pairs

5941165
post	get
you file is not uploaded until you do a post back it sounds like your only browsing to the file and then trying to get a thumbnail before you post back upload the image

5941213
jbox2d	andengine
andengine is using that implementation instead of jbox2d and they re happy they switched to that version

5941226

children	parent
there are a couple reasons to do this but one good one is that you can then also issue batch commands for parent and children at once and achieve a type of consistent transaction

5951887
children	parent
to differentiate between parent and children you can either add an attribute or use the rowkey perhaps

5951887
children	parent
the only trick to this and the model you already ahve is that if the parent and children are not the same clr type you will have issues with serialization in wcf dataservices

5951887
children	parent
anyhow use the same pk for both children and parent

5951887
children	parent
then when you search pk ranges you will always get parent and children returned at once you can discriminate with a where clause predicate if you wish

google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari this works as expected..

5957817

let the objects implement the serializable marker interface and then transfer the objects using objectoutputstream and objectinputstream

5957851
ubuntu	centos
ubuntu and centos

5957869
innodb	myisam
so it seems the answer is that you cannot do it for two reasons first because you are still populating the db while also wanting to read it and second because you are using innodb rather than myisam

5957878
try-catch	exception-handling
however we don t want to do this on every exception-handling because there may be a try-catch in our own code that is ignoring specific exception-handling

5957882
fseek	ftell
it s a much more direct and expressive method--you are literally asking the system to tell you the file s statistics rather than the more roundabout fseek ftell method

5957894
google-chrome	firefox
apparently firefox implements the nested section as an indication to reduce the size of the for the sub-section which makes sense while google-chrome does not

5957910
button	checkbox
how would i put button or checkbox in a scroll pane so it will scroll

i guess the mess maybe would work but i fixed my template because the post was like this method post action . and i figured out the url was fine when i get to the page but when sending data in the post it clears out the meeting id and i think that was the real horror

5958175
fseek	ftell
i d tend to agree with their basic conclusion that you generally shouldn t use the fseek ftell code directly in the mainstream of your code -- but you probably shouldn t use fstat either

5958175
fseek	ftell
even though the fseek ftell will give you the correct size with modern systems that data could be stale by the time you actually read the data so you could overrun your buffer anyway

5958230
postgresql	mysql
i ve never used mysql with eclipse but i ve done this with postgresql sql

5958253
boost	stl

width	height
a view s measured width and measured height values must respect the constraints imposed by the view s parents

5959518
children	parent
this guarantees that at the end of the measure pass all parent accept all of their children s measurements

5959518
children	parent
a parent view may call measure more than once on its children

5959518
children	parent
for example the parent may measure each child once with unspecified dimensions to find out how big they want to be then call measure on them again with actual numbers if the sum of all the children s unconstrained sizes is too big or too small if the children don t agree among themselves as to how much space they each get the parent will intervene and set the rules on the second pass

you had code like this to access the parent s height and width

5967155
width	height
i can t imagine how saving the parent s height and width values would speed anything up

5967155
width	height
i also find it hard to envision a situation where knowing the parent container s width and height is helpful

5967155
children	parent
it is important to know how much size a component has for laying out it s own children not how much space the parent has

5967155
width	height
that is in essence the height and width of the component

config	ini
however it was meant to read and write windows config ini files and windows config ini files are very flat and simple formats

5967298
config	ini
if you re using windows config ini files right now but may need to read more complex data structures in the future config any is a good way to go

5967298
config	ini
it ll handle windows config ini files and using the same programming interface read and write xml yaml and json file structures too

5967298
config	ini
that way you don t have to hack through your program if you decide to switch form windows config ini to xml or yaml

5967298
config	ini
so if you re working with windows config ini files now and need a more complex data structure look at config any

5967299

my plugin needs to detect an incoming request from another plugin on a different site at the moment it checks for a _post var as early as possible by using add_action plugins_loaded and the callback function uses to get the post object and then uses the post data to get any other information that is used to process the response which gets sent back before any headers or other standard wp processing happens with the intention of lessening the load on the blog receiving the request

this example is written in a clear object-oriented style with getter and setter

5968055
getter	setter
of course the proponents of getter and setter will suggest that you extend your interface with a member function sort

5968055
getter	setter
setter and getter make our daily programming hard but promise huge rewards in the future when we discover better ways to store arrays of integers in memory

5968124
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
my advice would be to try one of the known solutions svn git mercurial even bazaar and use only the features you need

5968549
directx	direct2d
this requires you to know the directx or direct2d libraries

5968550
width	height
also you re probably resizing the swfcontainer not the swf itself...thats why the swf width and height properties are always 800x600

5968582

it requires that the width and height of the center box be known

5968874
hide	show
to do this i placed the url of the friends requests in the src of an and using jquery to hide show the divs but the problem is the will also contain the header footer and all like facebook.com but i just want the content because the user is already on facebook

google-chrome	firefox
in firefox i get a string which needs to be parsed in google-chrome i get parsed json

5968937

this works fine in ie firefox and opera but not google-chrome

5968957

5969415
children	parent
the parent tag is captured but it ignores the children tags

5969442

i find this a bit monolithic and would not it better when we are using the mvp pattern that we declare a method called bind in each of the presenter that is as follows

5969462
superclass	subclassing
the construction is made up of two key parts a one public abstract interface serving as the â œfaceâ of the cluster which advertises the supported api and b many private concrete subclassing of this interface responsible for actually implementing the advertised behavior of the superclass in their own specific way

5969462
superclass	subclassing
the abstract superclass does implement a few methods itself the most significant being a factory method to vend instances of the private subclassing

5969462
superclass	subclassing
users of the cluster only ever see the one public superclass are unaware that it is actually abstract and know nothing about the existence of any private concrete subclassing

5969462
superclass	subclassing
the superclass offers a factory creational method which is responsible for determining which subclassing is appropriate for any given situation and transparently returning an instance of it

5969521
typedef	struct
the typedef was included in the file i was editing but the struct wasn t

5969576

multicastdelegate	delegation
i try to find some method in multicastdelegate delegation that can tell me there is already one in the calling list

5969897
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
we can get that data by this.dataset property in google-chrome and as we are too lazy to check if our functions work under different browsers engines by the way i have to support firefox and google-chrome only no safari no ie now our app is failing under firefox because firefox does not know what is this.dataset

5969960
hide	show
but when i had it like that the sub-menu show hide didn t work and all the options were showing when first entering the page

5969960
hide	show
so i changed the link reference from page.php to # â ---which makes more sense since that option is not meant to be a link rather than just display another sub-menu but had to include it for the sake of displaying the active id--- and now the show hide works except after i click a sub-category the menu to the right opens but the previously selected sub-category that opens on hover closes and the php detect function doesn t work because i changed the reference to # and the link doesn t show an active status

5969993
inherited	properties
most properties can be given the value inherited which means the same value for this properties as the parent node has

5970026
subtract	add	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	add
ok you might have noticed one awkward thing that i said you needed to subtract the sun position from the planet position first and add it after rotating but in the code above i apparentely added the sun position first and did the subtraction after but that is just because of the order of the matrix multiplication that are going on under the hood makes it reversed.

5970139

the simpliest solution is to add uisearchbar to uitableview header

5970383
udp	tcp
i know that tcp is used in the case of non-time critical applications and udp is used for games or applications that require fast transmission of data

5970383
ftp	telnet
i know that tcp is used for http https ftp smtp and telnet

5970383
udp	tcp
what characteristics of tcp and udp make it useful for their respective use cases

5970389
apache	nginx
using a lighter web server like nginx as a reverse proxy and a static content server should keep the apache memory and cpu usage to a minimum which will be a problem on larger sites

5970458
udp	tcp
think of tcp as a dedicated scheduled ups fedex pickup dropoff of packages between two locations while udp is the equivalent of throwing a postcard in a mailbox

5970458
udp	tcp
tcp is as close to a guaranteed delivery protocol as you can get while udp is just best effort

5970493
min	max
the closest id could be 3 with the value 48 max value inferior and above id 4 with value 55 min value superior

5970517

5970571
next	except
this works fine as a background process except i want to be able to skip to the next song once the stream is finished

5970588
ceil	floor
javascript natively have round ceil and floor to convert floats to integers

5970589
folder	directory
on looking at the folder directory in question on the filesystem they are still present appear to have the correct access permissions and do not appear to have exclusive locks on them

5970589
filesystems	ntfs
filesystems is ntfs jre is 1.6

5970630
int	chars
that would generate a list or array or whatever of int that correspond to indexes of which both strings had the same chars

5970641
mdpi	hdpi
keep in mind that there are three different directories to put your drawables in ldpi mdpi and hdpi drawables directories put your background images in the appropriate directory according to pixel density and the app will chose the appropriate one to use according to the device it is run on

5970656
int	chars
i suppose it could be a 2 dimensional array instead...then i could map int to the chars keys

5970681
entities	entitymanager
in other words the entitymanager holds a collection map most likely of entities

5970686
udp	tcp
boots and this is a time period when the client may not have its entire tcp ip stack loaded and running udp may be the only protocol the client is ready to handle at that time

5970686
udp	tcp
you can do that with udp but with tcp all you get during lag is a pause followed by audio that will always be delayed by as much as it has already paused

5970699
rss	feed
im trying to create a rss feed reader for a project that i working on

5970726
puts	gets
you simply get an endpoint attach to the cache and execute puts and gets on name value pairs

5970726
post	get
there s an msdn blog post showing how to get sql azure working as a session state provider and using a worker role background process to perform session cleanup

5970743
jboss	glassfish

5970753
fitnesse	dbfit
yes there is a cost to setting up test data there is no way to avoid this cost imho but the fitnesse platfom on which dbfit is based enables you to reuse data population scripts by including them within multiple tests

5970785
implements	extends
as i said before when you start a new line you start a new string hint #2 if you extends textview you can implements all this in overriding settext

5970795
listview	gridview
you should use a listview for that then you just need to swap out the listview.view to change the appearance the gridview already is a details-view then you only need to create a view for the thumbnails

5970813
nexus	artifactory
a product focused primarily on strong maven and or nexus integration you have no interest in gradle and artifactory etc

5970816
post	get
use the same url in the mappings for both methods and distinguish them based on request method - get for the former post for the latter

5970836
maven	pom.xml
however this doesn t work since there is no jar in the maven central repository just a parent pom.xml

5970842
width	height
cgrectgetwidth height will normalize the width or height before returning them

5970842
width	height
normalization is basically just checking if the width or height is negative and negating it to make it positive if so

5970880
google-chrome	safari
everything works fine for ie 9 google-chrome and safari on windows 7

5970880
google-chrome	safari
it also works for google-chrome on os x but not safari on os x

5970962
inherited	properties
i can retrieve lists of foosubclassa s and foosubclassb s and see the properties that get inherited with foo

5970968
onfocus	onblur
i d like to know if it is possible to use it in conjunction w onblur onfocus events

5970996
equals	gethashcode
however you should make sure that your gethashcode and to a lesser extent equals is as fast as possible

5971081
google-chrome	firefox
this same request takes 5ms when requested from google-chrome or firefox

5971087
minimum	max
the max value displays fine but the minimum value constantly comes up as 0

5971096
width	margin
i gave #image and #outer a width and #right_content a negative margin to account for the #image s space

5971104
post	get
i m using the query below to get post based on the start and end dates which use the unix timestamp

5971146
memcmp	strcmp
of course you could drop the from_abv function and give your members inscrutable names like sp tl and sr allowing you to directly compare them to your string data but you d need to change the strcmp to a memcmp with a size argument of sizeof #x - 1

5971176
put	get
when i put a similar thing into ejbql i get all sorts of errors raning from null poninter exceptions to invalid syntax exceptions -- here s what i have tried

5971179
dbcontext	objectcontext
self tracking entities are feature of objectcontext - they are not supported in dbcontext

5971205
nsnull	nsstring
at some point in your code you are either calling isequaltostring on an object that you think is an nsstring but is really nsnull or more likely you are passing an nsnull to a method property of a class somewhere that expects a nsstring

5971219
hide	show
i wrote a script that show hide a div depending on which checkbox is selected

5971225
min	max
in this example the object would have two properties min and max whose values are 0 and 1 respectively

5971252
post	put
to create users clients would still be required to submit xml data over http post or put depending on whether they know the final url and if they know all the necessary information for a user resource

5971268
width	height
im now using insamplesize 8 but how can the imageview automatically scale the image to be in the right height width proportions and fill the screen

5971289
mktime	strtotime
some combination of mktime and strtotime should work

5971311
atof	getline
the problem is that when input ends the getline call will fail and it will not update the string you are then converting an empty string to a float which is failing in the atof call if atof fails it will return 0.0 and pushing that value into the vector

5971311
min	max
in your particular case i would use the std copy and std istream_iterator s for reading the input but for processing the already read numbers i would unroll a manual loop so that all min max and sum can be calculated in one pass the stl examples above do it in three passes

5971587
chunked	transfer-encoding
i sent a transfer-encoding chunked header but i m still having the same problem when downloading it from the phone

5971602
google-chrome	safari
i tested in on recent versions of safari and google-chrome in macos ios and android

5971633
mouseover	mouseout
what happens is that i can locate the div and use a google.maps.event.adddomlistener to attach a mouseover and mouseout event to the infobox except it s too fiddly -- when i mouseover a child node within the infobox it counts as a mouseout on the parent node and fires the event

5971652
stdout	stderr
you can often append to redirect the stderr output to the normal stdout stream

5971660
fink	macports
i d look at installing ghostscript via macports or fink

5971691
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
which works fine in ie firefox opera but it doesnt in google-chrome

5971776
put	get
everything went fine until we got the db up and had put some of the data in it and then to get some of the data we were importing from another location we had to change field lengths

5971795
inherited	properties
so you may want to make all the models you pass to the views inherited from a base model class that has the properties required for master page and make the master page have the base type as the model type but it ll be too ugly

5971809
many-to-many	one-to-many
i have some many-to-many and some one-to-many associations that fail to eager load

5971815
post	get
these functions are actually called from ajax post requests so when i get a successful return value from _addsamplestocart i do a simple javascript redirect window.location and it correctly takes me there but i m not logged in

5971839
width	height
.colorboxinline .colorbox width 610px height 395px inline true href #inlinevid

5971855
int	chars
if you are combining int with chars then you d get better performance working with bytestrings

5971895
post	get
this blog post shows how to analyze access log with moving mean in gnuplot and preprocess data with awk to get totals for every second

5971906
super	implements
we settled on this because it was super fast to implements didn t require tinkering with the registration process worked with existing users and didn t require extra queries every page load since the user and user profile is retrieved on every page already

5971919
fadein	fadeout
the fadeout fadein image effect

5971926
versioning	upgrade
note that support for desktop versioning of 8.04 lts is due to expire shortly -- if this is a desktop machine perhaps the easiest answer is to upgrade to 10.04 lts 10.10 or the very-soon-upcoming 11.04 release or whatever they ll call the next release

5971932
hex	binary
i have a ruby-on-rails app that accepts a binary file upload stores it as an activerecord object in a local database and passes a hex equivalent of the binary blob to a back-end web service for processing

5971932
hex	binary
the binary representation of the file was stored properly in the database but the hex string representation of the file that resulted from

5971943
ready	each
i don t have a database ready to receive the input so i d just like each button to simply send an email to me if it was clicked

5971966
children	parent
when i delete child employee from parent organization list of children and then execute delete everything works fine

5972007
jboss	weblogic
jboss uses tomcat as its servlet jsp engine so it s jboss and tomcat or weblogic

5972010
uiview	subviews
i found a workaround to this problem by creating a container uiview with my intended frame and add the tableview to its subviews

5972011
post	get
i have a controller with typical create methods one for get one for post

5972023
x86	mips
nonetheless this is at least a general idea of the core of what happens and it s still at a high enough level to apply about equally to an arm x86 mips sparc etc.

5972032
boyer-moore	knuth-morris-pratt
i did some work on this a long time ago.i found the knuth-morris-pratt algorithm faster than boyer-moore

5972047
for-loop	arrays
inside the for-loop you re allocating a new arrays of int pointers but the original type for maxc was of type pointer-to-pointer

5972047
for-loop	arrays
therefore the statement inside the for-loop is assigning the wrong type to each arrays element

5972169
width	height
the bounding rectangle is essentially a cvrect struct containing the x-position y-position width and height of the smallest rectangle that encloses the selected contour feature

5972169
width	height
additionally the width and height fields in the structure will tell you about the similarity in size

5972174
hide	show
to make things hide and show use drupal_add_js for whatever javascript you want

5972201
kde	gnome
on linux kde and gnome provide this for you and it does seem like something that should be done below the application level

5972239
post	get
1 on form post get the state of each ui element and add it to post data

5972253
hash	md5
alternately you could hash checksum with a native mysql function like md5 and use only the first x chars if you need a short voucher code

5972333
onresume	onpause	onstart	ondestroy	oncreate	ondestroy	oncreate	onstart
use log.d to write messages to the logcat when an activity life cycle event occurs such as onpause onstop ondestroy oncreate onstart and onresume

5972337
post	get
satisfy those conditions and you still can t get it going then post the problem to the mod_wsgi mailing list

5972355

5972479
width	height
presently attributes that are used in layered navigation can t be grouped meaning if you have several attributes that are logically in one group attributes height width depth which are dimensions and color and texture belong in an appearance section

5972503
children	parent
i am not aware of a means to store a counter_cache without using the belongs_to relationship because only the parent can store the count of the children

5972515
fseek	ftell
when i build this to check for errors i get errors saying fopen fseek ftell rewind and fclose isn t declared in this scope

5972519
children	parent
parent cannot see members defined in their children

5972532
stdout	stderr
would suggest you simply modify the output of the scripts you are calling from cron to pipe stdout to dev null all output goes to dev null and stderr goes to the mailto target

5972537
joptionpane	jdialog
if you want the code execution to stop while waiting for input make the jframe a modal jdialog or joptionpane instead

5972542
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox but not in google-chrome or ie9

5972545
nsurl	nsstring
as it says there in the docs nsstring nsattributedstring nsurl nscolor nssound and nsimage are already available for you and of course you can write a custom class that suits your needs exactly

5972598
pop-up	dialog
right now i have a jquery ui pop-up dialog that reads from an external page

5972598
width	height
the width seems all right with 100 but 100 height doesn t work

5972625
linefeed	delimiter
and read from flatfile connection manager column delimiter as | and row delimiter as cr linefeed into col1 col2 col3 col4 then identfying the value with string supperator and getting the value

5972636
width	height
what you want to do after a user uploads that image verify that the file is a real image then using some library if you use a framework it probably has a way to resize images resize the image to whatever max width or max height or max width and height you are wanting

5972688
post	get
to get a different number of post from the blog pages show at most setting just add a posts_per_page parameter to your query

5972720
many-to-one	one-to-many
this being said the example i showed is not a one-to-one relation but rather a many-to-one for the faculty object and a one-to-many for the university object

5972723
mvp	presenter
the difference is really subtle between mvc and mvp when you describe them and resides in the definition of view and presenter controller responsibilities

5972804
post	get

5972810
post	get
my javascript code i tired this with both post and get

5972822
nsmutablestring	nsstring
nsstring is not mutable as is nsmutablestring

5972870
int	chars
the values associated with your enum are still int s you ve just set using a chars literal

5972923
client-side	server-side
either you have to write complicated client-side code to find each field that you need to modify in each repeater-item or you have to blow away the whole server-side output of the repeater and construct new html from the scratch or the method that i ve been using lately take the first repeated item blow away everything else and clone the first item as many time as you need to and modify it s fields

5972923
client-side	server-side
all of the described methods are not optimal because no matter what they require quite a bit of repeated logic on the server-side template in repeater and on the client-side javascript to display json data

5972924
doc	odf
so what i need is a class or component which has a function like these converttoodf htmlcode converttodoc htmlcodes which return odf and doc format

5972924
doc	odf
however the doc and odf file should be without problem and the pictures and tables should be shown nicely

5972976
for-loop	arrays
in my code i have for-loop that indexes over a multidimensional numpy arrays and does some operation using the sub-array that is obtained at each iteration

5972977
width	height
this way the content of the inner div is going to set the height of the inner div and negative margins on it will make sure that the outer div is always 20px bigger in height and 40px bigger in width the content div

5973028
rss	feed

portrait	landscape
i am uploading an image clicked from iphone both in landscape and portrait mode

5973105
portrait	landscape
the image with landscape mode is uploaded fine but the issue is with the image uploaded with portrait mode

5973147
vbo	normals
having now looked into rendering with vertex normals colour arrays and vbo s i have decided to consolidate all actual opengl communication into a separate module

5973155
portrait	landscape
do not use the same layout for both portrait and landscape modes

5973155
portrait	landscape
it would be better to have different layouts for portrait and landscape modes so that the control of the design will be in our hands

5973164
jtable	jxtreetable
subclass jtable or in my case jxtreetable

5973170
exponent	modulo
with a public exponent and modulo the best you could hope to do is to get something like this

5973170
exponent	modulo	post	get
if however the above is what you re looking for let me know and i can post further instructions on how to get it from the modulo public exponent

5973233
glassfish	resin
resin tomcat 7 and glassfish i believe support the servlet 3.0 spec which also offers support for similar features you may want to take a look at that

5973249
express	node.js
both of them just installed node.js and is running a website using express

5973264
equals	compareto
what i want to know is it possible to override compareto using an equals method

5973339
devise	cancan
now that i have cancan and devise working nicely i need to add to my tests

5973351
equals	compareto
if you want to save time - implement compareto and use it inside equals

5973360
post	get
final note when using .load if you pass the data as a string it will use get but if you pass it as an object it uses post

5973375
hide	show
i have these two javascript functions that change a background and show and hide fields however it only works once for each button

5973398
min	max
i m trying to get the min max and average of the set of employees who aren t supervisors

5973440
width	height
however the behavior for the dimensions of the text area is awkward and i had to set a static height and width to it

5973443
firefox	safari
i have both .mp3s and .wav files ready so that it can play in safari and firefox

5973445
width	height
up top i have had to define the width and height of the path

5973445
width	height
or perhaps define an explicit width height like say 100 100 and force the inner path to draw to that

5973445
width	height
currently the viewbox scales the path down to fit inside its parent grid and itw ould be ideal if the canvas could set the paths width and height such that it would fit

5973445
width	height
i guess this sin t that important since i can always just keep defining width and height but i figure if i can make the xaml simpler i should try

5973508
square-bracket	braces
json_encode only makes the process easier as it d be pretty easy to make a quoting bracket braces square-bracket error when creating the string manually

5973556
mouseover	mouseout
how do i stay the child open on mouseover mouseout on the parent1 and if mouseover the other parent2 its child opens up and the parent1 childs hide on mouseover on this parent2

5973581
width	height
the path does have a width and height

5973595
width	height
the function first gets the width and height of the bitmap and then finds the sample size closest to the required size

5973595
width	height
the problem is that the bitmap returned from bitmapfactory.createscaledbitmap src width height filter always comes back with a width and height of -1

5973595
width	height
i then calculate the ratio this way i can keep the same height to width ratio with the scaled image in this case the ratio is 0.598.

5973595
width	height
using the ratio and the new surface area i can find the new width which is 773 and a height of 1293

5973595
width	height
so i m passing in a width of 773 a height of 1293

5973635
salt	md5
i have my spring security set up to do basic authentication to a database with no issues however i would like to add custom login logout and admin pages as well as md5 encryption on passwords w salt

5973665
submit	submission
the default form submission is occurring because of the input type submit

5973665
submit	submission
you could change your submit button to be a different html tag like a span and then use jquery to assign the click event to handle your submission or you could cancel the default action within your submit handler you have now see the submit documentation for jquery on how to do that

5973677
post	get
i saw similar types of post here.but i am not getting this right.to get the uid of running process i wrote

i am trying to redirect my stdout and stderr output to a text widget and i tried memchan to do it and it did not work

5973710
glut	pyopengl
this code nets me with a clear color glut window which seems to suggest that it s not rendering my triangles for some reason but i have no idea why that could be and i can t really find any examples for pyopengl that don t use deprecated functions so i can t see if they did anything different from me that i m missing

5973743
width	height
camera.setmode - sets aspects of the camera capture mode including height width and frames per second

5973748
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i personally haven t used to loops through an arrays because i always just do a for-loop so you can try this

5973791
width	height
on hover i am increasing the image width and height to 400px and 300px respectively and on mouseout i am restoring back to their original size

5973811

5974064
inherited	properties
i have a view model that inherited from a baseclass that has a properties called isreadonly

5974156
mouseover	mouseout
regardless now that you definitely have a reference to the element that actually caused the mouseover or mouseout event you can use it to do your actions i ll stick with somevariable for now

5974156
mouseover	mouseout	actualheight	actualwidth
simply expand the image to 400x300 on mouseover without caring and then back to the stored off actualwidth and actualheight when they mouseout

super foo rather than above foo extends

5974377
width	height
in recent jqueries you can t even get its width or height

5974377
hide	show
on the other hand if you .show an element then hide it before an execution loop an event firing through to when there s no more code to run for that event the browser will be forced to relayout the page and you ll be able to get its offset between when it s show and hidden but it won t be forced to repaint so your users won t see a blip and you won t lose as much performance as you might think

5977966
min	max
when i create network with newff i have to give min and max values of inputs.

5977967

just reverse the mouseover and mouseout parts and it should work

5977968
jsf	seam
i m using the jsf 1.2 + seam 2.2.1 and jbossas 4.0.4

5978022
hide	show	mouseover	mouseout
you can simply add the overlay div statically on the page on each image and then hide it on mouseover and show it on mouseout with a nice fading effect

5978063
hive	hdfs
the data to load afterwards on the hive table is already on the hdfs and i would prefer having the table metadata created automatically by sqoop hive rather than creating it manually and loading the data afterwards

5978112
folder	directory
i debugged the problem it was because the execute directory is system32 and not the setup folder

5978225
listview	gridview
in gridview setadapter as you normally do for custom listview by extending baseadapter and passing the arraylist of paths to this adapter class

5978352
udp	tcp
the reason udp is faster than tcp is because there is no form of flow control or error correction

5978352
udp	tcp
1 tcp is connection oriented and reliable where as udp is connection less and unreliable

5978352
udp	tcp
2 tcp needs more processing at network interface level where as in udp itâ s not

5978369

no you don t want to call free because you never malloc -ed the data

5978383
free	malloc
free should always correspond to a call to a malloc function

5978386
onresume	onpause
it seems that setting your click listeners in onresume and nulling them out in onpause does the trick too

the onchange event on textbox and textarea elements only fires when the element loses focus and if its value is now other than its value when it got focus

5978406

5978520

rar	zip
--edit in other words i want 7zip to tell me if a file no matter the extension contains some kind of supported archive zip tar rar iso etc.

5978590
post	get
this seems like more of a security concern than passing as get or post parameters

folder	directory
would i have to make the admin folder a virtual directory

swt	swing
keep in mind that the point of swt is to use native controls so if you desire the ability to completely customize your controls perhaps using swing would be a better option

5978909
swt	swing
i haven t tried it out yet but i know that whereas eclipse rcp uses swt as a widget toolkit netbeans rcp relies on swing so that may save you from some headaches regarding compatibility problems and so on

5978964

5979196
inherited	properties
what i need is an inherited not in the oo common sense from ancestors to descendants in which the descendants inherited properties from the closest ancestor where their own properties are missing

5979200
folder	directory
i more or less built my own rails version of 360works supercontainer for filemaker. i have copied a few test directory into public images and everything seems to be working just great but this app needs to operate over upwards of 60gb of images and putting them all into the public images folder isn t going to really be feasible

screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
i am testing on a mdpi large screens acer iconia tab and a hdpi medium screens samsung galaxy tab

5979311
mdpi	hdpi
presumably because the acer still uses the mdpi icon and the samsung uses the bigger one but scales it down by 50 because it knows its hdpi if am confident that this surprising scaling occurs because if i move the 48pix icon to the mdpi folder and have nothing in the hdpi folder the icon shows very large on the samsung

5979324
switching	screens
if i understand correctly in your case you have a segmented control that should stay on screens and be responsible for switching the content in the rest of the available space

5981574
vsto	add-in
with typical vsto add-in the add-in is registered under the excel add-in key

5981574
vsto	add-in

tostring	string.format
you could also call string.format on that value instead of tostring and it should work just as well

5981727
equals	gethashcode
the distinct method will use the gethashcode method to determine inequality between the items and the equals method to determine equality

5981727
equals	gethashcode
in your implementation of the b class you have an inconsistent implementation of the gethashcode and equals method so the comparison won t work properly

5981728
equals	gethashcode
here s what you need to understand about the relationship between equals and gethashcode

5981728
equals	gethashcode
so gethashcode must return the same value for two objects that you want to be considered equals

5982208
haskell	ocaml
one would seldom if ever assign a specific numbers to any of the enum values - it is a facility that is not part of the point of the enumerated type but it is very occasionally useful so it is kept and serves more to confuse the beginning programmer than to assist and should not be envisaged as an integral part of enumeration - some languages do not even permit it modula-3 haskell ocaml

width	height
it works with width and height but not with left at least

5983549
spaces	delimiter
i suppose i could just replace delimiter with spaces as well.

5983557

5983835
superclass	subclassing
let s say we have an abstract superclass animal as complextype in xml-schema with cat and dog as subclassing

5983837

i would have used fadein and fadeout functions with callbacks

5983837
fadein	fadeout
then you re sure your fadein animation begins after the fadeout ends

5983858
mouseleave	mouseenter
as soon as the mouseenter that canvas tag the cufon hover element stops working once the mouseleave that portion of the anchor element

scheme	racket
i used ikarus although i would be quite satisfied to use plt scheme now racket if there was a clear way to do it

5984026
getter	setter
i guess there is no other way than to adjust the class and provide getter and setter or to make the member variables public

5984044
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i have tried in firefox google-chrome and opera on my computer and it s not overlapping but on different computers is.

5984049
min	max
the answers you have so far assume you count the min max number of images selected and wrap up to 8 in a containing element

5984072
hide	show
you should use the org.eclipse.ui.menus extension point with a visiblewhen to show hide your contributions

5984100

tested in firefox 4 ie 7 and latest safari

5984106
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

5984106
firefox	safari
click on one of this fish names is ie firefox safari and you ll see what i mean - then click one of the names in safari

5984136
width	height
this happens because sometimes slidedown can t accurately calculate the height when the element width is altered in the brief moment its absolute

5984191
pull	push
then by mistake i clicked pull instead of push

5984231
post	get
another option is system.net.webclient which is the proper way to get post web page data

5984278
jobs	cron

5984301
versioning	upgrade
i tried the nodename gd when versioning and it worked at first - but then when i upgrade jquery from 1.4.3 to 1.5.2 it broke

5984310

to do this i want to use a post method to get around url limit for ie browsers

5984310

5984324
fadein	fadeout
problems with css it s best not to play with display none and opacity yourself leave it up to jquery and use the proper functions for fadein and fadeout

5984347
post	get
forms and controller are in post unless the show get | post

5984350
int	double
to use these values as an index you have to convert them to a class that can store larger int like double to avoid saturation at the maximum value of 255 then add one since you need an index from 1 to 256

5984351
textarea	textbox
i need to add a function to the onkeydown for the textarea so i can check whether or not the length of the textbox has reach a max limit textarea elements don t support a maxlength property unfortunately

5984467
width	height
width 410 height 255 embed

5984474
superclass	subclassing
if the idea is to print the subclassing method from superclass object this will work

5984474
superclass	subclassing
this casts the superclass back to subclassing and prints it

5984486
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
here is css that will work in firefox opera and safari google-chrome

5984490
postgresql	mysql
some support multiple table updates like mysql or postgresql you can then write the query as

5984538
nfa	dfa
a direct implementation of an nfa which is not a dfa since dfa is a subset of nfa usually involves allowing backtracking whereas a direct implementation of a dfa requires only as many steps as the input length so in that sense dfas arrive at the answer faster than equivalent nfas which are not dfas

5984538
nfa	dfa
this is especially true when attempting to demonstrate the existence of a fa since the existence of an nfa is as good as the existence of a dfa

5984538
nfa	dfa
if a dfa is needed algorithms exist for a converting the nfa to an equivalent dfa and b minimizing the dfa

5984613
client-side	server-side
basically you are mixing server-side php and client-side js scripting

5984637
floating-point	fixed-point
there are numbers that you can represent in a few digits of text that can t be exactly represented in a fixed-point or floating-point binary numeric form

5984727
public	protected
the way to do this is to have a protected virtual property which is mapped in your model and a public property that returns an ienumerable

5984737
folder	directory
or svn mv the big_dir up into another folder and change your build system to get the content from the other directory

5984828
addclass	removeclass
i have read a few posts that seem to suggest that removeclass come before addclass but im not sure why

5984896
rtmfp	rtmp
1b yes it is possible with all media protocols rtmfp rtmp and it s tunneled secured variants

5984954
hash	md5
probably an md5 hash or just regular entity encoding see below

5984968
cpu	processors
i doubt it has anything to do with windows server 2008 but probably more with the fact that the server has more cpu cores and or a faster processors than your development machine

5984990
google-chrome	firefox
tested and working in firefox 4 and google-chrome 11

5985004

i m using jqueryui s draggable and droppable

5985050
hash	salt
always store a hash preferably using sha2 in your database and use a salt

5985061
padding	overlapping
you shouldn t use position absolute unless you really need it and there are other much cleaner ways to get this layout but a quick fix for your problem is if you change your padding styles to margins that way the spacing is not inside your div so there is no overlapping and you are able to click your element

5985144
children	parent
so we have 2t+1 keys we split the node into two nodes and push one element to the parent leaving 2t keys in the two children and t keys in each child

5985157
onclick	onchange
i have done most of thing but one thing i need to check is for onclick onchange events

5985165

of course my personal recommendation would be ruby on rails - it has activerecord support fantastic out-of-the-box internationalization and localization support and many more

5985166
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
if that is the case then there s no need to define a similar method in the subclassing since the method from the superclass is inherited by the subclassing

5985200
hide	show
i m searching for my site something that can show and hide some html after 10 seconds for example

5985211
try-catch	exception-handling
a checked exception-handling is different the compiler won t let you just let it propagate you need to either surround any code which might throw a checked exception-handling with try-catch blocks and throw exception-handling is the simplest case if exception-handling is an instance of a checked exception-handling class or you must mark the method which contains the call to code that might throw a checked exception-handling with a throws declaration

5985211
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
if the desired behaviour is to throw an unchecked-exception then you ll need to wrap the exception in a runtimeexception

5985254
portrait	landscape
i want the development platform to always appear in landscape and everything else in portrait

5985255
stdout	stderr
redirects stdout and stderr to logfile

5985328
singleton	facade
i know there are lots of design patterns facade singleton decorator etc... but i m reading about asp.net mvc and i m about two sentences into the intro and i m already confused

5985353
free	malloc
you have to call free for every malloc you stated to prevent a memory leak

5985355
free	malloc
as a general rule for every malloc you have a free

5985413
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
free frees the memory space pointed to by ptr which must have been returned by a previous call to malloc calloc or realloc

5985413
free	malloc
so as others have said if you want to free all the memory you allocated you have to free everything you malloc ed

5985422
codeigniter	cakephp
some other php frameworks to check out zend symfony cakephp codeigniter

5985439
pop-up	dialog
i m using jquery ui dialog for pop-up that read from external pages

5985446

i don t think this is possible in xcode 4 but from console you can add a git remote to the mba or imac from each of them and pull and push between them as and when you desire

5985484
uigesturerecognizer	subviews
i was working on some code that had the same issue and turns out the problem was a subviews with a uigesturerecognizer had been added as a subviews to mkmapview and sometimes they would cause some delegate methods not to fire

5985537

getter	setter
classes that mostly only have class variables a constructor and getter setter

5985655
folder	directory
lets say the file with your main method is in the directory projecthome then your java beans go in a folder projecthome com mycompany model

5985783
loops	if-statement
use an if-statement inside loops for the null check instead

5985864
inherited	properties
i also have a control that inherited from textblock and all it does is add some properties that determine what the text value should be it doesn t affect the style at all

5985864
inherited	properties
i was able to add a properties changed override for the foreground properties and found out that the style s foreground value gets applied and then the inherited value gets applied after that

5985866
x86	64bit
see the x86 tag wiki for links to x86 asm resources mostly aimed at 32 and 64bit

5985965
google-chrome	firefox
while testing i came across a scenario in which firefox 4 and internet explorer 8 render the table in the way i expect it to be rendered and google-chrome 11 doesn t

5985965
google-chrome	firefox
here s a very simple scenario to illustrate the different rendering try it in google-chrome and firefox ie to see the difference

5986041
post	get
using post has to be less of a subversion of the http spec than sending a get body

5986057
min	max
aggregation functions max min etc return immediately

5986079
width	height
edit - so i added the detail disclosure button as suggested below i can detect that my cell has an accessorytype but the accessoryview width and height are garbage

5986079
width	height
i need a width and height because right now the accessory is on top of my row text since i m not accounting for it in my layoutsubviews code

5986095
newid	hashbytes
you can use hashbytes to sha1 a string and newid to generate a random guid as salt

5986152
aggregate-functions	sum
all you can do is report on aggregate-functions sum count min etc -- these are able to combine the multiple values into a single cell in the result

5986170
move	drag
the content should be scrolled along the slider when you drag and move it forward and backward

5986188
put	get
there is a setup program a few other files that get put into the location that you specify when you publish it

5986216
folder	directory
you can use the svn update --set-depth exclude foldername to remove this folder from your working directory

5986228
inherited	properties
my guess is that for textblock the foreground properties is inherited from its parent unless you explicitly set it on your textblock instane

5986243
setinterval	settimeout
many use setinterval or settimeout to check on the content and update the count from time to time say 50ms but such approaches can be computationally inefficient

5986247
profiling	debugging
the export release build is not in the profiling perspective but it is in the debugging and flash perspectives

5986248
antialiasing	transparent
i suspect the answer involves finding some way to represent transparent pixels such that antialiasing ignores them for sampling purposes

5986248
antialiasing	transparent
if i change antialiasing to bicubic and then process the alpha channel such that any semi-transparent pixels are rendered completely transparent i get rid of most of the borders on most of the tiles

5986373
google-chrome	firefox
so far it works well on firefox google-chrome and even ie8

5986386
binutils	bfd
not so much gdb as the bfd library used by gdb binutils etc

5986395
glulookat	glrotate
i haven t found the part where you setup the camera modelview matrix with glulookat or gltranslate glrotate glscale

5986408
postgresql	mysql
stored procedures and functions are very similar between oracle and sql server or mysql postgresql etc

5986412
int	chars
this is fine for chars and other int but gets a bit tricky for floating-point types

5986420
width	height
the problem is the checkbox hover isnt spot on for the width and height of the checkbox

5986427
prepare	execute
it occurs randomly for queries execute using dbi s prepare execute blocks when dbi is routed through pgpool2 3.0.3

5986431
hide	show
now i m not sure but i think that it might just hide the representing the list but i m not 100 sure so you may be able to just show all the s representing each summary..

5986435
width	height
it draws a rectangular border starting at the x and y coordinates given as the first two parameters having a width and height given by the third and fourth parameters the width of the border given by the fifth parameter in the color given by the sixth parameter

5986435
width	height
the parameter list is x y width height borderwidth color

5986541
accessor	properties
the vast majority of the time you can write your properties without needing to overwrite the accessor mutator methods generated for you by the compiler

5986549
folder	directory
i created a test string that outputs the content root directory and it is as follows gamename bin x86 debug content minus my personal folder preceding it of course

5986550
rss	feed
pipes can create json feed from rss sources

5986550
rss	feed
i think the answer to this question would be very helpful for people looking to use rss feed to drive their calendar

5986568
metaphone	soundex
it is based upon metaphone which was designed to correct some of the deficiencies of soundex

5986592
inherited	properties
since tag is an inherited properties from uiview you cannot use it with uiimage itself but you can use it with uiimageview

5986609
hide	show
i wanna know how to hide and show a html element using the original javascript not jquery

5986625
kerberos	ntlm
the primary lead that this was a kerberos issue was when i successfully connected using named pipes as this uses ntlm authentication

5986641
dictionary	map
each object is a map a dictionary if you like

5986648
google-chrome	firefox
this behavior is present in google-chrome 12.0 i think is last version and firefox 3.6.17

5986676
textview	imageview
create a layout that has a textview imageview textview

5986695
hide	show
if you say hide or show a div you can change the style of the div

in both cases make sure you synthesize the properties accessor

5986754
heapsort	in-place
you can write an heapsort algorithm for in-place sorting

this works perfectly in firefox but in google-chrome the load function never runs

5986772
google-chrome	firefox
works great in ie8 firefox google-chrome but now ie9 doesn t know how to handle the callback because the response and mime types don t match

5986789
post	get
post your code and i can make this work for your situation if you can t quite get it

5986826
cldc	midp
you need to know java me java 2 mobile edition cldc midp try it with the netbeans

5986829
cmdlet	start-job
the cmdlet start-job use another thread from the pool allocated by powershell so it makes the dialog non-modal and it does not freeze

5986861
put	get	for-loop	arrays
i ve tried to put the panels in an arrays but i m using gui swing on netbeans and the jpanels are already declared when i put them into the jframe and when i try putting them in an arrays and using a for-loop i get a null pointer error

5986933
google-chrome	firefox
the page in question works perfectly well in google-chrome firefox and ie8

5986962
width	height
yep you are right about the weight when you want the width or height to be controlled by weight its convention to set that value to 0dip and let the weight control the actual value

5987000
folder	directory
i ve basically added an initial block that specifically looks for directory within your domain folder that don t end with a trailing slash and added one

5987002
hide	show
update a better approach as noted by mellamokb would be to hide the original image and then show it again when you hit the reset button

5987087
exponent	addition
in reality you ll get an addition 3 bits for the exponent for a total of 11 and an additional 29 bits for the fraction for a total of 52

metadata in this case takes the form of int dates boolean bits and strings with max size of 10chars

5987249
width	height
hi i have loaded a bitmap and i need to set my own height and width

5987288
width	height
what you need is to scale the image rather than just assign a width height property

5987352
switching	screens
it won t be called if the same row one with the switching goes off screens and comes back on after the cell has been reused

5987355
width	height
i believe the only way to load a high resolution image at it s original size is to use exiflib on the byte stream to detect the original height and width then create a writeablebitmap at that size and use the system.windows.media.imaging - extensions.loadjpeg method to load the image into the object

5987375
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade the make versioning and everything is running the way it should..

5987375

if you still get working directory problems you can put a before the java call on nix machines not sure what the windows syntax would be might want to make a cmd script that takes care of all the working directory bits and just call that

5987401
mouse	keyboard
also understand that this event may not be suitable for your needs - it happens when message pump becomes empty typically no keyboard mouse input - so as such you would probably receive this event too frequently see this so thread to understand more

5987547
addition	multiplication
i am performing a multiplication and addition operation in c and am getting the wrong result

5987548
post	get
looking at this so post you can see how the user used sql to push objec- you will need to do something similar with the json feed you get back

5987552
portrait	landscape
it looks right when in portrait mode but when in landscape mode the nine patch drawable didn t expand

5987576

also bitwise operations are executed on a separate execution unit the cpu can actually perform it in the same cycle as addition subtraction

5987765
qmainwindow	qdockwidget
there have been various posts over the years regarding control of the size of a qdockwidget in a qmainwindow dock area

5987765
qmainwindow	qdockwidget
starting with a qmainwindow subclass mw and a qdockwidget subclass dw

5987765
width	margin
the sizehint of the other panel after construction is used along with appropriate margin spacing to set the base size of the dw with the constructed sizehint width of the panel that will change visibility providing the increment to the base size when appropriate the dw implementation is provided with a panel_visible method that is used to enable or disable the variable panel by applying setvisible to the panel and changing the value of the sizehint by the increment value

5987782
for-loop	loops
i m pretty sure i know how to do one with a for-loop but i m curious if anyone knows of a way by using a while loops

5987810
put	get	post	get	post	put
my understanding is that post requests to user thing containing xml should then automatically get deserialized and put it into before thing_post is called

5987810
post	get
for what it s worth i get exactly the same behavior if i create sub thing and sub thing_post and then use curl to issue a post request to user thing.

5987816
width	height
i am making a project in flash cs5 - i visualize music using a midi file - that means i have on stage lot s of simple movieclips rectangles and they have different z-index opacity height width blur etc.

5987894
xslt	xquery
now using the esb you can mediate messages - maybe log accesses save a copy to a db perform content based routing to decide if a purchase-order request should be sent to pogoldversion service or pobronzevesion or transform a purchase-order-v1 request sent from an old client using xslt xquery smooks etc before sending it to the new poversion2 service etc

5987936
opera	google-chrome
it is working with google-chrome mozilla opera safari.

5987964
flask	cherrypy
i can t speak for flask but i can for cherrypy

5987964
flask	cherrypy
that line about a methoddispatcher is a no-op since it only affects cherrypy applications and you don t appear to have mounted any just a single flask app instead

5987974
for-loop	loops
as you said that you have done using for-loop you can follow following steps to convert it to while loops

5988002
width	height
compact view is width and height set to wrap_content

5988016
nsmutablestring	nsstring
an illustration of this usage in subclasses from the framework returns an nsstring instance whereas returns an instance of the subclass nsmutablestring without nsmutablestring being required to explicitly override the method

i also check the display -tag of the tr to determine whether i should show or hide

5988170
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i am kind of looking for the native app ios sdk equivalent of touchesbegan touchesmoved etc

5988217
hide	show
on a similar note you may use .toggle method to show hide elements with jquery

5988225
requestfactory	gwt
i think a nicer solution that has been solved in gwt 2.1+ is by making use of requestfactory and the entity valueproxy mechanism

5988261
hide	show
now whenever you want to show or hide line1 change the property if bindings are setup properly everything will magically work

5988261
hide	show
for example to hide and to show

5988266
qdockwidget	qwidget
with a qdockwidget subclass dw in which a qwidget with a qhboxlayout that has two widgets left-panel and right-panel added all of which have had their size policies set to qsizepolicy minimum the dw normally has both panel widgets visible

5988266
qmainwindow	qdockwidget
either i am missing something in how to control the size of qdockwidget which given the difficulty i ve had understanding all the interactions amongst the parts of the layout management system is quite likely or the qmainwindow is ignoring or overriding the layout instructions that it is being given

5988266
qmainwindow	qdockwidget
closely examining the event stream during the qdockwidget repositioning operations suggests the latter after the slot handling the docklocationchanged signal has done its resizing work and returned to the event loop i can see that the qmainwindow when user repositioning is done applies additional re-size operations on the affected qdockwidget thus undoing the application logic that attempts to control the dock size

5988276
oasis	ocamlbuild
high-level build systems like oasis ocamlbuild omake etc hide all this stuff altogether and user only needs to provide names of dependent packages

5988301
listboxitem	textbox
if not you can use the textbox getfocus event to walk up the visual tree till the listboxitem and select it

5988357
portrait	landscape
note that portrait landscape orientation is not set here but by the uiprintinfo property orientation

5988359
portrait	landscape
android screenorientation portrait or landscape in the manifest

5988395
hide	show
based on what you seem to need the following code should have the same button both hide and show the keyboard for the textfield

5988418
put	get
to get the effect of lto you re supposed to use the optimization options even at the link stage - the linker actually invokes the compiler to compile pieces of intermediate code that the compiler put into the object file in the first steps above

5988447
fflush	gets
i have developed an application in which i have one edit text value of edit text is entered in spinner on button clicked an the item i select to delete gets deleted but the problem is that when i delete the last item of spinner whole spinner list fflush

5988479
post	put
the post does not refer how to set the alarm settings but you might be able to find those by investigating into which string keys you can use for the put method when using contentvalues for a calendar intent

5988551

uipagecontrol	uitableview
as uitableview is subclass of uiscrollview i want to use uipagecontrol to control the movement of table view cell just like in pagecontrol

keystore	jks
this is for java use so the keystore must still match the jks format even if a non-java tool is used to create the cert

5988701

5989353
int	chars
let s assume and int field is 4 bytes long a datetime field is also 4 byes long and each chars is one byte long

5989510
ready	each
if your threads are doing i o then this is a strong contender for the speed-up as each thread blocks waiting for the i o the processor can run the other threads until they too block for i o hopefully by which time the data for the first thread is ready and so forth

5989542
google-chrome	firefox
in develeper-tools you can see the initially bottom in firefox is something like 500px exactly 511px for me in google-chrome not present

5989542
google-chrome	firefox
so the animation runs in firefox from 511px to 30px downwards and in google-chrome from 0 to 30px upwards

this tabs are for having content hide show and if using ajax pull the page info and show it on demand

5989585
int	double
targeting x64 may improve things noticeably but if you re stuck on 32-bit you could consider whether it is possible to replace the int keys with double since the cpu can handle those natively i don t know what the default hashing function for double look like though and it is possible it will be slower overall but it may be worth testing at least

you should be able to use the method in the post int the comments but you could also use specialcells like range a a .specialcells xlcelltypeconstants xlnumbers .copy to get all of the filled cells

5990134

teamcity	nant
it makes sense i think to use a teamcity template to keep these configurations in sync overriding the differences with parameters and variables overriding nant targets

5990241
width	height
a-tag is an inline element so your height and width are ignored

5990242
width	height
you can t set the width and height of inline elements

5990266

you did not specify the height or width for parent layout so i think that is the problem

5990433

there you have show how to show it and hide it on mouse click in my case right mouse click

5990468

switch to a different hash mechanism you can do it incrementally as people log in and definitely use a different for each user salt

5990674
int	double
the value in the selected row column is a double but i ve also tried with string values and long int values at no success

5990715
hash	md5
whilst md5 is not decryptable it can be beaten by either rainbow tables or matching the hash

5990715
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
salt will work against rainbow table but not against matching the hash which has been achieved with md5

5990760
setinterval	clearinterval
there s also the related setinterval clearinterval which does the same thing but repeatedly at the interval you specify until you stop it

5990781
salt	md5
at the very least dump md5 although computationally fast not very secure these days and use something a little more secure like sha256 with a long salt

5990943
hash	md5
reason why md5 is considered broken is because md5 returns same hash for strings that differ in small percentage

5990943
hash	md5
however some of them like md5 have less possible hash and execute faster

5990948
put	get
you can either customize that page or you can put a redirect on the page to get visitors where you want them to end up

5991023
mvp	presenter
i m only familiar with a few presentation patterns mvp model view presenter common in windows forms asp.net mvc model view controller and mvvm model view view model commonly used in wpf silverlight

5991028

calloc	malloc
calloc 3 and malloc 3 do interact with the kernel to get memory if necessary

5994981
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
but very very few implementations of free 3 ever return memory to the kernel 1 they just add it to a free list that calloc and malloc will consult later in order to reuse the released blocks

5994981
free	malloc
malloc and free cooperate to maintain a directory

5994981
free	malloc
the alternative is a bit more shared-memory and paging-friendly and it involves allocating memory specifically for the directory. malloc and free have little if any ability to enforce access to individual blocks even when special and optional debugging code is compiled into the program

5994981
free	malloc
finally the few programs that do return large amounts of memory are likely to bypass malloc and simply allocate and free pages anyway

pull	push
you should be able to effectively treat each repository as a discrete entity and push and pull between them to get them in sync although really it seems like you only want to be pulling changes from one to form your main repo and get it up to date before pushing and pulling to other dev repo s again

edit to add you can sort the array in place in o n at best in which case you can get the n highest values very quickly but the requirement is to not change position of the elements so you d have to start with a copy of the array if you wanted to do that or preserve ordering information so you could put everything back afterward

in creating a set of elements identified by guids i have opted to use children that share the first 12 characters 6 bytes of their id with their parent and sibling element ids

g++	gcc
i believe by default netbeans uses the standard apple gcc 4.2 compiler which is invoked through a g++ symlink found in usr bin

i often find myself writing getter and setter just because getting and setting would require different access level

6001881
getter	setter
and those getter and setter are trivial getter only returns setter only sets the value no other code inside

6001881
getter	setter
getter and setter are functions under the hood

you can put them in your javascript but then you ve tied your markup to your javascript and i get the impression you don t want to do that

6001968
mouseover	mouseout
i was unable to find a perfect solution to this issue so what i ended up doing was setting up a mouse-event handler for mouseover and mouseout on the control setting up the effects globally and checking effect.isplaying within the mouse event handler

6001976
getter	setter
but you can create properties with different access for the getter and setter in c#

6001976
getter	setter	public	protected
the first creates a property foo with a public getter and a protected setter while the second creates a property bar with a protected getter and a private setter

6001976
getter	setter
as for as objective-c the language specifically for the common case public getter private setter by allowing you to declare a property readonly and then redeclare it readwrite in a class extension or subclass

6002170
folder	directory
i m using eclipse all needed library resist in the project s main folder the current working directory

6002300
put	get
if it encounters any non-numeric values though it will cause an error so you probably need to put a coalesce statement around that field or something to make sure any null values get converted to zero

6002371
disk	ram
rather than thinking when i m out of ram the system will swap it to disk i think when i have available ram the system will move my on-disk memory into it

6002371
disk	ram
and the same for the kernel address space but let s ignore that. every page of memory you can access whether it is in ram or on disk has to be in that address space

6002371
disk	ram
ram is just a fast cache over the disk

6002425
webclient	httpwebrequest
it seems the performance of http requests either webclient or httpwebrequest on device is extremely bad

6002425
webclient	httpwebrequest
also both webclient and httpwebrequest approaches give the same result

6002426
keydown	keyup
it will show the newline in the textarea so if you need that removed you could switch to keyup rather than keydown and do a replace like so

6002431
hash	md5
the first one makes use of the md5 hash algorithm the other one uses nsdata s isequaltodata in conjunction with the uiimagepngrepresentation function

it seems to work fine when the page first loads but if you refresh the image is stretched all across the page and it is very thin height and width get screwed up

6002545
cos	sin
you have to make three rotations and multiply them together when rotating by euler angles whereas a quaternion is only one rotation and as it already encodes the sin and cos the conversion from quaternion to matrix is quite efficient

6002621
google-chrome	firefox
same svg file looks ok when rendered using inkscape rsvg or in google-chrome firefox

6002702
imagemagick	gdlib
you can also use the php module gdlib or imagemagick

6002722
int	double
but now it is not possible anymore to pass arguments of type anyval like int float or double which do not explicitly implement serializable

6002800
implements	extends
i tried to extends bitmap and implements serializable not thinking bitmap is a final class

6002816
temp	tmp
if you know the number of columns one way might be to transfer the data into a tmp table with that number of columns and select from the temp table.

6002836
put	get
put io formats where you have doubts and see if you get the expected values

6002882
serializable	deserialization
serializable the bitmap by using getpixels and when you do the deserialization you can use createbitmap to recreate it from scratch

6002885
stateless	stateful
the problem doesn t seem to be limited to singleton beans though - i ve experimented by changing the annotation to stateless and stateful and i get the same issue

6002915
innodb	tokudb
after a few thousands of inserts performances degrade severely for innodb and tokudb which end to write to disk when their cache and the system cache and the disk controller cache are full

6002957
put	get
if you need to put multiple divs on top of the image maybe it would be a better solution to make that image a background-image as per the css property and then use paddings to get most of the text to flow around it

6003031
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome use the property opacity x for transparency while ie uses filter alpha opacity x

6003081
tactionmanager	timagelist
use tactiontoolbar tactionmanager timagelist

6003084
ienumerable	iqueryable
i am under the impression that with iqueryable as opposed to do ienumerable i should be able to do what i am attempting

6003143
post	get
or what did i do wrong during the post to get this response

6003181
rss	feed
when i retrieve the same url from an rss feed it doesn t work error above

6003261
client-side	server-side
see this answer for a comparison of the candidate techniques showing that they don t work and also showing the client-side portion of the solution involving server-side code

6003284
mouseover	mouseout
it is generally a good idea to do this for click events to make sure one and only one thing happens in response to a click but i m less certain it s appropriate for mouseover and mouseout

6003340
gauge	progress
it s called when the user clicks a button it does some work which may take a while during which a progress gauge is shown in the status bar

6003340

6003584
fseek	ftell
you can use fseek and ftell to determine the size of a file in c

6003592
post	get
the helpers exhibit this behavior because they assume if you are redisplaying data after a post there should be a validation failure otherwise you would be redirecting to a get action as part of the mvc prg post redirect get pattern

6003633
ring	hiccup
for completeness i will mention that i am using the latest versions of appengine-magic ring hiccup and sandbar

6003665

6003712
gmail	hotmail
i ve tried sending it to gmail hotmail and an microsoft exchange address that uses outlook and i get the same results

6003751

a specific case that is very common is if the setter does something like property notification or calls an observer but anything could happen when you call either the getter or the setter

6005545

system.in	system.out
this works very well since system.in gets the inputs from the user nad system.out prints all the outputs

6006126
system.in	system.out

6006555
getter	setter
to access super class variables make the protected but a better solution is to make protected setter getter for that private instance variable and use them instead

integer	unsigned
note that the number 2269495617392648 is much too big to fit in a 32-bit integer signed or unsigned

many-to-many	many-to-one
i m looking for a simple-to-use reasonable-performance orm which supports caching many-to-one and many-to-many relations

for-loop	arrays
the problem is that array.splice reduces the length of the arrays thus making the for-loop skip over elements

6012123
elf	dwarf
however the size once loaded is likely somewhat smaller than the one disk size depending on what other information is in the file dwarf debug symbols extra elf sections not required etc

6012125
macports	homebrew
but one thing you might check i was testing using gmail on a macbook that had been set up with macports but with ruby rails and other stuff set up using rvm and homebrew and was getting ssl exceptions in this environment -- when i set the error stopped but no mail was sent

oncreate	ondestroy
a lot like oncreate through to ondestroy

6012189
width	margin
the only problem in my way is that after pressing an a4j commandbutton most of my h outputlabel s are shortened by 3 pixels these pixels were to the left of the text which is unusual since the left padding margin and border width are all 0px

6012194
stdout	stderr
things in the subprocess module need a file object with a fileno callable attribute for stdin stdout and stderr which only files with a file descriptor real files should implement

6012204

furthermore i d like to know what techniques can be used to make use of the min max values as part of template parameters eg

6012254
fileinputstream	gzipinputstream	bufferedreader	fileinputstream	bufferedreader	gzipinputstream
you should wrap the fileinputstream with a bufferedinputstream before wrapping with a gzipinputstream rather than using a bufferedreader

6012259
fileinputstream	gzipinputstream
add a bufferedinputstream between the fileinputstream and the gzipinputstream

6012278
nstableview	nswindowcontroller
when the user presses the new button an itemadd nswindowcontroller is activated where the user types in attributes for the item to be added to the nstableview

6012285
uiview	calayer
there may be some confusion i know there was for me when you see that uiview s and their posterity all are automatically layer backed and have a calayer property

6012285
uiview	calayer
never-the-less it is evident that uiview is somehow overriding the implicit animation mechanism of its calayer property

6012285
uiview	calayer
so if you want implicit animations you must use calayer s directly not just suppose that because uiview has a calayer property that it will behave the same

6012312
multiplying	multiplication
you get kind of shaky when you get to things like multiplying because there are actually multiple kinds of multiplication operators -- there s vector product and dot product which are fundamentally very different

put	get
put this in an initialization method of an object that you want the notification to get called on

6012326

when the mouse hovers into the inner element the mouseout event for the outer element is fired first then the mouseover element for inner element is fired then the mouseover element for the inner element is fired last

6012352
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave
to avoid this you should use mouseenter and mouseleave instead of mouseover and mouseout

6012404

in addition to octonion s post if like me you want to use apache mod_mono you need to ensure you install the correct version of mod_mono by running the following and it will get the right one

6012459
put	get
the problem is that theres nowhere in the code that writes to a database....it just uploads the image to a folder and theres no database to keep track of it......i know sql good enough to get through writing the code....but im not too knowledgeable about where to put the actual sql code.....if i click the go button to upload the image the user is taken away fromt this page.

6012511
mef	prism
using mef for the add-in architecture over prism can be cleaner because the reasons for each project are vastly different and mef has a cleaner model i think it can also act as a basic ioc container

6012511
vsto	add-in
i also have a project vsto contrib which may also help you out especially if you have ribbon s and other things registered via add-in

6012516
config	ini
apart from being one of the best command-line option processors in any language it also supports reading config data from files with a syntax like ini and using environment variables

6012516
config	ini
if you have a huge variety or a hierarchy of config however you might better check out boost property tree which read ini files but also xml or json and is probably better suited if you have a really large config

6012536
rspec	capybara
then when you want to do integration tests on your rails app use capybara with rspec

6012536
rspec	capybara
you then translate those cucumber steps into lines of rspec and capybara

6012543
post	get
to do this you ll want to either introduce get post data call or use a different path for your ajax requests call

6012566
getter	setter
there are also cases where two methods are so trivial that i would test them together like setter getter

6012586
multiplying	add
if the block-items are dynamic in quantity you could always count them with jquery on document ready and multiplying their quantity by 50px or whatever their width is and add the width of the container-article 800px or whatever its width is and then set the parent containers width to that

6012603
hash	md5
you could use hash such ass md5 random number or you could go all out and make a guid

6012620
for-loop	loops
i m using a for-loop to accomplish this however whenever the socket encounters a time out loops breaks

6012667
super	extends
just because you extends a class doesn t mean you can cast from the super type

6012688
lisp	scheme
ps i ve seen the post on doing this in scheme and a similar one on tuple expansion in common lisp but those weren t very helpful in answering my question 1 because i m not using scheme and 2 because the highest ranked answer was just the word apply

6012691
jquery	simplemodal
i am using jquery and one called simplemodal and it works well

6012714
int	boolean
surprisingly they are compiled to binary-xml which parses the int boolean floats etc to machine format and can be read very quickly

6012716
awt	swing
using gwt for guis are very different from using swing awt exactly because you need to describe the gui using html css elements

6012729
loops	while-loop
before you search in the database you may first split the sentence and then check each word is a stop word using a loops ex while-loop

6012766
rss	feed
i have a feed page that needs to have a click handler applied to every link in the rss feed

6012786

if the service is talking to the cloud with http get post whatever requests then note that a c2dm solution would net better battery life and that a syncadapter solution could provide a few benefits

6012796
portrait	landscape
i have seperate views for portrait and landscape views

6012796
portrait	landscape
the portrait view showns a single page and the landscape viewer shows 2 pages

put	get
put it at the top instead and get rid of the since i don t see this as a function call

6012889
terminate	timeout
that block takes just over 5 000 ms to execute instead of what i expect to be a few ms so it seems to have to do with a default future timeout - and the program does not actually terminate

6012903
getter	setter
see the getter in property initializer and setter in property initializer rows

6012940
post	get
thanks to rod s answer on this post i ve got the dashed line going but am not sure where to start to get it moving

6012943
int	double
note that there is no such thing as a double or even int in javascript a variable s type is defined by its value

6013032
getter	setter
it gets a bad score of 0.94 because each getter and setter doesn t access all of the other instance fields

6013032
getter	setter
a getter and setter will always only access one single instance field

6013055
post	get
but once i make another request get post wherever to the server i need a new context because my context is dependant from .net httpcontext

6013066
unix	solaris
i am trying to port some c++ code from windows to solaris unix

6013077
jboss	glassfish
you need an j2ee server which depending on the complexity of your application might be a jsp servlet engine like apache tomcat or a full-blown j2ee application server like glassfish jboss or even a commercial product like oracle fusion middleware suite which also includes features like user management ldap server sigle-sign-on server farm management tools etc

6013104
folder	directory
previously i was copying the source into each project independently but now i d like to move to having a single directory that has all of those shared files it and include a folder reference to them in each xcode project that uses them

6013131
datalist	repeater	gridview	repeater	gridview	datalist
when pressed a nested gridview repeater or datalist is used in place of a custom row

6013131
gridview	datalist
i find that jamming extra rows into a gridview in the above fashion is hard to maintain whereas nested gridview or datalist are not too bad once you ve done it once

6013177
int	boolean
instead boolean values are stored as int 0 false and 1 true

6013177
tinyint	boolean
the mysql adaptor overrides these to work with its tinyint implementation of boolean columns

6013221
g++	gcc
you can also use comand line gcc g++ from cygwin console but i still use vs as the code editor

6013232
cout	ofstream
now the polymorphism in this example happens because you can choose between std cout and std ofstream and std stringstream

6013284

implementations are required to ensure that if the equals method returns true for two objects x and y then the value returned by the gethashcode method for x must equals the value returned for y

6013293
client-side	server-side
you just need to ensure that when you create client-side widgets you do this using field names that wtforms will parse correctly into the server-side list

6013293
client-side	server-side
you can clone an existing row using client-side javascript to add rows so that the rendering of a row is consistent across rows generated server-side and rows created client-side

6013333
min	max
that can be used to to determine the min and max

6013333

i sort the lists so i can easily select the min and max values

6013333
min	max
if the min of box b the max of box a or the max of box b the min of box a then there is no collision on that axis and no collision between the objects

6013342
hide	show
if you do not want to hide the element that you will show by clicking itself

6013467
hide	show
drventure is right you have to define your ribbon up front then show hide different buttons on the ribbon

min	max
you don t have to use max min will work or even sum

6013522
vsto	add-in
installing vsto 4.0 causes vsto 3.0 add-in to quit working

6013585
int	double
exception when comparing an int double and int int

6013664
int	double
when you look at the il-code that those two snippets produce you ll realize that vb.net first converts the int values to double applies the division and then rounds the result before it s converted back to int32 and stored in y

6013729
post	get
this should issue a normal post request with single data parameter - so on server side you can use context.request.form data to get json string and then use any json de-serializer javascriptserializer josn.net to get the object

6013744
free	malloc
if the argument to free does not match a pointer previously allocated by means of malloc and friends the behaviour is undefined

fast-forward	merge
if that was from head of main branch then the merge back into main should have been a fast-forward one main head should have simply be moved at dev head and your project should have worked

6013919
int	double
nscontrol can have their value set with various data types int float double even some types that are not applicable to nssliders for example nsstring their is no default type just use the following method

6013932
stdout	stderr
i m pretty sure detached processes work just fine considering that you have to explicitly wait for it to exit and you need to use threads to babysit the stdout and stderr

6013943
google-chrome	firefox
it s working fine in google-chrome but it s not working in firefox

then i designed several layouts one for each screens type - ldpi mdpi large-mdpi and hdpi - where

6014031
qstring	qbytearray
qxmlstreamwriter can very well write to qstring directly since it was introduced in qt 4.3 no need to add the extra chance of getting the encoding wrong with a qbytearray

6014104
int	boolean
i m not sure that you have a valid model using either int or boolean

6014251
submit	submission
the easy one is to reset the session variable on every non-postback request but this will allow the user to submit a post on one page load another page than hit refresh on the first one thus submission the comment twice but not being able to add a comment on the second page any longer

6014260
clang	llvm
one of the llvm clang features that comes with xcode 4 is runtime checking for frameworks though

6014268

6014381
autocomplete	multi-select
i am using the following jquery multi-select autocomplete plugin

6014407
width	height
because the home screen s layout orientation and thus the cell sizes can change as a rule of thumb you should assume the worst-case cell size of 74 pixels for the height and width of a cell

6014407
width	height
to find your minimum width and height in density-independent pixels dp use this formula

6014455

6014596
google-chrome	firefox
i for example have google-chrome and firefox running side by side right now

6014613
put	get
the lambda uses startmetres and divisionposition so both of them get captured and are put in that nested class

6014620
client-side	server-side
server-side hardly i ll have a chance for suggesting a concrete solution because i don t know which server technology you re currently using in your project but you ll need to mimic client-side solution in your server logic by storing such hierarchy in some session or view state management and send such json of client-side solution but from server and execute some client state javascript recovery function

6014644

6014886
min	max
i think the problem is the calculation of min and max

6014914
width	margin
for example if the container element is 1067 pixels width and contains two panels of 200 pixels and one panel of 600 pixels with 50 pixels margin between the actual width of three panels will be 200ã 2 + 600 1000 but the outer width will be 1000 + 50ã 2 1100 greater than 1067 pixels

6014925

6015204
put	get
but generally it is not a good idea to put data into a session unless absolutely necessary because it is cached for a long time and there is no mechanism to get it out of the memory before the session times out

6015204
instances	transient
the prefered way for session scoped data is to add it to the session and add a transient binding to a method that returns this data or creates a new instances if it is not yet available

this second level of memory management is local to every process and is usually implemented by the standard c library malloc realloc and free

6016040

for small allocations malloc implementations keep track of mapped unused memory subdividing the unused memory as necessary to match the requests from the user code and requesting new memory pages from the kernel whenever no suitable free memory block is found

6016058

6017239
integer	unsigned
in the fragment shader we then just take a bit pattern as unsigned integer though 32-bit in contrast to gllinestipple s 16-bit value and the stretch factor of the pattern and just take the texture coordinate well no texture anymore actually but nevermind modulo 32 to get it s position on the pattern those explicit uint s are annoying but my glsl compiler says implicit conversions between int and uint are evil

versioning	upgrade
if the versioning numbers are different you know the app was updated and you can take whatever action is appropriate as part of the upgrade

dbms-agnostic ie. works with postgresql just as well as mysql

6018196
pop-up	dialog
good jquery pop-up dialog plugins

the idea is to hash your serial numbers during build time into their hash representations which cannot be reversed sha-256 is considered to be a pretty safe algorithm compared to say md5

6018313
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome it shows but in ie 8 it does not show

6018325

6018948
children	parent
however due to how the logical visual tree is constructed the parent of the overlay is the grid and not its children which are on the same level in the tree as the overlay

6018956
filtering	grouping
i have grouping of categories and i want to allow filtering of the listing of the courses by categories through an interface like

6019026
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
the other options cleaner but definitely harder is to create an nsoperation that manages an internal runloop or one supplied by the caller so that async apis that need it like nsurlconnection can be run on threads different than main

6019073
hide	show
when i click on any other menu headers the previously toggled show sub category should untoggle hide and the currently active menu header should be toggled with its sub categories

it s especially hard for me to grasp what s going on since we work with git using internal releases i create release branches that i push which our release manager pull and merges down to master and i pull his master

6019149

then when your edit dialog comes back it will store the chars the user typed back into buf which you ll probably want to convert to an int

6019318
post	get
post redirect get

6019376
children	parent
probably the most ideal use a treeview and template the parent and children to hide the expand button

6019435
versioning	upgrade
then look through the zend framework download archives and upgrade your framework versioning by versioning follow the versioning listed in the migration notes to either get to a versioning that works with the php you have or ideally the latest versioning 1.11.x

6019466
int	chars
i ve tried receiving a chars check if it is a int then convert it into a int but then i realized that i need to get inputs for int larger than 1 digits so the chars method won t work

int	chars
if i receive a string then i can t check to see if it is a int or not unless i scan through the whole string to see if all its chars are integer...

6019503
getter	setter
i see getter and setter as methods to be called by external classes

6019634
pop-up	dialog
you ll notice that by default the autoopen attribute is set to true so the standard behavior is to pop-up the dialog automatically on page load

path c windows system32 drivers etc in fact most of the listings in the services file use both tcp and udp protocols

6019811
udp	tcp
from that file here s a few of the protocols that can be sent over either tcp or udp there are exactly 100 listed protocols that use both in the file many internal ms protocols

6019822
accessor	properties
i always use the properties accessor because then your code is more prepared for changes down the road

6019822
accessor	properties
additionally if you use the properties accessor throughout the class you can then change the implementation of the properties down the road and you ll only have to change code in one place

6019823

6019990
folder	directory
however then i tried creating a folder in directory a by system.io.directory.createdirectory directorya+ test

6020016

now that the user s response is in a string you can do a quick scan for non-numeric chars or use the int value attribute to convert it to an int wrapping the invocation in a suitable exception handler

6020018
udp	tcp
snmp almost always runs over udp but it can and does run over tcp

6020031

safari and google-chrome seem to be ok with a timeout of 1

6020119
implements	extends
for the record fund implements ifund which extends serializable so nothing remote and mockstockmarket extends unicastremoteobject and implements istockmarket which extends remote

here s the situation i have a uitabbarcontroller as my root view there are 2 tabs both have a uinavigationcontroller setup so i can push views as needed

6020222
viewdidload	viewdidappear
here s the problem though if the user starts the application and selects an item in tab 1 tab 2 appears but the values of the search display text don t get set - because viewdidload and viewdidappear are called in another thread so the execution of queuesearchbytype withdata gets called while the view is still loading and setting up

6020255

6020369
trie	tree
convert multiway tree to a trie assign the following prefixes to every node in the above tree

6020385
keydown	keyup
you need to address this in the keyup and keydown event

6020385
keydown	keyup
so you will need to stop event propagation at the keyup or keydown event

6020391
division	modulo
i cannot use simple db functions like modulo or division as it is very time consuming

6020413
httpconnection	downloading
i using httpconnection so the downloading is not done with the getinputstream

this way select performance should be fast and i would just have to do a post select cast to get the data into the proper data type

6020445
pop-up	dialog
i ve used a solution that pop-up a modal dialog with the default indefinite animating loading circle spinning around while the task is running

6020449
pop-up	dialog
a better approach might be to pop-up a dialog with the data to be changed

6020495
jar	manifest.mf
i ve verified that the class-path inside my apps jar manifest.mf is correct

6020516
parentviewcontroller	navigationcontroller	parentviewcontroller	modalviewcontroller	navigationcontroller	modalviewcontroller
at a minimum you would need to override or mix in replacement getters for parentviewcontroller splitviewcontroller navigationcontroller tabbarcontroller and interfaceorientation and probably also modalviewcontroller

6020530
folder	directory
i m currently setting up an include statement and php files from different folder need to include the same files namely top directory public_html include head.php

6020530
put	get
also include is a folder where i put all the files that users generally don t need to view mainly to get them out of the way and make my main folder less messy

6020535
spaces	linefeed
on the other hand actual uses for such characters ascii characters before spaces other than tab carriage return and linefeed iirc are relatively rare - you may find you re okay just to strip them

6020540
getter	setter
you can use a private field with a public getter but no setter

you might have to tweak this for example store the result of the merge to put in the lookup what you are doing here is leveraging the fact that for a map put and get operations are really fast a hashmap uses the hashcode method that is on every object

6023123
innodb	myisam
my be worthwhile to consider whether you ll be using mostly select queries or insert update since innodb supports row-level locking better for insert update but myisam uses table-level locking faster if you ll use just select

the usual scenario is that you do a pull before you push up your changes

6025314
versioning	upgrade
if you transition from free to paid everyone that has downloaded the app for free will not have to pay to upgrade to the paid versioning

i m using eclipse and m2e maven integration for dependency management

6025598
hash	salt
so for now i m just putting a random hash and salt in so no one including me knows the actual password

6025613
post	get
also i m thinking that i should support post instead of get as some of the required parameters may not fit in nicely with url segments

6025618
ironruby	ironpython
you might want to look at a dlr -based language like ironpython or ironruby

6025631
width	height
the values for the width and height of a view will not return valid data in java code until layout is complete this happens sometime later than when the layout is inflated from xml

6025664

yes before any request data is sent url headers cookies get or post parameters.

6025688

6025778
width	height
if the above code executes within a frame or iframe it will give you the frame s width and height

6025778
width	height
the computed width and height do not include the title bar menu bar status bar or toolbar s - but may include the horizontal and vertical scrollbar s if any

6025778
width	height
if the user resizes the browser window you may need to recompute the width and height use window.onresize to do so

6025778
width	height
similarly if the user zooms in or zooms out you may also need to recompute the width and height

6025843
put	get
note that i m using the c++ deque here but anything that lets you put items on the back and get them from the front will work fine

6025845
innodb	myisam
it might possible make sense in some cases for myisam tables i would not recommend to use it anyway because a value for auto_increment column will be generated differently if it s a part of composite index but not for innodb engine

6025910
filtering	grouping
you will have to basically export to excel and do some manual grouping filtering there would be easiest

6025942

i wonder if i can disable authenticity_token requirement or get around it somehow so that when paypal post to my app it can go through without any errors

6026283
folder	directory

6026823
public	protected
i know the public private and protected are mutually exclusive which reduces the combinations somewhat

6026823
public	protected
i read in the hex value of the access flag and then increment a counter depending on if it is public private or protected

6026823
public	protected
i thought of doing modulo on the access flag and the appropriate hex value for public private or protected but public is 0x0001 so that won t work

6026866

6027182
cout	cin
both cin and cerr are tied to cout and calls cout.flush before any of their own operations

mp3	wav
so i think its safe to say that flash player will only support mp3 and wav files to play sounds

6027224
aggregate-functions	sum
often you ll want to use aggregate-functions like count and sum with the group by clause

6027259
width	height
all have the same width but may have different height

6027267

prints and i have included the whole code in a try-catch but no exception-handling was caught

6027506
single-quotes	double-quotes
i do also remember reading somewhere that python won t recognize the double-quotes around each object and key that to get it to something django likes each should be surrounded by single-quotes

6027515
onresume	onpause
check activity life cycle in android while onpause onstop ondestroy destroy the surface view which has been used in your application and recreate surface in onresume then it is working fine

i am writing a implementing a asp.net web app and when i call against a particular url i want to call a different action method depending on whether the request is a get or a post

6027656
short	base
basically create two different hierarchies one rooted at base and another that serves as some short of manual dispatcher

6027656
visitor	crtp
depending on your particular use case this might be too complex if static polymorphism like crtp would work or too hard to maintain if the hierarchy is big for each new element in the base hierarchy you will have to update all types in the hierarchy of the visitor so if you can avoid this complexity perfect

6027780
put	get	move	drag
i explain i ve got a jpanel on my app and i want to put a jlabel or jbutton on it and when i drag it it move arround the panel to finally get the bounds i know how to do this to save it on a bbdd

6027938
cout	cin
cout is tied to cin so any attempt to read on cin will flush cout and

6027952
width	height
if you added more height width to your list elements or changed the padding you could get them looking like you want them to

6027952
width	height
as-is though they get cut off by the 25px 75px width height

6027978
mouseover	mousemove
also it s better to use mousemove as mouseover doesn t always get triggered if your mouse is already over the element when the .live function kicks in

6028008
typedef	struct
a simple typedef won t yield the same effect for struct b

6028016
uitableview	nsindexpath
- void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

my two big favorites are debian and fedora centos

6028033
ssl	https
something like https ssl

std sstream is derived from both std istream and std ostream

6028161

google-chrome	safari
edit the question was changed substantially so i have added a demo that works in google-chrome safari as i only included the -webkit- css prefixed rules

6028199
width	height
there is a height width constraint though so longer text could still break the layout

6028264
post	get
but i don t know what your post method will do because it doesn t get any data

6028264
post	get
post actions usually get some post data to process so it would probably need some parameters as well

6028294
width	height
i tried setting 100 width and height and removing all padding and margins for body html and canvas

6028303
swt	swing
if you can t get it working in swt perhaps you could try rendering to a swing image and copy the resulting pixels

6028350
notepad++	scite
i know you stated you do not want an ide but i would highly suggest a minimalist ide like the ones i just suggested or at least scite or notepad++ to get some basic syntax highlighting with the ability to configure build tools if you want as well

6028435
google-chrome	firefox
the problem only seemed to occur with google-chrome and firefox

6028441
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome same engine as safari some slight differences in vendor extensions supported

6028524
folder	directory
i thought this was quite a sensible approach until i discovered that visual studio 2010 hickups under this approach if two .cpp files have the same name albeit in different folder and namespaces because all .obj files are placed into the same temp directory debug or release

6028548
super	implements
doing that you force the implements class to have an explicit constructor as it must call the super constructor with one parameter

6028558
mouse	keyboard
if i happen to be at the mac console i can move the mouse or keyboard and then the vnc works

6028579

if you don t want to use maven because you already use ant or anything like that use ivy gradle buildr or any other build tool with dependency management

6028630
filtering	grouping
you can process the result using any of the linq operators - so you can grouping filtering and select as much as you want

6028675
min	max	range	max	range	min
the problem is that matplotlib seems to automatically scale the color range to the min max of the data values

6028677
getter	setter
i have a quick question on best practice and if getter and setter are the best option in a specific case

6028677
getter	setter
class a contains public getter and setter for classes b and c to access so data is centralised

6028689
ssl	https
but now i have activated ssl in tomcat to use https

6028734
versioning	upgrade
now i am upgrade the rails 3.0.7 to rails 3.1 pre versioning

the method inflate int viewgroup boolean in the type layoutinflater is not applicable for the arguments int test01 boolean

6028784
spaces	linefeed
if you are looking for full sentences then it might be a period preceded by a non-whitespace character and followed by a spaces or new line or linefeed or some more complex rule set

6028789
set	bag
if some lines may occur multiple times you have to use a bag instead of a set

6028797
client-side	server-side
you could use client-side javascript validation and back that up with server-side php validation too but if you set the forms post target to be the same page that generates the form so _server request_uri you could call the validation object class in a statement like

6028829
rel	alt
if you don t want to use the title tag you could use the alt or rel attribute which would be performed the same way

6028835
int	double
so say i want a class that has 3 fields a string an int and a double

6028891

i have done nothing special within onpause or onresume apart from passing onpause and onresume through to the augscreen

6028933
width	height
the width and height of the centred content would be known

6028933
width	height
that fiddle does include the image width and height but if you remove them and the positioning for the sub text it does or should show that whatever is in the middle does stay centered

6028933
width	height
note i ve left your widths intact but you can test without widths height by removing the height width off #c and also remove the css for the #c div text div - in a plain text scenario entering text into either of these divs should auto centre

6028958
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
check specially the touch events touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended in movemeview.m to get the idea how they have moved placardview

6028981

6029259
google-chrome	firefox
the page behaves exactly how i would expect in firefox all versions and google-chrome

6029299
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
actualwidth and actualheight are 0 before the labels are displayed width height is not set because i wish the labels to size themselves basing on their contents desiredsize returns either 0 correct size or size exceeding the real label size like 2 or 3 times rendersize returns either valid size or 0 and it is like first label returns valid size and second one - 0.0 without any noticeable reason

6029347
actualheight	actualwidth
after invoking this method actualwidth and actualheight will have the correct values

6029362
int	boolean
in particular config4j provides type-safe lookup that is get operations for built-in types such as string boolean int float and durations such as 500 milliseconds or 2.5 days

6029362
int	boolean
so you would have to convert an int boolean float int-denoting-duration whatever value into a string and then insert that into the config4j object

6029441
width	height
try this if it will solve the problem just replace height and width in the css

6029442

6029532
hide	show
i use these buttons to show hide one of the two grid so that only one is visible at a time

6029542
google-chrome	firefox
keep in mind you don t see the modernizr classes when you view the source you need a tool like firebug on firefox or the developer tools on google-chrome to actually inspect the post-javascript code

6029621
int	double
reading your motivation again it seems like you want a function where an in int can be equal to an in double

6029627

asp.net-mvc	nancy
it borrows a lot from the asp.net-mvc razor implementation and also has some nancy specific stuff but it shouldn t be too hard to figure out what s happening

6029934
nsnull	nsstring
i m guessing letting nsnull go into an nsstring object was wrong

6029937
exponent	modulo
however this requires a set of values i have not been given such as modulo exponent p q etc

6029945
width	height
i have default styled input fields no css added just width height padding but now i want to give it a red border error style

6029945
outline	border-color
just setting border will delete the default style of the input setting only border-color will look weird setting an outline will work in some cases and doesn t look so good in firefox

6029949
mouse	keyboard
i am trying to implement a program which is started in fullscreen and does not allow any userinput wether mouse nor keyboard because it just reacts on udev-signals when a usb-stick or cd is inserted

6029949
mouse	keyboard
i want to prevent that a user puts in a keyboard mouse and does somethin weird with the workstation

6030017

6030077
opera	firefox
it doesn t work for me in firefox on mac or pc and opera on mac

6030078
ant	maven
you should really look into build tools like maven ant ..

6030081
put	get
if you can clarify where you want to put it and why i ll tell you how to get it working

6030083
versioning	upgrade
you really need to upgrade to a recent versioning which has good autovacuum and will handle this automatically

6030092
margin	height
if i set the body and html to be height 100 with 0 margin and padding then the background repeats the full height but now scroll bars appear

6030098
matplotlib	mplot3d
matplotlib s mplot3d part provides nice 3d plot support but so far as i can see its api doesn t have anything which will simply take a 3d array of scalar values and display an isosurface

6030117
folder	directory
if that s not possible some way of listing the entire contents of a directory along with which branch each file and folder is in

6030181
inline	inlining
i imagine there can be other reasons too inlining though in theory the compiler could generate the proper mapping for all the inline

6030206

6037434
width	height
the .attr method works correctly with respect to width and height

6037434
width	height

6037501
children	parent
code i have so far but it only gets the parent and children no grandchildren

6037509
strncpy	strtok	strcpy	strtok	strcpy	strncpy
frankly the best way to split up the string is to use any one of the standard library functions strtok strchr or strcspn and use either strcpy or strncpy to copy the substring to the destination arrays

put	get
now if i try to put the app into background and bring it back with a url sys call i get a print out of 4a40032 which in binary is 0000 0100 1010 0100 0000 0000 0011 0010 and i have my ishandlingurl bit turned on

addition	multiplication
we are not allowed use multiplication in our answer it must use repeated addition

6037628

with the other implementation it varies between min corepoolsize and max maxpoolsize

6037804

children	parent
besides containing properties for each datum in the node i ve included parent and children properties plus methods to add a child and to get a child

mouseup	mousedown
in my treeview i have different events for mousedown mouseup etc but when i do it fast enough the treeview expands collapses the treenode

6037885

comparator	comparable
a well-behaved comparable should implement an equals method that is consistent with its comparator method

6043871
getter	setter
by the way i would rather have a simple field with getter and setter and annotate the field instead

the naive algorithm for this would be to loop through the list of parent and then get the children for each parent in a different query either against the db or the dataset

6043923

in rsa you can choose a very short exponent e for encryption but the exponent d foe decryption will probably be 1024 bit long for an modulo with 1024bit

6044259
sorting	filtering
i would also think that even if i had this input on the top level grid that sorting the top level grid or filtering if there were filtering would destroy this input

6044259
sorting	filtering
meaning that the actual rows of the grid are literally sorted filtering paged etc. client side so that any client side changes such as adding text to a text box adding a css class to an object or in a more complex example adding a reference to a javascript object to an object via jquery would persist after sorting paging and filtering

6044320
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari still hide my link

i also want to check the width and height of the image

6044517

6044970
ant	maven
whether you do this through maven ant etc. doesn t matter

6045125
getter	setter
after a bit of research i found that magento generates all the getter and setter pragmatically through extensive use of the __call function which is called when a function that isn t defined is called

6045125
getter	setter
to modify functionality of a getter or setter simply define the function you want to modify in your rewrite of the class and this will be called before the __call essentially rewriting the default functionality in a roundabout way

6045138
folder	directory
what i did was i removed the reference deleted the dll from the bin folder copied the latest version of the dll to a new directory different from the location it was previously being referenced from and referenced it from the new directory

6045182
google-chrome	firefox
the basic approach is to build your blob however you want google-chrome webkit firefox has a responseblob on xmlhttprequest so you can use that create an iframe hidden display none then assign the src of the iframe to be the blob

6045196
ant	maven
but you can also compile swcs from the command line ant or maven

6045235
put	get
but i don t know how to get it to find out which folder to put the files in at build time

mp3	wav
you will probably need to wrap the mp3 function and the wav function together using inheritance and a simple wrapper function if you want one method to run both types of files

6045521
post	get
api teens with an http get would return a list of all teens and api teens with an http post would insert a new teen

6045521
put	get
to round out the crud operations using http get would return a specific teen with an http put would update a teen using the values passed in the request body and called with http delete would delete the specified teen

6045523
put	get
and put that in jtable but when i click i get error

6045560
min	max
i could divide the data into bins along the x axis and draw a vertical line between the min and max for each bin

post	get
you need to actually submit the form via an http post and get the value1 and value2 values from the post request body then use them in your jsp java code

6045814
fadein	hide
the obvious solution is to set display none as you have or to call hide before your call to fadein if you are sure the element is hidden

6045832
base-class	subclassing
i have also considered setting the base property in the subclassing constructor and set methods but there is no way for the subclassing property to be updated if the base-class s property is updated

6045839
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout stderr

6045846

in sql i can do a subquery with group by topic taking max post.date and then make an inner join with the post table to get the latest post record from each topic

6046371
folder	directory
the proper way to get the current directory is using a library that provides folder support

6046425
versioning	upgrade
if you re using a significantly older versioning of rails you may be exposing yourself to serious security vulnerabilities so if you can upgrade you really should even if it s just to another point release in the 2.0.x series

first of all md5 is a hash algorithm not an encryption algorithm.

6046512

6046735
post	get
ok when you send information to a .cfm page either it ll be by post or get

6046735

width	height
in your example length width and height aren t really separate objects and they re all related to the dimensions of the object you re describing in the table row

6053516
width	height
further length width and height only have one value at a given time

6053518

also in the solve in the for-loop you scan the arrays while a 0 is not found

6053749
for-loop	arrays
so include the arrays length also as a test of boundary condition in the for-loop

6053749
for-loop	loops
again in the inside for-loop you have iterated loops with to 9

6053787

the if statement you have around it checks whether a the specific parent page has children and only generates an unordered list if that is the case

6054061

6054897
base	fractions
the problem is that the floating point format represents fractions in base 2

6054897
rational-numbers	base
and the problem with that is that not every rational-numbers a number that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers actually has a finite representation in this base 2 format

6054897
base	fractions	rational-numbers	base	rational-numbers	fractions
although these values are always rational-numbers n 100 only .00 .25 .50 and .75 actually have exact representations in any number of digits of a base two fractions

6054906
serializable	deserialization
essentially on the dto layer you would a key to cdataset that you simply invent perhaps just an increasing integer storing the key instead of the item in m_refdata m_refparent and running fixup manually during serializable deserialization

getter	setter
you ll need individual getter and setter methods as well as one method that will update them all

6056202
implements	extends
since the only sane way to provide that is to make some classes or interfaces accessible you can just as well provide an interface or abstract class that they need to implements extends

6056223
implements	extends
alternatively you can go around by not forcing your users to extends a class or implements an interface but have them provide a function with a certain signature -- which then you can call via reflection

6056262

6059370
vb.net	vb6
very few problems like this get well-engineered exhaustive solutions that can be trusted not to regress functionality like commercial vb6 to vb.net converters that could justify spending enormous effort because of the sheer volume of potential customers out there and where you can pick up a phone or a lawyer if something goes wrong so if such a tool existed you should be extremely careful

6059385
post	get
if not you could pass the data as a get or post variable and then use this to generate the select box options on the new page

6059402
hide	show
i would approach this by adding a release flag to your releases and a condition see the conditions tab in the lower right when you re on the dialog s behavior node to hide or show the checkbox if isreleaseflags does or does not contain the appropriate flags

i ve tried icefaces and primefaces and finally chose primefaces due to zero-configuration start-up simplicity with the use of components and the good great integration with jquery

6059531
primefaces	icefaces
i only miss a good support for server-push in primefaces while this is well supported in icefaces

6059531
primefaces	icefaces
i also liked the one-jar dependency in primefaces while icefaces needs at least three jar libraries to work

6059534

you should definitely not use the tmp temp folder for this

6059556

6059756
post	get
if you are using the same name for each set of hidden inputs there is no way for to tell them apart when you pass them with post or get your name field should be unique the last entry is the only one that is going through because as each one is added its essentially overwriting the past entries

6059756
post	get
the easiest way to make each entry go to a unique page is using a get as mentioned by paul weber multiple forms with post work but it gets messy quick

6061204
width	height
my last resort is to fix the containing control s width which should dicate a fixed height but i would rather the text control span the full 100 of the page

children	parent
this makes it easier because you know that you can only have exactly one parent or no parent at all but each parent can have multiple children

6062218
integer	fractions	division	modulo
use integer division i 16 to get the number of whole units and use the modulo to get the fractions units

6062239
width	margin
the top is given no margin and the left and right are set automatically in relation to the page containing element based on the width of the div

6062246
width	margin
margin 0 auto is not the same thing -- if the div has a fixed width margin 0 auto creates a div that is horizontally centered in its container

if i m not mistaken the default http request method is always get unless it is specified as post

6062780
comparator	comparable
have a look at comparator or the interface comparable

6062780
comparator	comparable
basically every class that implements comparable gets a comparator ... -method

6062780
comparator	comparable
for the cases where you can t implement comparable or do not want to there is a class comparator which can be given to the sort methods sparately

6062836
free	malloc
the simple way to think about it is that every malloc must have a corresponding free

6062836
free	malloc
if you malloc a structure that holds pointers to other malloc ed items freeing that structure does not free the other items pointed to

6062850
google-chrome	firefox
did you try to inspect it with some sort of developer tool google-chrome - developer tools firefox - firebug ie8+ - developer tools

that way the post is linked in so when it is edited or removed changes are reflected on all blogs and you can also get a quick list of all blogs a post is in using something like

6062934
minimum	max
it can be shown that i believe first by konig that the minimum number of colours required is same as the max degree and polynomial time algorithms are known inspite of the general problem being np-complete

6062934
minimum	max
in fact the edge colouring corresponds to the vertex colouring of the line graph of a bipartite graph which is known to be a perfect graph and thus the minimum number of colours is the max degree

6062949
pop-up	dialog
also this still causes a print dialog to pop-up

6062992
background-position	background-size
the background-position and background-size did the trick

lingpipe	lda
you might also consider the agglomerative clustering implementations available in lingpipe see although i suspect an lda implementation might prove somewhat more reliable

6063041
int	chars
update since your names apparently can contain other chars than digits you ll need to check for valueerror and leave any values that can t be converted to int unchanged

what i would like to know is if it is a better practice to get a pointer to the view that needs to be reset and then reset the properties that need to be reset right there in the app delegate or should i post an nsnotification that the app is entering the background and have the view controller do it s cleanup within itself

6066263
vb6	vba
be sure to report your findings here i never use vb6 or vba anymore - your detailed findings could help others with a long-standing annoyance

6066263
vb6	vba
though i have never debugged such vb6 issues in great detail it would seem that the problems result from applications that install common controls vb6 com files templates and vba files and libraries that conflict with existing files and registry settings and registrations on the box or some per-user registry key or userprofile file may need to be added once per user allow the self-repair to complete once and see if the problem goes away

your code doesn t work because the showmoreinfo x function assumes that the x parameter will be a reference to one or the other of the radio buttons but then your text input s onchange onkeyup whatever event is calling the same function and passing in a reference to itself - this is why it only works when you click the radio buttons

6067459
onchange	onkeyup
so as has been said already you can use onkeyup instead of onchange

6067459
onchange	onkeyup
but remember that there are several ways that the user can change the value in an input without using the keyboard thus no onkeyup drag-and-drop onto the input drag out will change the focus but if you re not using onchange any more...

when you add items to your silverlight project they don t get copied out to the clientbin folder of the hosting site even on build regardless of copy to output directory settings because this only dictates what makes it to the current project s bin folder - you ll need to copy these manually or eventually use a post-build step that is

by adding trace statements into the setter code in the entityframework matter object i can observe the casenoteslog children being correctly placed into the parent matter

6070252

mef	prism
to modularize the application either prism or mef or both will be used

6070421
maven	m2e
the problem was that using m2e the maven dependency library is included in the war if built from eclipse or included if you are deploying the app to tomcat within eclipse and whilst the maven builds all still behave correctly m2e does not respect the scope of libraries so if you have provided scoped dependencies they will still be deployed so you can get these clashes

6070492
google-chrome	safari
it should be like in safari or google-chrome address bar in fact for example

6070609
google-chrome	firefox
i believe the error might be how firefox and google-chrome handles these multiple times included jquerys and it might be that google-chrome uses the older and firefox newer version

google-chrome	firefox
you should also tell what firefox version and google-chrome version you were using if the problem persists after deleting the extra jquerys

oncreate	onnewintent
in my case the problem was that i sometimes got two intents on application startup one in oncreate and then another in onnewintent

6071011
oncreate	onnewintent
the intent from oncreate had some really old data attached that should have been cleared according to the docs while the onnewintent had no extra data the correct case

6071011
oncreate	onnewintent
my solution was to record the last incoming intent assuming that the last intent is the correct one and then handle the intent in onresume since that method is called after oncreate and onnewintent

6071026
hide	show
it will hide this text select states and should show the list of the states

geshi	mediawiki
as you know the mediawiki extension lives in a directory named syntaxhighlight_geshi and contains a subdirectory geshi

6071140
geshi	mediawiki
if your patch is to the files not in geshi submit it to mediawiki s bugzilla

post	put
because when you use resources it will by default map the put protocol to the update action it will map the delete protocol to the destroy action and it will map the post protocol to the create action

my current solution is to have the product perform the serializable and the concretebuilder perform the deserialization then put both the product and it s concretebuilder declarations into the same source file

6071181

because a queue item can go invisible and then return to visibility later queue items don t necessary get processed in fifo order

6071193

6071193
width	height
you can also use layoutparams.fill_parent or layoutparams.wrap_content instead of height width

6071395
freeswitch	ivr
need to use the parsed vxml tags and interact with freeswitch to run ivr

6071403
min	max	minimum	max
since you seem to want the minimum value of id for xx the original values of id for yy and the maximum value of id for zz edit though i now see that there is but one entry for zz so it could be min instead of max or it might be unaggregated it is not clear that we can really generalize for you

outputstream	inputstream
i have a piece of code to read a inputstream and write the content into an outputstream

6071431

6072126
keydown	keyup
also you can consider some of the other jquery events like keyup keydown or keypress

int	chars
then why would even pass an int for the size to the same function you pass a chars to get set

6072157

6072962
ant	maven
originally one of the big advantages maven had over ant was the ease of dependency management but you are right in that ivy has now come along to fit that gap meaning that ant+ivy provides some similar functionality to maven in terms of build and dependency management

6072962
ant	maven
some people prefer ant as it is more flexible powerful for custom task builds where as some people prefer maven as its a lot more succinct and simpler

6072962
ant	pom.xml	ant	maven	maven	pom.xml
it will depend on the complexity of your builds if you have basic java builds then maven might be more suited as the pom.xml files maven build filds are pretty simple but if you need to do a lot of custom specific stuff you may well end up having ant scripts to perform also if you already have one system in place there isnt necessarily a huge advantage of swapping

textblock	itemscontrol
i want to replace the textblock bound to title with a listview listbox itemscontrol bound to the items in contacttypes

opensuse	linux
if you really want hard-core package management you ll always need a well-supported linux distro that provides tons of mingw packages like fedora i think or for sure opensuse

6074225

another approach is i don t have anything in the resources folder i download all images on app launch from the server and store them to documents directory and then on download the changed files at subsequent app launch

i think you are looking at your architecture the wrong way - in my opinion you should only have one submit button on a form after all a form is for submission values

6074943
innodb	myisam
another potential issue is if one machine is using mysql and you ve misconfigured to have myisam as the default storage engine rather than innodb or another engine that supports transactions

6074948
mouse	keyboard
as far as i know this is not possible with citrix xenserver newer versions of citrix xenserver have a gui if you want to use the screen mouse and keyboard whilst running vm s you either need to use the opensource version of xen from a linux distribution where a full version of linux is available to run the remote client software to connect to one of your vm s

6074948
vmware	virtualbox
personally i would not recommend this as citrix xen server is specifically cut down to provide a near bare metal experience for hosted virtual machines if this is for home use or testing purposes then i would suggest using a desktop virtualization technology instead such as virtualbox or similar offerings from vmware workstation or microsoft virtual pc depending on what it is that you want to achieve

inherited	subclassing
3 basicvisualizationserver and its subclassing visualizationviewer inherited from jcomponent which defines setbackground color

6075240
short	base
frameworks are really built to handle that automatically but short of using a framework you would be best off writing your own .htaccess rules if you are using linux or os x or try checking out how say cakephp handles url rewriting and base off of that

jflex	cup
both jflex and cup will generate java code and it is easy to get your tokens and nodes mixed-up

profiling	debugging
i have spend few hours debugging and profiling it tried many different ways to formulate the regexp but the results are always the same

6075491
temp	tmp
edit i noticed you wanted to write to temp not tmp to do this you can do tempfile.new tftpserver temp to specify a specific temporary directory

you can get the image width height by doing this

unbind	hoverintent
you also need to unbind click on over function from the hoverintent or it will cause a weird effect when you click the link

6075801
width	height
a width height of 95 means 95 of the parent element s width height not 95 of the image s original size

6075841

6075958
jobs	cron
of course because it s not your server there may be other users running cron jobs which you can t control.

6075959
udp	tcp
the fact you use a tcp connection instead of udp datagram can help you because of the three-way-handshake

6075959
udp	tcp
in fact most nat routers accept incoming tcp connection but not incoming udp packets

6075978
width	height
an easy solution would be to load just the div you want in a separate page use the jquery width and height functions on the div and then window.resizeto width height

6075992
post	get
you could pass back something from your server in the post get to say success then change window.location

migrate	upgrade	installation	upgrade
i just migrate upgrade from a windows 2003 perforce 2009.2 installation to a windows 2008 r2 2010.2 box and noted that after the upgrade the only issue that seems to present is the inability to create edit workspaces from the ui - because it tries to set the submitoptions parameter and throws

seeing that i spend way too many hours on this already i figured i d get some help and maybe some other people might profit from this post and the answers and save themselves some time

6076467

6076577
post	get
boost log v2 is simply what you get by checking out trunk according to what andrey says in the post you link

6076596
udp	tcp
one solution might be to loop sending the udp datagram and trying the tcp connection on the other socket until the connection is made or some other time limit or maximum retry limit is reached

6076619
submit	submission
maybe you should add a function that you d call upon submission on submit

6076675
serializable	deserialization
if what you are trying to do is create something and then store divergent types in a single generic list your serializable and deserialization just got more complex but it is still achievable

6076692
uiview	subviews
as to the error messages you are having with your image the fact is that uiimage is not a uiview so you cannot add it as a subviews but this is not what does not work here.

when you show hide a html element by pure jquery you have to reflect that as well in the jsf component tree on the server side to keep the both sides in sync

6076870

when continuing with jsf i d strongly recommend to just head to an ajax based component library such as richfaces primefaces or icefaces

vsto	add-in
i m fairly sure that s the name of your actual vsto project echoed through to the .manifest file for the add-in that is generated during the compile process.

6076929
onresume	onpause
you could make a common activity which just handles onresume and onpause in a certain way and then make every activity extend from that one instead of activity directly

6076949
iprincipal	iidentity
an iprincipal or iidentity will be initialized

6076982

6077118
width	height
set the width on instead of the and use line-height instead of height on the

6077228

int	boolean
my vb.net program will generate some lists that may contain boolean int strings or more lists

6077256
int	boolean
the lists become arrays and int boolean and strings are read alright with ruby

6077258
integer	unsigned
there is a uinttostr to help converting the uint64 to string but no way to convert a 64 bit integer to a unsigned value as a string

6077258
integer	unsigned
this is normally not a big deal but it can happen that a user needs to input a value as an unsigned integer which must be stored into the registry as a 64 bit unsigned integer value

actually the proper way to do this is when you first create a parentvm you iterate through the children of the passed-in parent creating a childvm for each then add those childvm objects to the parentvm s childvms property

6079311
children	parent
you then also have to listen for change-notification to the actual parent s children collection and update your childvms collection accordingly

6079323
vim	emacs
emacs+vimpulse is awesome but i think its right workflow is to liberally use emacs commands in combination to vim shortcuts

6079323
vim	emacs

if you do ungetc on a stream fp and then you do a getc again you get back the same character you just put in

6080383
tcplistener	tcpclient
network programming with the socket class is a lot easier in my opinion then using tcplistener and tcpclient

6082151
inherited	properties
since it inherited from tstream you could use the size properties to get the total size and position to get the current position

6082157
int	chars
then choose paths with either int or chars types accordingly

6082246
fgets	strncmp
while fgets buffer sizeof buffer stdin strncmp buffer stop 4

6082257
subtract	add
the reason you initially subtract the one and then add it on is because modulus works best on zero-based numbers while yours are one-based

6082257
subtract	add
the subtract add is to turn your scheme into zero-based before performing the modulus then turning it back into one-based afterwards

6082309
width	margin
traditionally you would set a width on the and then add margin 0 auto which centers the whole thing

6082354

6082640
addition	multiplication
negate is the unary negation and then there s the binary addition and multiplication operators

6082640
subtraction	addition
or can binary subtraction be implied because it could be made up combining addition and negation which we have

6082640
subtraction	addition
the implied subtraction from having addition and negation is a pretty handy feature too

6082654

when you are subclassing in objective-c you must 1 override the designated initializer 2 call the designated initializer of the superclass

6083124
width	height
i also checked simple nsopenglview examples and they also have the same problem so i am pretty certain that it s not a bug in my code but rather a problem with a view that has 100 width and height

6083126
put	get
then when you get back to an appropriate zoom level you can use setmap again to put the markercluster back on the map

6083126
post	get
hopefully this is all you need to get this done but if not post some of your code and maybe we can try to be more specific about exactly how to modify it to achieve this

6083136
put	get
get code from each line and create file put reference to opened file stream to dictionary with code as a key

6083139
xsl-fo	xslt
if the nl characters are present then your question is most probably only xsl-fo - related and not xslt one

6083166
cvs	svn
similiar to how github displays directories or how viewvc displays a directory in a svn cvs repo

6083310

rss	feed
iphone tutorial creating an rss feed reader

6083430
apache	nginx
i was testing my site with jmeter to see how hundred threads would affect site performance and tested it with apache and mod_php and nginx with fastcgi

6083430
apache	nginx
i noticed that the bottlebeck was always cpu in both apache and nginx

6083447
apache	nginx
the reason php is taking up more resources than your web servers is that php is doing a lot more work and does so in an intepreted language apache and nginx is both compiled into cpu instructions

6083464
tolower	toupper
so when you compare you need to compare using either tolower or toupper to make sure that your value is right

6083602
superclass	subclassing
when a method in subclassing has same name and arguments their types number and order as the method in superclass then the method in subclassing overrides the one in superclass

6083602
superclass	subclassing
now for the overriding to be allowed the return type of the method in subclassing must comply with that of the method in superclass

6083602
superclass	subclassing
this is possible only if the return type of the method in subclassing is covariant with that of the method in superclass

6083629
super	self
incidentally please don t do super self.__class__ self

6083629
inherited	subclassing
you should always explicitly name the current class when using super otherwise any subclassing that inherited from yours and in turn calls super will break

6083629
super	self
that s why you should always name the class you re in - in this case super somemodeladmin self

6083644
textarea	textbox
note however that making a selection like this will only check the length of the first textbox textarea it finds not each of them

6083680
sorting	grouping
i find the existing answers to be a bit lacking normally one would not process collections or boil their items down to a string at the very best you would do some dynamic manipulation using a collectionview sorting grouping but normally you use data templating to display the individual items which allows you to use all their properties

6083681
width	height
width and height seems fine

6083706
gif	png
if it s just a few images consider converting them to jpg png or gif manually depending on what type of image they contain

pandas	pytables
i haven t chosen the analysis package yet so if you have a recommendation and that recommendation is best used with either pytables or pandas or whatever please factor that in to your response

6083776
maven	pom.xml
you should invoke mvn package or right-click maven package and obtain a war file - the in the pom.xml must be war

6083792
children	parent
often you have a transformgroup then you can just change the order of its children if this is somehow not an option because some transform is inherited from a parent you can nullify prior transforms using their inverse in the case of a translation that should move the target back to the origin then you can rotate it in place and apply the original transform again

6083878
tablet	galaxy
for example imagine you have tablet for example galaxy tab in landscape orientation

6083888
trie	tree
the advantage a trie has is that depending upon implementation details the starting prefix letters can be shared a trie is also called a prefix tree after all

6083942
subtraction	addition
or can binary subtraction be implied because it could be made up combinding addition and negation which we have

6083971
int	chars
actually in most compilers chars literals are of type int so your actually storing an int form of a as a pointer to a memory location which can cause all sorts of memory corruption

6083981
post	get
i m developing a rails 3 app on ubuntu 11.04 and i get the following browser dialog box when i try to perform an ajax post request

6083995
joptionpane	jdialog
but joptionpane is a convenience class to create few commonly encountered jdialog s

6083995
joptionpane	jdialog
since the functionality you want is not directly supported by joptionpane s you should consider implementing it directly using jdialog s

6084000
put	get
for example i have a table that i m searching that contains hello but i put a search query in for hello and at the moment i won t get a result but i want to

6084048

javascript is sequential except if you use setinterval settimeout or make a request to a server with a callback or using onload

6084171
public	protected
if you need public read access and protected set access then simply use an automatic property

6084182
perl	tcl	lua	scheme
from the question i assume you want an embedded interpreter with which to directly script vim as one can do with perl python ruby tcl scheme and lua - so for example you could write vim functions in python in your .vimrc or so you can write a plugin in ruby

6084182
perl	tcl
look for references to languages in the makefile i see perl python python3 tcl ruby mzscheme lua

6084280
put	get
i am trying to integrate a rss parser into my irc bot and i ve found some simple code to do so online however if i put this code in the bot i get this

6084305
width	height
so basically the images are sitting vertically-aligned middle and text-aligned center and they have a maximum width of 176 and max height of 158 but they re cropped to maintain the original aspect ratio so the actual top corner of each image falls differently depending on which image it is

6084340
post	put
i want to send json with post put i don t know if it s the same think

6084362
width	height
the div s height and width are unknown

6084368
post	get
i can tamper with the input to change a value if i modify the submitted post get data

6084410
google-chrome	firefox
the order of alerts is as expected in firefox 3 firefox 3.6.17 ie 9 9.0.8112.16421 and google-chrome 11 11.0.696.68

6084424
int	chars
if it finds one it returns the chars position in source of the first chars in str as an int value otherwise it returns 0

6084492
sorting	filtering
the more queries requiring sorting or inequality filtering on multiple properties with multiple values the easier it is to get huge custom indexes

6084501
viewdidload	viewdidappear
on a side note viewdidappear doesn t seem to get called when doing this so it might be necessary to call it manually from viewdidload if you really need to use it but otherwise it works fine

6084516
hide	show
you should show the picture boxes and then set up a timer with code that will hide the picture boxes when the timer s tick event is triggered

6084521
int	chars
and the return type is int not chars or something

6084551
int	chars
not tested but you should be able to cast the byte int to a chars as well

6084555
ubuntu	debian
so the deployment process on a bare-bones ubuntu debian server would be

6084559
fadein	fadeout
so have created a couple of buttons fadein and fadeout to fade an image of a country in and out respectively

6084559
fadein	fadeout
the fadeout button by default is unclickable until fadein has been pressed and when the fadein button is pressed it fades the image in and then sets the visibility to 0 to stop it from disappearing again

6084589
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in ie8 ie9 firefox google-chrome and works a treat

6084617
int	chars
the simple formats of int and chars can slip through with just endian adjustments but floating point gets more complex

6084618
width	height
if you use css max-width and max-height instance of html width and height it don t lose aspect ratio

6084633
post	get
the general problem with capturing a post and turning it into a get is first that the query string on a get has a browser-dependent limited size and second that a post may be form multi-part what to do with the uploaded file becomes an issue

6084658
children	parent
parent can have multiple children

6084696
many-to-one	one-to-many
unlike normal sockets 0mq sockets can be many-to-one one-to-many

6084701
getter	setter
in fact by adding additional stuff into the getter setter you are actually increasing the risk that you will recreate something that is not an exact copy of the original

6084722
min	max
the command line takes 3 args startvalue min and max

6084722
min	max
the problem is the delta calculation when the buffer hits min or max it seems to be throwing it off by one

edit what i just want is to be able to show or hide some components in the main window which cause layout resizing without moving the windows to the initial position

6084992
google-chrome	firefox
the beauty of this is that the end user downloads the minimum amount of code needed to run the app and won t be bloated by having conditional code for ie when you are running google-chrome or firefox

6084992
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari are very similar and pretty closely written to specs so there s not a lot of special casing for them

6084992
google-chrome	safari
here s an example of the way a minor difference between google-chrome and safari is handled

and jquery has hide and show functions built in

6085448
post	get
you can always generate a random key like a234feg321de32 for the session store it into your db for each user and send it in the get or post variables then check it with a select query

6085464
hide	show
that can be signaled by a ready property on the view-model that can be used to hide and show parts of the user interface

x86	64bit
if your application uses 3rd party dlls that are not 64bit compatible you may need to do a release build in x86 mode

6085476
rar	zip
most users are going to prefer some form of automatic installer instead of a simple rar or zip

you ll not get it so easily the tftp protocol is relatively easy but put get is not stateless or at least if the file does not fit in a single packet that is something like 512 but some extensions allow a bigger packet

6086031
kerberos	ntlm
getting delegation to work can be a pain in the butt but you have to examine the spn you re using and make sure it s properly registered on the sql server plus mess around with iis to make sure that kerberos is enabled and actually working instead of it silently slipping back to ntlm

6086482
cpython	ironpython
cpython had the ability to access .net libraries using the python for .net see maintained at github but aside from ironpython there s never been a way to actually embed a python interpreter into a .net application

i think nobody cares but i have my opinion about getter and setter

6099363
getter	setter
getter and setter aren t evil

6099363
getter	setter
getter and setter can be declared in interface so you can replace one object by another - and it is what for encapsulation was invented

inherited	properties
you cannot use inherited because once entity is loaded from the data source ef will not know about inherited and because of that it will instantiate base type without your properties instead of derived type with your properties

by using it as the background and mentioning wrap_content for both the height and the width the final result looks more like a 45px x 45 px

ienumerable	iqueryable
you won t be forcing execution since both iqueryable and ienumerable are lazily evaluated and iqueryable implements ienumerable so no conversion whatsovever is neccessary

of course for simply pass-through type getter and setter you can use

6100771
post	get
one downside of jsonp however is you cannot make post requests only get requests which doesn t entirely jive with a restful approach but i still believe a restful architecture offers many benefits

onresume	onpause
so the idea is to start up the alarm service when our app goes in into onpause and cancel the service when our app goes into onresume

6101029
installation	upgrade

i m looking for a web-based java tool preferably one that will run in both weblogic and jboss that will allow controlled access to a particular database

6101200
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
the calling code will make just as much sense of an nullpointerexception as it would an illegalargumentexception but it ll be easier for the developer to debug and understand what went wrong if an nullpointerexception is thrown rather than your code attempting to execute some other unexpected contingency logic - which ultimately results in the application failing anyway

6111087

6111087

is this a better way for such kind of data data of scores here to keep all the data for all the 6 users in memory in nsarray or nsdictionary and find min and max in that array by a min-max algorithm

6111087
min	max
it should be taken from database by a query like where score 200 and where score 200 in short 2 database queries which return nearest min and max record each and not keeping all the data in memory

6111087
min	max
the point is would a db call be fast and efficient to find min and max or a search for min max in an array of all the records from db

6111087
min	max
frequency of finding min max for certain values are high

now fast-forward your changes back to master git merge dev on master

6112700
rss	feed
in my app i am trying to parse an rss feed url

6112700
rss	feed
but now i am worried about the other rss feed types such as rdf and autumn

6112700
rss	feed
now the problem is in my app when the user parses an rss feed url it will work fine but if the user is parsing an rdf feed or autumn feed i am sure that it will not get any content from those feed because the opening tags are different for all those feed

6112700
rss	feed
i have a logical idea of using switch case for each tag that they related to rss feed rdf feed and so but i dont know to implement it.

6112701
folder	dir
things like cmd c dir don t know why - and yes i do cmd c dir in cases i am in some kind of shared network folder with thousands of files and ls is significantly slower than dir

6112720
range	median
you could do it by computing the median mode and ignoring values outside of this range when computing your mean

6112722
free	malloc
when malloc crashes it s usually because you have previously stepped on the data it uses to manage itself and free

6112748
junit	testng
you can use rest assured which makes it very easy to test and validate rest services in java from junit or testng

6112758
for-loop	loops
this block of code is in a for-loop and the i j left right and value variables are altered every loops

6112769
width	height
you have to preload the image to get the width and height of the image

6112802
solaris	aix
i am interested in the case of linux hp-ux solaris and aix

6112810
versioning	upgrade
check which versioning of svn you are using with git svn --version - perhaps an upgrade will help

6112829
folder	directory
let us have folder rootfolder containing a lot of files and directory

6112829
folder	directory
i would like to create a folder rootfolder2 copying the directory tree structure of rootfolder but containing only the folder dirname with their content

6112836
width	font-size
adjust font-size value by not simply incrementing decrementing but rather by calculating width difference between your invisible and original div

6112842
hash	md5
what you can do is to send hash like md5 of the uuid and use this for your catalog names

6112857
button	checkbox
when i expose this class in my gui i have two radio button called radiobuttona and radiobuttonb which let the user pick between groups a and b and i have two checkbox to let the user change a1 a2 and b1 b2 respectively depending on which radiobutton ischecked

6112860
onresume	onpause
there are some small bugs regarding if the bt is not opened before entering the mobile app it get stuck too much in a while and for those who want to use this client server you should take a look at onpause onresume ondestroy functions

6112893
implements	extends
eg if i have an object that extends sprite and implements mungable i would like to do something like -

6112919
int	double
it is easily possible for a string int float or double etc because they all have a string representation

6112923
children	parent
i m trying to scale a container parent movie clip up so that i effectively zoom in to a point referenced by one of its children

6112925
avaudioplayer	mpmediaitem
i m trying to convert an mpmediaitem to nsdata object so i can play it with avaudioplayer

6112977
lseek	posix
the position or pointer is set in posix by the lseek function and is read by the tell function

6112981
put	get
the purpose of dispose isn t to get rid of any tangible entity but rather to allow an object to put its affairs in order

6112983
put	get
3 that spawned thread then get put

6112998
hide	show
i would like to give the user the option like in active directory users and computers where you can show hide certain advanced objects

6113002
rss	feed
that way if one changes -- eg suppose the format of the rdf feed changes -- you don t have to worry about breaking the rss autumn etc feed reading when updating it

6113017
hide	show
i want to use jquery to show and hide the sub-nav-conatiner div

6113017
hide	show
the only trouble is my jquery show and hide all submenus - i want to display just one

6113021
put	get
with an ajax call you can get the contents of an url which can be put in the div using javascript

6113035
pop-up	dialog
a spinner location populated from the sqlite table location which pops an edittext dialog on a long touch and which saves the edittext valie to the location table on dismissing the pop-up dialog

6113041
post	get
to get an idea here s a quote by jamie zawinski which appears in the post linked to above

6113063
mouseover	mouseleave
you can simplify the code however - no need for separate mouseover and mouseleave handlers

6113103
free	malloc
if i get rid of the free functions the malloc no longer fails

6113124
implements	extends
as others suggested you can create a type say mungablesprite that extends sprite and implements mungable and then refer to that type

6113173
free	malloc
if your struct had pointer fields that you allocated with malloc you d need to free them separately before freeing the struct itself

6113185
free	malloc
what you describe sounds like typical behavior if you free something that was not not created using malloc

6113185
free	malloc
you are basically trashing the memory allocation lists - when malloc tries to find some free memory it crashes

6113242
put	get
but the only place you can sensibly put this without analysing the code behaviour in some details - in which case you would know what resources you have open is at the end of the script - which is where the connections get closed anyway

6113345
children	parent
another possibility would be to add a column to the parent table oldestchild_fk and then join in that row from the children table

6113374
public	protected
inheritance flows down from the parent to the child so the child can access public protected or package private methods on the parent depending on the declared packages of classa and classb

6113386
min	max
is my setup for min max and target an accurate type of setup i am looking for

6113410
rss	feed
i am currently using the rss feed for search which gives me my description field back

6113410
rss	feed
the url for the search rss feed and its querystring parameters is as follows s scope u start 1

6113490
for-loop	loops
loops through an implicit cursor a for-loop implicitly defines opens closes the cursor

6113508
getter	setter
analysing your includes all the time and eliminating the ones that are not needed anymore for example i ve defined a private float variable of a class made a constructor and all the setter and getter automatically just by pressing an option in a menu when i ve executed the constructor with a number of precision too high for a float type it automatically suggested changing the private type to double and done all the changes including return types etc

6113513
getter	setter
however the .net team noticed that a lot of getter setter are basically just that

6113554
textblock	itemscontrol
the user control has a scrollviewer with an itemscontrol and a textblock

6113554
textblock	itemscontrol
the visibility of the itemscontrol and textblock is toggled by the mousedown eventhandler so at a time only one of them is visible

6113554
textblock	itemscontrol
the eventhandler is invoked correctly when i click the textblock but not in the itemscontrol

6113557
accessor	properties
changing a field which is what your first declaration is to a properties is a breaking change so specifying accessor in advance is a small investment in the future

6113617
for-loop	loops
reading a bit more in pil i see that there are more components used in the for-loop the invariant loops state and the current value of the control variable which are passed to the iterator function in each call

6113634
width	height
you ll have to do things with the or iframe width height to get it to work

6113650
multiplying	add
also if you think that you can t use class because li already have any class you are wrong because yo can add multiplying classes to any element

6113668
pycharm	komodo
i know there are ides available like komodo pycharm but i want to use that ide which link with my remote vps

6113718
ubuntu	debian
i am looking for instructions on setting up js lint to work with moo tools from debian ubuntu command line. br

6113727
google-chrome	firefox
for instance this persepctive demo will draw without such white lines in google-chrome but will have the ugly white lines in firefox because the two browsers decided to do anti-aliasing differently

6113727
google-chrome	firefox
because of this some things look nice in google-chrome and not firefox and vice versa

6113776
children	parent
then no matter what the parent will receive notification before it s children

6113785
superclass	subclassing
these relations naturally arise when you impose restrictions on what you can handle--then if a subclassing means that the method can handle less acts as a superclass of since can handle everything that the subclassing can handle and more

6113792
union	distinct
you don t need the distinct keyword because union returns only the unique values from the combined record sets

6113803
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox or google-chrome or other browsers i dont have this problem but in ie not working

6113892
inherited	properties
you can tailor that map manually adding or removing properties after all it s just code and create you own more complex ui map in fact with effort you can even make the maps inherited from other maps more a la asp.net master page

6113900
inline	inlining
in practice inline styles work but it s not as simple as just inlining everything and it will work

6113905
hide	show
it just hide them when it show you the diff

6113952
memcached	apc
using sessions apc memcached cookies etc does not guarantee that you will be able to hold the limit

6113952
memcached	apc
if you use apc or memcached or any other system designed for caching your memory limit might run out and the key you stored will vanish thus allowing the user 25 new searches

6113967
width	height
result for mystring1 width 70 height 28

6113967
width	height
result for mystring2 width 70 height 14

6114038
getter	setter
you can customize the setter and the getter by overriding the methods and specific some certain conditions for them

6114064
super	self
super connection self

6114066
width	margin
margin which controls column width

6114085
control-structure	break
e.g. break with labels as in java or even a more generic goto. continue does not seem more special than other control-structure mechanisms except that it is present in more languages

6114088
int	chars
unsigned chars converted to an int

6114088
int	chars
this means a chars value read via getchar can never be equal to an signed int of -1

6114122
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i have created a simple slider to display two messages so one displays and the slides over to display the second one but it is not working in ie7 i have tried the code in ie8 google-chrome firefox and opera and it works

6114168
mouseleave	mouseenter
implementing the mouseenter mouseleave improves it somewhat but it does still not feel perfect

6114182
hide	show
looks good to me you could also use the built in show and hide functions which might make your code more readable

6114201
hide	show
the only thing i would change is to use show and hide instead of the css call

6114276
addclass	removeclass
you can make use of jquery s addclass and removeclass to add and remove classes

6114291
hide	show
second use classes or the show hide methods

6114360
pop-up	dialog
internet explorer in compatibility mode gets the data from the server in an ajax callback method and pop-up a dialog if i want to save the data or open

6114385
rspec	capybara
using rspec and capybara i m trying to test a failing validation for a form where a required input is not filled in so it fails

6114390
keydown	keyup
the alert will still occur if you intercept keycode 13 on keyup or keydown

6114395
uiview	calayer
this is mostly because uiview acts as high-level wrapper for calayer so when you eg

6114449
curb	libcurl	curb	httparty
besides ruby s own built-in net http there are libraries such as httparty and curb which is a wrapper for libcurl

6114455
post	get
i was using httpget with 100 success but now trying to switch to httppost as the rest api i m using wants post parameters rather than get

6114469
put	get
to get a tree of maximal height you ll put as few nodes in each level as possible

6114532
folder	directory
i am creating directory and writing files to a shared folder within my web application that is being hosted on windows server 2008

6114532
folder	directory
i right clicked the shared folder that i m creating directory in and writing to and clicked on the security tab

6114535
min	max
so the max is 2 min is 0 leaves

6114556
innodb	myisam
but if i change the table from innodb to myisam everything works fine

6114618
imperative	declarative
in such cases imperative .add is awkward because the value is conceptually declarative even though it s technically mutable imperative

6114626
post	get
i had to do a lot of reading between multiple articles to get the details i was looking for from my original post

6114626
ssl	https
when using a wshttpbinding i will still need to secure the transport with a ssl certificate which i had done as mentioned previously and exposed the binding via https

6114645
onresume	onpause
be sure to save any information you want in your onpause method and check that information in onresume

6114648
move	drag
basically i want to drag an object sprite along a pre-defined curved path not just move it but drag it

6114659
trac	bugzilla
i want to write a mylyn connector for the bug repository my team uses i was able to set the workspace and activate a couple of small things by using the web resources and bugzilla and trac code

6114667
touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchescancelled	touchesended
in objective-c cocoa i was under the impression that every touchesbegan call must have a corresponding touchesended or touchescancelled call but this is not the case when a uinavigationcontroller pushes a new view controller

6114682
min	max
you could use two columns min and max

6114711
calloc	malloc
all i had to do was use calloc instead of malloc to allocate memory for the openal buffer

6114769
getter	setter
it only tells the compiler to generate the getter and setter methods according to the options used in your property declaration

6114792
width	height
and style the height and width as you like...then use jquery to handle the hover event..

6114833
profiling	benchmarking
don t optimize without profiling and benchmarking to verify that what you are changing is actually a bottleneck and that you can measure the positve or negative impact of your changes

6114833
spaces	delimiter
here is a quick benchmark comparing a bufferedinputstream reading the same set of binary numbers versus a scanner backed by a bufferedreader reading the same set of numbers as text representations with a spaces delimiter

6114873
postgresql	mysql
i have tried a couple of things that i think would have worked in mysql but i can t get it right for postgresql

6114903
dictionary	map
what s more you ll be able to give it a java map as if it were a python dictionary vals in your code

6114910
floor	sqrt
the foreach function is thus ineffective - the cycle should end at floor sqrt number

6114912
min	max
my thoughts where i need to make min max sigma all members and just hide them from the grid if they aren t used

6114916
button	checkbox
but what about in the case of radio button or checkbox where multiple form fields have the same name

6114936
hide	show
you could also try removing tinymce from the textarea before you hide the container and then bring it back after you show

6114942
squash	merge	squash	branch
in this case if you do merge external branch it would be best to avoid squash their commits

6114951
button	checkbox
basically if the case were to arise where there are multiple radio button checkbox with the same name they should be easily provided to you under the form using the same schema you re using already

6114972
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome firefox and ie8

6114997
width	height
turns out that when in landscape on the ipad it switches up the origin x is now y and width is now height

6114999
accessor	properties
a better approach is to create state-aware properties accessor like the following

6115006
getter	setter
getter and setter

6115028
pbkdf2	salt
that is why salt and a number of iterations is used on most protocols like pbkdf2

6115031
hash	md5
both of them are cryptographic hash functions that operate 1-way only the main difference being that md5 output size is 128 bits whereas sha-1 is 160 bits

6115034
post	get
i tried any combination of post get method with canvas_page script.php canvas_url script.php script.php action and this is only thing that actually works

6115050
postgresql	greenplum
1 greenplum is not vanilla postgresql but it is similar

6115064
profiler	yourkit
you might be able to gain some insight into what actually happens by running your program under a memory profiler such as yourkit

6115069
capitalization	uppercase
according to your code it should be user.id uppercase not lower case - capitalization matters

6115080
getter	setter
unless you are doing validation on the input there s no point using getter setter here in my opinion

6115080
getter	setter
make the properties public and override the getter setter for invalid properties using magic methods

6115093
int	chars
moreover in this trivial case direct assignment even if a1 was explicitly declared as an int constant most compilers would not issue a warning if they could see that the constant is in range of the target type unsigned chars

6115096
post	get
here s my problem for some reason the server interprets the post request as a get and for this reason the php input is always empty

6115126
subclipse	egit
if you are using the subclipse svn or egit git plugins you may try to create a new project and checkout your code via the git subclipse wizard

6115135
width	height
when i use the code i have written below it only shows the background picture for the length of the text logo link and it has not height to it even though i specify the width and height to be 334 by 67 pixels in the style tage below

6115137
put	get
in the youtube case all you have to do is get the video id of the url and put this in the follow url

6115162
salt	md5
for example if a user s pass is 123456 only a retard would use this but it s an example if you add a salt of salt to it so it becomes 123456salt the md5 of this would be 207acd61a3c1bd506d7e9a4535359f8a

6115168
hide	show
i took a copy of the latest release of an mvc2 project i have been working on and started playing around with how to make a wizard with jquery by using hide and show

6115178
mp4	h.264
in particular they both rely on segmented h.264 mp4 files

6115243
hide	show
if you re trying to show hide the checkbox you could do this

6115271
cos	sin
r cos beta cos alpha l + r cos beta sin alpha m + r sin beta n

6115279
versioning	upgrade
it appears as if the database will always grow on the thunderbolt when i upgrade the database versioning

6115304
ienumerable	icollection
unless you can change the method so that it takes icollection ienumerable or their generic variants you have to pass an instance of microsoft.visualbasic.collection to that method

6115320
folder	directory
first check the allow output folder for source folder box then modify the individual output folder elements under each source directory

6115325
addclass	removeclass
should i use addclass and removeclass

6115342
google-chrome	firefox
i tested on google-chrome and firefox and after i edit and come to edit again it s done a new json call and the new values are there different from i.e

6115345
post	get
i already have the connection established and i can send small pieces of data with post and get using an urlbuilder to fetch all fields but now i want to send all data from the server to my android app

6115350
hash	md5
i have a column of type char 32 where i want to store an md5 hash key

6115355
addclass	removeclass
yes you should use addclass and removeclass to change the styling

6115391
post	get
check that your phone is actually sending a post then check if your server is somehow rewriting redirecting the request into a get instead

6115407
hex	binary
two common options are to encode the raw binary data as hex - which it looks like you re doing in the second case - or to use base64

6115408
hash	md5
i d guess that your hashkey sql function is not hex encoding the md5 hash rather it s just returning the ascii characters representing the hash

6115416
mouseleave	mouseenter
the typical way to do this is to set up a timer to close the submenu on the parent s mouseleave event but cancel the timer if you mouseenter on the submenu

6115419
hide	show
then move all of the positioning css and jquery stuff to show hide position the div instead

6115437
hex	binary
storing the binary data is twice as space efficient than storing it as hex

6115439
hash	salt
always hash your passwords with a salt key

6115439
hash	salt
the purpose of a salt password is that the hacker who gained access to your database cannot simply compare the hash with a known list of hash that correspond to common passwords

6115439
hash	salt
by using a unique salt per password you guarantee that each hash in the database is different even if they use the same password

6115439
hash	salt
here s a sample hash with a 48-bit salt and sha-256

6115538
addclass	removeclass
instead you should use addclass and removeclass and control the styles in your static css

6115567
textview	imageview
i have the following imageview and textview

6115718
google-chrome	firefox
i have this code which works nice in google-chrome and firefox but on ie only the second background image appears.

6115720
hide	show
i would recommend not removing adding classes for show hide just use jquery s and

6115728
ant	maven
for now even if sonar 2.6 may use ant or a simple command line to trigger the analysis on a java project maven is mandatory for a .net project

6115799
serializable	deserialization
also this assumes completely out-of-the-box serializable deserialization

6115833
put	get
if i take this code and put it in a method i can t get it visible

6115842
min	max
then you can easily calculate the bounding box by computing the min and max x and y for all of these points

6115849
client-side	server-side
the fix is simply to make sure it is enabled server-side the default then disable it see blow or enable it see above using client-side code

6115857
actualheight	actualwidth
in each iteration of the loop get the item s canvas position upper left and add actualwidth actualheight to get lower right point

6115857
min	max
keep track of min and max upper left and lower right to get your bounding box

6115863
profiling	instrumentation
the visual studio profiling has two modes of operation sampling and instrumentation

6115882
getter	setter	accessor	properties
properties are atomic by default so that synthesized accessor provide robust access to properties in a multithreaded environmentâ that is the value returned from the getter or set via the setter is always fully retrieved or set regardless of what other threads are executing concurrently

6115882
accessor	properties
if you specify retain or copy and do not specify nonatomic then in a reference-counted environment a synthesized get accessor for an object properties uses a lock and retains and autoreleases the returned valueâ the implementation will be similar to the following

6115882
accessor	properties
if you specify nonatomic a synthesized accessor for an object properties simply returns the value directly

6115908
for-loop	loops
after the for-loop this means loops does nothing

6115973
rss	feed
as you can see from the code it goes off and does a pull from an rss feed in an asynctask

6116020
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
so you can always throw a subclass of runtimeexception unchecked-exception

6116023
mechanize	scraperwiki
i m trying to scrape uk food ratings agency data aspx seach results pages e. g using mechanize python on scraperwiki but coming up with a problem when trying to follow next page links which have the form

6116030
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
so nullpointerexception and numberformatexception are both runtimeexception catching a nullpointerexception should replaced with a graceful null-check while i recommend catching a numberformatexception explicitly to avoid possible introduction of error prone code

6116049
getter	setter
besides that the property must have a getter and setter to get the attribute working

6116053
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if they re using google-chrome safari use websql if they re using firefox or internet explorer use indexeddb

6116055
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception are subclasses of runtimeexception

6116104
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
this is because it is a subclass of illegalargumentexception which is a subclass of runtimeexception

6116104
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
2 runtimeexception is the root of all unchecked-exception

6116121
nsurlconnection	nsoperation	nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
check the docs for nsoperationqueue nsoperation and nsurlconnection

6116126
post	put
i ll edit this with more detail if when you update the post but what i would do is put the dialog and buttons in a container div with relative positioning and use absolute positioning to place the buttons

6116236
post	get
i know this is not a strictly programming questions but please don t delete this post at least until i get a

6116248
portrait	landscape
but if i launch in landscape i get an error and my interface orientation seems still to be portrait while the simulator is in landscape mode

6116248
portrait	landscape
the log says it is in landscape mode if i launch in landscape but if i change tab to another it looks terrible because the view is displayed in portrait mode instead

6116248
portrait	landscape
on change back to the start-view where i asked for orientationâ the log displays portrait â but the simulator is still landscape

6116310
translation	localization
means i ll just need to translation the content of the string and not to create new one with the same key for each localization file

6116321
touchesbegan	touchesended
why i use 2 timers because i want to handle scrolling in the main view - void touchesbegan and - void touchesended and scrolling on the scrollview uiscrollview delegate

6116369
rsa	aes
then encrypt the aes key using rsa keys from a machine certificate x509certficate2 in c#

6116378
textview	imageview
i retrieve my cursor inflate my imageview and textview pull the data

6116378
textview	imageview
from the cursor and populate the textview and imageview

6116386
put	get
then i tried to put all rooms also in an array and then iterate the array for the wanted room - but here i get the problem every room is basically connected to every other room at least with some other rooms betwenn it

6116410
width	height
get the width height of the image after it s loaded and use that to apply css etc

6116439
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
rendering 500 rows on one page is a bad idea no matter what browser you are using even though it might work better in safari firefox and google-chrome compared to ie

6116488
putty	winscp
you could also embed the putty source code i believe winscp does this

interpreted-language	compiled-language
in higher level languages say javascript it s usually a win to delegate string processing down to a regular expression because there s so much overhead even doing a simple loop in an interpreted-language but the same reasoning doesn t apply to compiled-language like c++

6116740
children	parent
nodes have references to both parent if they exist and references to all children if they exist so traversal up the tree and down the tree is fair game

so by multiplying the double value with 1e6 degrees become microdegree and so the calculation can be done with int math without loosing too much resolution

pop-up	dialog
the idea is that if you click no the confirmation dialog will close but the pop-up won t since the user has indicated they don t want to discard those changes

6127312
pop-up	dialog
the confirmation dialog also pop-up but it isn t much use since the pop-up is already gone

6127312
pop-up	dialog
the reason this happens is that the handlers for closing the pop-up and showing the confirmation dialog are both attached as click handlers to the cancel button

6127312
pop-up	dialog
my idea for fixing this was to simply add the handler that closes the pop-up to a different event that would only be fired when the correct option is selected in the confirmation dialog

6127783
width	height
for an example of a setter being used if you ve ever used windows forms and updated a control s height or width property you re using a setter

6127795
getter	setter
actually the error you mention is not related to the getter and setter concept it s because after creating your class you need to create an object before using its members

width	height
with everything set to fill i expect that when i add my usercontrol to the panel it will take on the appropriate width and height and pass that info to the child controls labels inside of my usercontrol

6129265
width	height
when i do things like this my objects are created with the full width height that i expect

6129265
width	height
this particular user control is the last to load into the panels from that load gui routine so it does not make sense that the parent panel width height would not be known yet

6129274
children	parent
the key is to not map the children entities back to the parent entity model from the view model so that i can deal with them individually

6129324
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
in contrast if you already have a uinavigationbar initialized from a nib which also contains a view you can just add your uinavigationitem to the topitem property of your uinavigationbar

6129337
user-controls	elementhost
i added a winforms form with an elementhost to it that in turn hosted a user-controls with a treeview but that still worked as it should so to me it really looks like the host com application is in some way interfering with the events raised on the treeview and treeviewitems

6130037
subtraction	addition
if one of the numbers is a constant your compiler might optimize by doing some combination of bit shifts and subtractions mostly for powers of two since hardware div mod is slower than addition or subtraction but on modern processors the latency already only a few nanoseconds is hidden by tons of other performance tricks so you needn t worry about it

6130037
subtraction	modulo	division	subtraction	division	modulo
no hardware computes modulo by repeated division some old processors did division by repeated bit shifts and subtraction but they still used specialized hardware for this so it s still faster to have the hardware do it than to try to emulate it in software

6130049
ant	maven
its often better to build and validate the .war independently with ant or maven then deploy manually or with a script

6130109
put	get
its impossible to trace with a product read normal released build i would put the code through yourkit and see what s happening hotspot will try to get the best possible optimisation at all times

6130654
viewdidappear	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
i ve been stumbling over the same problem and with some diagnostic work i discovered that the view s bounds and frame do not accurately reflect the landscape orientation in viewdidload when the device is held in landscape when the view controller is pushed onto the stack but do so correctly in viewwillappear and viewdidappear

6130654
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i just moved my code that needed the dimensions of the frame bounds from viewdidload to viewwillappear and it worked properly

6130693
filtering	grouping
it fill first filtering out all non-contractors and then grouping the remainder

6130904
google-chrome	firefox
this problem occurs in google-chrome and firefox

6130915
width	margin
if you know the ratios you can just derive the width of the margin that will be placed to the side of the image

6130915
width	height
similarly you can figure out the height if the width are equal except that you have to use the inverse of the ratio between the ratios as the width is inversely proportional the the ratio

6130915
width	height
once you have the width or height of the bitmap getting the space to the side is simple it is just half the difference between the bitmap and imageview width or height

6130937

important part was the if clause mouseenter mouseleave is just

6131052
mouseover	mouseout
mouseover mouseout but checking if you re targeting the right element and if

6131081
put	get
the time complexity should be o n because the hashmap operations put get and keyset are o 1

6131084

ive not got around to safari yet but im guessing its mostly similar to how google-chrome would display it

6131533
nunit	mspec	mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mspec
i would advise against driving mspec with data use nunit or mbunit if you need row tests or combinatorial tests and mspec when you describe behavior

6131533
nunit	mspec
instead of starting with a blank sheet of paper think nunit s test methods mspec gives you a template establish because it that you can build your specifications around

6131575
folder	directory
which creates a new folder with name project in the current directory

6131580
implements	extends
the above code will return all matched bad words you can further extends it to implements your own logic like replacing the bad words etc

6131595
nsstring	nsdata
since nobody was able to answer i continued my research and discovered a simple but fatal detail in the documentation of nsdata the description method which is called when trying to print the nsdate as a nsstring by default uses a default nslocale to determine the format and timezone

6131661
width	height
i want to stack divs with different height but same width within a div container

you can always use height and width on a jquery element

6131720
width	height
the first row of the table will contain the headings for example height and width but i need these to be buttons

6131720
width	height
the next rows in the table will just contain text values underneath their height and width headings and these are populated using a class that extends baseadapter

6131720
width	height
then my baseadapter inflates the following xml in order to assign the height and width to fill in all the row values inside the overridden getview method

6131768
postgresql	mysql
difference between postgresql and mysql

6131794

its memory is byte-addressible so i m using a chars array but i need to read write unaligned 32-bit int

6131854
pop-up	dialog
the next step would be to explain what a page map does what is it for and what problems it solves back buttons and pop-up dialog for example

6131878
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
if you have a sorteddictionary or sortedlist you can use .first or for sortedlist otherwise you could do

6131878
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
.first will probably have o 1 time for a sortedlist and o log n for sorteddictionary

6131878
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
insertion and removal will be o log n time for sorteddictionary and may be up to o n for sortedlist

6131885
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sortedlist and sorteddictionary are implemented internally as binary search trees and could ideally give you o log n performance for a min requires walking the tree but not enumerating the whole list

6131947
onclick	onfocus
onclick onfocus and similar possible callbacks are methods in the this context

6131961
google-chrome	firefox
the code works fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

6131981

from what you describe i would recommend using a listview instead of a gridview

6132022

if i put or or were the stars are i get this error

6132058
post	get
no matter which connection string i use i have checked the other post on this topic i continue to get table is not in the correct format error

6132071
cpu	affinity

post	get
also you can get number of post in stackoverflow for each of your tasks like zip files

6132481
google-chrome	firefox

6132481
keydown	keyup
such as keydown keyup keypress in your case ndash

6132542
post	get
i think you will have to post parts of your web.xml file to get this solved but if you are getting two instances of the same bean in the same application then it by definition is not application scoped

6132545
mouseleave	mouseenter
instead of using the .hover method try using separate event handlers for mouseenter and mouseleave

6132545
mouseleave	mouseenter
the mouseenter would only be attached to the mnav buttons while the mouseleave would be attached to both the mnav button and the snav div

6132620

i downloaded the latest resource editor from your blog site and i defined the background and border selected versions of the component tablecell but the extra-rectangle is always shown in runtime when i click on a last column table cells

6138156
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested it successfully with ie6 firefox google-chrome and opera

6138203
children	parent
which means if a parent creates a job object for a child all that child s children cannot themselves use job objects which is a severe limitation imho like a file system that only allows one level of sub directories

6138212
width	height
here are 3 functions i use frequently to get the text width height and adjust the size to the container s width

6138212
width	height
gettextheight width will return the actual height of the wrapped text contained in the initiator with a certain specified width

6138230
implements	extends
i implements my custom tabel model extends abstracttablemodel

6138242
onresume	onpause
or you can implement a locationlistener in a separate class and use it in every activity turning it on onresume and shutting down onpause

6138256

6138291
cas	shibboleth
two possible sso technologies are shibboleth and jasig cas

i am trying to resize the screen elements mainly div tags left top width height by giving all the values in age

6138403
width	height
i compute width from actual px screen width 100 and height by px screen height 100

6138403
width	height
now since both height and width are constraint against screen widht and height if the aspect ratio remains same with any resolution it works

6138403
width	height
but problem comes when say the width remains the same and height changes like by decreasing height it changes the height and elements width remains the same

i m not sure what you mean by control the size - you could set an explicit height and width or use percentages to achieve a fluid layout

6138538
width	height
in interface builder if you are using it just drag-drop a uitableview to your uiview and adjust its width height and y position in the inspector

6138552
unix	bsd
the hosts file format is the same as the format for host tables in the version 4.3 berkeley software distribution bsd unix etc hosts file

6138553
exponent	modulo
found the solution but not sure yet if its the right solution coz i still have to get the privatekey and decrypt the file but for now i was able to encrypt it using the supplied publickey as the modulo but i donâ t have the exponent and i just used some common number â œ65537â as the exponent

6138553
exponent	modulo
now this logic needs the modulo and exponent

6138570
width	height
and you can control the page size by using width and height

6138570
width	height

6138691
jar	war
and then inherit that pom project by your jar war projects like this

6138713
children	parent
but beware that when you later want to get parent objects from the database using a query the resulting collection will contain several copies of each parent depending on the number of children think about how many rows an sql join returns... so in most cases it s not very useful

6138732
hide	show
i make an easy div hover show and hide introduce words with jquery in the default code

6138737

nsurlcache	uiwebview
after setting up a small test project without a uiwebview the nsurlcache sharedurlcache memorycapacity returns the expected 10000000 instead of 0

6138856
getter	setter
now instead of passing around an instance of car you can either pass around mycar instance which has getter and setter or a reference to icar which will let you control exactly what you would like to expose for example you could just expose the getter

6138863
public	protected
there are varying levels of access from private to protected to public

6138878

getter	setter
they won t see those getter and setter

for-loop	arrays
i am not sure what you mean by how to access the direc folder direc is a struct arrays and you are already accessing it by direc index .fieldname as intended but i think the main problem is that in the for-loop every iteration overwrites the previous content of x so what you get in the end is the content of the last read file

selecteditem	selectedindex
well i m assuming your datarow object contains the selectedindex or selecteditem of whatever is selected in column1 so you can base your column2 datasource off that value

6139792
accessor	properties
there are few changes in existing behavior but mainly es5 adds new native objects object.create array.prototype.map string.prototype.trim etc. and standardizes some of the existing de-facto features from ubiquitous line terminators in string literals properties access on strings and indirect eval behavior to less popular accessor and array string extensions

i see in the blog post that he is using them to get a list of integers i presume primary keys so that he can use them in a different query but this is kind of nebulous in the way it is functioning and the why

6140390
x86	64bit
one way you can test for a 64bit system without getting too technical is to check for the c program files x86 directory

6140390
x86	64bit
this directory does also exist on 64bit systems so the absence of the c program files x86 tells you it s 32-bit

6140475
opera	google-chrome
msie and opera interpret these sizes the same but note that gecko browsers and google-chrome interpret heading 6 as 11 pixels instead of 10 pixels font size 1 and heading 3 as 19 pixels instead of 18 pixels font size 4 though it s difficult to tell the difference even in a direct comparison and impossible in use

here s some code that i updated to get it to work if there are less than two tags but this will cause all tags to be appended to the next post in the each

6140589
setcontentview	findviewbyid	oncreate	setcontentview	oncreate	findviewbyid

nhibernate	massive
now you don t have a list of brand s but instead a list of nameidentitypair s and nhibernate will have only issued a sql statement like select b.identity b.name from dbo.brand b to obtain this projection as opposed to a massive sql statement that grabs everything necessary to hydrate a brand object select b.identity b.name b.description from dbo.brand b left join dbo.vendor v ..

linkedhashmap keys are similar to arraylist or arrays in the way they are stored in the order that they are inserted

6140951
freebsd	linux
by the way i have no problems running rails3 with jruby 1.6.2 in 1.9 compatibility mode on freebsd and i reckon it might be ok on linux as well

6140955
division	modulo
it is a hybrid of two data structures a linkedlist where insertion order is preserved by adding elements to the end of a list of nodes which have access to their immediate neighbours and a hashmap or a map that uses an array of bucket lists where a modulo division remainder of the key s hashcode determines the starting bucket to query for the equals method of the keys that lie in that bucket s list of contents

6140982
entities	entitymanager
i guess if you configure your persistence.xml file with that single entity exclude all other unlisted entities and then start your entitymanager factory with the ddl auto generation enabled you might get just that

6140993
firefox	safari
neither overflow or column width is working in firefox or safari

6141010
pop-up	dialog
the dialog itself should not matter unless it was throwing an exception but i d think that would pop-up somewhere visible rather than just loading the default editor

innodb	myisam
the subscription table really doesn t need to be myisam i could change it to innodb because i don t have a need to fulltext it

6141488
oncreate	recreate
then in oncreate to read whether the flag is set and know whether the activity has not been created but recreate because of screen lock app going in background etc

6141493
next	except
i have initially tried to loop over the columns masking the array except the column to be recalculated and the replacing the values with the new ones with numpy.putmask but this does not retain the order as it attempts to place a value in each element and failing that tries with the next calculated value on the next element ã la

6141496
portrait	landscape
when i have two entirely different views for my portrait and landscape orientations i fade between them as they stretch during the rotation

6141499

use whatever version control system you re using s mechanism to ignore the actual config file put it in your gitignore hgignore etc.

6141545

selecteditem	selectedindex
but whatever syntax i use selectedvalue selecteditem selectedindex i keep getting a cannot convert int to string error

profiling	instrumentation
if you do really care about fine-tuning the opengl calls you re making the best profiling tool to use is the new opengl es analyzer instrumentation that comes with xcode 4

6141642
post	put
you need to put some php code to see what fields have are present in the post array

6141654

6141671
width	height
should i keep width and height of divs fixed fixed with pixels or

6141671
width	height
should i keep width and height of divs variable using instead of pixels

6141671
width	height
i personally like the first approach where you fix everything and there is very little chance of anything getting disturbed at different screen resolution but the drawback is if screen resolution goes below my expected screen resolution then the scroll bars makes the site look bad there may be more drawbacks but at present i am not remembering it so in that case 2nd approach comes into the picture but the thing is once you start using for your width and height its very difficult to design the page though once its designed its more stable

6141688
inherited	subclassing
you could do this by subclassing uicontrol which inherited from uiview but provides some additional methods for handling targets and actions

6141778
versioning	upgrade
i m guessing if you upgrade to a recent versioning of boost 1.46.1 you d be good to go

6141831
pull	push
if you need to monitor every change then have your php page push data to your bot rather than your irc bot pull data from the page through polling

6141854
versioning	upgrade
so if you are not with latest anydac versioning then consider to upgrade

6141855
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
that works fine in internet explorer full page or iframe opera google-chrome safari

6141878
margin	height
then it can have whatever height you like and the non-floated content when applied right margin won t stretch under floated element

6141956
width	margin

6144525

annoyingly all the java maven builds have been straightforward migrations - but grails uses ivy rather than maven - hopefully the vmware springsource guys will provide full maven integration in future negating these sorts of difficulties

6144532
post	get
it disables fine and moves to the new href fine but it s a get instead of a post

6145008
int	double
both x and y and int while getx and gety returns a double

6145061
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox google-chrome etc. this is what is actually seen

6145075
width	height
i had to rely on getting the hardware screen s width and height instead of the view s width and height

6145148
button	checkbox
i have a long form that s composed entirely of checkbox and radio button and i ve divided it up into a series of divs

6145148

with no protocol specified and no for directory the browser should request the asset from the same directory folder that the current page is at

6145181

apache	nginx
this causes nginx to strip the 8080 on packets flowing from apache back to the browser

6145354
apache	nginx
for example a redirect from django via apache will become after nginx sends it back to the client

6145371
getter	setter
imho getter and setter can be a waste of time for simple classes if they re public and all they re going to do is to return the value and set it which is all you want 99 of the time

6145371
getter	setter
but things are coming full circle and in a modern languages like groovy these would be properties with getter setter inferred and syntax pretty similar to that for accessing public fields in java

6145374
stdout	stderr
one problem is that in your stderr and stdout handlers which should be picking bytes off the pipe and writing to the real stderr stdout you re writing back to the same pipe

6145379
apache	nginx
when you serve static file via properly configured apache or nginx overhead will be minimal

6145379
apache	nginx
when you serve static file via django configured behind apache or nginx firstly web server connects to django then django handles things way more complex

6145379
apache	nginx
although it is written you need to configure apache or nginx you may not - you can outsource those files to services like amazon s3 or google apis so js css will be closer to users and in case services like google apis there is chance that library you want to add like jquery is already cached in user browser

6145388
ssl	https
i believe you d have the same problem even if they were on the same domain but one was ssl https and the other not http

i want to use guice on the server side with the gwt 2.3 requestfactory

6145519
cos	sin
when computing tx ty you use sin h with the x-coord and cos h with the y-coord because the angle is being measured from the y-axis

i even rebuilt the old release with message box displays to verify that installer is indeed re-installing the old versioning right after the uninstall rather than moving on to the new upgrade versioning

6145851
superclass	subclassing
a subclassing will have the static methods of its superclass but when they execute they will execute in context of the superclass - so there is no keyword that can be used in static methods to find out what class the method was invoked through

6145852
xdebug	xhprof
i suggest you xdebug and perhaps adding xhprof

6145879
versioning	upgrade

6145991
apache	nginx
what you want to do instead is use another web server for example nginx but apache would work too and run php as a fastcgi daemon

6145991
apache	nginx
a web server which uses limited forking few processes is probably better - such as nginx or apache with a different thread model

6145992
int	double	int	boolean
you can now have other types than strings only string int double boolean

6146250
puts	gets
first method puts records into queue and second one gets them

6146259
floating-point	integer
if you perform floating-point operations on the number before using modulus even if the logical result will always be an integer you should use

6146300
inherited	subclassing
it s fairly common to create a custom base class right below nsmanagedobject and the have all the subsequent managed object subclassing inherited from that regardless of their entities

6146317
put	get
but in rails it s hard to get subclasses to work with rest conventions it punishes you when you forget to include or it punishes you when you put a subclassed object in links such as edit_user_path user - bad idea

6146354
getter	setter
you can simply define those values as properties of whatever form they are in with appropriate getter and setter and refer to them as someformoranother.thisproperty

6146369
x86	64bit
x86 32-bit x86 64bit etc

6146438
abstract-class	superclass
my problem is that usually i start creating interfaces and then move to abstract-class because there s always some functionality that i want implements on a superclass so that i don t have to replicate it in every child classes

6146480
kde	gnome
this means that the desktop manager gnome kde doesn t matter

6146480
kde	gnome

or alternatively if you just need a hash with some relation to the original filename you can use md5 with the source filename

6146559
google-chrome	safari
the problem is that in safari and google-chrome it doesn t return to the beginning

6146569
urwid	ncurses
you could also do something similar via ncurses or urwid if you like

6146569
stdout	stderr
to handle process output you d need to capture the stdout stderr of and display it nicely to the screen using ansi escape sequences if you are manipulating the terminal manually or using an urwid widget to display the output in a scrolling window etc

you want to show or hide based on an expression

6146637
width	height
i try to get this example to work with scala and the scala swing library and i finally managed to get an internal frame but my mainframe distorts all internal frames and stretches them until they have exactly the same width and height as the space inside the mainframe

6146764
hide	show
you can use activities to show hide elements in the user interface including menus

6146764
hide	show
then when you enable disable your activity the platform will automatically show hide the element bind to it

6146768
mouse	keyboard
therefore even though the div receives keyboard and mouse events it s not reported in document.activeelement or a domactivate event handler

6146792
onchange	keyup	keydown	keyup
or is there a simple javascript way of doing it the onchange method doesn t update as they re typing and keydown keyup would have troubles with mouse changes

6146792
keydown	keyup
at the moment it seems like the best way is to have a function to do what i want check the length and update the message call it with keydown keyup change and also poll it a few times per second

6146859
hide	show
now i need to show the second select if the first select have the first option selected and hide the second dropdown if the second option of the first dropdown is selected

6146890
webclient	webrequest
i removed the webclient implementation as it seems like you re using the webrequest one

6146954
ord	unpack	uppercase	ord
edited to pass c to unpack in uppercase because unpack c gives me -1 where ord gives me 255 despite running on a platform where c s char is signed

6146956
width	height
the problem is that when you set the div to position absolute the rendering engine removes it from the relative positioning system so your div doesn t reserve it s own height and width relative to adjacent elements.

6146960
udp	tcp
if you want a fully functional environment based on javascript that has access to things like the filesystem network udp tcp http and the like i d recommend looking at node.js --

6146978
16-bit	64bit
after reading through msdn s alphabetical list of core win32 functions i realised how simple win32 s api design actually is and it s unfortunate that it s shrouded with all the cruft from the past 25 years including many references to 16-bit programming that are completely irrelevant in today s 64bit world

google-chrome	firefox
the problem seems to always occur in google-chrome and be intermittent in firefox

6147041
concave	convex
if the polygon is concave it becomes nearly impossible in the general case without lots of extra assumptions proof consider a point which lies within the convex hull but whose neighbors do not

6147041
centroid	convex
if the polygon is convex all you need to do is sort by the angle from some arbitrary point inside the polygon centroid of three arbitrary points

stdout	stderr
the output you are seeing is not from python but from the process s stdout and stderr being redirected to your terminal as spam that is not even going through the python process

try having the js console open in google-chrome or firefox or safari - you will get a much better idea of what the error is

6147529

i have ran this multiple time with different salt but the same password and keep getting the same hash

6147537
viewdidappear	viewwillappear

6147604
keydown	keyup
secondly you should know there is a difference between keydown or keyup and keypress

6147636

6147829
nexus	artifactory
worked-arounds included locally installing .m2 repo or running a repo like nexus artifactory et al

6147829
maven	pom.xml
it s also a problem for my end-users who use the commercial software i write as distributed by my owner er my company my corp won t publish pom.xml s or jars to a public maven repository due to the absence of any click-through license agreement

6147829
versioning	upgrade
building should be as simple as running mvn install once agree to a license and then all builds work locally just fine until you delete your local .m2 repository or upgrade your dependency versioning

put	get
other than cross-referencing and type hierarchy you will also be able to get calling graphs references and if you put the annotations in your code - documentation

6148343
put	get
while its true that you cant just send a vector outright keep in mind that the stl guarantees that a vector implementation will occupy a contentious span of memory meaning simply put if you get the address of the reference stored in the index of 0 of the vector you have the pointer to the first element in that contentious span of memory easily achieved with

cas	openam	cas	shibboleth	shibboleth	openam
cas can be realized by different protocols either by the central authentication service cas protocol for example by using the ruby cas server and the ruby cas client or by using the saml protocol with a suitable server for instance the shibboleth server or the openam server

6150555

6151647
archetypes	dexterity
i know there have been issues with dexterity archetypes playing well together on a site for example referencing between the two styles of content types

6151647

initially my thought is to use dexterity 1.0 and the version of archetypes that ships with plone 4.1 but i m open to suggestions versions 1.0-next for dexterity

6151652

apache	nginx
the c10k is related to web-server apache nginx etc not to php

6151797
apache	nginx
apache can also handle lots of passive connections if you run php as fastcgi and choose the mpm_worker which will create a more lightweight thread per connection but it s still not as good as nginx

same happens when switching from landscape back to portrait on the homescreen with the double high status bar already on

6154453

as far as avoiding the framework and creating your own base object goes all you need to do is make sure that the first ivar is declared class is_a and you could probably have a reasonable stab at replicating nsobject is by passing through to the runtime functions

folder	directory
you can easily do this by creating a bucket on amazon s3 that has the same folder structure as your public directory on your rails app

6155480
apache	nginx
apache and nginx the two supported web server platforms cannot run ruby like they can php perl or python because there s no built-in ruby module that works as well as those do

6155493
visualvm	yourkit
profilers like visualvm and yourkit can do this for you

6155512
multiplying	transpose
though if you plan on post-multiplying with the transpose it may be easier not to do the transpose at all in the first place because multiplying with the transpose of a matrix directly more closely matches the memory layout so one can do parallel multiplies if you ever want to go so far as to use simd

6155543
jar	war
deploying the web tier as a war and the business logic as an ejb jar is the right thing to do

6155543
jar	war
make sure you define a sub-project for each war and jar archive plus a sub-project for assembling the ear-file

6155543
jar	war
the latter project will pull in the war and jar files produced by the other sub-projects

6155554
gridview	rowdatabound
i m guessing you are getting the exception even before the gridview renders on screen as its in the rowdatabound event handler which fires when the gridview is loading

6155558
getter	setter
since properties are functions you can get a delegate from getter and setter

6155558
getter	setter
delegate like putting this delegate to the list with other delegates create a delegate from a property getter or setter method

6155558
getter	setter
setter and getter is a current situation in c++ java and many languages

6155558
getter	setter
but c# creators went further and decorated such getter and setter functions as properties

6155559
gradle	ivy
for a middle ground solution i d look at ivy instead and maybe gradle too

6155767
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your git versioning if it s not the latest

6155783
min	rank
when used alone min and source have the same function putting all those nodes on the minimum rank the top row of a tb graph

6155783
min	rank
the difference between them is that min will allow other subgraphs in the minimum rank

6155783
min	rank
source only allows other subgraphs of min or source to be on the minimum rank

6155783
min	rank
a - b will be to left of c - d all in the min rank

6155816

if you upgrade to the most recent versioning of magento and are still running into the problem i d

6155843
range	minimum
the standard defines minimum range

6155848
yacc	bison
the traditional approaches are either lex + yacc such as flex + bison or just a c program implementing a scanner and a recursive-descent parser

6155851
hash	salt
to do the match i send the list of hash and the salt securely separately to company b and they simply search their database using

6155851
hash	salt
a sufficiently long random salt prevents against use of a precomputed rainbow table to crack the hash

6155851
hash	salt
it would be pretty easy for company b to obtain one of these lists compute the hash using the salt i ve provided and recover some significant portion of emails on the list i ve sent certainly not all but a significant portion

6155855
unsigned	short
unsigned short will have maximal value 2 16 - 1 65 535

6155885

width	height
well the newheight and newwidth are not exactly 80 or 90 of the width height values

6155910
implements	extends
anyway any scripting language python lua applescript etc. is built on top of some native programming language usually c or c++ and if you want to extends your program with new features you still need to implements them first using native language

6155979
cos	sin
first cos and sin both have bounds between -1 and 1

6155989
gridview	formview
i have a gridview and a formview

6155989
gridview	formview
my edit button switches to the formview because there are more fields that i want to edit than will fit in a horizontal line on the gridview without horizontal scrolling

6155989
gridview	formview	gridview	onclientclick	formview	onclientclick
if i cancel from the edit mode of the formview and return to the gridview i use an onclientclick event to do this the next time a postback happens i get a viewstate error

6155989
gridview	formview
if i cancel from edit mode of the formview and simply switch to readonly mode and then cancel going back to the gridview everything works fine

6156002
width	height
actually you calculate 90 of width and 80 of height instead of 80 of width and 90 of height

6156075
google-chrome	firefox
edit it appears this is only happening in google-chrome and the default browser on the droid 2 global or at least it does work in firefox

6156090

set the site host header to blank so it accepts all domains then either use iis rewriter isapi filter to do the redirect or build a httphandler to do it checking the incoming host via httpcontext then redirect as needed

6156097
mouse	keyboard
i guess is always 0 because when the drop method is called the mouse button is already released you ve just made the drop - so naturally the keyboard mouse state flags would indicate that it is indeed released

6156100
client-side	server-side
if you want to be extremely competitive and marketable you might pick your languages based on diversity for example one that s good for web on the client-side one that s good for server-side and one that s good for platform device development

6156102
tomahawk	trinidad
i m only hesitating because we are using the myfaces tomahawk and trinidad add-ons in the application that i m migrating

your touchesended withevent will have to be the same as your touchesmoved withevent except it must invoke the method which is probably tied to the control event touch up inside event

6156137
sorting	grouping
in this way carry on the sorting for every grouping of 1 million integers and store it in the hard drive

6156163

i replaced my frameset with a table that takes up 100 height and 100 width and has two rows

6156609
width	height
then in each of the table cells i put an iframe that takes up 100 height and width for each cell

6156621

6156749
archetypes	dexterity
regarding references...zc.relation-style relations from dexterity items to archetypes have worked for quite some time

6156749
archetypes	dexterity
in plone 4.1 it is now also possible to use archetypes-style references from archetypes items to dexterity items if you enable the behavior from plone.app.referenceablebehavior for your dexterity content type

6156749

6157688
division	subtract
if inccount is unsigned int then your cast has no effect -- the subtract will be converted to signed int and then right back to unisgned int and an unsigned division will be done

it s worth pointing out that while ie doesn t support svg it does support vml which is a competing vector graphics format

6163496
svg	vml
svg is now standardised so vml will fade away but older ies will continue to support it

6163496
svg	vml
therefore the solution i d go with would be to use svg by default and vml instead on ie7 8

6163496
svg	vml
one is raphael which allows you to draw svg vml images using javascript

6163496
svg	vml
there are also a number of solutions which simply convert svg to vml

6163513
post	put
update to put the sort of work i m doing into context i m making a rather large social-media style site that ll have a very large amount of small regular post updates

6163536
serializable	deserialization
python has json serializable and deserialization built into it so you won t have to reinvent any wheels there either

6163606
awt	swing
it seems that whenever the monitor is off swing awt cancels all painting operations leading to a number of display issues in the gui that are visible as soon as the monitor turns back on

6163627
memcmp	strcmp
when the files are binary use memcmp not strcmp as 0 might appear as data

6163633
calloc	malloc
to get around this issue you should really first measure the length of the file by first iterating through the file and seeing how long the file is in bytes and then using malloc or calloc to allocate the buffers you re going to compare and re-fill those buffers with the actual file s contents

6163650
stdout	stderr
so the shell moves the existing stdout to an available file descriptor above 10 namely 11 then moves the existing stderr onto its own stdout due to the redirect then restores 11 to its own stdout when the ls command is finished

6163714
google-chrome	safari
many browsers actually expose __proto__ now so you can inspect it in firebug or the console in google-chrome safari

6163791
int	chars
z is a chars literal and in c a chars literal is of type int

6163813

hi my application consist of a uiviewcontroller which is a child of a uinavigationcontroller which is a child of a uitabbarcontroller

6163839
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the uiviewcontroller and uinavigationcontroller shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation functions are not being called

6163849
hide	show
i do want that stay always on the top and changes name to hide when is active so show hide

6163883
implements	extends
if the class is not final you can make your own class that extends it and implements serializable

6163892
nsstring	nsdata
use nsdata rather than nsstring

6163904
width	height
updatedisplaylist has real component unscaled width and height as parameter

6163914
free	malloc
free your own things you malloc release ownership of objects you control implement didreceivememorywarning to act sanely for your data sets and you should be fine

6163921
put	get
so i am trying trying to figure out how to access the intent i used to start the activity to get some extras that i put on it

6163923
folder	directory
it works fine but now i d like to copy a template from a resource folder to this new created directory would be the index of it and i know how to do it

6163972
unix	solaris
for instance could one write a driver for the keyboard-backlight of a mac and port it to another unix system maybe solaris

6163975
google-chrome	firefox
this page works correctly in firefox google-chrome smooth like butter

6163987
post	get
use the php-provided mkdir and copy functions and clean any post get variables you have submitted to you

6164006
nunit	mstest
the commandline version of mstest does not produce correctly formatted output and as far as i can tell neither does nunit or xunit so when i add mstest to my project s post build i still have to scroll around looking for the one that failed

6164011
yacc	bison
if you want to validate the structure of something and semantics is not an issue you could use lex yacc read flex bison

6164037
firefox	safari
with firefox 4 or safari 5 or ie 8

6164059
kohana	yii
i mainly use kohana and yii but my question is addressed to the mvc pattern in general

6164078
getter	setter
jsf need private boolean and its getter and setter but if i want to resolve some internal logic in application server it must be defined static

6164078
getter	setter
and in the beans there are getter and setter pointing to the settings.variable

6164148
children	parent
as far as i know parent and its children share the same file descriptor so i expected to see the child s output which actually didn t happen

6164194
next	except
the author seems to be doing the same thing as you did except he has a return after the next

6164231
google-chrome	firefox
firefox allows you to copy and paste these images out of a browser but google-chrome doesn t

6164244
firefox	safari
it works fine with firefox 3.6x i would expect fine as well with firefox 4.0 and safari 5

6164246
portrait	landscape
the problem is that the added view draws itself in portrait mode not in landscape

6164301
width	height
notice that there must be an integer number of squares which fill the width and height

6164301
width	height
input width float or int height float or int

6164301
width	height
if the width height is a rational number your answer is merely any multiple of the aspect ratio

6164301
width	height
if your aspect ratio was 4 3 you could fill it with 4x3 squares of length width 4 height 3 or 8x6 squares of half that size or 12x9 squares of a third that size... if it is not a rational number your task is impossible

6164307
spaces	delimiter
if your input was spaces delimiter not delimiter

6164314
stdout	stderr
of data allowed on stdout or stderr -

6164341
portrait	landscape
my host activity has 2 panes in landscape menuframe and contentframe and only menuframe in portrait to which appropriate fragments are loaded

6164369
children	parent
if a parent is found add the current node new unit to its children

6164463
rowdatabound	onclientclick
on rowdatabound event you need to read the client id of your txtname and set the onclientclick of your linkbutton

6164472
prototypejs	mootools
possibly mootools or prototypejs i m not sure what either return if there is no matching element but i m pretty sure that both have a function that takes an id and not a css selector as the argument

6164485
implements	extends
you have to extends japplet and implements init

6164499
findwindow	postmessage
you ll use the findwindow api to get an hwnd for the target program then the postmessage api to send key events

6164505
nstextfield	nstableview
the four nstextfield under the nstableview are to moved to a sheet someday but for now this is fine

6164522
post	get
this little function helps to fight common security issue with sql injections it can sanitize any global variable like post get _server etc and escape unsafe characters

6164574
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works in ie 7-9 firefox safari and google-chrome

6164618
hash	salt
once a user is logged in you can set a session that someone is logged in and then on each visit check if session exists and it is valid using private salt and hash

6164625
try-catch	exception-handling
1 if i need to take some action depending on the specific line that has thrown the exception-handling the only thing is surrond each statement with his-own try-catch

6164625
try-catch	exception-handling
2 if i not need to take a specific action based on the line that throws the exception-handling then the stack trace will give enough information to know line has gone wrong without a try-catch block for each instruction that makes the code less readable

6164638
subtraction	addition
the type of subtraction is also the same as that of addition

6164638
int	double
note the type of 100 is int so it first converts to double type which is then stored as local variable x which in turn is passed to the function f as first argument

6164638
int	double
again a conversion from int to double occurs in both cases

6164670
gxt	smartgwt
gxt and smartgwt both of them i d highly advise against for many reasons have form validation

6164680
subtraction	addition
in your example it is used both for assignment of subtraction to minus and for conversion of addition to the parameter type accepted by operation

6164687
gif	png
presuming by urls you mean elements then the following code would remove all jpg gif png links which end with those extensions

6164723
hash	md5
this pertains to a view log that contains all records viewed by a user - the key for the user is either their id when logged in or a random md5 hash while not logged in

6164723
hash	md5
by either he md5 hash as user did not log in or id if present and either of the two

6164738
implements	extends
i m trying to implements the geocoder in a class that doesn t extends activity and i have problems in passing the context for the geocoder constructor

6164749
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this all works really great in firefox google-chrome safari even ie7

6164835
innodb	myisam
do yourself a favor and alter each and every one of your tables so they use the innodb engine instead of myisam

6164843
folder	directory
once it s booted up you can use the ddms tool located in the tools directory under your android sdk install folder

6164861
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i can disable the scrolling in google-chrome safari but putting overflow hidden on the body tag but on firefox this only hides the scrollbars and i can still scroll with the arrow keys

6164861
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
with firefox i have to animate the html tag but with google-chrome safari it is just the body i need to animate

6164876
fread	memcmp
better to use fread and memcmp to avoid 0 character issues

6164957
width	height
i m trying to get the links to look like round circles with a width of 25px and a height of 25px so i applied the following css

6164963
google-chrome	firefox
later... seems i can do this in firefox but not google-chrome

6165018
pop-up	dialog
another approach to this problem which i find more useful for pop-up situations like this is to just open the other form as a dialog and require it be closed before returning to the calling context

6165025
servicepoint	httpwebrequest
httpwebrequest relies on an underlying servicepoint

6165025
servicepoint	httpwebrequest
much in the same way your browser keeps a connection to a url open between requests and reuses that connection to eliminate the overhead of opening and closing the connection with each request servicepoint performs the same function for httpwebrequest

6165025
servicepoint	httpwebrequest
i think that the bindipendpointdelegate that you are setting for the servicepoint is not being called on each use of httpwebrequest because the servicepoint is reusing the connection

6165029
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
i left out the bufferedinputstream and bufferedoutputstream since their buffer s size is only 8192 bytes which less than the buffer i use in the code

6165035
width	height
for part of a private project i am working on i want to get the height width bite rate fps of an mpeg in java

6165074
fragmentpageradapter	fragmenttransaction	android-listfragment	fragmentpageradapter	android-listfragment	fragmenttransaction
android android-fragmentmanager android-fragmentactivity android-listfragment android-dialogfragment fragmentpageradapter fragment-tab-host fragmenttransaction fragmentstatepageradapter android-nested-fragment dialogfragment fragment-backstack

6165089
multiplying	add
the standard approach assuming you have a 16x16- 32 multiplying available would be to split both numbers into 16-bit high and low parts compute four partial products and add the results

6165092
children	parent
i want to know if it s possible to make a specific query to obtain only the keys of the parent given some attribute restrictions on the children entities

6165092
children	parent
notice that i m not interested in the children just the keys of the parent

6165097
draggable	droppable
jquery ui has draggable and droppable functions for objects

6165183
int	boolean
my db table includes 5 fields gameid the primary key int gamename varchar islocked ishidden and isfavorite all boolean

6165189
int	boolean
instead boolean values are stored as int 0 false and 1 true

6165260
division	multiplication
64-bit multiplication implemented with 32-bit operations is quite slow and you may have the additional overhead of 64-bit division to convert back to seconds and milliseconds which is even slower

6165293
int	double
i want to access a c function that returns a struct containing double arrays where the lengths of these arrays is given by other int members of the struct from python

6165334
getter	setter
if you need to modify as well as read you will want separate getter and setter of course

6165339
switching	screens
aesthetics aside splash screens are a single instance activity that does not require a lot of complexity and allows you do do the exact thing you want switching activities based on some condition in your case if the user is logged in or not

6165350
nunit	mstest
we provide build tasks for mstest msbuild visual studio and nant including test parsing and reporting support for nunit

6165360
vmware	virtualbox
i have a slight preference for virtualbox but vmware is just fine

6165383
multiplying	add
since you are only multiplying by 1000 seconds - millis you can do it with two 16 bit mutliplies and one add and a bit of bit fiddling i have used your putative data type to store the result below

6165451
children	parent
i will almost always write a public destroy method for any object to handle inner object hierarchies parent calls destroy on child which in turn calls destroy on any children etc etc

6165470
int	chars
so setting minems to an int value say 3 on an edittext or textview should ensure it s at least 3 chars wide

6165472
google-chrome	safari
i use this webkit css code which works well for safari and google-chrome

6165481
hide	show
what it does is to show hide a subview in the cell

6165481
hide	show
if the subview already show then it hide otherwise it show

6165515
background-color	transparency
if an element has transparency but existing borders you can see that the background-color shows through the transparency borders here s proof

6165521
linefeed	delimiter
you never send a linefeed n to the java side bufferedreader uses these as delimiter for readline

6165528
google-chrome	firefox
if you have google-chrome or firefox with firebug you can inspect the dom to see how it works

6165600
mdpi	hdpi
because of dpi scaling you may be running what you think is an hdpi emulator but the emulator is loading mdpi resources or vice versa

6165638
keyup	onblur
to solve this i m trying to bind a function to the onblur and keyup events of the element to loop through other form elements and work out whether they ve been autocompleted

6165659
folder	directory
the key with windows directory and folder security is the owner of a folder

6165701
children	parent
i think you might need to do a mutiquery and bring together the dto parent and children yourself

6165745
converter	multibinding
i tried to use the value converter method and multibinding

6165746
subtract	add
so for any pair of variables x and y we know that the difference is between -m and m could add subtract ones there but not essential

6165752
httpconnection	downloading
i m using httpconnection to do downloading of pages in java

6165795
boost	stl
at some stage you might need to know about it but your better off learning other important things like stl and boost

6165798
ready	each
each distro has many many many python modules already packaged and ready to go

6165870
fgetc	isspace	fgetc	strcmp
and so now i have a non-utf-8 supporting code that works with fgetc isspace strcmp etc

6165877
hide	show
your intention is to show #loading then slideup and once that is complete hide #loading

6165877
hide	show
another thing that many people overlook is that show and hide when called with a duration are animations and are therefore queue however when no duration is passed these calls are not animations and will not be queued

6165877
hide	show
so calling show with a duration and then immediately calling hide with no duration will never show the element

6165877
hide	show
also the durations passed to show and hide are in milliseconds so hide 1 gives a duration of 1 millisecond you may be aware of this

6165891
pdcurses	conio
much of the functionality of conio can probably be found in pdcurses

6165896
post	get
this can be done in 2 ways depending on whether your form has a method of post or get

6165952
width	height
when i click on the blue box the width height of the parent returns an empty string.

6165956
ocp	principles
the conditional statements are an indicator that we are violating the ocp open-closed principles we can use the replace conditional with polymorphism refactoring to remove the conditional logic

6165966
overwrite	preserve
i have to not only preserve their existing handling but make it flexible afterwards too since someone could just overwrite what i ve done

6165994
int	boolean
mysql boolean are actually just int 0 or 1

6165994
tinyint	boolean
one caveat because mysql has no real boolean type your positive column is actually tinyint 1 and could contain any number that fits in a byte which will throw off sum positive

6166060
ant	maven
such as ant and maven

6166060
maven	pom.xml
using maven is the easiest approach all you do is create your pom.xml file and create your executions

6166060
ant	maven
it integrates really well with maven and ant

6166064
translation	pluralize
i know that i can use pluralize helper method but i want to embed this in i18n translation so that i don t have to mess up with my views at any point in the future

6166109
np-hard	subset-sum
the problem is np-hard since solving it efficiently would solve the subset-sum decision problem efficiently

6166131
crossover	mutation
entirely depends on what is your requirement in ga implementation what level and type of mutation crossover selection representation strategies need to be available etc

6166137
haskell	ocaml
i m more familiar with ocaml than haskell so type constructor may not be the right term

6166161
rss	feed
if you view the savetostring source on the phone you get a minimal link to the rss feed and few other tags

6166170
folder	directory
using what sameera stated by configuring your app to load directory i would probably put it in a new folder in the lib directory

6166198
rss	feed
i tired all my php skills to extract domain name strings from a rss feed and put each domain name as an array element but all in vain

6166228
post	get
but when i delete the item by clicking the delete link i have an issue a get request not post

6166273
rss	feed
i would also like to know how to make that code modular so that i can reuse it for a new incarnation of this website that is going to pull in content from rss feed from two websites that friends of mine are developing

6166276
salt	md5
i also realise that for safety reasons i need to encrypt it possibly with md5 and salt

6166303
int	double
additionally i have a price field which should be validated as either an int or a double

6166312
int	double
as for validating an int or a double

6166329
min	max
what i did was to combine all applicable settings and then assumed that we applied the most restrictive settings so take the max minprice specified and min maxprice

6166329
min	max
if i reverse it so that we try to be as inclusive as possible min minprice and max maxprice then that returns p1 - red and p3 - green - but still not p2 - blue

6166333
hash	md5
in the place where you accept developers for api keys let the developer enter their website url and use a hash to make the key for example md5

6166347
hide	show
you could show the loader and then download the slow image in a hidden tag with an ajax request and then when it s loaded hide the loader and display the img

6166382
int	chars
here is the key phrase you can assume that each symbol which will be mapped to a codeword is a 4-byte binary string. and what i think i know is that chars represents one byte and unsigned int represents four byte so i am guessing i should be reading the input four bytes at a time into a unsigned int buffer and then collect my data for the huffman part of the program

6166390
disk	ram
disk ram cpu

6166405
int	chars
instead of casting a pointer i would suggest using union of int and and passing pointer to the chars array as you should be

6166444
datalist	repeater
if you have controls that are databound repeater datalist formveiw etc. and under the updatepanel these controls will have page level scope

6166492
folder	directory
you can set the directory permissions using any ftp program like filezilla ftp browse to the folder right click on it and set the permissions using the permissions menu

6166569
google-chrome	firefox
i was testing simultaneously on firefox 3.6 4 and google-chrome for looks and js corrections and js lint ofcourse

6166617
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
in every browser firefox google-chrome opera when i press on the button it redirects me to the page i want the page where you pay for the item but in ie it redirects me to normal login page not the page in which i have to pay

6166656
post	put
if you are using php this will help you see my comment above see this site rude boy solutions or jasonlau s blog originally put the links for these but not enough points on stack overflow - for more than 1 url in a post at a time

6166657
submit	submission
user submit a submission that contains a version

6166657
feedback	review
each reviewer assigned to a submission then writes a review for that particular submission which encompasses a decision accept reject and some feedback

6166677
mdpi	hdpi
i have three folders hdpi ldpi and mdpi for drawables but in the emulator there isn t any referense to what resolution hdpi is and what mdpi and ldpi are

6166685
mdpi	hdpi
240 is hdpi 160 is mdpi and below that are usually ldpi

6166703
mockito	easymock
in java i can think of mockito and easymock off of the top of my head

6166703
junit	mockito
test using mockito with junit 4 drop the test attribute for junit 3

6166717
filesystems	fat
fat specifically fat16 is an extremely simple filesystems -- so simple in fact that building a fat16 filesystems driver was a single programming lab assignment for a 200-level computer science course when i was in school

6166724
width	height
need to set auto width and height for panel

6166751
pull	push
all devs then access this share via vpn connection to push pull changes

6166785
outputstream	inputstream
if i want to read more data i have to use outputstream to send some data then inputstream will read once and get stuck again

6166816
getter	setter
since canydata is a class-template all definitions should be written directly into the header-file just as you have done with all the getter and setter

6166846
ws-addressing	soap
for example ws-addressing which is set of well known soap headers

6166883
submit	submission
probably the most reliable way would be to hook the click event on the buttons as well as the submit event of the form and route them all to a central function that does the ajax submission with or without a button value without in the case of a form submitted another way rather than by pressing one of those buttons

6166897
pop-up	dialog
i found the solution to my problem and posted the answer in another thread android ime showing a custom pop-up dialog like swype keyboard which can enter text into the textview

6166905
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome and probably opera sort object properties automatically

6166927
autofac	castle-windsor
although it is named autofac it is not some kind of auto matic fac tory generator any more than unity is a way of unifying all your classes into one or castle-windsor is a.

6166951
int	boolean
wich calls the graphic.addanimation string int float boolean method

6166964
width	height
i set up a width and height to img tag using css

6166973
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s working in all other major browsers firefox safari opera google-chrome

6166976
width	height
the aspect ratio wont be maintained if you have set both the height and width using css

6166984
put	get
all pretty basic stuff in this case i m taking advantage of the fact js typically flattens array as strings without commas to get the desired out put but if you want to delimit them items somehow or wrap them in tags or whatever it s easy enough to work out by taking a few seconds to browse

6167046
g++	gcc
use g++ instead of gcc since youâ re compiling a c++ program

6167051
centos	linux
keep in mind that the linux ec2 ami is a cut down version of centos and you can add custom repositories and install as you wish

6167060
width	height	distance	altitude
i have 100 000 x y points altitude over distance to chart on a graph with height 400px and width 600px

6167064
opera	safari
i ve tested in opera safari ff3 and ff4 as well and the issue is the same though the invoke time is different

6167134
int	chars
your problem is that you read string data chars but the enumeration values correspond to int

6167141
put	get
basically the idea is to pass struct casted to void then you put it back to struct dereference to get struct and then just do a compare

6167175
button	checkbox
labels are meant for form controls that don t have a label or caption such as radio button and checkbox

6167177
public	protected
last if you need to extend the class for real edit the byte code and just add protected attribute the c-tor and public attribute to directbytebuffer and directbytebufferr

6167177
public	protected
you need some hacked version but that s super easy of bytebuffer w public access and protected c-tor just for the compiler

6167196
qtabwidget	qwidget
is it possible to get all tabs widgets that where added by addtab qwidget in qtabwidget in a list

6167228
hide	show
when clicking a button it hide the main menu and show the other form

6167263
portrait	landscape
if not how can i make the landscape version identical to the portrait one

6167281
hide	show
you dont need to clip the list elements in a div for your purpose.just use a javascript framework ex.jquery to show hide li-elements on hover mouse-out

6167321
postgresql	mysql
if not look into postgis for postgresql mysql s gis functionality etc

6167333
innodb	myisam
in the end i randomly discovered that using the myisam engine on the table instead of innodb fixed it

6167354
post	get
the data parameters are sent as post varaiables rather than get variables

6167362
int	double
48874808.0 is a float or double on the other hand 48874808 is an int

6167393
allegro	sdl
sdl sfml and allegro may provide a good foundation for a cross-platform 2d engine

6167477
ggplot2	lattice
however with lattice or ggplot2 you can do it

6167492
force.com	salesforce
i would have loved to use salesforce force.com platform but unfortunately it is quite expensive

puts	gets
absent an actual working file encoding decoding layer i think what you want is to change the gets separator from n x0a to x0a x00 abandon all use of strip since it s not encoding-clean and use print instead of puts so that you don t add extra line-ends since you ll be converting the ones you ve already got

the problem you re having seems to do the usage of starttls which is an smtps command so you might need to read more about it in the smtps specification

starttls	smtps
there are two ways of enabling ssl tls in smtps connections as described here although they re often badly labelled some call tls what really is using starttls

6172456
starttls	smtps
the other is a switch to tls although it actually works with sslv3 too sometimes during an smtps exchange using the starttls command

6172456
starttls	smtps
here the client starts talking to the server in plain text using smtps commands but then sends a starttls command and initiates a tls handshake to turn the plain socket into an ssl tls one

6172456

you don t need to use starttls as part of the smtps protocol after that since you ll already be using ssl tls

the only way i can see to do it is to create an appropriately-sized mkcoordinateregion using mkcoordinateregionmakewithdistance and then use mkmapview s convertregion torecttoview to convert it to a cgrect from which you can read out the width height to calculate the appropriate line width

i m a bit confused ieee defines 32-bit c float range approximately from 3.4eâ 38 to 3.4e+38 and i was wondering what is the maximum and minimum undistorted amplitude that a jack_default_audio_sample_t can hold with that audio type

this holds for things like settimeout and setinterval

6181590
put	get
also you are most likely going to get a runtime error if you try to test this outside of a browser for any reason so you might want to put a try catch for that case

6181610
setinterval	settimeout
don t pass a string to settimeout or setinterval for the code to run - use a function pointer

6181610
mouseleave	mouseenter	hide	show	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave
hide the tip on a mouseleave event either from the item that the tip is for or the tip itself and show it on mouseover or mouseenter

hash	salt
the password hash also needs to use a salt otherwise dictionary attacks are possible and two users who happen to pick the same password will have the same hash password stored in the db

i get similar warning messages but not critical in my logs when i invoke other spring controllers that either render a web page get or returns some xml data essentially rpc invokes which use http post

post	get
when i do an http get post to those urls the response code is 200 and the output is correct and i ignore the warning message in the logs

6182250

6182370
bash	zsh
this skips the gemsets part you don t need it if you are just starting learning rails and assumes that you use zsh i think it s mac os x default if you use bash then you have to alter .bashrc not .zshrc

6182376
int	chars
on the other hand technically speaking it is possible as an int is large enough to contain a chars - so you could create the array temp as an int type and populate it with int or chars from the other array

6182377
memcached	apc
sadly if you have an object small or big it will be loaded each time the php script runs but if you want to share something in memory between runs you could use apc memcached or shared memory

proof goes something like this if a is the min of the median and b is the max of the median then each array has less than half of its elements less than a and less than half of its elements greater than b

6182638
subtract	add
independent of any programming language but dependent on character representation you could retrieve every character of string and add 22 which would convert uppercase into lowercase.as you must be knowing ascii values of a-z is 97-122 and that of a-z is 65-90 .so you can lookout how much to add subtract to convert between cases

i think it would make your life fairly easy to use jquery and use the titles of the tags your users are clicking on as keywords that show and hide divs which have id s of the same name

6182741

put	get
whether you re using genetic algorithms or neural nets or combining them as mentioned by ben voigt even though neural networks are typically associated with other training techniques - what you get in the end is a function where you put in a number of real values and get out a single value

6184660
put	get
during training think of another black box where you put in pairs of input and output pairs and assume it s gonna get better the more pairs you show to it

6184673

this way i have the benefits of common getter setter code completion in your ide ease of coding if i want exceptions due to inexistent properties great for discovering typos instead of read only properties and compound properties

the data directory where we create delete files and folder is located at c projectx data

6185683
folder	directory
as you can see you can continue to use the linked data folder as if it were a normal folder inside the web app s directory

6185683

this means you can now create delete modify folder and files inside the data directory as you wish without having the web app restarted

the rss feed is generated by a standard .ashx handler in my application

6186563

6186591

6186987
coalesce	isnull
using functions like coalesce or isnull in the where clause is asking the server to search for the results of those functions - which are unknown until they are executed for every row in the resulting set so there is no way for it to make use of an index

6186992
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine with firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

i am trying to convert scheme code to haskell code

6187506
ssl	https
use https http over ssl

6187510

in this case tcp is a good match this could still be implemented in udp of course but tcp doesn t have as much drawbacks as for the live stream case

6187534
packets	multicast
with udp you can easily multicast your packets to all connected terminals

6187535
udp	tcp
tcp prevents the use of ip multicast but udp is well-suited for ip multicast

fadein	hide
hide the element first then only fadein effect will be visible

6187550
rss	feed
this is item element of rss feed

6187554
post	get
the reason its not is because when you first hit wall.php you get redirected to facebook to authenticate it then redirects back to your application script wall.php with a get - so you lose your post variables on the redirect

6187566
int	double
but if i have a double instead of an int

6187566
int	double
an int and a double can be transformed into string this won t cause problem

6187566
int	double
anyway i would like to understand why a generic object like my empty_row can be accepted as value of a declared int field while this don t work with double fields

6187568
fadein	fadeout
i want to make fadein and fadeout effects as jquery but by using javascript itself vanilla javascript

6187699
integer	unsigned
i need to send a message of bytes in python and i need to convert an unsigned integer number to a byte array

6187719
getter	setter
never ever allow xstream or any other serialization framework to marshal anything but clean pure javabeans getter and setter

6187730
profiling	debugging
for profiling and debugging you can use general gpu profiling and debuggers as gdebugger and the like i think

6187741
integer	unsigned
the format string i denotes an unsigned 32-bit integer

6187744
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i think you intuition is correct when you dismiss the modal view controller the underlying view is displayed again and it controller receives the viewwillappear viewdidappear messages

6187808
children	parent
this returns me an array of all my parent categories alphabetically-ordered with a children key containing another array all the children of that category in alphabetical order too

6187818
rss	feed
i m getting an rss feed from a site but if there is no internet connection the user can t read the rss information that the phone has already downloaded

6187894
oncreate	ondestroy
correct me if i m wrong but i understood that the config option android configchanges orientation should only be used when you want to handle the config changes yourself and not go through the typical ondestroy oncreate cycle

6187962
ia-32	x86
that is the data on the wire will probably include multi-byte 2 4 8 integers and either the msb or the lsb will be sent first but if one machine is little-endian ia-32 ia-64 x86 64 and the other is big-endian sparc ppc almost anything not from intel then the data will need to be transformed

6187962
udp	tcp
some are specific ip tcp udp

6187972
width	height
ya its time consuming to set height and width for every image

6187986
metaclass	subclassing
so to override __getitem__ for a class you can redefine its metaclass to make it a subclassing of type

6188038
getter	setter
i mean in objective c if i have a variable which i have declared in the interface of a class why can t i directly without making its getter and setter access with

6188038
getter	setter
getter and setter have their own advantages but when you are doing simple things would it not be better if you access variables in the way i have mentioned above

6188130
post	get
i want the post to get added into the database without page refresh and also title and text get appended somewhere in the html page

6188178
viewdidload	dealloc

6188547
svg	vml
ie supports vml instead and there are any number of javascript tools available for converting svg to vml so that apps using svg can work in all browsers

6188548
hide	show
another idea i had was to create a method or event that the presenter calls telling the form to show hide the controls but that kind of means replicating the logic in the presenter

6188556
aggregate-functions	sum
it is usually safe to assume that typical aggregate-functions sum count avg ... exist in all database implementations

6188581
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
after a couple of test firefox ie safari and opera working fine the only browser who erase the content of the editor is chrome.

6188613
hide	show
you will need to put the css selector inside the parentheses for the items you want to show or hide

6188653
folder	dir
and played about with this but closest i can get without ant throwing an error is to copy the contents of the temp dir not the base folder within temp

6188655
squash	merge	squash	branch
i am now done with the branch an want to merge it back into master however while i don t want to squash all commits into just one commit when merging back which i know can be done with

6188766
width	height
i tried you layout with and all the views have the same height and width in the emulator

6188783
fast-forward	merge
or whatever you branched from so the resulting history will appear i started from later version and the merge back will probably be fast-forward it s easier to work with especially since you are rewriting the actual history to logical changesets anyway

6188785
client-side	server-side
no server-side action can manipulate client-side dom

6188805
bash	zsh
this requires bash or zsh for the syntax

6188974
tabcontrol	expander
anyway the behavior you re describing seems more to fit with a tabcontrol than an expander

6189001
int	boolean
with axis2 command-line tool you can pass switch -euwc to wrap int into int boolean into boolean and so on in generated soruces

6189001
int	boolean
this is the one way to tell axis2 that its ok for certain int or boolean values to be nillable in schema

6189003
width	height
i know you can specifically set content width and height via corona and scale the content but this seems to be for scaling upwards method detailed here

6189024

6189033
put	get
i put in the formula bar and hit enter to get the colour effects that don t seem to appear otherwise for some reason then dragged down

6189064
hide	show
i discovered the element for html5 and that made me want to determine whether it was possible to implement a simple and reusable show hide via css alone

6189064
hide	show
i have created a show hide mechanism in the past for showing and hiding content by giving two elements relative positioning and one a negative z-index and then decreasing the z-index of the front element on hover and increasing the z-index of the back element on hover

6189064
hide	show
trivial example code that i would like to be able to apply a show hide to

6189076
post	get
as an example if your form post the following both get or post query

6189077
accessor	properties
i d favour your approach though with properties it s a good habit to stick to the accessor methods in case you ever want to customise them

6189095
pull	push
you can then push pull from either computer to your dropbox to stay up to date on all ends

6189125
udp	tcp
cocoaasyncsocket supports tcp and udp

6189125
udp	tcp
the asyncsocket class is for tcp and the asyncudpsocket class is for udp

6189125
udp	tcp
it works almost exactly like the tcp version but is designed specifically for udp

6189179
mp3	ogg
i want to ask for resources on how to load ogg mp3 files and play them using the openal facilities in lwjgl

6189248
tunnel	packets
you might want to implement this kind of restart streaming after break functionality anyway since phones tend to go under bridges tunnel just as the last kb of a 360mb video file is being streamed i know that tcp should take care of dropped packets but if the phone wireless layer decides to close the socket for whatever reason.

6189249
client-side	server-side
connect client-side to server-side via rest this will de-couple the two and provide a wider choice for future upgrade enhancement

6189304
int	double
int and float values will be converted to lua s number type by default double

6189336
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
i d suggest looking at the object before you serialize to make sure its not null and i d also suggest serializing to a file on the sd card to make sure you actually had data output so use new fileoutputstream mnt sdcard serializationtest as the output stream and new fileinputstream mnt sdcard serializationtest as the input stream while you are debugging

6189354
portrait	landscape
but once i change the orientation from landscape to portrait or vice versa the view gets very messy

6189471
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you should have a uiviewcontroller inside a uinavigationcontroller inside a uitabbarcontroller

if so you can use ceil sqrt n to compute the number of columns since this is as you apparently have guessed the smallest amount of columns you need in order to not have more rows than columns

6190160
ceil	floor	ceil	sqrt	floor	sqrt
the calculation i propose is a safer way to indirectly discover whether the number of rows should be ceil sqrt n or floor sqrt n

superclass	subclassing
you might not declare protocol adoption in the superclass but demand compliance in all subclassing

6191367
width	height
never used galleria but just peeked at their docs and it sounds like by default both those values are auto and will take the width and height of the containing element so if your containing element is liquid you can just leave width and height out of your init options and it should conform to the container

6191380
width	height
you can do this binding a function that updates the width and height of the element to window .resize

6191380
width	height
you should find out where is the galleria function applying width and height and use your new function to do the calculations you need with the window dimensions and apply them to that element

6191386

value types in .net like int double and bool cannot by definition be null - they always have an actual value assigned

valgrind	memcheck
aside from the debugger you could try valgrind memcheck to find where your program deletes an already freed object

6192275
valgrind	memcheck
it probably won t give more detail than the debugger in this case but you ought to learn to use valgrind memcheck sooner or later

go through the checked checkbox and refer back to the viewstate for the name that goes with each id when they click the delete button

c++ has no equivalent to c# s sealed modifiers

6193153
getattr	setattr
i understand that something like pyunicode_asstring and its related methods can be used to encode the data in utf-8 store it in a basic char string and decode later but doing it that way would require wrapping the generic getattr and setattr methods functions with ones that account for the encoded text and it s not very useful when you want character arrays of fixed element size within a struct and don t want the effective number of characters that can be stored in it to vary

6193186
maven	m2e
edit i ve found out that using m2e core + maven integration for wtp from m2e extras resolves my issues

macports	homebrew
ditch macports - homebrew is a much better package management tool and results in almost no errors

you should definitely do null checking and throw argumentnullexception to avoid hard to understand nullreferenceexception inside your code

6193607
g++	gcc
i m on linux using g++ gcc 4.6.0 20110509 red hat 4.6.0-7

nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
it seems that a nullreferenceexception shouldn t be thrown in this case as microsoft recommends using an argumentnullexception instead

int	chars
note that stringbuffer.append is overloaded for any primitive type so it can accept int and chars directly without the need to be converted to string objects

i have jsp that works fine in tomcat 7 but does not work in tomcat 6 which i assume is the fact that you cannot call methods other than getter setter from el 2.1

6194168
getter	setter
declare a boolean property in your managed bean and generate the getter and setter methods for it

6194466
google-chrome	firefox
my first assumption is that it has to do with the way firefox s js engine would handle string objects and that for firefox this operation is simple pointer manipulation while for google-chrome it s actually doing hard copies

6194466
google-chrome	firefox
but i m not sure why google-chrome wouldn t do pointer manipulation or why firefox would

6194472
int	double
and unfortunately it has to work with only 32-bit int and single-float math no double and not even 32x32 64bit multiply though i could emulate that if needed -- basically it needs to work on older cuda hardware

if the cyclomatic complexity of the getter and or setter is 1 which they usually are then the answer is no you shouldn t

6197415
getter	setter
remember to differentiate getter and setter even in languages like c# where properties might seem like the same thing

6197415
getter	setter
the setter complexity can be higher than the getter and thus validate a unit-test

6197431
hide	show
edit this is the code i use to show hide the view

6197432
getter	setter
unit tests are there to test the behaviour of your code in an expressive and meaningful way and getter setter are only a means to an end

6197432
getter	setter
if you tests use the getter setter to achieve their goal of testing the real functionality then that s good enough

6197432
getter	setter
if on the other hand your getter and setter do more than just get and set they re properly complex methods then yes they should be tested

6197432
getter	setter
but don t write a unit test case just to test a getter or setter that s a waste of time

6200589
hash	md5
if you are looking for cryptographic hash then the issue is completely different and md5 is loosy and you ll need a library for for example a sha-2 hash

gridview	detailsview
the gridview and detailsview uses the boundfield commandfield etc

width	height
when sizing an image to a width of 650 and height of 350 in concretapp.as the main parent class the size is correct and as expected

6201925
free	malloc
the pointer passed to free has not being returned by malloc as being an odd address it cannot be properly aligned and malloc provides aligned blocks of memory always

6201925
free	malloc
again the problem would be that the pointer that is passed to free by the implementation of delete is not corrected to match the one returned by malloc .

you can package facelets files in a jar file and put it in the classpath and provide a facelets resourceresolver which serves the files from the jar on when no match is found in war

6203109
iboutlet	ibaction
the bundle should contain nibs that correspond to some properties and methods in the main project iboutlet ibaction

6203123

one way you could accomplish this is cancel the form from submission and then submit it manually if it passes the requirements from the ajax request

6203189
hide	show
i m currently trying to make some show hide content more accessible on a large site in excess of 30 000 pages and i ve come across a weird bug when adding tabindex where a dotted border appears when clicking on the control to open the hidden content

6203189

this works in google-chrome and safari but in ie8 and firefox 3.6 i still get the border when i click on the p tag

6203205
fgets	strtok
prefer fgets to read the input and parse the lines in your program using for example sscanf or strtok

6203252
free	malloc
okay here s what it s telling you after 17 times around the loop you are trying to free a pointer that no longer points to a malloc d block

6203303
swt	swing
no unfortunately those behaviors are not supported by swing or swt for that matter

6203320

the general understanding for crud systems is get request post create put update delete delete

6203363
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the view controller is designed and intended to be used full-screen or as part of a uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller etc

6203373
dlsym	dlopen
i have to create another shared object for android which will use the vbox lib created above using dlopen dlsym

6203381
width	height
you may bind the canvas width and height properties using element binding like this

6203381
width	height
you may also wrap the canvas within a scrollviewer of fixed width and height to limit for user screen size

6203388
uiview	subviews
i m using the touchesbegan method in my main uiview to create a second uiview and add it as a subviews

6203388
touchesbegan	touchesended	uiview	subviews
edit the reason i have to find some way to transfer the touchesended is that the initial touchesbegan is received by a uiview that is removed as a subviews at the same time the new uiview is added so the touchesended actually fires immediately as the subviews is removed

6203393
post	put
the main difference between put and post is about their idempotent property

6203393
post	put
post is also more commonly used for partial updates as put generally implies sending a full new representation of the resource

6203393

6203457
fgets	strtok
but i will recommend to read it with fgets and then parse it inside your program with strtok or other means and ways

6203460
wav	caf	wav	aiff	aiff	caf
you can use any sound you desire and you have the rights to - but you need to correctly encode the sound to work on the device caf aiff wav

6203473
pull	push
you can do a normal copy of the folder but if you plan to continue using your local version you should make the copy with the hg clone so you can do a hg pull or hg push to sync the versions

6203473
pull	push
you can still push and pull if you don t use hg clone but it makes it a little easier

6203571
gif	png
i realize static images can t have flash animation animated gif png

6203606
width	height
you should also use scalex and scaley instead of setting a width and height for the scaling going back is only a call to

6203608
width	height
size is a structure with width and height

6203608
width	height
you need two integers to generate it with size width height constructor

6203630
superclass	subclassing
i have a wrapper class with a property whose type is a superclass of several subclassing

6203630
superclass	subclassing
specifically i have a wrapper class with a result field of type superclass but it will always be an instance of some sub class subclassing below

6203630
superclass	subclassing
if i make my wrapper class have its result field defined as subclassing type subclassing it works ok but when it is of type superclass but the instance of of subclassing i get the error

6203634
post	put
if you never permit the client to synthesize urls put is pretty close to update and post can handle create just fine but that s most certainly not the only way to do it

6203671
16-bit	64bit
it also appears that the messages inserted by the dialog editor are based on the 16-bit windows api and need translation for 32 64bit windows

6203688
children	parent
this will return an where item2 of the tuple contains the children for the parent in item1

6203725
queue	fifo
this has an advantage over maintaining a fifo queue with a fixed location for the beginning of valid data because no shuffling of unprocessed items is required

6203725
queue	fifo
if the simple management of items in a fifo queue is your objective then this is most likely the approach you want at least for an initial implementation with items encapsulated as facts

6203730
google-chrome	firefox
it s working fine for ie and firefox but not in google-chrome

6203737
wsdl2java	cxf-codegen-plugin
add the option frontend to the maven cxf-codegen-plugin plug-in and set it to jaxws21 or if using wsdl2java on command line use -fe jaxws21 option

6203742
getter	setter
and the getter and setter in class named bitcomp

6203768
getter	setter
the methods that are defined for current_user are the setter getter methods

6203768
getter	setter
usually you need setter getter in order to be able to set and get stuff from outside of the class

6203792
width	height
you can make the width and height of these graphics relative based on screen size font size etc

6203802

however if you are targeting api level 11 honeycomb you can put in your manifest file and then call to get the max heap per app which may be larger than normal heap size

6203880
width	height
you can have an iframe of width and height 0 so it won t be visible

6203893
width	height
here is the example height 600 width 700

6203917
put	get
note the use of the analogous pure immutable data structures within the context of a state monad in addition to put and get monadic functions which facilitate access to the state contained within the state monad

6203936
width	height
i am also taking into account the width height of the scaled change but for some reason it s always just a bit off

6203961
ethernet	wireless
i have a code which receives packets from the ethernet and sends it via wireless network

6203975
serializable	deserialization
if you do not circumvent the encapsulation it may not be possible to end up with an object that has the exact same state after deserialization as it had prior to serializable

6203997
pull	push
you could setup a nightly cron job on either your machine push or on the network machine pull so that they remain in sync

6204012
google-chrome	firefox
my simplified code is below and the issue is reproducible in desktop google-chrome and firefox as well as the various mobiles i ve tested on

6204046
children	parent
the canonical way to do this is to pass a reference of the parent object down into the children

6204068
tinyint	boolean
the implementation will transform byte to boolean because a tinyint is mapped in byte in java

6204140
uilabel	uibutton
in doing this i explored how apple created their own classes but struggled to work out exactly how things such as uilabel or uibutton worked

6204191
onchange	onblur	onchange	onsubmit	onsubmit	onblur
you could evaluate onblur onchange and onsubmit for the form

6204191
client-side	server-side
i do agree that validating the move on the client-side and server-side would make a lot of sense as well

6204196
action-filter	onactionexecuting
an action-filter s onactionexecuting method receives an actionexecutingcontext which has an actiondescriptor

6204217
put	get
if i try rather than printing my counter printing each variable from the for command i get numbers from 0 to 2 max since that s what i put on my for

6204218
google-chrome	firefox
css works for firefox but not ie or google-chrome

6204232
post	get
thanks to this two post i get the idea of using n to replace n correctly in the final nsstring so is possible to use other valid control characters

6204256
width	height
then set the css style properties width height to both be 100

6204284
rss	feed
in the case of the example above let s say i have a task that runs once a day that grabs the latest soccer-related article from an rss feed

6204290
google-chrome	firefox
the question title was check for google-chrome ie firefox that s what i ve answered

6204402
uitableview	nsindexpath
void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

6204436
spaces	delimiter
so your real problem is that you have spaces in your keywords which solr is also using as a delimiter of sorts in which case the technical solutions listed there are the only ones i know of

6204470
equals	gethashcode
i suspect the problem is that checkboxlistitem doesn t override equals gethashcode so any two instances are effectively distinct

6204502
screens	tablet
also no small number of older apps will display in a phone-sized area leaving the rest of the tablet screens blank

6204503
client-side	server-side
sure that should work but if you re going to mix server-side and client-side code like that why not just use the server-side code to output one bit of client-side code or the other in the first place

6204517
implements	extends
so if you have c extends b implements a c.class.getdeclaredmethods wont return the methods that you haven t overridden

6204545
put	get
if you mean when you put same formula on below cell then when you drag this you ll get them automatically

6204563
post	get
using fiddler i can call the methods on the service get and post successfully and provided i adjust the json we re sending to the webservice to include the session id for example it trundles along happily

6204582
implements	extends
one option i thought of is making commonsettingsandfunction as abstract create a class commonsettingsandfunctionsreal extends commonsettingsandfunctions then implements the real class per project

6204608
titlebar	window
i wrote a small autohotkey script that removes the border titlebar and resize handles of a window and centers it on the first monitor

6204617
post	put
i m planning to put together a blog post and video that goes into more detail on how this is done and what you can do with it but this is the basic idea of how it works

6204621
qobject	qnetworkaccessmanager
i ve got a problem trying to send a request using qnetworkaccessmanager from a qobject derived class

6204624
qslider	qvector
i m trying to create a dynamic qslider that accepts a qvector of integer values and maps them underneath the qslider relative to what position they represent

6204692
google-chrome	firefox
i cannot reproduce this behavior in any other browser tested with the latest firefox and google-chrome browser

6204704
pop-up	dialog
i can not use ajax callbacks because in that case the browser does not pop-up the download dialog

6204753
width	height
i realize percentage height generally do not work but since the image width changes with the screen the height needs to as well so setting no height forces the css to constrain the proportions

6204756
versioning	upgrade
i ve seen implementations that also allow for downgrade statements for each versioning to undo what the upgrade did and this allows for taking a database from versioning 38 back down to versioning 37

6204844
width	height
height 600 width 700

6204919
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
- void tabbarcontroller uitabbarcontroller tabbarcontroller didselectviewcontroller uiviewcontroller viewcontroller

6204946
addclass	removeclass
first you addclass loading then you removeclass loading that s why you didn t see it working you should add loading class before the ajax call when the call returns success you can removeclass

6204962
serializable	deserialization
no serializable deserialization pain

6205016
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
i m writing an nsoperation to make a web service request via a nsurlconnection

6205052
vb.net	vb6
i am trying to convert some old vb6 code into vb.net

6205117
bmp	png
using this product you can create jpg png bmp images from the first page of your pdf files with the specified resolution and then use them as thumbnails

6205122
int	boolean
consider using boolean instead of boolean and int 1 instead of int 1

6205133
implements	extends
to extends rex answer a little bit the reason why java style concurrent modifiable collections are not very interesting in scala is its bias for immuatable data the most common way to implements concurrency in scala is the actor model which relies on immutable data not threads

6205160
children	parent
works fine and lists all the children of the parent but as soon as i navigate to one of the children it obviously doesn t work

6205244
width	height
the numeric parameters for -draw are left top width height

6205256
put	get
it appears that i ve got everything set up right but i get no response when i put a message to the associated queue

6205262
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
read the xml from the other application into a bytearrayoutputstream then when that s done copy the output stream to an inputstream you can use commons-io for that and feed that to the parser

6205282
outputstream	inputstream
i can check what the string is and get an outputstream to the client but whenever i write to it and flush the inputstream client-side is never in a ready state and will never get a message back.

6205320
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
i would like to move my finger on the gray uiview with touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended and my cards move like this

6205350
oncreate	ondestroy
if you thread is using looper and normally all activity s broadcastrecevier s and service s methods oncreate onreceive ondestroy etc

6205361
user-controls	tabcontrol
in my application changing the tab sometimes resizes things and at times the mouse up event will get called on a another user-controls because the tabcontrol moved

6205361
mouseup	mousedown
if i can set the tab pages to switch only on mouseup rather than mousedown it would solve the issue

6205376
folder	directory
i have a browser folder which contains a configure.zcml file - registering the resource directory and my template files

6205449
jar	war
so the solution i found to my specific problem is to simply use the jar command duh to unpack the war rather than restarting the server

6205466
free	malloc
you have to deallocate it via free because you allocated it via malloc

6205496
width	height
this involves retrieving the width and height of the bitmap calculating the number of bytes bitmap requires as calculating the available memory and then bitmapfactory.options.insamplesize such that the bitmap will use less memory than what is available

6205496
tablet	galaxy
on my samsung galaxy tablet the log statement outputted is 3759416.0

6205509
vim	emacs
i am quite certain that trying to make a vim plugin work in emacs is quite impossible

6205509
emacs	aquamacs
on unix like environments emacs is more native and you can use slime which is usually available as a os package or as a separate download for aquamacs

6205537
post	get
100 characters would best be handled through a post request instead of a get

6205584
ubuntu	debian
on my ubuntu also debian based system it system -- administration -- alternatives configurator

6205585
uiview	subviews
add a uiimageview as the first subviews of the uiview you want the dropshadow on

6205632
min	max
to be honest i d assume if they re calculations like rolling averages min max etc sql won t be that slow.

6205724
int	chars
note if the byte s were not ascii chars values representing int it s just an int encoded as four byte s then you would want to look at the bytebuffer class

6205733
hash	salt
first the password should be encrypted if not hash and salt possibly multiple times

6205768
maven	m2e
the problem is maven can not download the javadocs for the dependency or at least m2e download javadoc feature don t work so eclipse don t show me the javadocs when i use the very handy code completion feature

6205804
put	get
that said if you absolutely want a box with an x of type int in it you could try making your own get and put variants something like this

6205859
rss	feed
using simple pie it is really easy to mix multiple rss feed to one

6205880
versioning	upgrade
versioning 1.0.1 of pip seems to be the latest in that running pip to upgrade itself does not download a newer versioning

6205901
post	get
do not perform critical actions save delete modify articles using get requests..use post for those xsrf

6205950
spaces	delimiter
in this example join will contain all the lines of the file concatenated into a single string delimiter by spaces

6205950
spaces	delimiter
you can use whatever delimiter you wish simply by passing it in as the first argument to string.join if you wanted the lines to be separated by a comma and a spaces you d call string.join lines

6206004
stdout	stderr
this wraps the execution so that stdout is piped to out-file but after that wrapping stderr is redirected to stdout so that it can be assigned to variable err

6206006
jar	manifest.mf
the proper way to embed the classpath with the -jar option is to set a class-path directive in the jar s manifest.mf file

6206024
free	malloc
the most painful part is that you may have to override the global new and delete to use winapi functions exclusively because they are likely to use malloc free internally

6206033
vb.net	vb6
you should be doing your new development by creating com components in a .net language for instance vb.net or c# and having your vb6 application call them

6206060
free	malloc
you should allocate a new threadargs structure with malloc for each thread and free it from within the new thread itself

6206076
width	height
height 600 width 700

6206079
gridview	rowdatabound
you can use findcontrol in the rowdatabound event of the gridview

6206079
gridview	rowdatabound
see this rowdatabound function of gridview

6206091
hide	show
i am basically trying to hide a div on the homepage but have it show elsewhere controled by the url

6206107
post	put
because it d be against the tos to post this on jsbin then stackoverflow i just created a div in the shape of an ad but if you put the ad in it ll work

6206118
opera	safari
mobile safari has it and now even opera mini for iphone has it

6206120
post	get
i m looking to make an http post request to a php script on a server from a firefox extension and get json in return

6206121
hide	show
you can then dynamically show hide the relevant fields on the form with javascript based upon the selected employee type as well as setting the corresponding fields as required

6206165
webkit	gecko
check this site it generats css for webkit gecko css3

6206169
plone	buildout
very new to setting up plone 4 and trying to integrate solgema.fullcalendar but when running buildout i get an error saying it needs zope.schema 3.6.0 and i have 3.5.4

6206190
hide	show
or you can check if .is checked and make your own hide show more bullet-proof

6206191
x86	64bit
you likely will need to set the platform target of your .net application to x86 in order to get it working on both the 64bit and 32-bit machines

6206208
for-loop	arrays
however you could easily create a float c-style arrays and iterate with a simple for-loop over it

6206252
multibyte	htmlspecialchars
there are a few east asian multibyte charsets which can differ in their use of ascii code points so if you re using those you would still need to pass a argument to htmlspecialchars

6206258
gentoo	linux
so i m using matlab on a linux gentoo machine

6206266
getter	setter
now there does exist a notion of a getter and a setter inside of the state monad

6206266
getter	setter
the idea is that a lens provides access to a getter that knows how to extract a b from an a and a setter that knows how to take a b and some old a and replace part of the a yielding a new a

6206269
post	put
when the user is back you send a http post put request to upload the data back to the server

6206276
for-loop	arrays
1 arrays indexing starts at 0 when your for-loop starts with i 1 you are skipping the first element

6206284
vb.net	vb6
i have a fairly lengthly block of code that i m trying to convert from vb6 to vb.net

6206342
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
safari uses the proprietary h.264 codec whereas firefox google-chrome and opera all support the open-source theora

6206361
getter	setter
this will prevent coupling while discouraging writing silly tests for getter and setter

6206361
getter	setter
if you write tests for getter and setter you get a false sense of coverage and will not be able to determine if the properties are actually used by functional behavior

6206388
pascal	delphi
you may be able to do this with free pascal which is supposedly compatible with delphi at some level but no guarantees

6206413
oncreate	onstart
it would be best to put all data initialization in onstart or onresume and not oncreate

6206456
put	get
i have the first bit of code done but i don t know how to take in and store all the modules id and then how to get their names in the module table and put them in the gridview

6206498
daemons	systemd
depending on your systemd microseconds might matter an os that goes off for 50 usecs to handle a daemons outside your application might be deadly

6206503
inherited	properties
i can make objects that have prototypal inherited and know to set the prototype properties of a function performing as a constructor to initialize the prototype properties of the object

6206527
children	parent
the same product can be in multiple categories including multiple children of the same parent

6206527
children	parent
for instance if the parent category is bikes and the children are bikes - boys and bikes - girls i want to make sure i m including an ordered product only once in the bikes category row even if it is in both child categories

6206541
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
alternatives are option compare text case-insensitive compare and option compare binary case-sensitive

6206542
pull	push
the reason why this is important is that other people might pull in your commits and base their work on your contributions to the code base and if you later on decide to move that content from one place to another rebase it and push those changes then other people will get problems and have to rebase their code

6206564
getter	setter
you should be doing some validation in your getter and setter so you should be testing that

6206564
getter	setter
if you are returning an array or collection you should be testing whether or not the getter is going to be performing defensive copies of the data passed into the setter before returning

6206565
jar	war
i m working on a multi-project and right now i have a structure that resembles this actually there are a couple of jar projects and a couple of war projects

6206565
jar	war
actually i don t really care where they read them from at compile time but when i package my ear file i want each jar war to appear just once hence reducing the ear size

6206567
button	checkbox
may be copy paste error with name on checkbox and button

6206586
opera	firefox
tested in ie opera and firefox

6206592
boost	stl
but now as i learn more about c++ stl and boost i find that many of my data structure needs can be met by combining stl classes into more complex composites like

6206696
post	get
what you re trying to do is to send post data over get request which is wrong anyway

6206707
servicebehavior	was
i was able to get rid of the this error by decorating the concrete service with the servicebehavior and giving it a namespace

6206749
width	height
i want to be able to do something like this in the infowindow public images # name .jpg width 25 height 32

6206760
post	get
post and get will by definition return content

6206840
stdout	stderr
alternatively you could figure out a way to intercept your own app s stdout and stderr any solution that works on generic unix may work on ios and watch the text for relevant log messages

6206869
hide	show
the question is how to render the fields in the view in such a manner so that the jquery can also be incorporated in such a way which is similar to hard coded page with jquery to hide show fields

6209272
calloc	malloc
try allocating the entry_3d array dynamically using calloc malloc

6209282
children	parent
you could also store the elements in a tree so instead of having a list of strings that are in the parent node format you would have a tree of nodes with children

6210231
int	chars
i am wondering why the parameter to indexof method an int when the description says a chars

6210231
int	chars
a basically what i am confused about is int in java is 32bit while unicode chars are 16 bits

6210231
int	chars
b why not use the chars themselves rather than using int

6210236
integer	fractions
here 333 ptm_ratio gives result in fractions that is been always be rounded of to it s lower integer part so here you can t deal with single or less than 32 pixel

6210247
int	chars
chars in java are stored in their unicode int representation

6210247
int	chars
the methods that accept an int value support all unicode chars including supplementary chars

6210248
int	chars
if you pass a chars into it java will cast the chars to int since chars is a 16-bit number

6210277
int	chars
for your specific question the conversion of int to chars is a narrowing primitive conversion. see section 5.1.3 in the above document

6210277
int	chars
that being said it s a common programming practice to interchange small positive int and chars which are encoded as int

6210332
hex	binary
normaly you use hex notatition not binary because keeping track of so many digits is difficult

6210343
int	chars
the real reason is that indexof int expects a unicode codepoint not a 16-bit utf-16 chars

6210343
int	chars
if you give indexof int a code point 65535 it will search for the pair of utf-16 chars that encode the codepoint

6210389
width	height
my basic understanding here is that the code is setting the viewing port angle to 45 degrees and the width to height ratio of the window size

6210389
width	height
how does changing the orientation and width to height ratio effect the equation

6210397

children	parent
problem i need to display one parent post all it s children posts up to a certain number before requiring pagination and up to 5 comments associated with each child post and the parent

6210639
children	parent
the query returns the parent post all it s children and the first 5 comments it encounters usually they belong to the parent because we are ordering by posttypeid and the parent is the first post

6210639
children	parent
what i need is to return one parent post and all it s children posts and up to 5 comments for each child the parent

6210639
children	parent
the only condition is that the parent and children posts retrieval happens in the same query

6210649

post	get
a post request can alter data in server side a get request musn t change anything

6214087

and the browser can perform this get request without any risk so the problem is on server side every action that can change alter data database session etc must check the request is a post one

unfortunately i have to deal with a uinavigationcontroller and each page has to support both portrait and landscape modes and reproduce the same functionalities in both modes

6216920
portrait	landscape
that means that if a user at some point decides to switch from portrait to landscape the whole app should allow him to navigate back and forth through the pages in the mode he chose

the big.jpg has more width than height so when it s resized the wrapping containers get the correct new height but they still have the old width

6217166

this jsperf benchmark shows the slice indexof solution to be about twice as fast on google-chrome and firefox

6217167
mp3	ogg
if you are storing the actual audio data in the database in a format that the android audio system can natively interpret mp3 3gpp ogg then one way you could do it is to implement a web server in a service and have that service open the sqlite database fetch the blob using cursor.getblob and then feeding that blob out to a mediaplayer instance through the web server by wrapping the byte array with a bytearrayinputstream

6217172
getter	setter
you can use getter and setter ro react on properties change

width	height
after looking at image it seems that it needs explicit height width or else it won t scale down properly

6217326
width	height
it s a bit stupid not to scale to the maxheight but you could always use flex 4.5 image class instead or just create your own to handle max height width

6217367
google-chrome	firefox
it is also worth pointing out that clickonce applications can be only be installed from ie well you can use firefox and possibly google-chrome but the user will have to have a plugin installed. this is because windows installer 3.1 updates ie so that it knows what to do with the .application file

6217381
comparator	comparable
within my add method i need to use the comparator method which i believe means that i also have to extend comparable

6217426

6217432
implements	extends
you do not extends an interface you implements it

6217435
int	boolean
i ve tried testing the bindings of other properties - simple strings boolean and int but the changes made at either end aren t reflected to the other

6217443

you can set up a server or shared directory inside the company firewall for everyone who has access to use and have your offsite people each set up their own local ssh or something you can push and pull from as necessary

6217647

the best solution is to usually uninstaller all prerequisites reboot manually re-install the prerequisites not from the clickonce setup.exe file and then launch the application

i really want to be able to show a thumbnail of a photo without having to go to the server to generate one even if it s just for google-chrome and firefox

i actually picked junit over testng for android testing i thought it was more lightweight than testng for on-device testing

6217784
post	put
the previous post is accurate in terms of a model to put orders or requests into a queue asynchronously and then have them be picked up later

6217822
draggable	droppable
a quick and easy solution would be to tell jquery ui to recalculate droppable positions on every mousemove by using the refreshpositions true option on the draggable

6218120
d3.js	protovis
i ve done a fair amount of work with protovis and a few things with d3.js

6218120
d3.js	protovis
where protovis provides a simplified abstraction layer between the visual properties you re specifying d3.js uses the actual css and dom specs - so instead of .width 10 or .fillstyle #00c you d use .style width 10 or .attr fill #00c

6218120
d3.js	protovis
the result is that using d3.js can feel a little lower-level - you have more control but you have to be pretty familiar with svg syntax to do some of the things protovis does much more easily

6218120
d3.js	protovis
as you note protovis is all rendered in svg while d3.js can use other parts of the dom

6218120
d3.js	protovis
d3.js changes or drops some of the basic protovis utilities like scales and data manipulation

6218120
d3.js	protovis
edit 10 1 12 d3.js has filled out its data utilities but there are still a few that protovis includes and d3.js doesn t pv.dict pv.numerate and pv.repeat

6218120
d3.js	protovis
d3.js api documentation is almost completely lacking incomplete compared to quite detailed docs for protovis

6218120
d3.js	protovis
finally i haven t done much with animation but i think you re entirely correct - d3.js provides more animation support than protovis especially in terms of animated transitions

6218120
d3.js	protovis
edit 7 12 11 it looks like there s a new major difference - as of june 28 2011 protovis is no longer under active development and the protovis team is pushing d3.js instead

6218146
listview	gridview
it will produce the desired layout with a gridview but indeed the asp listview is a better choice

6218254
width	height
meta name viewport content height device-height width device-width initial-scale 1.0 maximum-scale 1.0

6218254
width	height
this viewport sizes the page to the device-screen width and height and does not allow zooming

6218254
mdpi	hdpi
this will require putting an image named splash.png i think any file extension will work in the res drawable- dpi directories there are usually hdpi mdpi and ldpi directories

6218275
innodb	myisam
there are many options that control mysqldump s behavior when dumping myisam and innodb data plus accommodations for making the mysqldump s output perform binary log rotation on the master prior to dumping and preparing replication slaves to change replication coordinates master log file master log position during reload

6218359
setinterval	settimeout
furthermore passing a string to settimeout or setinterval is not recommend

check my post why to use stringbuilder over string to get better performance

6218709
int	chars
if you have a pointer to a chars and assign it to a pointer to an int there might be good reasons to do this but if done accidentally you could well get bus errors or invalid results when you dereference that pointer also on some very old platforms the sizes of the pointers were different

6218749
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
if same uinavigationcontroller is used for all uiviewcontroller you can use uiviewcontroller parentviewcontroller for this purpose

6218783
getter	setter
that thing is just a bunch of variables and doesn t need any getter and setter

6218783
getter	setter
the fact that there s no intelligence in the passthrough methods should be a huge alarm bell telling you that they are quite probably redundant and not helpful- especially since you can t change the public variables without breaking your interface anyway it s not like the getter and setter are decreasing coupling or anything like that

6218789
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in ie8 ie9 and latest google-chrome and firefox but can t seem to get it to show up in ie7

6218815

innodb	myisam
since i am moving the application and database to amazon ec2 and rds i was wondering what are the key considerations when migrating tables from myisam to innodb

6218871
innodb	myisam
create 17 tables with the same structure as they exist on myisam and build them in rds innodb

6218871
innodb	myisam
export data from the myisam tables and import them in to the new tables created in rds on innodb

innodb	myisam
i am worried mainly because i read that innodb and myisam s way of buffering i o cpu and memory usage are different

6219147
post	get
weigh it up between post and get

6219147
post	get
however a post request is less efficient as a get request - bear that in mind and only use post if you really need to

6219153
implements	extends
this way you can implements servlets the usual way by creating classes which extends httpservlet

6219171
for-loop	arrays
arrays use 0 based counting and in your for-loop you go i a.length which means you ll be accessing a element that doesn t exists

6219300
jboss	glassfish

take a look at the functions strtok strchr strstr and strspn .

accessor	properties
the first idea was just to put checking to properties accessor and throw exception on invalid data

6219420
mouseleave	mouseenter
hover can accept two handler functions one for mouseenter and one for mouseleave just add the handlerout function like so

6219428
bash	zsh
approach 1 bash zsh and a few other shells read a file whose name is in the env environment variable after the usual rc files and before the interactive commands or the script to run

6219428
bash	zsh
however bash only does this if invoked as sh and zsh only does this if invoked as sh or ksh which is rather limiting

6219482
ceil	math.h
use the ceil function from math.h

6219507
put	get
so in short words i send a form with information - get results - hit reset - form is all cleared - put in new information - hit submit - nothing happens

6219561
for-loop	loops
it seems like you should probably be defining your list outside of the for-loop and then adding to it in loops

6219566
post	put
i m looking for a truth conditional on whether eggs was selected for the post i can put the conditional in the ajax success function and if so then i have some code to run

6219607
mousemove	mouseup
the first change is in the _mousedown event when the widget is binding the mousemove and mouseup events

6219695
put	get
in the above example the link with rel order could be a get put or delete request

6219704
xlib	cairo	xlib	gdk	gdk	cairo
i have already tried several libraries xlib xrender gdk cairo but none of them works

6219714
mouse	keyboard
you can t control other applications with java but you can control the mouse and keyboard with the robot class

6219797
opensymphony	webwork
the opensymphony webwork project seems to have migrated to apache and struts

6219831
rsa	dsa
you can use standard rsa or dsa signature algorithms to do what you want

6219831
3des	aes
one last note others have proposed using symmetric encryption algorithms like aes 3des etc

6219838
gridview	detailsview
i have a master detail view gridview detailsview which i use for editing reviewing feedback

6219843
google-chrome	firefox
i tested in google-chrome 12 firefox 4.0.1 and ie 9

6219848
3des	aes
a shared secret is easy to code but complete useless in practice which means aes 3des xdes or any other similar cipher are not the answer so you need an scheme that starts based on public key cryptography

6219879
equals	gethashcode
remember to implement equals and gethashcode and just delegate to the underlying object

6219936
keydown	keyup
how to track keyup keydown events in javascript in iphone browsers basically i need to move the focus automatically to next form element once the end user has keyed-in maximum no of characters in a text box

6219947
equals	gethashcode
has gethashcode and equals methods that call the methods on the field

6219952
put	get
if i put quotes around the perl command like so i get the command i do want to execute

6220013
setinterval	settimeout
in your case from your comment i would just use settimeout instead setinterval

6220013
put	get
its only fired once but if you put it in nextslide it will get cleared if its already set and then reset every time regardless of how the nextslide function is called

6220018
post	get
is get every name of the post into a file on my server

6220018
post	get
now i d have to store all the category locations in an array and run this code again to actually get my post names

6220063
post	get
when i get post2 in the addpost action it is return of type mvcapplication.models.post where as when i return the same post in the getpost action it is of type system.data.entity.dynamicproxies.post

6220072
portrait	landscape
on the main.xml tab in graphical layout i ve created a qhd device config with portrait and landscape qualifiers and screen resolution set to 960x540

6220072
width	height
my project is just a simple linearlayout with width and height set to match parent

6220084
prepare	execute
perhaps it should be mentioned that i am using pdo so i can prepare statements once and then execute them several times for different ids.

6220104
execvp	fork
the second fork is not going to be reached in case execvp succeeds because the latter should replace the image of the process and will stop executing the current code

6220151
updatepanel	formview
currently all my pages use an updatepanel containing a formview listview or usually one formview and many listviews one on each tab inside a tabpanel

6220152
fgets	fread
quick rule of thumb use fgets if you intend to read textual data line by line use fread elsewhere

6220168
post	get
in c# if you call new post then you re going to get a post instance not an instance of a proxy subtype of post

6220217
vb.net	vb6
you need to find out what the canvas was in vb6 then you will be able to see what the nearest equivalent is in vb.net

6220258
google-chrome	safari
i have a problem with the following code which doesn t want to work in google-chrome and safari

6220258
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine with firefox and ies but for some reason google-chrome and safari doesn t seem to like it

6220258
google-chrome	safari
to make it even difficult - this is only happening with google-chrome and safari on mac osx 10.5 leopard - but doesn t on snow leopard - using the same versions of browsers google-chrome 11.0.696.71

6220258
google-chrome	safari
it doesn t allow me to log in either - meaning session is not created when using google-chrome or safari on mac os x 10.5

6220296
migrate	upgrade
while attempting to upgrade an existing app s core data model and migrate legacy data i just ran across a scenario where a third-party framework was writing data into an app s database

6220315
ubuntu	centos
we develop on ubuntu macs and deploy rpms to centos this is the settings can t be changed much

6220354
width	height
the current config just shows the first image the entire width and almost height of the screen and the second image is not shown at all

6220360
preventdefault	keyup
i don t think you can preventdefault which is what you d need to use to stop the browser from performing the default action for a key on the keyup event - it is fired after the default event has already occurred

6220360
submit	submission
as for stopping the form from submission you could bind to the submit event and return false

6220365
actionscript	haxe
you could use haxe to create one single codebase that will translate to javascript as well as actionscript

6220378
macports	homebrew	fink	macports	fink	homebrew
i strongly recommend to install all the versions using a package manager homebrew macports fink etc. so they ll be easier to manage

6220408
int	chars
the data currently consists of float int datetime bit chars and string

6220451
post	get
my problem is that i m having some users writing bots that are interacting with these urls to post messages and get updates

6220476
post	get
does it matter whether it s passed in the post or get

6220488
system.in	system.out
i mean something like printf scanf c functions or the system.out system.in java classes with relative console creation

6220490
chi-squared	kolmogorov-smirnov
that means for each run i where i ranges from 1 to 100 000 read in the first i values of average-age add them to a list and run a few tests like kolmogorov-smirnov or chi-squared

6220499
128bit	64bit
the multiplication can similarly be constructed using ptx inline assembly by breaking the 128bit numbers into 32-bit chunks computing the 64bit partial products and adding them appropriately

6220642
post	get
often these web api s take structured data in a post or cgi variables in a get and don t return html but rather xml or json or some other programming-friendly return data

6220659
hash	salt
i am using the following php function to salt hash user passwords for a web app

6220678
maven	m2e
the best way imo is to use m2e - maven plugin for eclipse

6220678
maven	pom.xml
in maven all the dependencies are defined in pom.xml and downloaded automatically as needed

6220699
jtextfield	jlabel
a simple jlabel to show the image with the problem and a jtextfield for the answer will be enough

6220722
hash	salt
you are not adding too much security by iterating through the same salt and hash over and over and over again

6220729
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works splendidly in google-chrome safari firefox

6220741
degrafa	flex
for this you could use flex and axiis which is a tool to make complex charts based on degrafa

6220754
puts	gets
i am using a rhomobile rhodes app to talk to a web service and display content in a webview when i send the login information in a rho asynchttp.post with the login details and a callback i can see a successful login on the web service and the application gets a cookie that i can puts and view

6220795
pkcs#12	pfx
i have been able to openssl tools to extract the certificate and private key bytes from an existing pfx pkcs#12 file

6220855
post	get
the reason is that when the post back occurs for the button12 click the button does not exist in the control heirarchy anymore so the event handler does not get hooked up and therfore will not fire

6220893
post	get
have tried submitting the curl request parameters via post and get via each of the following command line curl flags -d -f and -g

6220919
implements	extends
the application i am maintaining appears to use the first for straight servletsand the second for anything implements via gwt-rpc which itself extends servlet

6220966
width	height
each one of those can be a with a hover effect to change the background color image and the which sits inside just covers the entire div with a height and a width in your css

6220971
vb.net	jscript.net
this last method works fine in c# and vb.net however there are other languages that do not support initializing biginteger with literals such as jscript.net phalanger

6220980
trie	tree
see so question trie prefix tree in python for more info about implementations

6221001
gnu	uclibc
this works with the gnu version of libc haven t tried it with uclibc yet

6221005
pop-up	dialog
i have a wpf datagrid that has it s columns generated dynamically in code and i need to insert small buttons in each column s header to the right of the text to implement custom complex filtering in a pop-up dialog

6221027
addclass	removeclass
i didn t originally have the complicating addclass and removeclass this is what i was originally working with and it didn t work either

6221046
innodb	myisam
one issue is that an insert or update to an event now may also include one or more insert update deletes to the cross-reference table which on myisam means the cross-reference table is locked and on innodb means the rows are locked so if your database is busy with a significant number of writes you re going to have a larger contention problems than if just the event rows were locked

6221075
hdfs	oozie
i am trying to use oozie for running a simple mapreduce job that searches for a string value in hdfs location and if it finds it it outputs it

6221098
width	height
both result in a bitmap object with width and height of -1 so when i then try and use the bitmap as a texture it doesn t show

6221100
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome works firefox works ie doesn t work explorer doesn t work

6221109
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview subclass called tipballoon that i ve added as a subviews of a uitextview but when i touch tipballoon it doesn t focus the text view even though by default

6221112
helpers	actioncontroller
to call getinvokearg within an action helpers you must first get the current actioncontroller which you can do within action helpers by calling the getactioncontroller method

6221129
google-chrome	firefox
what s even more weird is that both google-chrome firefox are now showing the error when i visit other websites

6221148
wav	aiff	mp3	aiff	mp3	wav
in addition to mp3 and wav naudio can also open aiff and wma files with the aifffilereader and wmafilereader classes

6221160
equals	gethashcode
edit also in order to use you ll need to ensure that discussion_category implements equals and gethashcode

6221161
hide	show
i have one div which i want to hide and show with link

6221163
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
while supported by ie google-chrome and opera firefox doesn t support it

6221173
portrait	landscape
i have code that detects the rotation of the device and re-arranges the panels accordingly so there s 3 panels wide on portrait and 4 panels wide on landscape

6221185
implements	extends
the imageadapter class should extends android.widget.baseadapter - there are plent of example around showing how to implements an adapter of this type

6221193
hide	show
this part works flawlessly with minor hide show glitches which i assume are related to using the existing animations in a way they weren t meant to but so not the point right now

6221237
post	get
it performs a post instead of a get

6221242
implements	extends
public class impacts extends activity implements view.onclicklistener

6221262
keydown	keyup
my idea my own nstextview overwrite keydown or keyup and get the event keycode or something similar

6221284
sqldatasource	linqdatasource
i ve got the answer if i were using sqldatasource by overriding the insert statement and use the identity property but when i use the linqdatasource i couldn t override the insert statement

6221306
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the right aligned image arrow is pushed down in firefox mac but not safari or opera dependent on the length of the text to the left and above

6221325
onfocus	onblur
to make this prettier you could put a div behind the textbox onfocus so it hides the actual site content and you could center the textbox using the top and left css properties just make sure to clear those too onblur

6221344
google-chrome	safari
i ve tested this in google-chrome safari ie and they all seem to do the same thing so i don t think the problem is browser specific

6221359
width	height
for my sample height 65 width 375 horizontalresolution verticalresolution 150.01239

6221359
width	height
msdn says height and width are in pixels but the horizontalresolution and the verticalresolution are pixel per inch

6221378
public	protected
extending gives you access to all of the public and protected variables and functions however not the private ones

6221389
gtk	clutter
i would like to write an app targeting gtk 3 and clutter

6221408
mouse	keyboard
the parent window should remain key support resizing but cannot be navigated responded to via keyboard or mouse

6221452
cakephp	yii	codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	yii
yii codeigniter akelos symfony prado cakephp and solarphp

6221455
awt	swing
android has no awt nor swing related classes in its runtime

6221456
width	height
this suggests you didn t set width and height values for your img element arrow.png so the first time it has no idea what size it s going to be and subsequent times it does

6221456
width	height
otherwise you could just apply or add width and height attributes to the img element

6221482
width	height
i set width and height of that offdiv like below

6221499
try-catch	exception-handling
however lift-json also throws an exception-handling if it is unable to convert the jvalue to a device so i ve wrapped my whole request with helper.tryo a lift helper method that wraps a try-catch call returning a box

6221500
super	extends
amazingly easy to template and super easy to extends

6221519
for-loop	loops
i m trying to break up the animations via a for-loop and several if loops within but it doesn t work

6221594
uiview	subviews
if the uiview is a subviews of your textview you should be able to call

6221599
put	get
the solution is to put all the stuff after the get set into the callback since you don t want anything happening until after that taburl is finished being set.

6221605
express	node.js
i am creating an express js app on node.js and have implemented a page that will callback for live updates as per chat.nodejs.org i ve followed the approach in node_chat to a t and the page updates correctly if an update is made from another browser

6221606
width	height
is on the right track but the image needs to be loaded before you can try to read the width height

6221638
super	self
note this is what i see in intruments when i take autorelease out and after i changed the if self super init to if self super init

6221676
getter	setter
all those fields have getter and setter

6221724
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
m is a superclass of foo so foo#bar overrides m#bar because that s how inherited works subclassing override superclass not the other way around

6221768
post	get
the error i get as in the post is could not find datatype with id 71b8ad1a-8dc2-425c-b6b8-faa158075e63 so searching for this id in the cmsdatatype table is returning nothing and leaving me with nothing to modify

6221768
post	get
i ve been upgrading from umbraco 3.0 managed to get to v4 but whilst i could see the blog on the front end no problem trying to edit a post in the back end was showing an error when clicking on the blog post error page was appearing on the right where the content edit pane would normally appear

6221827
hid	keyboard
usb msrs magnetic stripe readers are often set up as hid devices which means that input looks just like it s coming in over the keyboard

6221884
pseudo-class	visited
instead of manipulating the pseudo-class directly create real classes that model the same things like a hover class or a visited class

6221931
uiview	subviews
then add this uiview as a subviews of your uitabbar

6221931
hide	show
this way showing and hiding the uitabbar will automatically show or hide your uitoolbar now you can animate the showing and hiding of your uitoolbar and still have it disappear each time the uitabbar does

6221936
getter	setter
i type setter and first option on the menu is the generate getter and setter wizard

6221959
width	height
the easiest method here is to simply call g.clearrect width height

6221977
oncreate	onstart
you can set the image in your oncreate then in onstart launch a asynctask that will sleep for 1 second then load the second image and then sleep for another second and then launch your main screen

6222076
post	get
i have the following code to get the selected item value and post it to a div

6222090
getter	setter
i am trying to build a base class that all of my classes extend from that allows for property access through simple syntax but if get_property or is defined then any attempt to get or set that property is routed through those getter and setter

6222090
getter	setter
i would just write getter s and setter but they vary based on the db schema and it would be lovely if there was an elegantly simple solution

6222107
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
it literally replaces malloc calloc realloc free to add instrumentation code

6222112
min	max
there is one for columns betweencolumns as well and the function between just returns true false if a given number is between a min and max value

6222114
implements	extends
i haven t used the implements keyword before and i ve been trying to use it to implements the ieventdispatcher class to see if this would allow me to use addeventlistener in a class that extends object this is my understanding of what it s for - correct me if i m wrong

6222142
free	malloc
i don t want dataptr hanging around for the entire execution of the program and it may change in size anyway so i want to malloc free it as necessary

6222172
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have the same result in google-chrome firefox and safari

6222175
maven	pom.xml
i m defining a dependency in pom.xml in a maven 3 project

6222246
uiview	calayer
subclass uiview and calayer which becomes layer for view and displays image

6222266
mouse	trackpad
i would like to invert the trackpad or mouse movements so sliding up would go down on the screen and sliding down would go up this is just general cursor movements not gestures

6222267
sorting	filtering
if you have an inequality filtering and are also sorting the output you need to sort first on the column used in the inequality filtering

6222272
getter	setter
track shows how i set up getter setter for a set of keys

6222296
ssl	https
if they meant https then you will need to set up your server to use ssl

6222337
integer	unsigned
now to break it up into their parts from a unsigned integer is the next goal

6222345
postgresql	mysql
with propel as its orm where some data is stored in mysql database and some other data is stored on another server in postgresql database

6222345
postgresql	mysql
to be more precise i want to store some models in mysql database and other models in postgresql database at the same time and do it seamlessly without explicit database switching i mean propel will use proper database connection and sql dialect to retrieve store data

6222345
postgresql	mysql
models from mysql part will not have relations with postgresql

6222345
postgresql	mysql
if yes i also would like to know how to setup development environment i want to access different mysql postgresql dbs in developement and production environments

6222350
jar	war
if your external jar files are in a war web-inf lib directory as part of your project if you go into configure build path and add them as external jar files they are added using a full qualified path which is not what you want

6222350
jar	war
if you open the actual war web-inf lib directory in your project and right click on the jars and select build path add to build path then the jar files are added with a relative path

6222376
hash	salt
forgive me if i m missing something but looking at your hash and your model you don t seem to store the salt anywhere instead you use a new salt each time

6222376
hash	salt
so when the password is set you must store both the hash and the salt

6222376
hash	salt
when you want to check an entered password you retrieve the salt compute the hash using it then compare against the stored one

6222380
children	parent
note the recursive call to flatten and that this is an extension method defined on the function that returns the children from a given parent item

6222380
children	parent
and then assuming that all dimension parent and children properties are not null we can use this query to produce the list of records to add to the table

6222400
freemarker	velocity
for frontend templating you can use either jsp freemarker velocity or gsp

6222422
implements	extends
on the other hand if you don t want to implements custom functionality you can just extends eventdispatcher

6222441
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for some reason in google-chrome safari firefox ie8+ it works great but in ie7 it opens the form in a pop up window

6222482
tabs	tabpanel
i have a main tabpanel to navigate through all the pages and in one of these pages i have another tabpanel with 3 tabs

6222484
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
in ie9 firefox and opera everything is the same width but in google-chrome my default browser the textarea overflows unless the width is set to 304px

6222540
post	get
i am using twitter4j to post to twitter but you have to open up the browser and get a pin from twitter for my app to be able to do this and that works but when i return to my app the activity times out and closes itself

6222548
int	boolean
it allows you to for instance return a boolean indicate success or failure and an int value that serves some other purpose

6222558
int	chars
for this reason java chars are 16-bit unsigned int

6222562
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve been trying to sum up values over a swipe and see how different browsers report values and they vary a lot with safari reporting order of magnitude bigger numbers on almost all platforms google-chrome reporting quite more like 3 times more than firefox firefox being balanced on the long run but quite different among platforms on small movements on ubuntu gnome nearly only +3 or -3 seems like it sums up smaller events and then send a big +3

6222568
google-chrome	safari
i have a text input field on a page however i m finding it difficult trying to vertically center the field in webkit google-chrome + safari

6222568

for those wanting to see this in action visit and observe the search field in both firefox and safari google-chrome

6222576
button	checkbox
button checkbox and select

6222582
google-chrome	firefox
in other browsers such as firefox google-chrome ..the marker animates with the text when the list item s animation is playing

6222642
pull	push
whenever i run a command that requires permissions ssh keys to access a remote git push git pull it fails with the following error

6222695
hide	show
temp sign-in as lantiis here can independently show hide

6222751
width	height
whenever you see yourself using layout_weight when you are also using fill_parent for both width and height then you know that you are doing something wrong

6222776
google-chrome	firefox
the following example is working fine in firefox and google-chrome with the exact json you provided

6222821
integer	unsigned
what is happening is that in order for guid 0 to return an unsigned integer it is trying to convert guid from a negative signed integer to an unsigned integer resulting in 0x7fffffffffffffff then shifting it over zero places which is an identity operation resulting in the same 0x7fffffffffffffff

6222855
uiview	subviews
i had the same problem after trying various ideas i just added a subviews a shadow colour gray behind the uiview i needed to have a shadow see code included is the code for 3.2.x 4.x as well

6222972
width	margin
i just made up values for the width and the margin but you should get the idea

6222994
submit	submission
when submission using an a submit button then ie will ask you if you want to save the password

6223039
pull	push
i don t ever want to pull from bitbucket only push so that it can then be grabbed by appharbor and deployed

6223069
portrait	landscape
i am taking print as landscape in javascript as there was no standard code so i changed it to like that i rotate my page div to 90 degree which makes it landscape way and then perform window.print but the problem is i made it fool as basically it is portrait printing in landscape way so the text is quite small and fields also i want that they should be zoomed so is there anyway to zoom the page for printing

6223080
pop-up	dialog
i don t know exactly how actionscript facebook sdk works but if it is using facebooks javascript sdk try changing display mode from pop-up to dialog so that it shows in the same window

6223081
int	chars
however i d like to constrain a to be int or float or chars with no other valid types for a

6223159
min	max
currently max life time is 30 min i want to change this to 10 hrs

6223184
subscript	superscript
yes it you use nvarchar and the correct subscript superscript characters

there are many differences between myisam and innodb but the main points that you should be aware of before the migration.

6227293
innodb	myisam
innodb does not have compressed indexes like myisam so its going to take more space

6227293
innodb	myisam
create tables with similar structures as the myisam but only with the engine changed to innodb

6227294
ienumerable	iqueryable
you could use single or first if you re expecting only 1 result or want to use the first result respectively or you need to write code based on there being an ienumerable iqueryable of objects returned

6227354
innodb	myisam
it would be completely ok to use innodb instead of myisam for selecting user data

most fonts will adjust spacing based on the specific width height and kerning of each character but a monospace font will allow you to use spaces for alignment

6228006
post	get
you generally don t intend for backslashes to be interpreted in this way in a path so -- even though all the backslashes in your post are interpreted literally -- it is generally a good idea to get in the habit of using raw strings r appdata local temp to specify paths so you don t get unexpected surprises later

6228084

6228840
google-chrome	firefox
the fade works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome

6228871
post	get
however - after a post - if it is successful you should by design be redirecting to a get action for your next data

6228906
post	get
to get the data in the server side you have to get a way to get the raw post string instead of using a dictionary-like structure

6228917
post	get
unfortunately facebook loads the iframe page using an http post not an http get and is not compatible since amazon has a rest interface and properly uses post to upload modify content

nsurl	nsstring
from the code samples i read i don t think i ve seen apple storing url s as nsstring as instance variables it s usually an nsurl instance

6228946
nsurl	nsstring
whether it s a url to a remote or local location i believe the most conventional thing to do would be to store it in the class as an nsurl and when you need to work on the path retreive the string using nsurl s absolutestring and the name of the local nsstring in that case would be path filepath resourcepath imagepath

6228969
post	get
what it s meant to do is go through all your friends and get all their status post and order them

6229090
ssl	https
you want to worry about serving your pages over ssl https but your js over straight http from a different source

6229095
getter	setter
but getting an existing attribute indeed seems of less general utility though one could imagine a situation where you were passing around attribute nodes sometimes created anew without an element and sometimes retrieved from an existing element--using getattributenode allows you to avoid building your own object which has getter and setter and handle them with the same interface

6229127
opennlp	lingpipe
lingpipe opennlp etc

6229134
strlen	strcmp

you should attempt to avoid image scaling by placing the image somewhere on the page where the css does not affect its size as a test try making a blank page containing just the image and remove any custom height width attributes if they exist

6230002
put	get	post	get	post	put

mergesort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort	quicksort	heapsort
the use of quicksort and introsort which is a variant of the former with guaranteed o n log n performance achieved by switching to heapsort on worst case inputs in place of other theoretically better algorithms like mergesort is due to the fact that the average case is the same and the constants much lower in the constants you can include the fact that it can be sorted in place so there are no reallocations and copies

minimum	max
i know how to use the event.resize function to make my image proportional with the browser using stage.stagewidth height but i am trying to figure out a way to have a movieclip or image scale up or down to a certain dimension such as on browser resize the image max would be 640x480 and the minimum being 320x240

6231369
allocator	stl
this is because a stl container s std allocator actually uses the placement version of the new operator to copy construct the objects in pre-allocated memory blocks and that requires the existence of a copy-constructor to copy the actual instance of the object you re wanting to add to the container into the memory address that had been pre-allocated by the container s allocator

6231381
firefox	safari
but the css doesn t display at all on firefox 4.0.1 or safari 5.0.5 also checked firefox on windows 7

as a rule of thumb only use free on what was allocated with malloc and only use delete on what was allocated with new

6231536
google-chrome	firefox
i ve run into a bug with my app that i traced down to inconsistent text rendering between google-chrome and firefox 4

google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome tells me that a certain string of text is 215px wide whereas firefox 4 tells me its 218px wide

6231536

a bit of searching indicates that the issue is with firefox 4 not google-chrome

6231551

just fyi i don t use exceptions in codeigniter tho i m using them a lot in kohana just because the framework throws them and everything is designed to work with exceptions unlike codeigniter

6231551
codeigniter	kohana
i don t really don t want to enter in framework comparison discussions but i need to compare two pieces of code to clarify your question one piece from ci2 and another from kohana 3 it born as a branch of codeigniter with better object oriented implementation

6231563
ostringstream	std
so i m using ostringstream and set the flag std ios showpoint

6231596
for-loop	loops
in your for-loop test you re referencing a variable val which probably comes back as having a length of 0 so your loops will never do anything and the function will simply return true

6231626
ati	nvidia
it s a nice library build by ms research that runs your code on anything that has lots of cores many-core nvidia ati gpus and multi-core processors

6231663

free	malloc
as littleadv proposed i would override new delete probably malloc free and trace the allocations and the size of them

6231800
width	height
chances are you re using divisions because you need block-level behavior like width and height

6231820
hide	show
after the hide method is called the visible property returns a value of false until the show method is called

6231838

there is actually a dedicated version of firebug for that called chromebug named after the google-chrome of firefox not google s google-chrome

6231929
temp	tmp
sort 1 actually does a pretty good job of handling large data though you ll want to look at the --temporary-directory argument if you think it will overflow tmp with its temp files while chewing through the stuff you feed it

6231944
for-loop	arrays
maybe try casting to arrays in your for-loop this is untested and may not work as is but should get you on the right track

6232145
width	height
if you mean that you want your terminal to have the entire width and height of the viewport then adding css to this effect

i m using the script to show and hide a div

6232244
hide	show
what happens is that it only show the content and never hide

neither uitabbarcontroller nor uinavigationcontroller is a view

6232265
navigationcontroller	modalviewcontroller
if you have an actualview controlled by an actualviewcontroller that is pushed on top of a rootview controlled by a rootviewcontroller that is the rootviewcontroller for the navigationcontroller and you also have a modalview controlled by a modalviewcontroller then put

however i ve noticed that png s and gif s uploaded and converted to jpg s end up with a strange colors and some kind of in-versing effect

6232313
gif	png
i know jpg s don t support transparency but i ve recently found the need to accept png s and gif s and not convert them to jpg.

6232331

you are given a rectangle with width x and height y

6232441
implements	extends
my action class extends another class baseaction that extends actionsupport and implements sessionaware

6232505
put	get
if you still get errors also put your web service s certificate into your client trust store as well

6232743
put	get
i can put garbage in the file and get a 500 error

6232776
put	get
one way to get the real client-side id is to pull the value from the clientid property of the control but you should only look at that value once it has been put in a controls collection

6232784
comparator	comparable	int	double
if you can change what you put into the column to something that implements the comparable interface int double then it will use that comparator instead

6232784
implements	extends
in order to do that you will have to extends defaulttablemodel or implements abstracttablemodel or tablemodel and override the getcolumnclass method

6232842
fileoutputstream	gzipoutputstream
the equivalent gzipped content written out using the gzipoutputstream and fileoutputstream to the local file system

6232842

6232867
nunit	mstest
i have tried the tests with nunit and with mstest with the same behavior in both environments

6232905
parent-child	one-to-many
personally i prefer to use nulls with some judicious moving of data to child tables if the data is truly a different entity and often these fields turn out to need the one-to-many structure of a parent-child relationship anyway such as when you may or may not know the phone number of a person put it in a separate phone table and then you will often discover you needed to store multiple phone numbers anyway

6232944
hash	md5
hash values such as sha1 and md5 are used to verify integrity

6233147
uiview	subviews
if you re adding subviews you should probably have b subclass uiview instead of uiviewcontroller

6233188
subtract	add
the most obvious thing to do is to add up all the other blocks in the container and subtract that from the container height

6233241
int	chars
the reason ghc can t just infer that a needs to be chars is that theoretically you could have one instance collection tree chars chars and another collection tree int chars

6236061
int	chars
it sounds like you might be interested in packing the data as tightly as possible from your comment on converting int to chars in which case maybe you should just write a set of low level packing routines at either end

6236070
int	chars
input a string and convert to an int if it s not your exit chars string

6236089
jsf	seam
if have a web application and huge object graphs it is a great benefit if you are using jpa hibernate and something like seam thus having all objects under entity manager control even in your jsf managed beans

6236110
width	height
on the other hand width and height is always correct it is used by window manager so it should better be

6236110
width	height
i d say the best idea is to do the width height checking always

6236110
width	height	portrait	landscape
if you think about a moment this is exactly what you want - to know if width is smaller than height portrait the opposite landscape or if they are the same square

6236157
folder	dir	folder	directory
i am asking because i noticed that on a mac it is like the .app folder is the file launched and not the jar inside and thus the parent dir is the working directory where all my files will be stored

6236269
uitextview	uiresponder
theorically since uitextview is a subclass of uiresponder you should be able to override methods like the one you shown

6236269
uitextview	uiresponder
however you should try it by yourself because the last time i tried in ios 3.0 there were some methods that were not called uitextview implementation changed a lot between 2.x and 3.0 it seemed to me that uitextview was hijacking some uiresponder methods and won t let the user use them

use adb logcat ddms or the ddms perspective in eclipse to examine logcat and look at the warnings or errors that mediaplayer generates to give you more clues

6236456
websphere	ibm
for java and websphere try some competitors like ibm sun oracle or novell i m not up to date in the java world but those companies float to the top of my mind in this regard

6236467
listview	gridview
i found out that the overrides isenabled and areallitemsenabled from baseadapter will only be called if the adapter is attached to a listview but not to a gridview

6236467
listview	gridview
you are welcome to create your own clone of gridview that attempts to implement the stuff you ll find in lookforselectablepositiononscreen in the listview implementation but this is unlikely to be easy

6236473
put	get
please can anyone help put me through on what exactly i need to do so i can get my first app running

6236479

6236749
opera	firefox
if testing pages with either firefox or opera both of those will report errors such as code that is not well-formed and mismatched tags

6236755
implements	extends
you can extends baserequestlistener class and implements its oncomplete method to do that

6236801
int	boolean
one difference i can see easily is that a bundle allows you to put int boolean etc. into it while a hashmap seems to require you to convert them to from objects

6236834
lxml	beautifulsoup
i found beautifulsoup lxml and mechanize to be quite usefull

6236892
content-length	content-type
your headers here could include content-length 0 omit the content-type header and so on

6237200
textview	imageview
i have a custom listview with imageview and textview in a row

6237288
unsigned	short
because the shift operator operated on a single unsigned char you ll need further code to copy to the next 3 or 4 unsigned chars into an auxiliary short long then or-copy to the result the relevant bits that will make the full unsigned long

6237376
distance	polygons
if each query is applied to a different unpredictable polygons then the only solution you have is essentially the total inspection of all polygons edges with point-to-segment distance testing for each one

6237449

6237471
width	height
so height and width of the blocks are 3

6237508
mouse	keyboard
i did some debugging experiments and it appears that though mouse stays still over controll the mousemove is actually called frequently and not only when control move is caused by some ui behaviour scrolling of parent controll called using keyboard

in addition to numeric values each property can take the strings show hide and toggle

6237518
hide	show
in addition to numeric values each property can take the strings show hide and toggle

6237528
hide	show
toggle toggles between show and hide

6237528
hide	show
in addition to specific values we can also specify one of the strings hide show or

6237528
hide	show
like the hide and show commands

6237553
super	self
as such they go through all the same dynamic dispatch you can use self to access other class methods you can use super to call into the superclass s class methods

6237558
width	height
this is caused by the implicit width and height of 100 on the svg element

6237561
hide	show
and even better use show and hide instead of setting the display

6237634
put	get
so that if you want get info from one machine we have to use get method and add info in one system we need to use the method post..like wise put and delete

6237653
hide	show
as you can see when the user changes the tab the code show the new tab child and hide the old ones

6237825

6237825
post	get
i also get a ienumerable of the different post types

6237825
post	get
i get 1 is invalid 1 being the value of the select list which makes sense as my post model expects a posttype object not int

6237858
versioning	upgrade
recent versioning of delphi support png natively amongst many other enhancements and you would be well advised to upgrade

6237866
int	boolean
i updated the old version now it should support unquoted values such as int and boolean

6237894
multiplying	add
if you parse a mere tokenizer just gives you and then you have to figure out how to do the 2 3 before adding the 4 to get 10 and not just brute force add 4 and 2 then multiplying by 3 which gives the wrong answer of 18

6237900
h.264	webm
don t expect anything else than h.264 and webm to work and you need both

6237900
h.264	webm
even fast low-quality encode of h.264 and webm is going to give you compression much much better than m-jpeg

6237962
for-loop	loops
you ll need to do loops differently probably with a for-loop instead of for each

6237967
hide	show
the way it works is by default we hide any element we don t want to be show on pages example disqus adding the class .pagefix between in the div wrapper we can tell it to show elements on posts with tags that way elements will only be show on posts and not pages because pages don t have tags

6237968

how am i supposed to do this i am a complete noob never been using g++ gcc mingw etc i looked on the internet for a solution to my problem but didn t find anything

6238088
goto	break
move the declaration of x outside of the for-loop and replace your label goto combination with a break like so.

6238124
for-loop	loops
agree with unset - using break will break if loops and keep iterating through for-loop

6238145
associativity	operator-precedence
basically associativity is expressed inherently through operator-precedence or through user introduced sub-expressions parentheses

6238159
typedef	struct
just make sure you use the qt typedef and struct and not the microsoft windows ones.

6238161

but it works good for me and it s easy to implement no overriding of activity s onpause onresume onstart onstop nor writing of special thread methods like resume pause are required

6238215
vbscript	vba
i need some excel vba examples where with in the vba code excel macro i could call a vbscript and will get some values like filename and directory information from the vbscript and assign it to the variables in vba code

goto	break
and the goto becomes a break and resets the stop condition

6238220
kate	kdevelop	kate	kde
it works for quanta as well as a bunch of other kde editors like kate and kdevelop

6238250
interpolation	splines
the n-dimensional interpolation routines i have found are not quite good enough i would prefer splines over linearndinterpolator for smoothness and i have far too many data points often over one million for a radial basis function to work

6238274
width	height
so if i set height attribute to 40 i might find myself with images larger than 120 width

6238274
width	height
if i set both width to 120 and height to 40 well it fits but the original ratio is lost and i don t want that

6238305
width	height
do not set any width or height properties these might cause problems

6238311
children	parent
so bring the stuff that is common into a parent class and the stuff that is different into the children

6238394
post	put
setting this option will fake put and delete requests with a http post and pass them under the _method parameter

6238407

6238427
google-chrome	firefox
my tests on ubuntu 11.04 with google-chrome 11 and firefox 4

6238489

tiff	png	gif	png
the small open source syngdiplus library is able to load and save gif tiff and png pictures

6238531
interpolation	splines
smooth splines interpolation in dim 2 is difficult to implement and so there are not many freely available libraries able to do that in fact i don t know any

6238558
primefaces	richfaces
there are many jsf components richfaces primefaces etc. which you advised me to use and gave me steps for implementation

6238573

wav	ogg	wav	aiff	aiff	ogg	mp3	ogg	mp3	aiff	mp3	wav
i have tried support of midi mp3 ogg aiff and wav files on ruby interpreter after installing rubygame and it works fine

6238606
wav	ogg	wav	aiff	aiff	ogg	mp3	ogg	mp3	aiff	mp3	wav
but when i use and try it on the rails framework only midi format is working and the rest of the formats mp3 ogg aiff and wav are getting executed but there is no sound

6238667
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it is small enough to be embedded in many apps see here for a list of famous apps ranging from photoshop to apple mail + safari dropbox firefox google-chrome skype and more yet complete enough to cover most sql aspects you may need

6238693
put	get
so say there was a folder and i wanted to get the first file in that folder and put the name in a string

6238899
folder	directory
i have it starting from the folder c messy but currently a user can go to all directory from this starting position

6238931
dictionary	map
i guess most people just use a std map and have swig convert it to a python dictionary

6238974
ienumerable	ilist
for example if your routine were expecting an ienumerable of car but were passed an ilist of hondacivic it would be nice if you could use its read-by-index function

6238974
ienumerable	ilist
the reverseprint function casts or converts an ienumerable to an ilist and outputs it in reverse order

6238986
put	get	post	get	post	put
i get the same number of li -elements as i put in but they all seem to be evaluated to null as explained in my previous post

6238991
hide	show
this is a recurring problem with some dojo animation effects such as show hide wipein wipeout etc

6238991
hide	show
then when you call .show also set style to left 0 - you only need to this the first time you call show because on the next hide .show everything works well

but if the application is deployed archived in a ear that contains an war that contains a jar scannotation can t scan my classes

6239148
minimum	max
the goal is to minimize the max travelling time making this sort of a minimum makespan problem

6239200
ienumerable	ilist
a routine expecting an ienumerable of car will be perfectly happy if given an ienumerable of hondacivic which in turns means it would be happy with an ilist of hondacivic

6239228
button	checkbox
it is here that you must set the state of the checkbox because a checkbox or radio button does not change its state automatically

6239253
x86	64bit
i m expecting this component to be installed on both x86 32-bit and x64 64bit boxes running the appropriate flavour of windows

6239322

if you however need to get your data from a xml-file like from the web you can use a xml-parser to get your informations from the xml-file and put them in the database using preparedstatement s

6239336
next	except
the problem is that scanf of pretty much anything will leave the characters after the value you read usually a newline in the buffer except that c reads the next character regardless of what it is

6239379
stdout	stderr
ffmpeg is writing that information to stderr not stdout

6239379
stdout	stderr
notice the redirection of stderr to stdout

6239385

i need to create separate controller files extendedmapviewcontroller.h and extendedmapviewcontroller.m that will contain methods that control 2 more items in the mapview.xib a segmented control that can change the map s type and a button that will hide and show the segmented control

6239401
vim	textmate	vim	emacs	emacs	textmate
off the top of my head i know vim emacs textmate and pycharm all support django s template syntax and i d imagine many more do as well

int	boolean
rather than use boolean you should use an int counter

6239470
subtract	add
functions to add and subtract cells

6239565
width	height
it works in firefox as long as you set the appropriate 180px height for the 320px width video 16 9 aspect ratio - otherwise the curved borders aren t visible because they re outside the frame of the video

6239607
integer	unsigned
unlike java c has unsigned integer types

6239607
integer	unsigned
you should always use unsigned integer types for bitwise manipulation like this

6239645
dbcontext	objectcontext
the first problem is that this object is not directly accessible from dbcontext api - you must convert dbcontext to objectcontext and use objectstatemanager to get the access to objectstateentry representing the relation

6239645
dbcontext	objectcontext
more discussion about this problem global in ef is here - it is not related to the dbcontext api but because the new api is just wrapper of the old objectcontext api same problems remain

6239654
public	protected
the usual fix is to give the public and protected functions different names

6239725

6239807
regression	least-squares
as a refinement you might want to do a least-squares linear regression over the longer term and then compare the shorter term average to the projection you get from that

6239847
min	max
i think because i can still trigger resize notifications even though i am trying to block window resizing by temporarily hiding the resize glyph and fixing max min size

6239863
textmate	aptana
i would advise you to pick up some books or follow some basic tutorials and work with a decent ide aptana .. or code editor i m thinking textmate coda ...

6239882
move	drag
drag and drop doesn t move elements around if you want the element to move when you drop it then you have to set the new position of the element in the drop event

6239882
google-chrome	firefox
i ve done an example which works in firefox and google-chrome here are the key points
