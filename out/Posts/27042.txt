keep your code as-is but change #some-img from an img to a div and specify width and height as needed based on the image dimensions

22080124
background-position	background-size
it s not possible at least not in a simple way to make an img element behave as if it was using background-size and background-position properties since img elements are not backgrounds

22080124
width	height
so for example keep the css you have now but add height width or other styles to the #some-img div as needed but replace with something like this

22080132

libstdc++	libc++
however if you are building a c++ library via clang++ that you will later link with a python extension or if you are building a python extension that uses a c++ library you need to use the older libraries libstdc++ and not the clang++ default of libc++ via these compiler linker flags

i ll post my solution in case anyone else runs into a similar problem basically replace the for-loop with an async.whilst loops as follows

22107140
asterisk	pbx
sorry asterisk is pbx it have only needed functions

22107144
express	node.js
we are building an infrastructure which features a node.js server and express

22107223
subtract	add
this is probably not even the best way of going about this it seems laborious to take the id number subtract 1 and then add it to the eq function but i ve been on this all day and this is the closest i ve managed to get to returning what is required

22107280
wordpress	phpbb
i run a wp-site with an attached phpbb forum and would like to integrate at the same time phpbb + wordpress + disqus + wordpress social login

22107280
wordpress	phpbb
phpbb + wordpress linked successfully thanks to wordpress phpbb bridge

22107301
innodb	myisam
grails auto-detects the dialect well in most cases but can t determine if you re using myisam or innodb so it defaults to a dialect that uses the default engine type configured for the whole server

22107301
innodb	myisam
newer versions of mysql default to innodb and it s easy to change it in any version but if you don t or it s an older version you ll end up with non-transactional myisam tables

22107302
google-chrome	firefox
they can be set via the script tab in firefox or the sources tab in google-chrome

22107303
uielement	adorner
an adorner is basically an extra ui layer over top of a uielement

22107333
int	chars
use va_arg ap int instead it will handle arguments of type int and smaller type short chars

22107333
int	chars	unsigned	short
use of chars or short as the second argument to va_arg is invariably an error these types always promote up to one of signed int or unsigned int and float converts to double.

22107375
bash	zsh
find a zsh solution first followed by a bash solution

22107375
bash	zsh
update turns out that zsh implementation based on builtin compctl is much simpler than the bash implementation based on builtin complete

22107375
bash	zsh
either interactively or preferably from your bash zsh profile

22107432
inherited	properties
inherited with properties can be non-obvious if the properties itself is not overridden

22107432
accessor	properties
thus one must make sure that accessor methods are called indirectly to ensure methods overridden in subclasses are called by the properties using the template method dp

22107432
getter	setter
apparently the people that came up with this scheme never knew that you can override just a getter or setter of a property see python overriding getter without setter

22107432
getter	setter
then again the getter setter and deleter decorator attributes were only added in python 2.6

22107444
width	height
my initial thought would be to use direct pixel access to form a width filter and a height filter

22107449
google-chrome	firefox
when i set line-height to 1.625 or 1.625em or 26px it s exactly alike in google-chrome but when i set it to 162.5 it s not exactly alike in firefox it s always ok

22107449
google-chrome	firefox
demo must be opened in google-chrome or ie11 in firefox it s always ok

22107473

while carrying the height and width without change

22107487
ubuntu	debian
i am trying to use the jenkins plugin debian-package-builder to build a debian ubuntu package

22107533
int	double
examples include int and double for java and c c++

22107602
for-loop	loops
the user is asked to input how many rectangles he she wants and then i use a for-loop to ask for the length and width which loops based on the number of rectangles the user inputed

22107654
qgroupbox	qtreeview
i would like to replace the checkbox icon in a checkable qgroupbox with the open close icon from qtreeview

22107654
qcheckbox	qtreeview
i have found examples of how to replace the check icon by setting the qcheckbox inidicator style but i don t know how to get the icon set for qtreeview

22107741
for-loop	loops
add in the while loops before your for-loop for all rectangles

22107781
hash	salt
also see here secure hash and salt for php passwords

22107784
int	double
conversion to int rounds a float or double value towards zero

22107784
int	double
use double not float and calculate int x + 0.000001

22107787
comparator	comparable
either pass a custom comparator to treeset constructor or implement comparable in your model class

22107798
comparator	comparable
so you need to implement interface comparable in user or provide a custom comparator to the treeset

22107823
hash	md5
and i also suggest verify the files after the transfer using some hash function like md5 for example it creates unique stamp for a given input and it always outputs same result for the same input which means you can create the stamp from the same file both in the server and in the client and if the file is truly the same it will generate the same stamp

22107823
hash	md5
you can generate an md5 hash with this code

22107824
inherited	properties

may also refer to virtual directories in webserver configurations for example in iis apache or nginx

22107855
portrait	landscape
the concept of a mobile device being able to be viewed both in landscape wide mode and in portrait narrow mode

22107856
portrait	landscape
the concept of a mobile device being able to be viewed both in landscape mode and in portrait mode

22107857
comparator	comparable
so if comparator is null then it will try to cast the set member to a comparable

22107886
implements	extends
you can implements runnable interface this allows b to extends any class and also implements other interfaces

22107906
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
when testing in firefox google-chrome safari and ie 9+ the ajax call for the button works as expected

22107948
children	parent
the former selects all descendant para elements that are the first para children of their parent

22107961
dictionary	map
you can simply this by having a map dictionary where the key is the sum and it maps to an list of pairs that equal that sum

22107968
swt	windowbuilder
select the swt and windowbuilder from the list

22107980
folder	directory
make sure to set the local path for the node web site or virtual directory you create to the root folder of your flask application

22108015
put	get
you re definitely on the right track and using can get you there if you follow it up with a to put things back together

22108032
width	height
i think the key part was that the content view had a set width and height

22108032
width	height
so i gave mine a height of 248 and used the standard screen width of 320 as my width

22108034
autocomplete	typeahead
and then set-up an event handler for this link which will destroy the typeahead autocomplete functionality making it behave thenceforth as an ordinary input control

22108050
min	max
i m pretty sure it s something to do with how you define xlim but i can t figure out how to have r access the date min and the date max for each factor as it draws the plots

22108055
margin	font-size	margin	height
try setting its height to at least the same as font-size and add some pixels for margin ...for example

22108063
int	chars
interpreting binary data i just stick to the unpack method provided by the struct module which makes it easy to define whether you want to interpret a sequence of bytes as an int float chars etc

22108073
min	max
the container has a dynamic height i have set min and max height properties on the container

22108073
min	max
please note that since the container height is dynamic i can t set a fixed height on any of the inner elements unless it is possible to use jquery to assign the correct height on document load and on window resize but this would need to respect the min and max height settings of the container

22108084
screens	hdpi
the screens is 480 by 800.on the phone the app is i assume correctly loading graphics from the hdpi folder because the pixel density is 1.5

select the swt and windowbuilder from the list

22108146
disk	ram
i am using hadoop2.3.0 and have installed it as single node cluster psuedo-distributed mode on centos 6.4 amazon ec2 instance with an instance storage of 420gb and 7.5gb of ram my understanding is that the spill failed exception only occurs when the node runs out of the disk space however after running map reduce tasks for only a short amount of time no where near to 420 gb of data i get the following exception

22108198
int	boolean
again the boolean value is converted to int value 1 and compared with a that is also promoted to int

22108212
mouseleave	mouseenter
however hover binds both mouseenter mouseleave events refer this

i am using base64.encode64 to create a hash from hmac used in an api request an api that i did not develop

22108296
pull	push
you can push your builds to a registry public or private and if a rebuild fails just pull a previous build instead

22108296
ansible	puppet
chef is completely orthogonal to that you can use chef or puppet or ansible or salt orâ in docker just fine

22108296
pull	push
they might help with issues #1 and #2 resource usage and isolation but they won t help with #3 and #4 partial rebuilds and easy push pull of build images

22108399
wordpress	elgg
i want to learn professional php so i can create webapps like wordpress and elgg and all

22108436
postgresql	mysql
a database such as mysql or postgresql are difficult to work with when scaling is necessary

22108454
crypt	salt	crypt	hash	hash	salt
then you put the random number and the fixed seed shuffle it and use it as salt with crypt to hash the password

22108454
hash	salt
standard des-based hash with a two character salt from the alphabet . 0-9a-za-z

22108454
crypt	salt
using invalid characters in the salt will cause crypt to fail

22108455
typedef	struct
note that c++ permits typedef struct xxx xxx

22108481
lisp	smalltalk
matz was a fan of both smalltalk and lisp so he went with their terminology

22108495
google-chrome	firefox
but the position is completely missed-up in firefox and different in google-chrome

22108505
laravel	yii
use a quality framework like laravel or yii or _ insert favorite framework here

22108506
yacc	bison
i ve worked with compiler interpreter construction in the past quite a lot mostly as a hobby obviously and for some reason i stuck with lex yacc or flex bison i m quite confused as to how they call them now.

22108541
typedef	struct
2 unlike c++ in c without that typedef you would have to declare the objects of the given struct as

22108575
width	margin
instead using margin 0 auto on your paragraph block should align it in the center of its parent width

22108676
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu systems type apt-get install ldmtool

22108694
express	node.js
i am making a easy proyect with express and node.js that use session variables and i have a error in the browser and i don t know why

22108696

you would need fixed width tag identifier 001003004 otherwise it s ambiguous

22108698
yacc	bison
i admit i ve never used lex yacc or flex bison for anything real

22108726

equals	gethashcode
a default reference type uses referential equality is the key the same object in memory but you can override gethashcode and equals to give whatever equality semantics you like

22108809
hide	show
also the css position off the page and then appearing may provide more consistent results than show hide

22108810
hash	salt
with this approach i understand i ve only have to store the hash on the database not the salt

22108815
post	get
before the cors spec it was impossible to send any browser-based cross-origin requests other than get or post

22108815
post	get
you couldn t send get or post cross-origin requests via xhr either but you could send a cross-origin get or post via a form submit or a cross-origin get via an or tag for example which made jsonp the only option pre-cors

22108815
post	get
the cors spec defines simple methods get and post along with simple request headers

22108815
put	get	post	get	post	put
non-simple cross-origin requests such as put or post get requests with an x-header for example could not be sent from a browser pre-cors spec

- i m convinced though comments indicate otherwise that the 1.8.8 upgrade broke something on mac os x and am very interested in rolling back versioning to troubleshoot further

22108955
int	chars	multiplying	add
it should then convert the chars one by one and add after you multiplying the out variable by 100 assuming that you want to stick with decimal numbers to a possibly huge int output

22108962
defineproperty	getter
defineproperty for defining a getter

22109021
width	height
just ensure that you have also styled the div to ensure it has a height and width

22109033
ati	nvidia
it happens on windows with both ati and nvidia gpus though i ve mostly been testing on ati

22109100

22109321
gallery	shadowbox
however when i click on a button on the fotorama gallery it immediately brings up a shadowbox of an image

22109342
folder	directory
i thought that it could be a problem with the image location since changing the widget s background-color works fine but the images folder is in the build-debug directory which i believe is the correct place

22109401

22109542
bower	npm
you can install it by running sudo npm install -g bower

22109545
free	malloc
length is an int and is not dynamically allocated with malloc so calling free on this interprets the int as an address

22109561
width	height
the outside images are 1 2 width to height ratio but can be a little flexible and the middle image s dimensions are more malleable

22109621
google-chrome	firefox
using windows 7 sp1 browsers tested are google-chrome and firefox both most recent

22109630

the client class will as part of the put_request see that there is not authentication token and will first to a post request with user and password to get the token and then do the put request

22109735
range	minimum
these are the dates that correspond to the minimum and maximum values for a 32-bit signed integer. additionally not all platforms support negative timestamps therefore your date range may be limited to no earlier than the unix epoch

22109752
post	get
most sites use cookie-based authentication so you could post or get the username user email in your case and password to corresponding url when curl redirect to sign-in page and save cookies if it sign in successfully

22109790
int	chars
void main int argc chars argv

22109791
hex	binary
a very simple way to do this which is probably quite fast is to read the entire file into memory as binary data not as a hex dump and then search for the markers

22109873
int	chars
note that c is not careful in its handling of int versus chars

22109937
gentoo	ubuntu
it compiles happily on ubuntu 13.10 and gentoo

22109958
put	get
at the end of the day you have to put all the items in it a large box and report what you ve inventoried so you also have a getproductquantitytotal and you have to getproductdimensiontotal -- as the name suggests get the total of number of objects you ve counted and the sum of the dimensions

22109970
hide	show
if i can t fix it with css i ll just set it to display none at 700px and show hide it with js jquery

dictionary	map
you are passing a key-value object so the api should be accessing you passed args with a dictionary key1 or its equivalent for a hash map

22110049
put	get
the way i got around that was to simply put a small delay before running the get values procedure after the fragment b comes back to fragment a

22110075
min	max
i really want to directly use max min and sum from the r base instead of writing additional c++ functions

22110095
public	protected
java as part of language feature can stop user doing such thing at compile time by introducing private protected package access specifier on data members within the class and use public member functions which perform the same logic on those data members

22110112
sqoop	hadoop
please update the question stating the hadoop sqoop and mysql versions so that the issue can be replicated

22110122
postgresql	mysql
then check if the db engine is mysql or postgresql

inherited	subclassing	public	protected
for example when you extend a class the subclassing inherited all of the public and protected methods from the parent class

22110158
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
if you are attempting to make cross-origin ajax requests in ie9 you ll need to use xdomainrequest instead of xmlhttprequest

22110184
udp	tcp
thus if the user select udp at first but call settcp i have to determine whether to actually call the function in class tcp or not

22110224
for-loop	loops
what you want to do is to have the outer for-loop loops through the rows and the inner for-loop loops through the row elements columns

22110324
width	height
you are not showing how you are setting the actual width and height of the canvas but if the center point always is 150 75 then the canvas is always at default size which means you are probably setting the size using css instead of directly on the element

22110336
width	height
i can t really set a height since the slider s height changes based on the width of your browser responsive

22110419
button	checkbox
so if a checkbox radio button from group1 or group2 is selected before an input from necessary the checkbox radio button won t be selected and will show an alert on the screen

22110425
profiling	instrumentation
profiling using xcode s allocation instrumentation

i want to upload the original image with same properties in width and height only i want to reduce its size for example if the image size before uploading is 3 mb then after uploading saving it must be 300 kb but in my case image is generated with no display completely blank image

22110691
multiplying	multiplication
i multiplying a series of values from 1 to 1000000 named a by a global variable p1. the multiplication is executed by a parallel-do hosting a subroutine that calls a function afun to do the element-wise multiplication a i p1 and save respective result to corresponding b i

22110703
width	height
the data fetched in case of height is working fine but in case of width it is returning whole line instead of the words in the rectangle

22110735
multiplying	add
i mean that i use to multiplying only a matrix 3x3 and then i add a 4th row and 4th column for that would it becomes a matrix 4x4

22110755
apache	nginx
you need to build compile your go application with a http or fcgi server and run it and then use apache or nginx to reverse proxy to the http port fcgi socket your go app is listening on

i have used the auto-generated salt for hash stored in database

22110772
post	put	min	max
keep in mind min and max are actually functions that do some simple arithmetic operations then return that value but i just put min and max for simplicity so i don t have to post the entire class

22110803
int	double
you can declare a start and end variables int or double and use nextdouble like

22110811
range	max	range	min	min	max
you can translate the range by adding the min value and scale the range up by multiplying it by the difference between max and min

22110817
median	percentile
to eliminate problems with outliers throw out the distances below the 10th percentile and above the 90th percentile before calculating the mean or median

22110894
int	double
suppose that sizeof int is 4 sizeof double is 8 then the address of a should be a multiple of 4 the address of b a multiple of 8

22110906
int	double
the compiler and architecture likely prefers that the address of double b aligns on an 8-byte boundary since just as it prefers that the address of int a line up on a 4 byte boundary

22110906
int	double
hence the compiler is likely inserting 4 bytes of padding between int a and double b such that both variables can line up on an expected boundary

22110919
put	get	post	get	post	put
for any common http get put post delete please ensure that your ajax envelope goes with the credentials cookie

this utility uses java reflection api to traverse through an object graph with disciplined syntax of getter and setter and trims all strings encountered within an object graph recursively

22110995
getter	setter
cannot handle undisciplined syntax of properties invalid getter setter

22110995
getter	setter
cannot handle chained collections for example - because of the exclusive support to disciplined getter setter convention

children	parent
with union all you can select the parent first then all the children

22119732
children	parent
this sorts all children together with parent of the same time

22119732
children	parent
then i sort by the introduced sortparent to group parent and children together in case two parent have the same datetime

22119732
children	parent
now you now for sure that the children are with their actual parent and not another parent that happens to have the same datetime

22119732
children	parent
and finally sort by datetime to sort the children of the parent by their own date

std	ostream
the way to implement this logic is to create a custom stream buffer which writes at the opportune location in its overflow method and then to create a suitable std ostream using this stream buffer

22120092
std	ostream
except for a couple of likely typos and the details on how to actually move the cursor the above code should actually work and create an std ostream which can be passed wherever an is expected

it would take a bit of code to get everything set up and it would be horrible style but you could transfer your strings into chars arrays and have an int array which represents the ascii values of the letters in jord so that you gain the benefit of checking by primitive rather than object referencing

22120155
int	chars
pass the chars you re checking against into a conditional block that evaluates it with the int values of

22121189
post	put
i think it s because you are using put in your ajax as the request method but laravel uses post for a put request and mimics the put request by sending a hidden field as

22121189
post	put
this is automatically generated appended by form open method in the form and since you are using ajax and json you should add _method put within your data and change the type put to type post so it ll be available in the array and laravel can do the work as a put request

apache	nginx
varnish is the odd one out it s a server that runs as a reverse proxy in front of the real webserver apache nginx etc. and it stores the response of the server separately and could decide to serve it for a subsequent request without passing the request to the backend the webserver so simply it s like html caching

comparator	comparable
if you put your objects in a treeset you need to either provide an implementation of the comparator interface in the constructor or you need your objects to be of a class that implements comparable

22123743
comparator	comparable
you said you implement comparator from the comparable interface but in your comment you say that you didn t so am i correct in assuming that you just return 0

22123743
comparator	comparable
basically in a treeset your objects are maintained in a sorted order and the sorting is determined by the outcome of the comparable comparator method

22123743
equals	compareto
the easiest way to achieve that is to let your equals method call the compareto method and check if the result is 0

22123743
equals	compareto
i would advise you to read up javadoc or books on treeset and hashset and the importance of the equals compareto and hashcode methods

22129192
width	height
if your border element has a width of 600 and its height is set to 800 then any contained ui element will inherit those same values

22129192
width	height
i used your code to run your experiment and found that width and height values went from 0 to 600 and 0 to 800 respectively

22129222
hide	show
i have a js carousel with a number of slides and each slide has two divs that you can alter between show hide by clicking on two nav-tabs above view and read and each slide has these nav-tabs

if this is too much work then just the greedy step where a vertical cut is made from each concave vertex is a 2-approximation

22129490
put	get
if it is okay to not really do it all at the same time all you could do is to put your reading into its own function read_csv then get all txt files in one directory and call your function for each file you find in the directory

google-chrome	firefox
i noticed it was breaking in google-chrome and ie seems to work in firefox 27

i made an installation of the redhawk framework and ide on a linux ubuntu 13.04 64bit system

22130006
width	height
plus you have your height and width inverted while generating the random position

22130038
versioning	upgrade
this will at minimum cause problems with providing upgrade in the future as after the certificate expires you would have to create a new one and changing the certificate would require wiping out the private data of the old versioning on each phone

22130058
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
you re probably unnecessarily duplicating the amount of network code by supporting both nsurlsession and nsurlconnection

22130058
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
you can do that if you really want but they assure us that nsurlconnection is still supported so it strikes me as unnecessary unless you wanted to enjoy some nsurlsession specific features for ios 7+ devices which you re not currently doing

22130058
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
do whatever you want but personally i m using nsurlconnection where i need to support earlier ios versions and nsurlsession where i don t but i wouldn t be inclined to implement both unless there was some compelling business requirement to do so

22130143
jar	war
so let s start from creating your own empty structure then starting with integration of the various parts of the old structure beginning from the integration layer...in turn integrates also a solid structure of unit tests i would not exclude the possibility of dividing even the three main entities the ear the war and jar integration in sub-modules to increase the modularity of the application and facilitate the integration and maintenance activities

22130160
agile	sprint
in msf for agile 2013 there is iteration configuration possibility but release and sprint are absent while in scrum there are both iterations and sprint

22130162

22130245
width	height
when using opengl this can be tested via source android maximum allowed width height of bitmap

22130255
tamil	left-to-right
using layout_alignparentleft true is sufficient since both english and tamil are written left-to-right

22130261
equals	compareto
i am using the min value because i read that the compareto method returns negative 0 or positive whether the first string is less than equals to or greater than the second

22130268
oncreate	setcontentview
the only difference that matters in this particular case between fragment and activity is that the view is not created in oncreate with a setcontentview but in oncreateview

22130326
try-catch	exception-handling
it uses a generic try-catch block to stop an input mismatch exception-handling and uses an if-statement to make sure the value entered is within the legal range

22130341

22130425
phpoffice	phpexcel
composer require phpoffice phpexcel

22130436
geocoding	geocode
not sure why you are using the webservice geocode rather than the built-in google maps javascript api v3 geocoding

22130463
int	boolean
if itself is very easy to define as a macro and can be done with only four preprocessor definitions - it s the int comparison which generates a boolean that s the complex part since you have to completely reimplement arithmetic itself using nothing but token substitution.

22130465
hide	show
this way it won t be a reflow when you show hide it

22130467
firefox	safari
safari and firefox both show the icons normally

22130470
portrait	landscape
i want to say have the main menu screen portrait then the play screen landscape

22130470
portrait	landscape
now i want my main menu in portrait but the play screen where the game is on should be in landscape

22130493
mouse	keyboard
if you are after example code how to hook mouse and keyboard events you can have a look here

22130518
hide	show
so if you want to display a different button each time i would create two buttons in the layout hide one and show one

22130518
hide	show
when the visible one is clicked hide it and show the second button

22130531
int	chars
note - i use the sprintf function to turn the int into a string - then i can find each corresponding digit by looking at each chars in the string and subtracting 0

22130550
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
it seems the most convenient way to do your hosting application is to use amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk

22130550
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
creating and deploying amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk applications in .net

22130596
google-chrome	firefox
collapses the side bar in firefox but not in google-chrome or ie where the unordered lists are displayed in full no + buttons - at least for me

22130596
google-chrome	firefox
and it not getting fully processed by google-chrome and ie occasionally by firefox perhaps associated with all the other processing being done to populate the google map

22130667
jar	war
i ve unzipped the war file and no jar files found which is expected

22130776

22130829
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the current versioning of vmware fusion

22130850
width	height
if you need the parent div to adapt it s height and width to the child span you can do this

22130850
width	height
span is an inline element and doesn t need height or width decleration see this demo

22130906
put	get
ps if you could also show me how to get the qr code and impact graphics central that would be great i put them in a table

22130925
free	malloc
i malloc an array of this structs but when i want to free them should i just

22130951
free	strdup	free	malloc	strdup	malloc
so for each malloc or strdup you should have one and only one matching free

22130953
free	malloc
then you should call free on whatever pointer was returned from malloc in this case called s

22130953
free	malloc
although if you previously assigned a malloc d pointer to a char field in the structure remember you need to free that as well

22130959
width	height
w is the width of the bitmap h its height

22130960
free	malloc
if your values were individually malloc ed you need to loop over each element of the struct array and free them first - otherwise you end up with unreachable memory and thus a leak

22130962
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome but does not work in ie11 and firefox

22130999
iprincipal	iidentity
asp.net mvc - set custom iidentity or iprincipal

22131020
hide	show
if the script detects the user is from usa it will hide the uk div and show the usa div

22131038
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
-webkit works only for safari google-chrome opera

22131063
webkit	gecko
i would like to understand what is involved in adding support for a non-javascript scripting engine to gecko or webkit

22131075
width	height
when you call your interface to change the orientation from your game when doing a screen transition libgdx will automatically call resize width height with the new values and you can align your stage and so on according to the new values

22131081
post	get
deletes should happen either via post or delete as get requests are supposed to be idempotent meaning they don t have consequences they don t change anything

22131084
setinterval	clearinterval
you can t use the same variable for the count and the interval the count is something you update yourself adding 1 every time the callback in the interval executes while the setinterval function returns a unique id that can later be passed to clearinterval to clear that specific interval and by overwriting that id with your number the unique id is lost and the interval can no longer be cleared

22131133
hide	show
hereâ s all you have to do use the javascript given in this page then on the basis of ip adresses show hide divisions using javascript

22131141
post	get
i am building a restful api where users may create resources on my server using post requests and later reference them via get requests etc

22131155

i m trying to use qbwc gem my ror app to connect to the standard quickbooks with quickbooks web connector

22131164
textview	imageview
i m trying to put imageview and textview in viewpager circle indicator

22131201
free	malloc
you should also consider using new and instead of malloc and free

22131244
google-chrome	safari
i should note that this only works on webkit web browsers including safari google-chrome and opera15+

22131283
debian	linux
i am using gdc on debian linux so i can t use ncurses

22131314
punctuation	words
the first issue of this problem is to define the words word. am assuming by one of your comments that punctuation is not part of a words since you were asking how to ...delete punctuation from the text...

22131316
wmi	managementeventwatcher
using wmi s managementeventwatcher eventarrivedeventhandler will result in creating another thread which i m trying to avoid

22131336
getter	setter
from what i can understand setter and getter are used to set variable values from outside of the class scope

22131336
getter	setter
as it seems like you would want to define a setter and getter in the .h file as you then set the variable s actual use in the .m file

22131336
getter	setter
overall i just want a real clarification of getter and setter and why they are so useful

22131381
realloc	malloc
i think i ve got mostly malloc down but had some questions on realloc

22131415
width	height
as you re able to see if to focus on element nav#menu.horizontal-menu - i can see the actual width height of that element in chrome

22131415
width	height
there is no both width or height values of it..

22131450
sorting	filtering
every time you change filtering or sorting create your subset from original saved data

22131467
getter	setter
if you have both - setter and getter - for one variable it is true that you can change it outside your class

22131467
getter	setter
if you used setter and getter you can change setter to transform it right before saving it

22131468
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
ptr - pointer to a memory block previously allocated with malloc calloc or realloc

22131473
integer	unsigned
if the destination type is unsigned the resulting value is the least unsigned integer congruent to the source integer modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits used to represent the unsigned type

22131473
integer	unsigned
the least unsigned integer congruent to -1 modulo 2 sizeof unsigned long long is the largest value of unsigned long long possible

22131476
width	height
that s because there are no width and height styles defined for it

22131476
width	height
to calculate the rendered width and height use a.offsetwidth and a.offsetheight

22131486
hide	show
hello i m using a javascript to hide or show a div

22131486
mouseover	mouseout
so when mouseover the 9px height #nav my #nav gets 84px height and the image_thumbnails get visible and when mouseout back to 9px height and images hidden

22131491
int	chars
it seems that many of the tutorials pass it an int with the value of 10 which is the newline chars in ascii

22131512
express	node.js
my goals are to use it with either a php backend likely laravel or with node.js running express and sails

22131521
integer	unsigned
if the destination type is unsigned the resulting value is the least unsigned integer congruent to the source integer modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits used to represent the unsigned type

22131551
textview	imageview
my first assumption was to use a scrolllayout containing all of these elements imageview textview extendablelistview which works only if i specify a height for the extendablelistview

22131554
google-chrome	firefox
no problem in firefox google-chrome but of course the usual problem child ie is acting up

22131577
button	checkbox
i tried to change styling of checkbox and radio button using css but with no luck

22131577
button	checkbox
it changes styling of checkbox but doesn t change styling of radio button

22131639
subtraction	addition
i was hoping that it would make the calculations of the variables like the distance between 2 vectors or points as per my understanding addition and subtraction of vectors significantly faster due to using special vector functions like glkvector2distance glkvector2normalize glkvector2add etc

22131657
serializable	deserialization
this is bad - cause while serializable deserialization jvm should exactly know what is the class of serializable data so basically - don t use anonymous classes if you want to serializable them

22131675
post	get
i get a no implicit conversion of string into integer error when trying to post the following

22131717
calloc	malloc
that is exactly what calloc already does for you in contrast to malloc

22131772
springboard	tweak
i m trying to develop a simple ios tweak that uses some springboard components

22131850
getter	setter
edit to use async on a property you have to use the setter not the getter

22131854
google-chrome	firefox
you can check the javascript console using f12 in google-chrome and firebug firefox plugin

22131868
versioning	upgrade
the solution is most likely to just upgrade to a more recent scipy versioning

22131901
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
my issue is that this works on ie and will not work on opera google-chrome or firefox

22131932
getter	setter
let s say there s no wrong time to use setter and getter because they give you additional control memory management etc

22131932
getter	setter
it s up to your needs whether you define your setter and getter in the interface of the .h or .m file

22131932
getter	setter
there might be a case in which you want your setter to be private in .m file and only make your getter public because the value is beeing changed inside your implementation depending on certain state changes or vice versa

22131940
superclass	subclassing
the problem is there are 2 attributes called description one in the superclass beverage and one in the subclassing darkroast and since you are using beverage as the the reference type you get the description attribute instance variable of the reference class and that of the subclassing is shadowed not accessible at least to my humble knowledge in java

22131953
comparator	comparable
treeset expects you to either pass in a comparator for its element type or for its elements to implement comparable

22131953
comparator	comparable
map does not implement comparable and you haven t provided a comparator

22132027
int	chars
the various s are c-strings chars not int

22132037
post	get
now i m trying to get a few fields i need content title id etc. per post via the following two foreach-statements

22132086
post	get
ps if you do find a way to get a hold of them legitamitely please post an update though

22132113
put	get
i have an iad which i am trying to position at the bottom of the screen though when i try to get the height of the ad so that i can put it at the bottom

22132113
portrait	landscape
this error only occurs when i enter the screen in a landscape orientation as the ad is taller in the portrait orientation and only on the iphone simulator as on an ipad the ads are the same height

22132135
bufferedreader	stringtokenizer
now i ve been told to make the program using bufferedreader and stringtokenizer

22132195
aggregate-functions	sum
you need to give the alias for the sum of amount sum s.amount total_amount so when you execute query and fetch the results from it you will have the sum of your amount column on total_amount index in resultant array and you can access it by also note using aggregate-functions without grouping then will result in a single row not per group

22132202
uifont	uitextview
we can get all these things by calculating the cursor position from the textview and according to that we can minimize the uifont of uitextview according to the height of uitextview

22132223
inherited	properties
but when using inherited you cannot change the input parameters or return type of the function properties

22132247
int	chars
and i want to put those into a std map that maps pairs of chars to int

22132288
put	get
trying to get this to take input of 5 different temperature readings and out put the lowest input

22132297
ssl	https
the above holds if your client is not compromised https does work since you are assuming that your clients will compromise themselves and use tools that will cheat your application by adding fake trusted certificates which requires admin rights i can suggest you to use two way ssl

22132299
ssl	https
now the way ssl https works is that your browser starts a secure handshake at which point the server will return the public certificate and your browser will attempt to authenticate that certificate with the authority you puchased the certificate from like godaddy geotrust or versign etc

22132336
sunspot	blacklight
we have a website that we are building running ruby 2.0 rails 4.0.1 blacklight 5.1.0 apache solr 4.2 with sunspot gem for ruby

i have code that contains a nested for-loop and i need to see the execution line by line so i can understand how loops works

22132398

22133297
subtraction	addition	subtraction	add
i had code for - signs in the program previously but deleted them temporarily because i want to figure out how to make the program run for addition problems and then i m going to add in the subtraction programming later using the same thing that worked for addition

22133297

i could remove the find in line but then i ll need a different way for the program to determine whether to add or subtract and i m struggling to think of anything

22133297
subtraction	addition
i ve also tried rearranging my code so it will find the + or - sign first then use a delimiter to get rid of the symbol and proceed with the addition or subtraction but again the program froze

in fact multiplication and addition of 64-bit integers in java c++ and c# is equivalent to multiplication and addition modulo 2 64

22134779
primes	modulus
it would be better to use a large primes as the modulus and get much better collision resistance

content-length	content-type
because of this the header needs to include the content-type and content-length attributes as well as the post command

22135885
post	put	content-length	content-type
so to answer your question if the url you are interested in posting to is command arg2 then there is no body or query string and consequently no reason to post because there is nothing to put in the body of the message and so nothing to put in the content-type and content-length

22135885

public	protected
rich domain model have better access modifier public private protected for their properties

22136203

i want to log send metrics to statsd every get post request in gae

int	chars
a switch works with the byte short chars and int primitive data types

22151597
min	max
note - this was written assuming the files read in had integers 0 and 0 hence why the min max functions were done in the way they were...simply trying to teach myself one step at a time

22151600
min	max
i know i can do this by casting the bit column as an int and using min max but it feels like a bit of a hack

22151635

22151834
integer	unsigned
value that can be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type

22151834
integer	unsigned
nearly the same wording with the phrase resulting unsigned integer type changed

22151834
integer	unsigned
in c90 if a signed or unsigned value is converted to a signed integer type and the result cannot be represented in the target type the result is implementation-defined

22151834
unsigned	short
as supercat points out in a comment multiplication of two unsigned short values can overflow

22151834
unsigned	short
are promoted from unsigned short to int because int can hold all possible values of type unsigned short -- but the product which is nearly 2 32 cannot fit in a 32-bit signed int

22151834
unsigned	short
with unsigned-preserving semantics the unsigned short operands would be promoted to unsigned int and this problem would not occur.

22151835
google-chrome	firefox
as far as i know this is not reproducible with msie version 11.0 firefox or google-chrome

x86	64bit
printf will cause it to work because the floating point number will be converted from the internal fpu 80-bit representation assuming x86 old-style math to the 64bit that is saved in a double

22152608
x86	64bit
the reason for this is that the register value has to be moved to the stack when you call another function again assuming x86 old-style fpu calling conventions which will cause it to be rounded to 64bit of precision

22152636
unsigned	short
this was tested with a bit field of type unsigned short unsigned int and unsigned long

22152688
post	get
because urls contain characters that aren t allowed in the hierarchical portion of the url it s best to specify it suitably encoded as part of the query string if a get request or in the form parameters for a post

22153834
getter	setter
from what i can tell the getter function in that code does not work but the setter function does

22153871

g++	gcc
if i remember well both gcc and g++ can detect whether their input files contain c or c++ code and do the right thing but gcc will link against the c standard library and g++ against c++ s so it s possible that you end up with some missing functionality

stdout	stderr
as most classic unix commands it writes error messages into standard error stderr rather than standard output stdout

22156388
int	boolean
as the error message says you cannot use to compare a boolean on the left-hand side with an int the 0 on the right-hand side

22156388
int	boolean
unlike c java has a boolean type and you shouldn t use int like 1 and 0 to stand in for true false

in my ocde i declare a variable that equals 0 and then initiate a for-loop and attempt to use the tofixed function on the number in the beginning of loops

22156497
int	chars
there are only about 800 000 words in the english language so an efficient solution would be to store those 800 000 words as 800 000 arrays of 26 1-byte int that count how many times each letter is used in the word and then for an input 9 chars you convert to similar 26 int count format for the query and then a word can be formed from the query letters if the query vector is greater than or equal to the word-vector component-wise

22156506

better algorithms hash the password thousands of times and apply the given salt in a cryptographically proper way to make it more difficult to crack

22156638
crypt	salt
let php crypt generate the salt

packets	pcap
the way that would be done is platform-dependent so it might be useful to provide a get maximum packets size call in pcap

22157346
packets	pcap
i cannot find any documentation on how pcap handles such large packets

22157346
packets	pcap
pcap handles those packets by handing them to the os - what happens after that is a function of the os s code

22157346
winpcap	libpcap
your code may be cross-platform but libpcap winpcap s code whilst it provides a cross-platform api is most definitely not cross-platform

portrait	landscape
if rotating the device to landscape and then selecting the back button then when the transition back to the main view completes the view buttons are displayed as though the device is still in portrait mode shifted left

22157590
portrait	landscape
if i rotate the device back to landscape and back again to portrait the view is corrected

22157590
portrait	landscape
buttons shift right slightly after transition from portrait to landscape my feeling is the two scenarios are not related since this new scenario corrects itself by rotating the device

22158152
memcpy	memmove
it is unlikely that you can do any better by calling any generic stl algorithm the best they could do is to call memcpy or memmove behind the scenes but of course you could answer this question simply by running your code and timing it

22158156
memcpy	memmove
memcpy just loops while memmove performs a test to determine which

22158162
stdout	stderr
this tries to get the terminal associated with dev tty or stdin stdout stderr if the os doesn t support it and uses it to read and write directly to the user

i noticed my app was starting with no launch image and when it displayed the initial view controller it was in landscape mode even though the app supported portrait and i was holding the phone that way

22158343
portrait	landscape
the app was previously landscape only so i added portrait later

22158345
portrait	landscape
note that you will need to remap the coordinate system to handle device orientation changes portrait or landscape which might be a source of some of your issues

the only variable in the java counterparts is the long holding the adress the access to the inner struct in b is submited through the getter and setter methods

22159185
box-sizing	border-box	height	border-box	next	except
for me chrome would not display box-sizing padding-box so i had to use border-box which mostly worked except that elements that are lined up next to it are not getting rendered the same if i depend on height

22159185
height	border-box
this is because the ultimate height in mozilla using a padding-box will be two pixels short of the element in chrome set to border-box

i can handle it either by how i did it above just override the properties or by replacing that cache with something like _cache constructor.name and writing cache accessor functions instead of just directly interacting with it

22159293
put	get
notes while you can put unicode characters such as katagana or hiragana in a single-byte string literal you re unlikely to get what you expect

22159940
gdal	ogr
i typically use this at the end to save close either a gdal or ogr dataset

jobs	cron
it creates cron jobs for you with ruby syntax

in future if you wish to stop changes that have been made to a specific folder or file type from appearing in github for windows you can add a .gitignore file to the root directory of the git repository with the file extensions and folder names of the files you want to ignore

22160182
width	height
then i set up 2 empty bitmaps with the same width and height as the background and create 2 canvases for it

22160191
for-loop	loops
a fix for this is using a for-loop to loops over each individual character in selection not every character at once

22160192
calloc	malloc
you should use malloc stores memory on heap uninitialized or calloc stores initializes all elements to 0

22160243

in my humble opinion the 1st 3rd and 4th are just different ways to declare a properties of the class with the get and set accessor

22160658
oncreate	setcontentview
also try to benchmark how long your oncreate executes the setcontentview method -- i believe nested linearlayouts cause significant performance hits especially in complex ui structures

sorting	filtering
for examples take a look at how to use tables and pay attention of the sorting and filtering section

22160740
ready	each
when your contentitem shape is being rendered the shapes for each of its parts are already built ready for display i think someone like bertrand le roy could correct me on this if i m wrong

apache	nginx
one way you can do it is with apache or nginx

int	double
dividing an int by a float or a double will result in a non- int value which in most cases is what you want but you need to be careful particularly if precision is required

22160955
typedef	struct
also you could have declared your vect type to be typedef struct vector a non-pointer type

22161023
width	height
the problem can be solved by saving the width and height of the image when you upload it

22161051
for-loop	loops
in general when you have a variable in a for-loop that you are varying it s wrong to also modify the same variable in the body of loops

22161052
superclass	subclassing
of course i could use separate entity classes without using a superclass but it seems neater to have a superclass post and just create subclassing inside of each bundle

22161052
inherited	subclassing
i ve read about bundle inherited in symfony but it doesn t seem to be the way to go here since i only want to subclassing the entity class and also it looks like it s only possible to have one sub-bundle per parent bundle

multiplying	addition	multiplying	modulo	multiplying	division	addition	modulo	division	addition	division	modulo
all of the above column and row increments can be done without using a divide operation using modulo addition where the algorithm keeps track of the pairs of quotients and modulo s of 60 with just an overflow check and adjust operation on the modulo quotient pair after every operation but the conditional code to do the check and adjust is likely more computationally expensive than the way as written for which most modern optimizing compilers will generate a multiplying operation using overflow truncation characteristics to replace the computationally expensive division operation for division by small integers which usually takes less time than the combination of operations plus the conditional code required for the check and adjust method or using a direct divide operation

22178225
antialiasing	transparent
this works fine with an opaque push button however if you put text on a transparent background in its own layer if you have a transparent pushbutton with a title you lose sub-pixel antialiasing

22178300
width	height
they then seem to hit a minimum height and maintain that height whilst ensuring the width of the image doesn t distort

to go from a previous value to the next multiplying the prior value by ten and add the value of the current digit to it

22178675
int	chars
your returnval does not make sense because in c you can very often avoid an explicit conversion of chars to int

22178675
int	chars
making a function int digit chars c that returns a value of decimal digit c- a would be a lot more useful because it would let you get rid of your c-87 in multiple spots

22178704
mongodb	bson
i m trying to restore a bson file into a mongodb collection and i get the following error

22178723
hide	show
when i set a background-color to the li tag the before hide and sometimed show up if i scroll the page

22178730

drawoval accepts the top-left position and the width and height not the centre position and the width and height

22178989
lodash	underscore.js
bonustip try to approach custom validations in a simplistic way for example try to avoid loops when possible and avoid using libraries like lodash or underscore.js for in my experience i ve seen that these may have a significant performance cost when working with lots of transactions

ionic	angular
about the backend angular provides http and resource for ajax requests take a look at the angular documentation i assume ionic didn t change the way angular makes these calls

22179396
express	node.js
i ve got a node.js + express + socket.io app

uilabel	textkit
you can t do this in a uilabel because it doesn t give you access to the textkit stack

22179416
textkit	nstextcontainer
what i do is to build my own textkit stack and subclass nstextcontainer

22179434
jobs	cron
is there any possible way of doing this using trigger or by using cron jobs

22179463
nsstring	nsdata
but that wont be considered valid in an nsstring and if you need to keep arbitrary data an nsdata object will work better

22179481
width	height
it is also mandatory to define the height and width as well in your svg otherwise by default its take 1em width and height if not mentioned

22179481
width	height
it would be better way to call the image by using background url this way a height and width can given to image so the svg image could rendered properly

22179503
post	get
i m trying to setup gitweb i m using the gitweb shipped with the git installation and using the apache provided with wamp when i access to the page i get a 404 - no projects found error i modified the variable projectroot on the gitweb.cgi file but according to some post this file shouldn t be edited and i need to modify the same variable but now on the file gitweb.conf and i can find this file i tried with

22179594
put	get
however i need to get a whole bunch of these keys so i put the call into a for-loop

22179670
implements	extends
to do so using polymorphism each state can be a class of its own that extends one base class implements the transitions from one state to the other following a graph that defines the possible transitions

22179682
width	height
you also need to change the positioning element #pager-wrapper and set different height and width to it

pull	push
as development progresses commit push in case one of us had to make changes to the other s projects in his absence and pull

22179707

chown	chgrp
after chown and chgrp ing var lib mysql per the answer by bad programmer you may also have to execute the following command

i think a better scenario would be for the first person to create the branch and push it up then the second person to pull the branch down and begin working from there

22179980
children	parent
based on the nested controllers section of introduction to fxml link you could inject the children controllers 2 3 into the parent 1 and have the parent coordinate their interactions

folder	directory
if you want to load slim.php from index.php then you need to go one step up to parent folder then enter sys directory then slim and slim.php is located there

22180151
free	malloc
if you want to be able to store both allocated by malloc and non-allocated static or automatic storage objects in your list and have a delete function that removes objects from the list and frees them you need to store as part of each list member a flag indicating whether it s in allocated storage or not and only free the ones which are

breeze	datajs
and breeze has always consumed the xml representation of metadata coming from odata sources a task outsourced to the datajs library as i recall

22217421
hash	salt
no doubdt we must not store raw passwords in the database and we must not send raw passwords between client and server so we use hash and salt

22217471
folder	directory
which means that every clientâ s files folder are created under their respective main directory

22217479

int	double	int	chars
in case the generic type argument to the collection is a standard java type date chars timestamp long int float double etc then you don t have to do anything and the framework will take care of converting the string data to the requested type.

22217575
hash	md5
you do definitely want to use the md5 hash security feature where you can

22217575
hash	md5
note that the md5 hash value can be up to 20 characters long including upper- and lower-case letters numbers spaces and punctuation

22217575
hash	md5
the md5 hash is created by combining several values

22217575
hash	md5
for sim these values are used for creating the md5 hash in this

22217575
hash	md5
the md5 hash value which is assigned by the merchant in the account s settings

22217575
hash	md5
for silent post these values are used for creating the md5 hash in

22217575
hash	md5
the md5 hash value which is assigned by the merchant in the account s settings

22217575
hash	md5
the resulting string is then used to generate the md5 hash

22217580
folder	directory
since you know which directory the user has access to you can fetch a listing of files and folder and present it in a listview to the user

22217583
hash	salt
second approach - to store hash passwords without salt in server and when authenticate - get random token from server that will expire in some minutes calculate hash from client password and use calculated hash to encode received token

22217583
hash	salt
this approach has cons - needs to store password raw or hash without salt

22217599
put	get
i generated xml sitemap file and put it in root folder on server but when i try to acces it i get following error

22217603

folder	directory
if you want to customize them copy them from the installed plugin directory to your project in the same folder and make the changes there

22217661
direct3d	direct2d	direct3d	directwrite	directwrite	direct2d
wpf renders on top of direct3d 9 preventing the use of direct2d but they do still use directwrite for the text rendering as of wpf 4.0 on windows 7 ref

22217661
direct3d	direct2d	direct3d	directwrite	directwrite	direct2d
since directwrite exists separately from direct2d they are able to use the lower-level interfaces to directwrite and reimplement the rendering on top of direct3d 9 similarly to how direct2d provides its text acceleration

22217738
min	max
if you know it s int dtype then suprisingly it s faster to check the max and min even without doing these operations simultaneously

22217803
free	malloc
you either have to define a character array using something like or you use malloc to do the allocation don t forget to call free when you are done with the string

22217803
free	malloc
however in the posix-2008 standard there is already a function called asprintf that does precisely what you need it combines the function of sprintf with the allocation of enough memory using malloc again don t forget to call free when you are done with the string

22217804
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox

getter	setter
i have all my getter and setter for length width and color

22217868
fast-forward	merge
apparently if you use --no-ff with merge no fast-forward flag it will create a new commit object at the point of the merge even if the merge could have been performed via a fast-forward

22217877
width	height
rewrite getvol to compute the volume from the length width and height each time it is called

22217877
width	height
your current design doesn t work because vol is not recalculated whenever length width or height is changed

22217877
getter	setter
that would speed up the getvol getter method at the cost of greater complexity for the class design and slower setter methods

22217882
screens	mdpi
if running on mdpi device 150x150 px image will take up 150 150 dp of screens space

22217882
screens	hdpi
if running on hdpi device 150x150 px image will take up 100 100 dp of screens space

22217889
post	get
if you take the solution from the pre image part and use it for the post image part you ll get the output you are looking for

22217903
oncreate	ondestroy
these are methods like oncreate onpause ondestroy onclick etc

22217955

daemons	launchd
i wrote a launchd daemons that executes this script in order to set the date to something more appropriate at boot which works fantastically

22218314
hide	show
you need to hide your element by default to make show method works

22218341
google-chrome	firefox
here is the working fiddle solution for the sample i have created.i have fixed the position but when i try to run in ie currently i have ie 11.0 the triangle is rendered as a square box but when i try to run it in google-chrome and firefox it is working fine

first off all the eclipse code is based on swt you mention swing which swt is not compatible with

22218453
installation	upgrade
if not maybe trying to install magento ce 1.7 or 1.8.0 and then upgrade the installation to 1.8.1 might circumfence the problem for now but chance is the same upgrade script chain is used and thus fails too

22218465
int	double
t can hold only classes like double int not primitive types like double int

22218485
int	chars
you can lookup the int value of the chars with this command

22218509
width	height
the code does create thumbnails for the images which are larger than the specified thumbnail width and height but the quality looses and i get blur images

if you find wmi api that does it you can write jscript or vbscript and then run it from java using cscript interpreter

22218658
debian	linux
i am working on codeblocks in linux debian

22218670
put	get
put in echo s and error_log s until you can build a very small test case then then open an issue on github and we ll get it fixed

22218703
apache	nginx
you will find much more documentation about whatever webserver you choose apache nginx etc than ours and we are slowly getting out the webserver business entirely anyways

22218710
slider	fotorama
how to enable double click event to fotorama slider to make full screen like what we are seeing on right top corner

22218738
innodb	myisam
at first mysql performance was terrible using this platform then i decided to convert myisam tables to innodb and make some my.cnf changes

22218738
apache	nginx
it s not dedicated to mysql it also hosts php apache nginx

22218819
post	get
usually you need to use a post to get an oauth token

22218824
pop-up	dialog
you should modify the html first then just call the dialog to show to pop-up

22218846
google-chrome	firefox
it works with firefox but not with google-chrome i get this same origin error

22218847
squash	merge
i don t think it s saying squash is the problem it s just that it happens to be a squash style merge that is failing

22218852
udp	tcp
i m capturing tcp udp packets through network adapter and trying to analyze the packets to get some statistical indicator such like bandwidth rate or protocol efficiency

22218857
directx	gdi
it s equivalent in strength and function to passing the dxgi_swap_chain_flag_display_only flag for a swap-chain but it also protects content presented with gdi older directx technologies etc

can you let me know how i can change this so i can display the formatted value using ng-init but as well as keep ngmodel for binding edited value on submit

22219066
bower	npm
setting main in package.json is a wrong thing to do because package.json is npm s own metadata and shouldn t have anything to do with node.js think about installing the package from bower for example so you shouldn t be using that anyway

22219075
width	height
the changes are the height and width are just for demonstration

22219086
goto	break
goto break your for f if context and they can be executed only once

22219138
post	get
i am new to jquery but have been fiddling around and looked through many post here a lot of which have helped me to get this far

22219144
draggable	droppable
if you drop a draggable element on a droppable element the drop event is triggered and does this

22219144
draggable	droppable
so the droppable is not disabled but accepts only the received draggable by its unique html id

22219144
draggable	droppable
now each droppable accepts only one draggable

22219144
draggable	droppable
the droppable is now locked if it receives a draggable

there aren t any ssl certificates assigned to these aliases as we do not need or use https - we re on the free plan

22219222

22219262
folder	directory
i created 40 different folder and executed the jobs parallely by creating a shell script for each directory

22219335
inherited	properties
no matter how i try to i cannot access any of the properties of either of the classes that inherited engine from their relevant buses

22219352
client-side	server-side
this will cause the client-side code to calculate it s own result while server-side is able to do the same

22219352
client-side	server-side
same code same result no call from client-side to server-side

22219360
post	get
the http post idea still seems best if you have trouble with authenticating you just need to mimic that part as well or get the session id if a given session is enough for you

22219369
portrait	landscape
2 in viewcontrollerb i have 3 buttons as auto landscape portrait

22219369
portrait	landscape
3 if user clicks on auto button the particular view controller should always be visible in portrait + landscape mode depending on the orientation mode

22219399
sse	avx
the best way to use simd would be to multiply four eight independent quaternions at once with sse avx

22219404
lsp	principles
it s also likely that it ll lead to a violation of the liskov substitution principles lsp because there s a general tendency that the more members you define on an interface the harder it becomes to adhere to the lsp

22219409
inherited	properties
this is really not a great solution due to loosing some polymorphic properties and getting complex easily when you have more then one level of inherited but it could at least work

22219458
superclass	subclassing
excepting your misuse of terminology. in java if you have a function in a subclassing that is identical in name parameters and loosely the return type to a function in the superclass then objects of the subclassing type will use the function in the subclassing

22219502
squash	merge
one thing that you can do is to reorder and squash separately to simplify the flow â run two rebases but fundamentally there isnâ t much you can do except following the instructions and resolving all the merge failures every time rebase fails whether running one or two rebases

22219502
squash	branch
it is almost identical to what rebase is doing behind the scene. you can work on a temporary branch where you will explicitly cherry pick the changes in the wanted order and squash as necessary

22219504
jtextfield	jtable
just like what the title says i want to search a sql database and display it on the jtable using a jtextfield on keyreleased

22219505

from question gradle directory in an android studio project i see that the gradle folder is good to have it but what about .idea .gradle gradlew.bat etc..

22219516
google-chrome	firefox
to clear go to the settings - apps - browsers google-chrome firefox or any other if installed

22219536
width	height
because your imageview fills the entire screen it will probably give the device s width as width and the window height as height

22219536
width	height
to get the actual width and height of the image inside the imageview set the relativelayout s height to match_parent and set the imageview s height to wrap_content and set the imageview s layout_gavity to center_vertical

22219556

assuming intersect1 is the intersection of the label s bounds with the top rectangle intersect2 is the intersection of the label s bounds with the bottom rectangle and intersect3 is the intersection of the label with the rectangle created by the shared width of the two original rectangles i don t know from your example whether they have a horizontal offset from each other and the height of the space between them it s between the two pipes but not touching when

it works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome - but fails in ie safari mac and ipad

22233740
put	get	oncreate	recreate
i would put it in single asynctask this is actually because asynctasks are difficult to manage in activites once your activity rotates or user presses home button - it begins its lifecycle - which can end in oncreate - which means your activity might get destroyed and then recreate

22233751
for-loop	arrays
like mah said in his comment you can create a function that receives an arrays variable as its argument that has your for-loop as its body

because checkbox and radio button will be added dynamically with javascript rather then have a separate event listener for each one and just have a general event listener to check for changes in any checkbox with the jquery change function if that s possible of course

22234401
bash	subshell
to do it in pure bash avoiding side-effects do it in a subshell

22234401
bash	subshell
note the use of set -f which disables bash filename expansion in the subshell so if the caller wants expansion it should be done beforehand hat tip mkelement0

22234404
disk	ram
you already have an ssd so you re probably not hard disk bound anymore and swapping with an ssd should also be faster so ram is probably not the most pressing issue

22235924
for-loop	loops
appending to an object in a for-loop causes the entire object to be copied on every iteration which causes a lot of people to say r is slow or r loops should be avoided

22235924

from what i read i understand that the safer way to store passwords is by using crypt along with random salt per user a value that the user inserts in while registrating like username for example without storing the salt in the database

hash	salt
the salt is saved with the hash so that the hash can be regenerated from the password+salt

22238614
hash	salt
with an added random number in front of the original word the hash is completely different and so to create a dictionary or rainbow table with all possible salt values for a given length salt would be a huge database and take way too much time for the hacker to crack or even bother attempting

22239276

if you re trying to target an image that s already in the html give its tag a unique id that you can target and then set the width or height

22239723
width	height
if it s still cropped check the parent element s width height attributes because that may be what s restricting the size

22239723

22248828
ng-view	ng-include
and shell.html has ng-include topnavigation.html and ng-view about.html

22249428
portrait	landscape
imagebutton2 in portrait has the same id as the imagebutton2 in landscape

22249428
portrait	landscape
ps for example i assigned in oncreate a listener to button1 and that listener works for this button both in portrait and also in landscape

22250757
children	parent
one way to do what you are trying to achieve is by injecting expander div in afterrender event of parent panel before collapsible children

when children are collapsed expanded or parent is resized injected div gets height of parent minus children

22250782
post	get
i don t want to pass the values either in post or get method

it doesn t seem to run at all so i am thinking i stuffed up or just incorrectly put code in that didn t belong as i was following multiple tutorials etc to get the desired result

22251161

it s better practise to use the object-based equals method is better applied to primitive comparison int long boolean etc

22252141
range	max
by default all non floating point literals are treated as integers and max value of integer is 2147483647 so 1000000000000000000 is incorrect here it is out of integers range

2 chars 5 in utf8 will add a byte for its length so int looks reasoaanle to use

22252587
for-loop	loops
moreover i would suggest you always work with a for-loop in a view because the binding may cause troubles with a foreach loops

22252601
audiotrack	audiorecord
i have already used android audiorecord to input sound from the microphone and the audiotrack class to output it through the speakers in realtime which is working fine

22252638
pull	push
with this approach you must always be working off the latest code so if you re on commit and you re currently working on the changes that will eventually be commit you need to pull from the repository to get the changes from in order to push your code without conflicts

22252638
cornerstone	git
this is a cornerstone of git multiple people can work on the same file without overwriting each other s changes

22252666
int	double
better to stick to int math and avoid double and math.pow altogether

22252734
for-loop	arrays
instead it is rewritten to be a for-loop using an index because the ways arrays are implemented in .net this is actually faster

22252754
cprofile	timeit
i have already optimized as much as possible my code using cprofile and timeit

22252812

textbox to hide show

22252859
for-loop	loops
to display the percentage of the for-loop already processed i use flags to indicate how much of loops already passed

22252861
width	height
a somewhat hackish solution would be to use a measure type for height and width

22252861
width	height
where h and w are measure types enccoding height and width respectively

22252872
width	height
can t duplicate your issue entirely but you aren t setting the height property you have width twice

22252884
hide	show
the best approach to show and hide ajax loader is using beforesend and success callbacks

22252956
versioning	upgrade
same kind of issue after upgrade to android studio to versioning 0.8.0

22252957
build.gradle	gradlew
to fix it open file called build.gradle in the project root and change gradlew version there to 0.9.+

22252957
versioning	upgrade
after upgrade to versioning 0.8.1 full download and copy sdk folder over had to have new versioning of gradle installed by ide using the fix it link a couple of time s and modifing the android section of the gradle file in project folder from 19.0 to 19.1 as below

if you want to lock the main view of your app to portrait but want to open popup views in landscape and you are using tabbarcontroller as rootviewcontroller as i am you can use this code on your appdelegate

22253044
vxworks	rtos
yes it can be done - i used to do this myself when working with some ni products which actually use vxworks as the rtos

22253094
pop-up	dialog
2- you need bootstrap for a pop-up dialog and nothing else

22253122
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the only thing is that flexbox is not supported by older browser support by ie10+ google-chrome 20+ safari 3.1+ firefox 2+ read more about support so i probably would need to add the flexie polyfill to support this on older browser

22253132
for-loop	arrays
and i don t know what you are trying to do with your for-loop but the text you are showing will always be the last one in your arrays

22253132
hide	show
last of all if you hide your element clearly your text won t show up you should remove this line unless there is something i didn t understand correctly

22253137
mocha	sinon
to test that i ve done something like this using mocha and sinon and mocha-sinon

22253141
int	boolean
as an aside the huge 2d-array used for the maze--at the bottom of this post in the full code --should really contain one-bit boolean instead of 4-byte int but looking at the array s code makes sense with int s and doesn t with booleans.

22253146
int	chars
i have a data.frame with chars and int columns

22253233
put	get
if you put the method on the person class itself you should at least be able to avoid the get and by using the private fields directly

22253261
express	node.js
some modifications to the app itself were needed before it worked on my machine ubuntu 12.04 with node.js v0.10.26 and express 3.5.0

22253284
folder	directory
i figured out that i had somehow initialized a .git folder in my home directory

22253296

that will set css for its children but if you have inline styles classes within the parent that set the color - it will not overwrite them see one of the solutions for that functionality.

22253310
vb.net	vb6
vb6 is very picky when it comes to wpf and vb.net

22253394
tolower	toupper
the simplest solution for converting case on a single character is to just use the c functions tolower and toupper

22253399
g++	gcc
these updates are aimed at g++ gcc 4.8.2 on a linux 3.10.17 kernel

22253414
int	chars
your server code must read into an int and check whether that s -1 before casting to a chars

22253418
implements	extends
a big part of making your module truly extensible is to expect your developers to extends a class or implements a certain interface which the developer register as services

22253441
int	chars
without column c it s converted to an int matrix and format converts the int to chars

22253451
hide	show
another suggestion which would most likely be acceptable to users is to write an addon that show and hide its main ribbon tab but has a ribbon button to activate the document and when you click that button on another tab it attaches your template or assigns some other persistent indicator to the document

22253467
illegalstateexception	illegalargumentexception
your trywithadifferentinputexception for instance could probably easily be replaced with an illegalargumentexception or possibly illegalstateexception

22253467
illegalstateexception	runtimeexception
if you do find yourself in need for creating custom exceptions derive them directly from whichever ancestor seems most fit - error illegalstateexception runtimeexception ioexception etc

22253477
width	height
somewhere you have a call glviewport x y width height

22253477
width	height
you should supply gluperspective with the ratio of width and height

22253543
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works just fine in firefox and ie but in google-chrome and safari the transition does not work

22253561

getter	setter
in my experience with pf i always called my variables the same as the getter and setter otherwise i came across a lot of issues

22253585
dictionary	map
since hashtable in java is a subclass of dictionary class which is now obsolete due to the existance of map interface it is not used anymore

22253627
width	margin	box-sizing	margin
margin is not part of the box-model whatever box-sizing you use so it will always be in addition to the width + padding + border you ve declared

22253627
box-sizing	border-box
the image below from the css tricks article on this topic illustrates the difference between the standard box-model and box-sizing border-box

int	chars
when i have a pointer to the chars f how can i convert that into the int value 15

22253710
hide	show
this means you can t just show hide siblings based on a match

22253710
hide	show
if both siblings match you need to show both and any code that hide siblings could potentially hide a previous match

22253724
memcached	apc
better use apc on apache server it will be much faster than memcached because you don t need to make a tcp ip call to connect to memcached

22253732
prepare	execute
i then execute the prepare statement using pdo as follows

22253775
post	get
i replaced get with post and add some random information into url as unused parameter

hide	show
what you will need to do is create two elements one with the title and one without and show or hide the desired element with media queries

22253788
serializable	deserialization
you can use custom serializable deserializers to globally control the serializable and deserialization of datetime values

22254023
post	get
the client-side nfc reader would typically not act as a web server and therefore won t be accessible through http get post requests see the exception below so you will have to find something else

22254023
post	get
if you really want need to use http get post requests you could provide a client-side application that acts as a web server and processes your get post requests

22254055
gentoo	ubuntu
i have an access to another vim installation on ubuntu i use gentoo and this problem does not occur

division	multiplication
adding to nappathesaiyan s answer shifts are equivalent to multiplication and division by base two

22254905
division	multiplication
these are often used in place of multiplication division since shifting requires less processing time in terms of processor cycles to compute than multiplication division

22254909
put	get
put the two together and wrap it in a literal with case-insensitivity and you get

libstdc++	libc++
i searched about this error and it looks like xcode in mavericks by default uses libc++ instead of libstdc++ and the recommendation is to compile using -stdlib libstdc++

22254981
portrait	landscape
these should specify that the grey view is at least your minimum and not more than your maximum and that the black view is at least the minimum space available in the landscape view this is what will push the grey view smaller in landscape but it will be larger in portrait as there is more room

22255046
button	checkbox
the 1st div contains a set of checkbox while the second contains radio button

22255046
button	checkbox
as written below the first loop loops through the checkbox while the second loops through the radio button

22255113
fread	read.table	strsplit	read.table
so that s about half a second for the regular concat.split.multiple which just uses read.table under the hood and much better results for strsplit and concat.split.dt the latter of which uses fread from data.table under the hood

22255145
width	height
ancestors do not have a height or width set

22255145

google-chrome	firefox
we are using mostly firefox google-chrome and ie drivers

22255264
int	chars
d expects to read a bunch of digits from input so that it can form an int and store the result into the pointer you pass which is invalid in this example since you provided a pointer to chars but anyway this is irrelevant here

22255264
int	chars
since the chars was pushed back line 4 will again retrieve the same chars from input and see that there is no valid int on input so the same chars is pushed back again

22255264
int	chars
scanning for int won t work until you consume this chars

22255290

i am using php to define the width and height and beforeshow to grab the width and height of a div in the child which i change based on the size required which all works fine

22255940
gif	png
either way doing base64 on anything larger than a really small gif or png image is almost always counter productive

22256003
post	get
in game http post get is a terrible idea but in user interface it s really not bad

22256003
udp	tcp
you could also use udp and send pings back and forth to determine if a client is connected instead of falling into the tcp well with timmy it feels so safe but don t let that hair fool you

22256003
post	get
i would imagine the calls you d want would be something like this - means to the server - is the http response from a get post

22256016
textview	imageview
for the selector i m using a listview with a custom list item - textview to display category and an imageview the forward arrow to indicate if the category has sub-categories - see this image

22256035
post	get
you can use any kind of verb such as get post push etc while making the request actually that will depend upon the request

22256037
google-chrome	firefox
the accepted answer is correct but it s important to note that you cannot programatically inject scripts into currently open tabs like google-chrome and firefox can

22256065
width	height
i need to create a scrollable owner-drawn widget that behaves a lot like qplaintextedit with word-wrapped text in the sense that the height depends on the width - as the content width decreases the content height increases

22256065
qplaintextedit	qscrollarea
i was thinking about putting my qwidget-derived class inside a qscrollarea but qplaintextedit is derived from qscrollarea instead should i go that route

22256089
sudo	passwd
you want to per-populate the sudo passwd

22256105
maven	pom.xml
i tried digging through the pom.xml file definitions in maven central to try to prove why it s happening but i m not sure i could give you an explanation that didn t have a lot of holes in it so i ll stay quiet on that front

22256120
width	height
the problem in your case is that the is-table has the same height and width as table-cell where as it should be equivalent to header s height and width

22256229
hide	show
it works just like i want but need to apply it several different article elements each with their own set of show hide links

22256253
width	height
it seems that if width height is larger than 1.775 i should use widthx as resize value and if else than i should use xheight

22256254
hide	show
instead of adding a column you should show and hide a column otherwise you will have to destroy current grid and create a new one pretty expensive

22256308
listview	gridview	gridview	objectdatasource
to achieve this i tried nesting the listview inside the gridview and passing the id into the default parameter of an objectdatasource used by the listview but this syntax is not allowed

22256335
google-chrome	firefox
i have ran multiple firefox multiple ie and multiple google-chrome up to 5 instances

22256335
google-chrome	firefox
for example you can have one grid node on a remote machine and run 3 ie 3 google-chrome and 3 firefox through that one node simultaneously

22256405

22256565
hex	binary
i have a binary data set that i would like to search for a hex value

22256570
equals	compareto
and by the way that you specified your compareto method you impled that sue and joe are equals because their names have equals lengths

22256570
equals	compareto
but the treeset uses the compareto method and this compareto method is currently not consistent with equals

22256570
equals	compareto
this way the compareto method becomes consistent with equals it will return 0 if and only if the names are equals

22256638
post	get
the code to get methodinfo from above post is

22256656
implements	extends
i have three java classes manualcomponent automaticcomponent and customcomponent which extends abstract class calculationcomponent and implements the following calculablecomponent interface

however in the existing app we cancel these prefetches if the user switches activities this doesn t seem possible in picasso cancelrequest only accepts an imageview or target

22256684
uicollectionview	uitableview
use a uicollectionview instead of a uitableview

22256715
equals	compareto
the treeset documentation talks about having not mandatory compareto implementaion consistent with equals

22256715
equals	compareto
in your case joe and sue are of equals length and as per your compareto implementation they are same

22256715
equals	compareto
one workaround would be to compare the hashcode values in compareto methods if they are of equals length

22256741

22263207
many-to-many	many-to-one	many-to-many	one-to-many	many-to-one	one-to-many
similar tables should exist for each many-to-many relationship between two of your other tables but they re not necessary for many-to-one one-to-many relationships

ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
you ll either have a build.xml for ant or a pom.xml for maven as part of your source tree

try-catch	exception-handling

post	get
post can send its information via body while get should not but i think it can be done practically

22266230
post	get
using get is much easier than using post for most of developers

22266230
post	get
concluding this summary using get in post situations is bad and dangerous

22266230
post	get
but is it true that ignoring the easiness post can be used as a replacement of the get requests as it seems it totally covers the get requirements

22266230
post	get
i m not going to use post instead of get

22266230
post	get
this question is just about to check if i understand the get and post difference correctly

22266991
int	double
that also happens when using int internally computed as double and returned as int

22267033

width	height
one more thing to point out - if your banner space width height is set ot 0 you ll receive exactly the same error

22267615
disk	ram
in this case even if ram isn t sufficient you can access the memory of the file via the virtual memory system and it takes care of all the mapping back and forth between disk and ram physical memory

22267651
width	height
so you have to outer the image with a div having the same width and height of image

22267668

a possible reason is that extends represents a a stronger relationship than implements although both represent is a or is a type of relationships

22268825
implements	extends
if a certain class implements dozens of interfaces and it were allowed to list the interfaces before the class you might miss the important extends clause which scroll off the screen

you will need percentages and absolute or fixed positioning with top or and bottom and left and or right values don t use margin-top or margin-bottom because they are calculated on window width and therefore won t adapt to window height

22268927
integer	unsigned
second thing is if the only thing you want to achieve is to print the absolute value of the int_min defined in limits.h you can just print it out as an unsigned integer or as a long long integer like this

22268950
google-chrome	firefox
they work fine on google-chrome and firefox

22268967

22268970
unsigned	short
you need to know how data is stored in memory first take a look at integers int short unsigned long long they are stored in memory and every different bits configuration means different number so its fine the same situation is with float numbers different bits configuration means different number so lets look at limits of types

22268976
jar	war
properties files must be outside of the war jar file

22269038
devise	rolify	devise	cancan	rolify	cancan
i would strongly advise using devise for authentication cancan to manage your permissions and something like rolify or role model to define distinct roles for your different types of users

22269071
width	height
and instead of percentage and viewport css3 has its way that you can set the element width and height by vw and vh units

as pointed out by aaron in the comments the .zshrc file is used from the zsh shell - so if you re not using that if you re not sure then most likely you re using bash instead this code should go to your .bashrc file

22269590
integer	unsigned
since the sign bit in 2 s complement has the value âˆ 2 m and each value bit has a value that is a power of two between 1 and 2 m-1 there is no way an unsigned integer on implementations where m n can represent 2 n it can only represent up to 2 n -1 1+2+...+2 n-1

google-chrome	firefox
if you shut off wifi turn the external internet feed off and if you have for example google-chrome firefox and possibly other browsers open at the same time and if google-chrome chokes on a page and you get the spinning pin wheel and you try at that moment to also load a file from another browser from localhost it will also hang until google-chrome finally times out or whatever and finally finishes many seconds later even for simple pages

22270918
int	chars
now based on some research on so people use a signed chars when they need to use really small int but for that we can utilize the type

22270918
int	chars
you can use it if you are dealing with the basic chars ascii table which unsigned chars is already capable of doing or you can use it to represent small int which already takes care of

22270925
post	get
the post is truly great and explains the topic in details but i did not get why i should use the reader monad in that case

client-side	server-side
so you need to output server-side variables in your jade into javascript code that will be executed client-side

22271135

instead think of the hover list as producing indices based on left - subtract one and right - add one

22271342
width	margin
you need to add a less-than-required-priority 1000 constraint either to your view s width giving it a defined width or add an equality constraint to your left margin constraint

22271342
width	margin
the view will size differently depending on if you add the new constraint to the view s width or the view s left margin

22271375

packets	multicast
it seems as if the wifi shield isn t capable of sending a udp packets via the multicast address with the latest wifi library

22271455
packets	multicast
note i can successfully send and receive udp packets using unicast addresses on the arduino just not using multicast

22271455
packets	multicast
i assume that the ethernet library is capable of sending udp packets using the multicast address since this library does exactly that

22271455
packets	multicast
edit when i said the wifi shield isn t capable i meant that as in i am not able to send a udp packets using the multicast address

22271455
packets	multicast
it appears that the wifi library doesn t support the ability to send a packets using the multicast address

22271491
getter	setter
i am new to node javascript and was using the framework of a getter and setter to accomplish this task

22271491
getter	setter
looking at it from a getter and setter aspect i would use the set method to set the variable of the file name and the get method to return the select statement

range	max	range	min	min	max
i want to be able to save all the dates in between a min and max range

22271817
range	max	range	min	min	max
meaning when the user selects a min date of 04 16 2014 and max date of 04 19 2014 i want to save every day in that range to an array

22271817
min	max
saving just the min and max date would probably not be enough since there will be multiple min and max dates for all the different bookings

22271862
hide	show
when information is correct and has been saved customers see message account information saved successfully i try when this message show up save button to hide

22271884

22272067
int	chars
first of all peek returns an int not a chars at least std istream peek returns int --i don t know about boost

22272073
hide	show
you still need to hide it using css but to show it just do this

22272130
post	get
i m confused by the fact that sequences get automatically created on identity fields - the comments in this post db2 auto generated column generated always pros and cons over sequence make it seem as thou it s an either or proposition to use generated identity or sequences - but the behavior of create table with a single column as identity does create a sequence...not only that but it appears as though it s a 1 1 - which may be needed for identity and its most likely that a defined sequence can be used by other things

22272165
hide	show
code select all show hide

22272181
stringstream	ifstream
instead of ifstream you need stringstream

22272191
children	parent
as you re creating an anonymous object the parent dbset of the context is not being populated with any data and therefore neither are the children being stored in the context

22272201
width	height
it is set to be 100 width and 90 height

22272229
width	height
all of the images i have as sources are large images and i want to resize them down to various intervals or either height or width

22272229
width	height
for example if a height of 100 is supplied the output image will be the original width by 100 3840x100

22272229
width	height
a comparable effect is had when supplying a width -- the height is maintained but the aspect ratio is not

22272261
int	double
simply casting a double to an int is not a good way of converting data

22272270
put	get
put break points to debug your code where you get edittext value

22272294
put	get
or you can just put another field in this table for the year and have all the info in one table but the table could get quite large

22272295
for-loop	loops
the problem is that your outside for-loop is overwriting the image variable with each loops before the image can be loaded and drawn

22272299
rsa	dsa
ssh-add adds rsa or dsa identities to the authentication agent ssh-agent 1

22272319

to create custom exception classes you can either extend exception class or runtimeexception class depending upon checked unchecked-exception type

22272539
inherited	properties
all objects inherited methods and properties from object.prototype although they may be overridden except an object with a null prototype object.create null

22272539
children	parent
for objects the hierarchy looks like this where the children are indented to the right of their parent

22272539
inherited	properties
this is because the constructor properties is inherited from string.prototype both str1.hasownproperty constructor and str2.hasownproperty constructor are false while object.getprototypeof str1 .hasownproperty constructor is true

22272605
for-loop	arrays
a for-loop then takes the characters inside each of the strings creates the seat objects and adds it to a two dimensional seat arrays with the same layout

getter	setter
to resolve this just remove the static declaration from anything you intend to be an instance variable as well as the setter getter

22272865
int	chars
if you want to handle numbers that start with 0 then i suggest that you read the user input as a string array of chars rather than as an int

22272895
width	height
your are not giving it a size try creating a constructor and setting a default size there you also seem to be using the parent controls coordinates i would use the location of the usercontrol to set your start position and only be concerned with the width and height of the control needed to contain your line

22272918
cpu	processors
whether calling it 100 times actually speeds things up is a separate question as once all your cpu cores are fully loaded trying to run more things at once is likely to decrease speed rather than increase it as processors cache efficiency is lost

22272964
width	height
if you want the image size to remain untouched and you are using autolayout simply pin width and height in storyboard by selecting the image view and then adding the constraints like this your numbers will be different

22272993
children	parent
the important part is that it s relatively positioned so that the children elements are absolutely positioned relative to the parent

22273035
hash	salt
i have a users table with a userid column a username column a hash column and a salt column

22273050

im making this very simple gui that literally scales the circle size every 5 milliseconds and then once the width and height reaches a certain number it scales back down and it keep on doing this process

22273795
int	double
you almost certainly want to be float or double as otherwise the result of fonc is getting truncated to an int

22273847
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
but i don t understand ruby s modules because they have functionality but they aren t interfaces in that they define method bodies so they are more akin to subclassing but they aren t superclass because multiple inherited is not done in ruby

as can be seen i want a decent folder structure where the script will append the path to the dlls and set qmakespec etc with respect to the cd pwd directory of the .pro file.

22273951
int	chars
then pi pointer made point to the address of int i then same address down cast to chars pointer pc so pc actually hold the address to a byte that contains a and of course if you add 1 and 2 to the address that means the adjacent b and c get pointed to and print out

22273951
int	chars
edit just to clarify a bit more int is 32 bit long but chars is 8 bit that s why u need a chars pointer to represent an address valid for 8 bit long

22273955
min	max
no errors occur without the usage of a set max ot set min method

22273965

22274233
scipy	scikit-learn
i searched through scipy and scikit-learn but i did not find anything

22274263
int	chars
what happens is that a chars pointer is used to point to a subset of the original int bits

22274334
octal	decimal
if you wonder how i got to use 128 as byte code for the â have a look at the pdf specification iso 32000-1 annex d.2 latin character set and encodings which indicates an octal value 200 decimal 128 for the â symbol in winansiencoding

22274340
folder	directory
once identified folder and files are easy to detect with directory and file .exist

22274360
int	chars
the fact that your elements are strings and not chars can complicate things a little bit but you can in beforehand create a hashmap string int to map every element to a given cardinal with an initial sweep linear in time

22274361
fts4	fts3
i see that i can use external content inside of an sqlite fts3 or fts4 virtual table but i ve been unable to find any documentation on how or if i can reference multiple tables as external content in one virtual table

22274618
comparator	comparable
more on comparator and comparable can be read here

22274626
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox

it s supposed to have the image in the top left corner h1 in the top-middle between image and div edge and some rows of text aligned with a margin consistent with the images width and below the h1

22274721
inherited	properties
this properties that the class always has just one superclass is called linearization and it solves a lot of the problems that traditional multiple inherited has which are usually related to the fact that there are multiple possible paths between two classes in the inherited dag whereas with mixin linearization there is just an inherited tree so there is always just one possible path

22274819
subscript	superscript
anchor subscript superscript strikethrough source

22274907

22275053
inherited	properties
the only limitation is that you cannot assign a value in your code-behind xaml to a properties you newly defined in your derived class but i can hardly think of a scenario when it s useful - you can do it in code just as well while of course anyone consuming your control will be able to do it in xaml including the properties inherited from gridview

the cause for the actual error message loss of precision is that you want in the argument of pow to stuff a long int of 64bit into a double that only can represent int of 53bit exactly

22276393
int	chars
i am not sure exactly what you need but if you are just trying to get a numerical representation of a string you can use data.char.ord which will convert a chars to an int

22276393
int	chars
then you can use data.char.chr to convert each int back to a chars

22276414
google-chrome	firefox

i know the code itself is probably terrible but i felt i had to post something to get the idea across

22276639
post	get
ok im trying to get my head around autoload and i am a bit confused i read a bunch of post and now i think i am more confused if i had a simple example i think i could get my head around it

22276653
implements	extends
for use within an enum which cannot take generic type parameters create an abstract class that extends fragment and implements myinterface

22276653
implements	extends
these fragments extends other already implements fragments

22276659
implements	extends
to work around the requirement you need you can create a class or an abstract class if you do not want your users to create objects of this type to extends fragment and implements interface and then pass this within the diamond operator

22276666
converter	multibinding
in addition you need to have converter class that implements imultivalueconverter for use with multibinding

22276682

how can i change the width and height of the window in such a way that when i manually resize the wrapping is taken into account

22276805
int	chars
just cast to an int so that you get the numerical value of the chars which consequently uses the overloaded println int method

22276902
int	double
note you can use scanner to read int float double string .

22276927
screens	tablet
the application dosnt need to be mobile + tablet responsive but im using the responsive version so the interfaces scaled horizontally on wider monitors a large part of the ui is tabular data so users with bigger screens will appreciate being able to use the full width of their screens

22276982
hide	show
then whenever you want to show or hide those forms use

22277006
ienumerable	iqueryable
your problem and the reason it all compiles is because iqueryable implements ienumerable

22277006
ienumerable	ilist
ilist also implements ienumerable

22277023
uiview	subviews
the idea is that when a user selects a row the uiview with a semitransparent background containing a uidatepicker subviews slides up emulating a modal view the user can interact with the uidatepicker but nothing else

22277042
min	max
i ve checked the min and max values from import statement and they fit in bigint and could imported but the whole insert statement in the attachment gives me error

22277044
subtract	add
as soon as you add subtract or apply a function to a column to a column being used in

22277046
min	max
if the relationship is linear than setting intelligent min max values should be all you need to do

22277079
ssl	spdy
well if you re willing to buy an ssl certificate or already have one i would recommend using spdy it s available in the nginx-extras package to enable it you just add it to the listen line

22277080
put	get
also noted in the comments it s better to use semantic markup and put your css in external files but if your just starting out it s probably a good way to get going

22277126
post	get
i ve already read a lot of tutorials and forum post but for every more i read i get more confused

22277153

as soon as i change the location to subfolder however my get post put delete requests return 404 responses

22277158
prepare	execute
when using prepare statements first the statement gets sent to the server with the placeholders converted to question marks for mysql since it doesn t natively support named placeholders and then you send the data to the server separately when you do execute

22277235
integer	unsigned
compareanswerchoice returns an unsigned integer value

22277235
integer	unsigned
in fact every single value in the parameters is an unsigned integer value but the parameter after the final or seems to break the if statement

22277235
int	chars
none of the values are negative they are translated from chars lowercase and uppercase to the unsigned int between 1 and 26 inclusive

22277250
google-chrome	safari
when the above is viewed on an ipad or iphone in both mobile google-chrome safari the top right corner of the site is viewable but it s impossible to zoom or scroll to see anything else

22277327
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the only way i can think of to keep this from happening is to make a strong property to the uiviewcontroller so that it isn t destroyed when you pop it off the screen i m assuming you re closing it by popping it off the top of a uinavigationcontroller stack

22277358
post	put
since you did not post your controller i can t really tell you what to put there

22277389

22277450
int	chars
the values in the two outputs are different due to the little-endian nature within each pair of bytes of how the int is encoded in memory and that the msb affects the magnitude the most while the individual chars are in sequence of memory

22277542
ant	maven
i tried file - import - choose general - existing projects into workspace but because this is not a standard java project maven ant etc. eclipse does not recognize it

you don t need javascript for show hide panel

22277664
apache	nginx
and apache or nginx can handle all de client-side files html js css ...

22277675
filtering	grouping
this means you can add a conditionexpression to a filtering grouping thats on the parent main entity even though the condition is actually for an attribute thats present on a link entity in this case customeraddrress line1

22277675
filtering	grouping
so the final working queryexpression looks like this notice the condition for address line 1 is not added to the address link entity its added to the filtering grouping on the main entity and it has an entity name set to the alias of the link entity

22277718
width	height
the svg file contains width and height like this

clang	llvm
apple clang version 3.0 tags apple clang-211.12 based on llvm 3.0svn

22277846
hide	show
in other words when i click on the expand collapse test anchor the anchor with the text child in it show and hide accordingly

22277846
hide	show
once i do this it works inconsistently no matter how slow i press on the anchor. it works if i scroll around the page before clicking on the expand collapse test anchor each time but if i just keep the page static without scrolling and click on the expand collapse test anchor it doesn t show or hide the child anchor until i click somewhere else on the screen

22277901
width	height
this particular query only targets screens that are equal in height as in width or taller

22277901

fadein	fadeout
for the fading part just use fadein fadeout on the sibling elements based on the number of chosen elements

22277991
nsmutablestring	nsstring
despite the fact that it works the third line is causing the warning assigning nsmutablestring from nsstring

22277993
post	get
i know this post is a little late but i figured i would tell you the reason why you only get one row back is because you are using an aggregate function count

22278010
ubuntu	debian
i am attempting to update my ubuntu debian system and i am getting an error

22278033
nsmutablestring	nsstring
i just realized that stringbyappendingstring returns an nsstring despite calling it from an nsmutablestring object

i already checked out the following post and wasn t able to get this working.

22278181
ioexception	fileoutputstream
you can periodically open the file for writing just open a normal fileoutputstream on it in append mode - if this raises an ioexception then the file is still open

22278188
width	height
this code does not affect the viewport which is set using glviewport x y width height

22278190
for-loop	arrays
i am not really sure why exactly you need an arrays to do what you want to do though consider removing the arrays and just using the first number entered as your bounds for the for-loop rather than the arrays size

22278190
for-loop	arrays
the arrays data structure is really just a waste of space as the only time you ever use it is to use its length as a stopping point in the for-loop

22278193
oncreate	setcontentview
that all functions are called after setcontentview in oncreate

22278194
post	get
probably get told off for redirecting an old post but here s how i do it using free tools

22278209

choice is int and you write chars - 1 2 in the case

22278217
debian	linux
debian gnu linux 7.3 wheezy

22278266
minimum	max
so the size of a frame is influenced by the maximum transmission unit mtu ie the max no of bits packet your channel supports channel here means multiple links hops mtu of the entire path is equal to the minimum of the mtus of each hop in the path

22278266
mtu	icmp
there are protocols employed that determine the path mtu called path mtu discovery using icmp message

22278280
hash	salt
this is because your salt is already stored in the hash

22278280
hash	salt
hash are completely different because different salt was used

22278288
google-chrome	firefox
when i set the cookie expiration at the moment i save it it then appears under response cookies on both firefox and google-chrome that s when it works but the rest of the cookies appear under request cookies on both explorers

viewdidappear	viewwillappear
from within viewwillappear and seeing my originating vc s viewdidappear method called twice successively with the same stack trace as you mention

22278373
ontouchevent	ondraw
i know what s happening here the ontouchevent fires when i touch the screen so objects are being added to my arraylist but sometimes this happens as my ondraw method is firing which iterates through my arraylist and this causes the exception

22278384
width	margin
using margin to put something in the middle requires a width

22278411
getter	setter
there are more code to this but are not important to this problem because they are just getter setter and a method that uses the tick to update position of the planet object...blah blah blah

22278414
google-chrome	firefox
you need to use the google-chrome explorer firefox tools to debug your stuff

22278573
int	chars
converting chars to int in java

22278595
int	chars
first of all numofeach should be an int array and not a chars array

22278699
passenger	thin
i believe uri agassi is partially correct by recommending passenger but i worry a nginx thin combination introduces a security risk if you re expecting the cert to act as the authentication if thin is ever moved off the nginx server thereby exposing your thin server

22278717
decoder	encoder
here s a good js base64 encoder decoder

22278736
apache	nginx
you can use go s built in web-server directly which is very capable or sit behind a nginx apache reverse proxy if you so wish

22278744
for-loop	loops
the following code sends the for-loop into a crazy loops that crashes the compiler

22278758
udp	tcp
you will have to write another transport protocol in pjsip or modify the current transports to support tcp udp over http tunneling

22278758
rtp	sip
this may get you the sip signalling but you may run into problems with the rtp media traffic

22278758
rtp	sip
pjsip already supports turn for rtp media so it will be less work to make it support turn for the main sip signalling traffic

22278778
width	height
with transforms being more ubiquitously supported these days you can do this without knowing the width height of the popup

22278855
google-chrome	firefox
you are supposed to be able to even specify the desired viewbox transforms or other attributes as part of the url fragment like but i don t think that s widely implemented -- it had no effect on either firefox or google-chrome

22278855
width	height
so if your document has a natural structure to it you could replace some elements with with a specified x y height and width parameter and then linking to an element within that sub-graphic would show that view

22278855
width	height
if you don t want to zoom in just pan leave the width and height as the full size of your visualization and just change the x and y offsets

22278866
post	get
i was missing the context_instance requestcontext request in the post get methods in the veiw

for any other class i like to have these variables i set the document class to be the delegate so that i can write getter setter in them like

int	double	std	ostream
note that there are two different kinds of involved here the one for std string is a free-standing function taking a std ostream reference argument the ones for int and double are std ostream member functions

22279726
std	ostream
if you want to provide std ostream printing for your own class all you have to do is do it like std string provide a free-standing which takes a std ostream reference and a const reference to your object and which returns a reference to the stream

goto	break
the only way to break into a nested statement is the goto statement it moves the instruction pointer unconditionally to the specified label

22280145
int	double
the check should catch some cases where a number exceptionally close to a square has a square root whose closest double approximation is an int

22280145
int	double
if an int double has a greatest odd factor long enough that the square is not representable feeding the closest double approximation of the square to this code will result in a false positive

listview	gridview
so i added a listview in mainwindow.xaml and set the name for gridview to gridview1

22280982
superclass	subclassing
it s usually considered better that a superclass doesn t know about its subclassing

22280985
put	get
this will overwrite buffer by one byte and if you are unlucky e.g you put some other data immediately after buffer and update it to be non-zero between fgets and then you may get a lot potentially rubbish printed or even a crash

22280986
put	get
note to get so to display 2 slashes which is what you need i had to put 3 in the source for this post.

what you re doing there instead is finding children with id select-choice-direction-postuser that have select-choice-direction as a parent

22281080
int	chars
int 21 function 2 can output a single chars so you could use that repeatedly if you need to output or you don t want ctrl+c and such checking

22281113
fflush	gets
i m afraid the easiest way to go around this will be to just fflush product to db so it gets it s primary key

superclass	subclassing
the properties and behaviors of a superclass is common for all the subclassing

22281231
superclass	subclassing
if your superclass performs some calculation on the dataitems of the subclassing and all the subclassing want that functionality

22281241
post	get
3 the other approach that seems to be common out there and that is recommended in one of the responses to the post above is to set up things so that all packages get saved to a directory outside of r and then change the settings in the .renviron file or whatever the appropriate file is to always look for packages in this external directory.

22281305
bower	npm
i am publishing a npm package developed with bower and wonder what is the proper manner to construct a package.json

22281305
bower	npm
and to include the www js index.bundled.js file in the npm package files as it is after the bower in my local dev environment

22281305

22281418
hide	show
also one more thing is when page loads initially everything would be show to the user and the text of hyperlink should be hide answers and when user clicks on this link the content should get hidden and title should change to show answers

22281471
width	height
first you create a bytearrayoutputstream with the size equal to image width height which is wrong no matter how you look at it if you were writing raw bitmap data it should be 4 width height but you are writing a compressed jpg whose resultant size would not correlate with image width height

22281514
folder	directory
the goal is to be able to build using the command line an installer that can install the files from the release folder and for debugging purposes the same files same names but from a debug directory

one of the big problems i have is that if i implement my touch handling in my view controller touchesbegan only fires for the first touch - if the user touches something and then without moving the first finger taps on something else that tap is not recorded in either touchesbegan or touchesmoved

22281645
portrait	landscape
the following code looks perfect on portrait but everything moved left on landscape mode it looks really bad

if an interface is declared as being implemented on a superclass it can be declared to be implemented again on a subclassing

22281693
implements	extends
it does it explicitly by saying but also implicitly by extends class1 which implements as well

22281693

google-chrome	firefox
edit i recommend you use develop tool f12 in google-chrome or firebug in firefox to debug your program

22281759
post	get
by default .ajax calls sends a get request so your is not valid in your .php file unless you specify a ..type post

22281760
rank	max
the max element rank is 23 because the root node size is 23

min	max
for the max value i will set it to the latest time while for the min value i plan to set to the latest time minus 60 secs variable

22281833
width	height
i am currently using the following simplified code which makes use of nsstring+geometics to calculate the approximate height of the view given its width

22281833
width	height
to calculate the required height of the nstextfield correctly i need to know the width of the nstextfield after this indentation

22281899
hide	show
also one more thing is when page loads initially everything would be show to the user and the text of hyperlink should be hide anwsers and when user clicks on this link the content should get hidden and title should change to show answers

22281947
width	height
how to get the width and height of the sheet you are working on

22281947
width	height
we are using this information about the sheet width and height to know where to place the boxes

22282026

you should consider aspect ratios between 4 3 and 16 9 for landscape and 3 4 to 9 16 for portrait games

22282040
oncreate	setcontentview
inside oncreate after setcontentview r.layout.activity_main

22282142
constexpr	non-type
other.getcolnum is probably not a constexpr function and can therefore not be used as a template non-type argument

22282198
integer	unsigned
int32 simply return unsigned integer which it does not return any decimal digits

22282227
gson	jackson
i suggest using jackson or gson library.parsing native json is really a pain

inherited	properties
check that the paths are inherited in project - properties - vc++ directories

22282336
gradle	ivy
the spring framework reference manual has a section on dependency management but their description assumes you use a dependency management tool such as maven gradle or ivy

22282386
post	get	submit	submission
i have html page and i have taken one form in it and other link outside the form .form is submitted by post method when i submission form first time its ok and when i click link it pass data by get method and when i again submit form then it send both get and post variable i.e form data and link data both.so what is the reason for that and how can i solve it.my html page is below

22282393
jlist	jtable
jlist and jtable put in extra effort to efficiently display a lot of information while minimizing overhead doing so

22282393
jlist	jlabel
what you are seeing in a jlist are not true jlabel but images of jlabel or whatever components are used as the renderer

22282393
jlist	jlabel
so say you have a jlist with 1000 items rather than create 1000 jlabel the jlist creates just one uses it to create jlabel images and then displays the images

22282393
jlist	jlabel
so what you are clicking on is truly a jlist and not a jlabel

22282416
ubuntu	centos
instead you may want to try an centos fedora ubuntu rhel ami which supports all the gui related things

22282425
post	get
the post variable you re trying to get is different than the submit button

22282434
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
the problem that i am talking about is that when i first read from the fileinputstream object f i.e f.read and write it to the f1 i.e fileoutputstream object it goes on to do what it is meant to do but when i try to read it again it returns -1

22282435
post	get
when you submit it the first time it s all fine but when you do it after clicking the link the url is dirty due to the data of the link so you have both get and post values

22282438
integer	fractions
integer fractions

22282438

i d just recommend you to afraid to upgrade to the first minor releases of the newest major versioning

22282580
google-chrome	firefox
i change your code and it works in ie firefox google-chrome

22282623
int	chars
1 is the chars 1 ascii 49 not the int 1 change it to

22282623
int	chars
note that chars literals like 1 has type int in c so the syntax is correct but not the behavior you expected

22282649
int	double
while conversion it converts all my float or double basically decimal values to int

22282655
for-loop	loops
what you can do is create a disjoint table such that disjointtable i j 1 if ai and aj are disjoint sets else 0.this is the most time consuming step.since there will be double for-loop followed by another loops to check whether any element of ai is in aj

22282659
post	get
third load form submit using blank action to indicate that current page is where to post makes request with post form data to thus having both post form data and get url data

22282659
post	get
the link is never sending the form data as post and the post data is not part of the get array so you know that when there is no post it s just get and if there is post it was a form submit even if there is a get array

22282672
bower	npm
i finally figured how to do it for bower components haven t tested yet for npm modules

22282686
google-chrome	firefox
i have attempted to upload an app via the google play developer console for the last two days but the apk uploads until 99 complete in firefox or until processing in google-chrome and the is stuck

22283034
put	get
i could not get it to work with labels in fact the article quoted states label does not support native transparency so i put the image directly into a canvas instead

22283060
width	height
use an image that is at least 1200 width by 630 height

22283070
for-loop	arrays
if your only expecting numbers and characters you can run a for-loop on the byte arrays and run char.isletterordigit on each character replacing those that arent with

22283090
ant	maven
if the 3rd party code doesn t use maven or gradle or anything like that or if it perhaps is not even written in java then you can use the ant ant-maven-tasks library to publish it

22283090
ant	maven
take heed of the comment there also as there is an alternative imho better method still using maven ant tasks but there currently exists a bug with this method jira ticket manttasks-170

22283148
std	ostream	ostream	istream
usually there is choice between returning by value or by reference made by considering the meaning of the operator or independent factors like for example that std istream and std ostream are not copyable so trying to return objects of those types by value is an error

22283162
versioning	upgrade
if you re using an older versioning of php and cannot upgrade to php 5.5 you may use the userland implementation of the function written by the same author who wrote the array_column function for php core

22283182
mocha	node.js
there aren t any official examples of implementing unit testing for keystonejs sites yet but there wouldn t be anything stopping you from writing tests with a framework like mocha the way you would in any other node.js app

22283185
distance	polygons
essentially we use stenvelope to build a polygons around the line this lets us then use stcentroid to obtain the centre point of the polygons and therefore line which we in turn finally expand with stbuffer using stlength 2 as the buffer distance which of course is half the length of the line - and therefore the radius of the required circle

22283199
uiview	subviews
the subviews currently within the scrollview are uiview and i am not sure if i can create a shinobichart within a uiview view

22283200

without that to trust their selfsigned cert but not anybody else s get their cert by some process that you are sure isn t tampered with and put it in your truststore

22283202
int	double	int	chars
int for int byte for byte double for double chars for chars etc

22283207
children	parent
i m actually modeling real human relationships in my system so usually parent node has only few children and some of them might have few children as well and there can be only four maybe five generation alive at the same time

22283232
std	ostream
now if this example strikes you as particularly useless as it should look at how the standard library handles calls with std ostream for a realistic use case

22283331
min	max
i have a function to simultaneously retrieve the min and max values of a list

22283363
int	double
i guess your problem is that the input data distance time should be double not int

22283384
hide	show
but i can t seem to figure out how to hide the entire page except for the loading bar while the page loads and show it once the loading completes

22283392
hide	show
i m trying to make a easy hide and show script that is separated from the html-code

22283408
hide	show
the above works from a show hide perspective if loggedin is true it show the log out link

22283409
post	get
however when i post the index page i get http 404 error - sep hello

22283416

what is supposed to be happening is this i get a list of the new checkins into an array called and i also get a list of check ed ins which is all of those that were checked before the post into an array called

22283496
box-sizing	border-box
i believe you want to add box-sizing border-box

22283514
width	height
i used to in ios 6 be able to just tell the youtube player what width and height it should stretch to and no problem

22283514
width	height
but now i have to put in much 3x higher values for height and width than the screen it self but that is of course not a solution because the size of the devices varies

22283514
width	height
to 640px and 960px the width and height going into the html

22283518
slideup	slidedown
simply remove the callbacks with the slidedown slideup animations

22283518

they store two values that can be assigned to the top property of the slidenav to either hide or show it

22283520
int	boolean
edit also use sharedpreferences to save any primitive data boolean floats int longs and strings as these are small

22283564
min	max
when you are using min or max then each of those will have to iterate over the iterable once

22283564
min	max
now as chepter mentioned in the comments min and max are implemented in native code so they are most certainly faster than when implementing it in python code yourself

22283564
min	max
in most cases though it rarely matters as a min max wonâ t be the bottleneck of your application so you just shouldnâ t worry about it until it becomes a problem

22283564
min	max
i did some testing on this and it turns out thatâ without a custom key functionâ using the built-in max min is kind-of impossible to beat

22283564
min	max
with a key function you get pretty much the same timing result for a single min or max call as for the full function doing both

min	max
so unless iterating the iterable is very expensive although you could then use tee and still iterate twice or you want to loop over it anyway in which case you would combine that with the min max check using the built-in max and min functions separately will be faster and also a lot easier to use

i guess what you should do is to attach stdout and stderr streams in your parent process to the write side of your pipes you need one more pipe for the stderr stream

22284346
waitpid	fork
if you use wait or waitpid you might have to think about blocking sigchld before calling fork and in that case you should unblock sigchld in your child process right after fork at the beginning of your child process code a child created via fork 2 inherits a copy of its parent s signal mask

22284363
tiff	png
does the browser recognize any format despite jpg and png eg tiff

22284491
for-loop	loops
the increment expression of a for-loop is executed after each loops iteration not before

22284491
for-loop	loops
programmers often refer to it as the for-loop because of the way in which it repeatedly loops until a particular condition is satisfied

22284491
for-loop	loops
given that loops variables are both initialised outside of loops and you don t want to use a for-loop increment expression it might be clearer to rewrite the code to use while-loops as follows

22284522
post	put
i already tried something but each time i tried it i had an error i can t post the code here because there s a bug when i try to upload it it shows me that i didn t put the 4 indents but i did...

superclass	subclassing
so either change the visibility to public in superclass in which case you are overriding and correct method of subclassing will be executed at runtime

22284724
superclass	subclassing
in a nut shell you cannot refer to superclass object with a subclassing reference

22284746

it seems to work perfectly fine in opera while it doesn t in firefox

22285227

i have been at it for two days and tried a variety of solutions including isolating the last li by its name property using a classic for-loop to iterate the others using angular foreach to loops the others etc

22285289
stdout	stderr
as a side not whilst it is fair enough to write to stdout in this sample it is a good habit to write errors and debugging data to stderr

22285333
put	get
in the above example there really isn t much in the way of logic but you might test what happens when odd values for name or version get put in

22285335
onresume	onpause
this is pretty straightforward since you can manage the camera in onpause and onresume

22285335
onresume	onpause
if you send a message to tell the thread to shut the camera down from onpause the actual camera shutdown may not happen for a while -- and in the mean time the activity is shutting other things down and if events are happening quickly might be back in onresume before the shutdown has completed

22285348
union	distinct
you re doing a union which results in distinct processing

22285516
portrait	landscape
currently the app works in the portrait orientation but i want to add the ability to work in landscape

22285526
puts	gets
the non-obvious part of this is that call puts the return address the address of the instruction right after the call on the stack and ret gets the address to return to off the stack so we don t want to alter where ss sp points in between

22285538
post	get
usually a client either an app or a web browser makes an http request sending parameters login password with post or get methods

22285539
width	height
vh vw are viewport height and width

22285612

the scaled down image looks fine on google-chrome firefox safari or opera whether windows or mac

22285992
post	get
post variables get carried not as part of the url

22286001
getter	setter
moreover saying self.popovercontroller repeatedly either to set or to get its value is to be avoided because this is a method call - you are passing through the setter method or getter method which may be synthesized may have side effects and does in fact take some extra time

22286021
int	chars
undefined reference to void xmlgenerator createxml chars const int chars const chars const std string chars const int chars const chars const

22286040
jpa	javax.persistence
you use javax.persistence to keep implementation-agnostic you can change to use a different jpa implementation later. if you want to just go with hibernate you can use org.hibernate annotations

22286059

as joakim mentioned in comment since you want to stop code when activity stops running you can register the receiver in onresume and unregister it in onpause

22286110
src	attr
var imgref #chart img attr src

22286142
getter	setter
read about javascript getter setter

22286152
nsurlcache	nsurlsession
i was thinking of populating nsurlcache with mock responses and data but i feel this assumes too much of how nsurlsession and nsurlsessiondatatask work

22286187
getter	setter
new way getter and setter

22286187
getter	setter
but next is a privileged method or has privileged getter and setter since it s declared inside the function it can read write private variables

22286240
mapply	lapply
i ve tried using mapply several different lapply s but i never seem to end up with the same datatype as c_flips

22286347
int	chars
hashmap chars int

22286347
int	chars
is a hashmap mapping chars to int

22286347
int	chars
you cannot use the primitive types int chars long short byte in generics so use the class wrappers int chars long short byte instead

22286357
width	height
all i do is render two triangles to form a screen-covering quad with screen width and height in uniforms

22286358
inherited	properties
as angular uses prototype inherited you can still gain access to parent scope properties and react to them

22286379
background-image	background-position	background-image	background-color	background-repeat	background-position	background-repeat	background-image
the reason why it happens is because background is a composite property which includes background-color background-image background-repeat background-position background-attachment

22286390
children	parent
the parent is then also blocked waiting for the children to terminate

22286479
width	height
i turned it off and added width and height constraints manually

22286494
google-chrome	firefox
i was having the same problem but then with google-chrome instead of firefox

in firefox ie or google-chrome s private browsing mode the toolbar was shown without an issue

22286498
plot	heatmap
i am looking to make a heatmap bubble graph which allows you to filter what plot on the graph based on a few descriptive criteria

22286520
post	get
its allows requests from get post and cookie

22286530
vim	sublimetext
vim mode is not as good as the vintage mode on sublimetext which is not a fully featured vim either because the vim package is in an early stage of development

22286530
atom-editor	sublimetext
again because atom-editor is still in the beta stage sublimetext has much more native plugin packages

22286530
atom-editor	sublimetext
atom-editor has better github support out of the box but sublimetext has a several git packages

22286530
atom-editor	sublimetext
github seems to be confident about the future of this text edit because of its popular underlying technologies and atom-editor is probably going to be a good alternative to sublimetext in the long run

22286546
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
in google-chrome and firefox the slider works fine but in safari the video don t hide he continues appearing in other sliders

22286574
salt	md5
when users submit the encrypted text they also send a salt md5 of the words and respective matches

22286574
client-side	server-side
server-side encryption would work but then we won t be able to give users the added security of client-side encryption

22286605
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
if you only want to save some user profiles then you should maintain a subclass of nsobject which you usually use and which is able to be created from an nsmanagedobject instance that you have fetched from the data store for that purpose

22286608
post	put
do not use the entity unless you are post or put method

22286621
stdout	stdio	stdout	fflush	stdio	fflush
reason for needing fflush stdout is because stdio detects you re not running in terminal it will by default not fflush on n for improved data throughput

22286682
hide	show
i want logo screen to hide then ad to be show and only then main menu screen to appear black screens are ok in between

22286684
http-get	http-post
my thought is when view is first requested http-get model will contain default data of begindate and enddate then user can change these values and if values are valid http-post is done

22286763
post	get
i don t know exactly your business requirements but it seems a bit unusual to me that when a user gets deleted really all of his threads and all post of those threads including the post of other users get deleted as well

22286809
cjk	thai
the results for the cjk analyser are not great when searching in thai

22286840
for-loop	loops
i believe that the for-loop is causing the error as loops based on string0 and not string 2

22286874
keydown	keyup
i or a teammate actually used iohidmanager to set up an event callback that successfully intercepted capslock keyup and keydown events

22286908
post	get
i suppose can t be a post since i ll have other forms in the app should be a get request but on every request i need to verify is the shop belongs to the owner or to the employee increasing number of queries

22286958
cos	sin
nothing appear to be wrong with them as i can calculate sin cos etc

22286964
opera	google-chrome
when i visit the images in my browser google-chrome firefix opera ie they will appear

22287026
for-loop	arrays
to initialize arrays spots you must use the first for-loop i showed basic for-loop

22287029
for-loop	loops
this even happened when i had the for-loop as just one loops the positive charges were switched but not zero to negative 4

22287092
int	chars
however you are also passing that int as a chars pointer to execve in the argument list in the child case

22287128
fish	bash
if everything went well running on that bash session would yield fish

22287144
min	max

22287150
rss	feed
there s an asp script to read rss feed here

width	height
sometimes often onsizechanged gets called a number of times in succession the first time with a width and height of w 0 and h 0

22287252
width	height
i have tried resizing the images to the same width and height and then pixel by pixel comparing them but the results are not accurate

22287286
min	max
you will also probably want to set the font s min filtering to linear or mipmaplinearnearest and max filtering to linear

22287355
for-loop	loops
what is happening is that when the for-loop runs k is correctly increased but when the callback function successfunction was executed typically several ms after loops was finished it was always been evaluated with the last value of k not the value of loops the .ajax was called

22287358
setinterval	settimeout
it seemes that there must be some combination of setinterval and settimeout but i just can t make it work

22287381
filtering	grouping
trying to filtering these further to return those from this grouping also associated with community 6 by adding another where clause is returning an empty activerecord relation

22287394
equals	gethashcode
a assuming you don t want to compare the objects by their references you should override gethashcode and equals methods of myclass

22287396
equals	gethashcode
just change your myclass so it implements equals and gethashcode

22287417
setcontentview	findviewbyid
findviewbyid is called after setcontentview

22287437
udp	tcp
one workaround would using multiple applications talking to each via a tcp udp socket osc is pretty easy to use for example

22287469
children	parent
given that the children elements are absolutely positioned you need to relatively position the parent element in order for overflow hidden to work

22287503

what i have is a .txt file with spaces delimiter formatting

22287548

mybb	vbulletin
i am using vbshop - dragonbyte tech for the points system and was only able to find a code for mybb forums not for vbulletin

22287627
crypt	hash
crypt will return a hash string using the standard unix des-based algorithm or alternative algorithms that may be available on the system .

22287751
min	max
whenever i try to run this code it generates a random array as it s supposed exactly but then when i use the functions to get the max and min values it generates random number so here s the output when i run it

22287760
fgets	getline
note that the preferred solution for such issues using fgets or getline to read the line and sscanf to parse the line makes error reporting much simpler

22287785
rss	feed
in my project i have two uiviewcontroller s in a tab bar application each one contains a uitableview which displays information from rss feed

22287786
min	max
your code returns positions of min and max values

22287797
spaces	delimiter
you can split the strings later based on spaces delimiter

22287798
min	max
you are returning position of max and min value from the function not the actual max and min values

22287841
mouseup	mousedown
i would add a couple of events like middleclick and rightclick then handle the mouseup or mousedown if you want to intercept on the down then fire one of the two events depending on the details of the mouseup event

22287863
hide	show
by default when you run docker images it hide these intermediate images but if you pass the -a argument it ll show them all

22287881
getter	setter
i define a class example with some data member setter and getter methods

22287881
getter	setter
later i create class instances and call the setter and getter method in other source code file

22287944
rss	feed
i ve been working on an android app where i am getting an rss feed and i need to parse some additional html for image source links

22287944
rss	feed
right now there are 10 articles in the rss feed and the html parsing for each one is not really long

22287952
getter	setter
getter and setter should access conceptual properties of the class not its physical members

22287952
getter	setter
if you make a getter and a setter for every private variable then it defeats the entire purpose of encapsulation

22287952
getter	setter
either variable_a stores a conceptual property of each object---in which case removing it would actually change the class s semantics in which case code depending on it will have to be rewritten no matter what ---or it doesn t but forms a part of a larger feature that can be rewritten in a way that does not involve variable_a ---in which case there shouldn t be a getter and setter in the first place

22287995
hide	show
then when the page is loaded call a javascript function that show or hide the div based on the value of the cookie

22288010
spaces	delimiter
ok so i m struggling with the most mundane of things i have a spaces delimiter text file with a header in the first row and a row per observation and i d like to open that file in matlab

22288026
put	get
the way to get a reverse transformation is to invert a general matrix encompassing all transformations or separetly negate a translations and transpose a rotation matrix and then put them back together

22288040
filesystems	ntfs
if you have full access to the filesystems and it is ntfs you can probably use an alternate stream related to the file but apart from the data

22288125
serializable	deserialization
i know how to test serializable and deserialization but this tests only the happy path

22288126
versioning	upgrade
when you presumably upgrade ubuntu from 12.04 to whatever versioning you re using now lapack was also upgrade to a newer versioning

22288126
scipy	scikit-learn
i would then install liblapack3 as well as libopenblas-base and libopenblas-dev which provide a faster alternative to the standard blas libraries then reinstall numpy scipy and scikit-learn

22288139
free	malloc
you should check if list isn t null in case the malloc failed and don t forget to call free list when you re done with it

22288167
getter	setter
you get getter and setter ã la java that allow better control over the possible values

22288203
switching	screens
if you want more screens and be able to switching between them use viewpager

22288208
postgresql	mysql
i have a database dump of an mysql database and like to import this into databases of other vendors like sqlite or postgresql

22288214
hide	show
ng-show just show hide the element so it still exists in the dom and therefore will always be evaluated

22288278
bower	npm

google-chrome	firefox
i think it mostly depends on the interprter engine in browser which responsible for interpreting th scripts which server sends to your browser and another thing about firefox as you have mentioned the extension in firefox is also responsible for it and another thing which i think matters a lot the developement of the browser as you can see google-chrome has same ui on all windows linux mac since it is mostly written in java so it requires jvm to run hence it is slow as compared to firefox which is written separately for each os using the respective oss apis hence it is fast since it directly interacts with os than interacting with jvm which in turn interacts with os like in case of chrome.still google-chrome is faster in incognito mode because of its intelligence to keep frequently data cached if you ll see the temporary files created by google-chrome they are huge in size as compared to that of firefox

22301900
subtract	add
however while this works for the case above which consists of just adding to a value it causes problems in that if i don t adjust the counter it is now one higher than it needs to be and causes indexoutofbound exceptions and if i do subtract the counter and or assign it to 0 before entering the loop the return is giving back a 0 even if i explicitly add one to the counter before passing it back

22307556
stdout	stderr
also you can pipe stderr and stdout into stdout

22307556

this is a rather ugly way to get the output to send a message and i d advise in favor of refactoring the outer call of shell_exec to read stderr and stdout craft a message and send that to yourself

22307563
post	get
or you can use post but this way the feed.php can get come settings via get values

22307587

profiling	instrumentation
looking with instrumentation and the time profiling i got this

22308062
width	height
if the image has a greater width than height than it should be as wide as possible to 340px

22308062
width	height
normally you would just resize by the largest side however this obviously won t work as then you will end up with a larger height than 170px if the height is close to the width

22308064
google-chrome	firefox
however it does not work in google-chrome and firefox

the main defference between these two is that awe6 is using openfl to target platforms such as ios and adnroid while flambe is focused more on html5 and flash games

22308283
flambe	openfl
and the answer is no for flambe because it is not based on openfl

22309021
implements	extends
you can extends the concept by maintaining a 4-value priority queue for example implements as two double-ended queue

22309046

my understanding was that i prepare the stmt2 just once and then use a for-loop to find the parameter values and execute the statement a couple times

22309244
super	implements
eating my own dog s food and implements what i suggested in a comment untested but it should work -- note that you should use super where appropriate this is not my forte

22309308

when i ran into this problem previously it was after we upgrade mvc versioning and the web.config references were not properly updated

22309617
magento	joomla
ps this seems like a magento joomla installation to me in that case ignore the var folder completely in your .gitignore you don t want objects from var cache or var session etc to be tracked in the repo

22309729
hide	show
so on your ajax call use the done function to hide the form and show the results

22309733
super	abstract
thus i d like to put the method into an abstract super class

22309780
children	parent
in order to style p after in case where there are form elements as children you d need to have a parent selector which practically doesn t exist

22309782

int	double
java interprets numbers like 123f as referring to a float and 123d as a double whereas plain 123 means an int

22310059
stdout	stderr
although the implementation behavior is the same using stderr instead of stdout will definitely impact consumers of your program since they will be attempting to capture output from your program from stdout by convention

22310059
stdout	stderr
best practice is to log debugging information errors warnings status etc to stderr and actual program output to stdout

22310100
decoder	encoder
your encoder and decoder just don t fit together

22310100
int	chars
the problem is int overflow combine has type but int can hold only values up to 2 31 - 1 which corresponds to 4 chars in your encoding

22310127
post	get
the only purpose of whole get -handler is to act almost the same as post but omitting valid annotation to prevent displaying of errors in jsp on the first user get request before he submits the form

22310213
post	put
you can put your form to submit on the same page and check the post data on php side

22310228
folder	directory
i don t know if this could help but i can use namespaces correctly anywhere inside the src folder but it seems like it doesn t work in another subfolder of the main directory

22310332
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome

22310352
propertychangelistener	listeners	implements	extends
as propertychangelistener is just a specific subclass extends interface of eventlistener - which is a marker interface and defines no methods it is much easier to work with propertychangesupport than eventlistenerlist - that is because if you start off with an eventlistenerlist you ll need to always do instanceof checks and casting to get to the actual business methods of your listeners since the interface they all implements has no methods

22310355
onresume	onpause
i wanted to start the service in my mainactivies onpause method and stop it when onresume is called

22310378
width	height
resizing the window height which causes the wrappanel to adjust itself and add remove columns should cause the textblock to change width - and clip - to match the wrappanel

22310414
getter	setter
annotation is added properly but no getter and setter are generated

22310420
prepare	execute
also you should always check both prepare and execute for returning false which indicates an error occurred

22310430
pop-up	dialog
instead of starting a debug session a download dialog pop-up containg that html code

22310496

22310653
portrait	landscape
i have an activity with 3 tabs using fragments it works fine when working in portrait mode however when i change it to landscape it crashes

22310662
stdout	stderr
stdout is where your program will write its output usually the screen unless you ve changed it and stderr is where it will write its errors again usually the screen unless you ve changed it

22310662
stdout	stderr
this means that if you run your program as a filter receiving data on stdin and writing to stdout then other programs can receive their data from your program but they won t receive the data written to stderr

22310662
stdout	stderr
the following command will put both stdout and stderr in the same file

22310662
stdout	stderr
what this command is saying is run the command setting up stdout to be redirected to file.out then duplicate file descriptor 2 stderr to go to wherever file descriptor 1 is going to file.out

22310662
stdout	stderr
this command says run the command and duplicate stderr on to stdout at this point in time the terminal then redirect stdout to file.out

22310690
implements	extends
public class startaccelerometer extends activity implements sensoreventlistener onclicklistener

22310726
put	get
you could also put an else and an if within braces but if you have very long else if chains the braces get really messy sure i can tell d

22310727
post	get
in javascript you can listen for the click event of this specific button get the form for this button serialize the form and post it the action method url

22310744
google-chrome	firefox
after looking at caniuse.com and testing i can see it work in firefox but not with google-chrome

i have to type the getter and setter myself

22310842
laravel	codeigniter
in my opinion you can use zend codeigniter or laravel

22310911
free	malloc
free will free what was allocated with malloc and should work properly in this situation

22310911
free	memset
if you want that memory cleared such as if it contains a password or a security key you must clear it out with something like memset before you call free

22310911
free	malloc
again free only marks the memory as unallocated available for use by malloc and does not clear out the contents

22310912
width	height
now assuming that content was boxes of different height with all the same width - how could i keep the same grid based layout and yet have all the boxes line up under each other instead of in perfect lines

22310939
ubuntu	linux
note the paths in the error seem to be the old ubuntu linux paths

22311003

22311165
maven-dependency-plugin	pom.xml
in the pom.xml of each eclipse plugin i issue an unpack goal to maven-dependency-plugin during the initialize phase

22311165
folder	directory
importing the project from vcs and manually specifying the target dependencies directory as a class folder in eclipse allows said ide to also compile the plugin

22311165
folder	directory
adding the class folder in eclipse requires maven initialize to be run once so that the target dependencies directory is created

22311169
folder	directory
the source code is in a directory named intranet inside the root www folder

22311169
.htaccess	httpd.conf
pages are blank and i am not sure if the problem is in the .htaccess or in the httpd.conf

22311184

if you ask the compiler to optimize compile with gcc -o2 or g++ -o2 then there are no much overhead probably too small to be measurable or perhaps a few percents

22311212
isotope	masonry
finally you may want to use a plugin such as isotope masonry

22311218
libsvm	liblinear

at some point as a younger it person i learned that there was some connection between cvs and the more recent version control system svn

22311268
cvs	svn
searching a little harder i found info stating that subversion svn was started by former cvs developers

22311291
sqlcommandbuilder	sqldataadapter
this website has a great reference implementation on using sqldataadapter and sqlcommandbuilder

22311343
collabnet	cvs
although cee used cvs as its initial version control system cvs s limitations were obvious from the beginning and collabnet knew it would eventually have to find something better

22311343
collabnet	cvs
so collabnet determined to write a new version control system from scratch retaining the basic ideas of cvs but without the bugs and misfeatures

22311345
google-chrome	firefox
i have a map and i would like center it on the position of the client but it doesn t work on firefox and on google-chrome it centers on a wrong position

22311407
parallels	bootcamp
all that being said the first time i had this issue month of nightmares and late gis homework i had imported my vm from bootcamp which seems logical but at that time parallels 8 and arcgis 10 it was still a license error i was receiving but for some unremembered reason i was convinced it was because the vm calls its hard drive the c drive which it clearly is not - parallels merely translates this virtual c drive between the 2 oss and their respective boot drives

22311407
parallels	bootcamp
i have not tried this next part yet it might be worth trying to install your vm on the mac side and then use the windows or parallels migration tool to create a win migration file and then go to your bootcamp side important - deactivate your esri license before uninstalling arcgis - if you don t do then you ll be mired in the this license has reached its maximum allowable installations or whatever they say

22311545
box-sizing	border-box
then with jquery you can do something along these lines - if you are using box-sizing border-box which i suggest than you ll want to use .outerheight to be sure to include padding and borders

22311607

the reason that count is 20 after the for-loop is that you declare count outside loops so on each iteration count will be set to the next integer and then incremented once more by

22327107
for-loop	loops
if you did not have the extra increment inside loops count would be 19 after the for-loop terminates because range n does not include n

while it is possible in theory to mix the two cases like you did and make student implement and then continue along the lines of 2. this is a total no-go because either your objects have a natural order - then you should go with comparable and case 1. or they don t then defining the order should go to a separate comparator -class

22331239
int	chars
48 is the value for the zero chars 0 so t will end up holding an int between 0 and 9

22331252
int	chars
for numeric types of different size c will actually generate a tiny bit of code that truncates a floating point number like 4.5 into 4 or makes sure that if you typecast the chars -1 into an int it will move the bit that indicates the sign up

22331252
int	chars
that way you still get -1 and not 255 which would be the interpretation of the bits that make up -1 as a chars when seen as an int

22331256

put	get	post	get	post	put
the stateless isn t a main problem in your situation problem is that browser can only send get or post request in tradition way in tag form so to send put or delete request you should use ajax the easiest way is to use jquery library and config it to send user credentials in http header between requests it can be store in cookies in every request and use basic-authentication if you plan use own auth logic

22333873

22334878
children	parent
it s the best solution i ve ever found for the children floating disappearing parent problem

22334897
width	height
if i understood correctly you will need to establish the width of the whole table using jquery so that the height will change to what you want too

22334897
width	height
if you want for instance that all rows be no taller than 26px the height of the cells in the first column then the table s width can be changed to match this limit by iterating through the rows and checking the height of each and changing the width accordingly since just indicating it in the css that all rows should be x height will not work

22334921
width	margin
this view has some margin a background and a textview with match_parent width

22335029
width	height
just set the height to 100 and the width to auto

22335034
width	height
here x width and y height return 0 always since it s integer division and width and height are values greater than x or y

22335034
int	double
so i d use double instead of int

22335065
pull	push
you should be aware of the consequences of a forced push though for other developers that may already have the overwritten changes i do not recommend it better use a simple pull to bring in the upstream changes

getter	setter
i need to provide public getter and setter

22335140

i ve already tried modify the for-loop with a while loops no results at all also tried to make it a function and execute it by the settimeout with as usual no luck at all

22335683
google-chrome	safari
these amelioration should t affect google-chrome and safari

22335746
jobs	cron
the default behavior of cron is to send any output from all jobs by email

22335764
children	parent
it problem on conditions which show multiple parent s children

22335764
children	parent
but move up work between same parent s children order by lft

22335852
getter	setter
rename your getter and setter to getrole and setrole

22335870
children	parent
we have a object type called parent which contains a collection called children like so

22335930
integer	unsigned
the result is an unsigned 32-bit integer

22335953
post	get
i d run a query to get all the post ordered by post title as you usually would using get_posts

22335953
post	get
i would then loop through these and use substr to get the first letter of each post title

22335953
post	put
add the key if needed and put the post inside

22336023
versioning	upgrade
i strongly suggest every cocos2d v2.x developer to upgrade to this versioning rather than applying the quick fix below

22336069
min	max
then you need loop all panel on right to get the max or min sort_id or the closest sort_id

22336110
google-chrome	firefox
fyi i revised the html further to try and troubleshoot a problem i m having talking to the c++ libjingle neither google-chrome nor firefox

22336191
put	get
i can t readily put together an example of this but it should be possible assuming the image is coming from the same domain you are running the code on or you can control the cross origin header for the image or else you ll get a cross-origin error

22336225
post	get
my issue is sometimes the model doesn t validate so i don t get a post back to the jason method in the controller

22336295
post	get
after a while i get the exception message in this post s title

22336334
put	get
if you include the subdomain php file into the main php file by using it s url like include then php will get the parsed subdomain s file for you and put it inside the main file

22336338
getter	setter
if you really want to ensure you have exclusive ownership you can hold a unique_ptr instead of a shared_ptr and have your getter pass back a const -reference and your setter take either a unique_ptr or a value

22336343
range	max	range	min	min	max
a variation on pentadecagon you are free to set n arbitrary values on the diagonal in some range min..max containing x and fill the rest of the array with lower than min on one side and higher than max on the other

22336390
stdout	stderr
the is to hide stdout and stderr

22336391
maven	pom.xml
under the dwp i would just drag required jar files into web-inf lib but using maven it looks like i have to add them to pom.xml using groupid artifactid and version

22336497
implements	extends
both viewmodels extends the tabableviewmodel class and implements inotifypropertychanged

22336532
width	height
each element positioned according to it s width height x and y

22336541
background-repeat	background-size
use background-size and also always a good idea to use background-repeat too

22336543
put	get
i get an error no matter where i put stuff in the test

22336680
strstr	substr
because you want to know whether the string contains vowels or not you may want to use a substr search using strstr

22336684
post	get
i have an application that can do post and get requests if i pass them as a string

22336685
subtract	add
then in each iteration of the i loop starting at 1 add in to the sum the value at index window + i and subtract out the value at index i

22336689
subtract	add
for each next step move the window one to the right add the new integer that falls into the window and subtract the old one

22336712
ubuntu	debian
the most common way to do that on debian ubuntu is to build an initscript and place it in etc init.d or etc rc init.d and place a script named mytestprogram in that

22336743
google-chrome	firefox
in ie and firefox site a doesn t open in the same window but creates a new window tab works in google-chrome

22336763
tsc	transpiler
i attempted to use the tsc transpiler option â out file to generate a single file but it chokes when you use the export keyword anywhere in any of your files

22336783
put	get
i ve used the default template from vs2013 and as soon as i put in the custom route it stopped working and i ve tried soo many things i just can t get it to work

22336843
post	put
the way to use it is to put the shortcode frontier-post in any post in my wordpress page and that page turns into this

22336862
openmpi	mpich
for example both openmpi and mpich allows you to use mpi_double on the sender side and mpi_long assuming an lp64 system on the receiver side

22336869
post	put
i ve read post regarding using lookup merge join derived column but i still don t understand exactly how to put it all together

22337009
google-chrome	firefox
this is happening on both google-chrome and firefox whereas on ie everything works fine

22337082
outputstream	inputstream
closing a socket will also close the socket s inputstream and outputstream

22337090
postfix	dovecot
i ve recently taken on a vps ubuntu 12.04 to host a few websites with domains and have recently set up postfix dovecot to act as a mail server for the sites as well

22337096
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
i have the feeling that it is bad practice to include all contract subclassing in the hasmany map because in an uml class diagram subclassing inherited associations of their superclass

22337126
rtp	sip	rtp	rtcp
rare exception to this rtp + 1 rtcp rule would be when a sip session travels through a network address translation device and where port mapping is involved

22337162
spaces	delimiter
column 2 spaces delimiter hashed ordered individual words from the above encrypted text

22337162
hash	salt
i would argue that this hash approach weakens the data sufficiently that you could reasonably work out a users data that is you have lowered the effort required to the point that it is very plausible you could decrypt a user s information without any knowledge of their keys salt

22337162
hash	salt
2 32 possible salt 4 billion possible salt that is not that many if you only need to hash a handful of words for the initial attack

22337195
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the code in question fhhorizontalsplitviewcontroller is a custom uiviewcontroller container that is installed in a uinavigationcontroller

22337206
post	put
i find that although post requests properly contain my payload in the request body slim seems unable to extract anything from the request bodies of any put requests

22337243
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome but it does weird things in firefox

22337244
google-chrome	firefox
decoding won t hurt the already decoded string in firefox and will decode the string in google-chrome

22337246
width	height
so the height is always 57px smaller and the width is always 28px smaller

22337246
width	height
if i use firefox to change the padding in the html code above it does nothing to make it display correctly only by changing the height and width does anything change

22337260
int	double
when you look at it this way map upgrade f the term lift is often used in this context to work on lists if double is a function that double an int then map double is a function that double every int in a list

22337261
folder	directory
you can get the members of the groups by importing the active directory module and using get-adgroupmember or there are more complicated ways to query ad without the module but exactly how depends on which way you want to grab them because if you can have multiple associated security groups for one folder then you can t do it in a one line per folder display at least not without making things very messy

22337292
margin	height
for some reason the svg element gets a 3px or 4px bottom margin that is the body element gets a height of 1007px 1008px or even 1009px

22337292
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the behavior is consistent across opera 12 google-chrome 33 firefox 26 and internet explorer 11 so i m confident that the behavior is by design and standards compliant i just don t get it

22337301
redhat	fedora
based on comments above decided to dump redhat didn t have a subscription so not easily upgradable on the other machine and switch to fedora which has the latest gcc

22337307
min	max
with the following query i will get data i expect the max and min speed for each date

22337318
min	max
any tip for solving it should return a random number between 20 int min and 30 int max

22337334
post	get
ideally i should be able to create a base class a which i can use for both post and get

22337334
post	get
get works great and i can display all the entries i get from the server but here is the post code

22337386
ant	maven	centos	linux
i have a jenkins 1.5xx master node running on centos linux that builds java stuff with maven and ant

22337409
min	max
that s a really bad idea for a huge number of reasons hint min and max aren t what you think they are among other things

22337499
min	max
what i m trying to do is disable the + - buttons when the number input reaches its max or min attribute

22337499
min	max
if no max or min attribute is set min should default to 0 and max to 999

22337499
min	max
on page load if the number input value starts out at the min or a max or a the fallback if neither min or max is set the appropriate button should be disabled immediately without waiting for .change on the number input to be fired

22337558
post	get
i created a workaround by simply reimplementing the normalize method in js but struggled with this for many hours so i figured i d make a so post to help other folks out and hopefully get more information to help satisfy my curiosity about this bug which wasted most of my day haha

22337593
dns	spf
so google directly told me what to do add some spf records in the dns of my domain mydomain.com to get rid of this warning

22337638
getter	setter
when i try to generate getter and setter the option doesn t appear and the insert code.

22337638
getter	setter
now the insert code... option is there but still don t get getter and setter

22337659
for-loop	arrays
then inside the for-loop it writes this constant value into every 4-byte entry in the buf arrays

22337686
fflush	gets
however you shouldn t close the socket you should close the outermost outputstream or writer you have wrapped around its output stream so it gets fflush

22337710
width	height
from this rectangle you can check width and height to see if the intersection is big enough

22337753
innodb	myisam
currently when running rake db test clone one of the tables should be myisam but is instead innodb

22337761
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
also it is getelementbyid or getelementsbytagname

22337796
folder	directory
in the server under the ssh folder in the root directory there are two files

22337804
latex	stargazer	hmisc	stargazer
stargazer is at least in my experience more general than latex from hmisc

22337832
uiview	subviews
i tried adding it to the cell that didn t work to the table view nope and i also tried adding a clear colored uiview as a frontmost subviews and putting it on that but still no

22337833
width	height
it s getting cropped in fact to the correct width and height dimensions but the x and y offsets are wrong

22337963
width	height
since the width of the div is 30px and the height is 30px you place a margin-left and margin-top of -15px or negative half of the width height

22337967
button	checkbox
i have wrapped up a complex grid stackpanel arrangement with button images checkbox all inside a viewbox tag like below

22337976
chown	chmod
as root you should chown var www to whoever should own the directory hint it s neither root nor the apache uid then set the group ownership appropriately we can t tell from the information you ve provided what that is - but again it s neither root nor the apache uid then chmod o_rx the directory

22338075
width	height
if the lots of nested elements are designed without fixed width scaling in mind the viewbox would be unnecessary as the grid will automatically fit 80 width height if you set it to stretch to its container

22338104
hash	md5
if you base64-decode it you get 128 bits which is the size of an md5 hash 0xa11bbe8e5a423bf79277031bd224d56f

22338104
salt	md5
the mxgxy21tdxr4bjb0 is probably a salt something added to the received password to protect against dictionary attacks md5 password is known and easily pre-computed whereas md5 mxgxy21tdxr4bjb0password isn t

22338104
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
this together with the previous point suggest that you compute the md5 hash of the salt plus something else to produce the 128 bits that are produced by base64-decoding the oru.

22338104
hash	md5
it s possible that this is stored directly in your sample hash but unlikely not least because that would mean that the md5 in your sample hash line would be meaningless

22338104
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
hash the salt and ciphertext with md5 giving 128 bits of hash output

22338120
put	get
therefore you need to first retrieve the user that you want to update using a get and only change the field that you want to change then send the updated user object back to the api put method

22338123
scipy	scikits
i used scikits talkbox s mfcc function for feature extraction and used scipy s cluster for vector quantization

22338135
gulp-notify	gulp-if
you can use the gulp-if plugin and the gulp-util library along with a production development flag to prevent gulp-notify from being run on the server

22338203
public	protected
i do know that it contains - means private # means protected and + means public

22338248
uitableview	uipageviewcontroller
instead of using different controllers for different uitableview rows i implemented the uipageviewcontroller delegate method as follows

22338253
getter	setter
i think the type of the thumbnail may be determined by the way the thumbnail information is posted to the magento controller and the way that the magic getter and setter work

22338258
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
the margin auto does the trick as long as you specify height and width of what you want to center

22338277
puts	gets
i managed to create functioning loop which gets the number of created textfields gets their values puts everything back into textfields and preserves everything

22338294
spaces	delimiter
a csv library chose one that preserves spaces among fields like opencsv will allow you to read all records very fast in the order of tens or hundreds of thousands of records per second depending on how many fields a record has and extract all the fields which you will then need to rewrite to disk by joining them into records separated by the new delimiter

22338306
button	checkbox
and more it takes at least two radio button or use a checkbox

22338393
width	height
the downside to this is the width of each component will be the width of the parent container and each component will be given an equal amount of the height divided amongst the components

22338458
google-chrome	firefox
to debug that kind of issues firefox firepath extension is very helpful for google-chrome there is xpath helper.typically you should start with finding the right xpath with firepath and then trying it in scrapy shell it s really simple something like

22338496
try-catch	exception-handling
this method uses a try-catch block that catches exception-handling objects but exception-handling is not thrown within the try block and runtimeexception is not explicitly caught

22338537
fadein	fadeout
i tried using fadein fadeout but that doesn t work all the time

22338545
mp3	ogg
ok so i m just googling that now and this link comes up and it s just reminding me of the pletora of compatibility considerations between ogg acc mp3 etc on various browsers vs

22338609
google-chrome	firefox
this does not happen when i run my tests in either google-chrome or firefox

22338614
thin	webrick
i would recommend using another web server such as thin as webrick is not really suitable for production use

22338638
google-chrome	firefox
browser is current google-chrome or firefox

22338681
oncreate	recreate
i prefer to recreate the activity and its state as android documentation suggests using onsaveinstancestate to store the data you want on the recreation and then retrieving it in oncreate from the bundle or onrestoreinstancestate

22338697
ready	each
or something like this so you won t need to type document ready event for each method

22338707
put	get
edit when i try this it will not get the rows from mysql database to put the data in each xml tag channel with other tags display-name programme-channel title sub-title desc and category

22338708
uiview	calayer
an alternate approach would be to subclass uiview to add a calayer that is one pixel bigger than it s view s layer and has a bordercolor and borderwidth as desired

22338739
alloca	stackframe
in c the alloca function allocates memory on the stackframe of the caller of alloca

22338755
google-chrome	firefox
this happens only on ie9 and ie10 google-chrome and firefox are fine

22338791
for-loop	loops
calls for the use of the for-loop which encapsulates the definition and incrementation of loops variable into loops control statement

22338827
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade my android studio to the versioning 0.5.1 taking care of the migration process that has to be applied to the build.gradle files into my project and modules

22338866
tiff	bmp
since i need the tiff image loaded using system.drawing.image to display it i would like to know if it is possible to display it directly instead of doing the conversion to a bmp or jpg

22338954
coldfusion	railo
this works on my coldfusion server but not on my railo server

22338967
google-chrome	safari
when i open the app on windows internet explorer safari google-chrome - it works smoothly

22339000
google-chrome	safari	ubuntu	linux
linux x86_64 applewebkit 537.36 khtml like gecko ubuntu chromium 32.0.1700.107 google-chrome 32.0.1700.107 safari 537.36

22339011
width	height
where w and h are the screen width and height you can get these values using sdl_getrendereroutputsize

22339038
width	margin
if i set a width to the label span then when the javascript removes the from it looks like the price has a large left margin

22339038
google-chrome	firefox
my question is is there a way to do this with css and make google-chrome behave the way firefox does where it is working perfectly with just the spans

22339041
int	double
when i create the object it says i need to have a double and int in the argument so i did as it said but i just keep getting more errors

22339043
children	parent
this sounds really abnormal but all children are parent s but not all parent s are children

22339048
google-chrome	firefox
just trying some image rotation resizing and dragging functions of fabric.js and it works fine on firefox google-chrome and newer version ie

22339058
equals	compareto
the compareto that actually gets called always returns 0 indicating all elements are equals

22339062
onclick	onmouseup	onmouseup	mousedown
one of your events is triggering those behaviors so you do not want the event to fire on mousedown - just the onclick or onmouseup events

22339068
int	double
your constructor is set up to take two arguments a double and an int but you pass neither

22339070
folder	directory
you can try replacing your www folder with the www folder in the examples directory

22339105
fgets	fgetc
you would likely want to use fgets instead of fgetc

22339109
int	chars
the trigger could make use of an int auto_increment column to generate unique values and then use that int value as part of an expression to generate the chars string you need

22339110
decimal	ieee
using math.float32bits and math.float64bits you can see how go represents the different decimal values as a ieee 754 binary value

22339127
folder	directory
intellij apparently has the feature to import existing code into a project however whenever i go to import project and selecting my base directory folder it always turns out like this

22339142
build.gradle	gradlew
using intellij 13 when i add the repo like so to gradlew in build.gradle

22339142
build.gradle	gradlew
the .m2 settings.xml seems to be ignored completely by gradlew i tried by not adding the maven repo to the build.gradle file and hoping that gradlew will look at .m2 settings.xml to figure out where to fetch artifacts from

22339156
int	double
you need to add two argument to the constructor double and int

22339167
post	get
when you get redirected to the post it has its proper data from the database but after the remove function it just changes all it s database-based info to undefined

22339219
awt	swing
take the time to read through and understand painting in awt and swing and performing custom painting

22339277
int	chars	outputstream	inputstream
i don t know why you would be opening an outputstream to a file which you ve just opened an inputstream to...the int buffer seems overly large and the hexchars never need need to exceed 16 chars not to mention the fact that you are completely ignore the int buffer anyway.

22339281
punctuation	words
the b token indicates a words boundary including spaces punctuation marks like commas periods full stops question marks etc

22339327
int	chars
that is assuming you do care at all - it s also fine to use int long etc as long as you are not relying on them being some size - will work with i and x being any int type - the sum is even below 128 so chars would work

22339327
subtraction	addition
in some architectures using long may make the code slower - especially in 16-bit architectures where long takes up two 16-bit words and needs to be dealt with using typically two or more operations for addition and subtraction for example

22339349
multiplying	subtract
i m learnign mac-1 assembly language and i learnd how to adding addd and how to subtract subd but i dont know how to multiplying and how to use bracket s

22339357
put	get
first you put one leg then the other leg then you will get the hypotenuse

22339461
multiplying	add
selectnumber was 2 and you multiplying by 10 and get 20 and then add 2 so it s 22 then you print it out as an integer

22339461
multiplying	add
when you type a number after a decimal place you can t multiplying by 10 any more you have to add the digit 10 number of digits so far

22339504
multiplying	add
when you respond to a digit key you take selectnumber multiplying it by 10 and add the value of the key

22339553
division	modulo
if you don t mind seeing zeros in the output you can use integer division and modulo operations to separate the value into hours minutes seconds and days

22339553
xslt	xquery
xquery is in some sense a superset of xpath 2.0 which adds most of the same capabilities as xslt 2.0 though in the form of query expressions rather than in xml syntax

22339567
integer	unsigned
i will stick with unsigned integer for now

22339567
integer	unsigned
this is again all about unsigned integer arithmetic

22339609
int	chars
int max_chars sizeof str sizeof chars

22339633
oncreate	ondestroy
android can destroy your activity at any moment that s why you have to properly do initialization in oncreate and properly dispose of things in ondestroy

22339651
width	height
the negative margins of #two need to be exactly half of the width and height of that div

22339678
exponent	modulo
my modulo is a 512-character hexadecimal number and my exponent is 10001

22339708
box-sizing	border-box
you could use box-sizing border-box in order to include the element s border within it s dimension calculations

22339733
width	height
since the width and height are defined i changed it to

22339740
mouseover	mouseout
while it represents an element which has a pointing device over it there is neither a mouseover pseudo-class for an element that has just been pointed to nor a mouseout pseudo-class for an element that has just been pointed away from

22339788
width	height
the width and height will be the same size as its parent container

22339827
children	parent
1 keep a published version of parent and it s children together

22339827
children	parent
2 keep a draft version of parent and children where they can be modified individually and children can be destroyed

22339827
children	parent
3 keep a version history for the published versions of parent children

22339837
folder	directory
i want to delete all of the current directory s content except for the .git folder before i copy the new files into the branch

22339891
uicollectionview	uitableview
what i am trying to do is to mimic the ui from ios where you have a uitableview with cells that are uicollectionview

22339900
put	get
i want to be able to get every item included in an arraylist and put it into one string with each item separated by commas

22339924
width	height
if you store the blocks in a 2d array indexed by grid row and column number you can directly compute the grid coordinates of the ball divide ball x block width and ball y block height then check to see if there is a block in that grid cell or the neighboring cells noting that the ball could be on a border of up to 4 cells presuming its diameter is less than the smaller dimension of a cell -- but you can easily adapt if this is not the case

22339933
folder	directory
another approach would be to move your .git folder out of the directory and then going back and deleting all the contents of the folder and moving the .git folder back

22339979
subtract	add
i need to make this rotation work by adding-13 to a character if the resulting character is greater-than z i am suppose to subtract z then add a then subtract 1 the number 1 not the letter 1 and do this only for capital letters

22339994
post	get
however i cannot create a new model using the rails generate model post title string text text command - i get a long list of errors which complain that my adapter is not valid

22340006
cassette	squishit
if you look at the examples for cassette or squishit you see code such as

22340016
int	chars
you re appending an int rather than a chars to crypttext

22340020
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
i get runtimeexception of illegalargumentexception

22340080
disk	ram
in the non-technical sense â œvirtual memoryâ is disk space used in lieu of ram uses terms like swap backing store etc.

22340190
pop-up	dialog
you still can have a modal dialog parented by the main form and a modeless pop-up form at the same time on the main ui thread

22340190
pop-up	dialog
the workaround is very simple if the pop-up form is currently visible disable it before showing displaying the dialog and re-enable it when the dialog is shown

22340195

width	height
that s because each reference to a symbol element is drawn as if it was a nested element within it s own viewport with a fixed height width and viewbox coordinate system

22361432
width	height
you re not setting those attributes on the symbol so they end up as the defaults for nested svgs width and height equal to 100 of the parent and a default coordinate system with 0 0 at the top left corner of the viewport

22361728
int	double
i think the basic issue is that the default messagewriter uses the jaxb annotations xmlrootelement to process the object and since base types like string number double int etc do not have these you have to use the default pojo mapper which will process use jackson s objectmapper class

22361814
margin	height
but not the horizontal scrollbar height border or margin

22361818

i wound up changing it to a rangecolumn type of chart and just set the min and max of the range as needed

22362013
filtering	grouping
if you ll generally be passing in the slug rather than the filtering grouping presumably because you don t have access to the filtering grouping from where the link-to consider making the slug the model of the route

22362013
filtering	grouping
at the controller level you ll want the model to actually be the filtering grouping and you can use the setupcontroller hook to do this

22362013
filtering	grouping
you could also do a similar thing and have the unfiltered grouping as the model in the model hook and as what gets passed in via link-to s and then use the setupcontroller hook to filtering members by this grouping before setting the model of the controller

22362033
nsmenu	nspopupbutton

22362230
superclass	subclassing
in the code below a subclassing extends its superclass and overrides its method using it to call another method unique to the subclassing which uses a variable of the subclassing

22362230
superclass	subclassing
the program then stores an instance of the subclassing to a variable of type superclass and then calls its method

22362369
if-statement	while-loop
or since your code is obviously only expecting one row use an if-statement rather than while-loop

22362405
for-loop	loops
i ve achieved it using a for-loop however i m currently using only a small data set 200 rows and it needs to work with up to maybe 60000 or so rows and in my experience for loops tend to become inefficient when using lots of data

22362448
int	chars
the nul chars not null which is a pointer has int value 0 and is false

22362462
width	margin
however the body margin isn t being taken into account with the media queries and instead gives the width of the full window

22362487
getter	setter
i found that you have to put some spaces below the attributes of the class for the getter setter functionality to work

22362519
mouseup	mousedown	nsbutton	nspopupbutton
nspopupbutton is a subclass of nsbutton so you can override the mousedown and mouseup methods just as you would on any other button

22362519
mouseup	mousedown
if you need to you can use them to set a boolean property like ispushed and use that in your drawrect method but it would probably be smarter to put the drawing code in mousedown and mouseup

22362563
put	get
so you get the idea the code below is an example of code that would be put into the html confluence macro

22362620
width	height
also since you want to print a square height and width will have equal side lengths

22362624
ienumerable	iqueryable
i don t know how you are testing your performance but the main thing to remember when working with iqueryable and ienumerable are that both will give you deferred execution

for-loop	loops
this type of for-loop basically behaves just like a cursor and executes the code in loops for each row returned by the query regardless of the datatype

22362769
width	height
this is because the other cells don t exist -- rows and columns by default have zero width and height so even if you put something at row 10 000 if there is nothing in the other 9 999 rows row 10 000 will appear at the top

22362782
typedef	struct
there are many things in kernel that are #define d or typedef d or functions mapped inside struct the fop struct in the drivers

i know you can use .. .. to get folder above a directory and would assume that their is a method to do the same with folder down a directory

22365434
draggable	droppable
in my new project i used jquery draggable and droppable function

22365445

properties accessor aren t quite the same thing as method calls

22365456
hide	show
i am working on a third party web-based software platform bigmachines and they are using css classes named rule-hide to selectively show or hide columns in a table

22365486

you can use scandir or glob to get the contents of the directory and then your folder will probably the first or second item in the result you can check that with is_dir in a loop

22365491
queue	fifo
your queue is a fifo yes but you re not pushing data onto the queue in a fifo order

folder	directory
it was recommended i place all my database connection usernames passwords etc in a separate .inc file in a separate folder mine unfortunately needs to be in a folder in the root directory

22365620
width	height
it looks like adblock is setting the div width and height to 0 to hide it so the padding remains

22365626
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
in firefox and safari this renders fine but google-chrome puts the gradient stop a little further than it should

22365667
uicollectionview	uipageviewcontroller
i currently have a uicollectionview that scrolls vertically and this is the perfect layout for my content however now i need each element in that collection to be a flip through of pages just like the uipageviewcontroller

22365688
uicollectionview	uitableview
after a while the uicollectionview and the uitableview will not render any animation anymore thus loosing the paging and the inertia when scrolling and overall resulting in a very poor user experience

you want to use get which is the method to pass data by the url instead of post

22365901
profiling	instrumentation
the below picture is an instrumentation time profiling which shows quite clearly how core data tasks can be distributed on different threads

22365946
filtering	grouping
is used to grouping results by conversation id and filtering the results not repeated for each participant which means it will only return the one that has relation with all of them

22365970
int	chars
i d recommend using a union of chars array and one of the biggest int types

22366048
folder	directory
if i modify the file path to create the file within the root folder of the external directory i get an eacces permission denied error

22366074
versioning	upgrade
i would make a standard app with all xxx well compiled against a empty data ddbb and then import development layers with axutil or with import option in aos but this can be slooow and set some standards pre-versions objects as custom developments one per one this will require a good development layer-focused design and then upgrade developments to new versioning

22366074
versioning	upgrade
in your case i would backup the _model database and apply directly cu7 this is i would not use detect code upgrade conflicts process then compare syp vs old syp layers remember to input old objectos into baseline database it is like the old folder in app of previous versioning

22366094
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop before the one that prints the values using system.out.println i is printing 0 s because you never initialized any values after creating the arrays

22366156
box-sizing	margin
note that in addition to changing the images widths i also changed the margin to padding and made use of the box-sizing attribute read more about it here

22366192
folder	directory
i assume root folder actually is your ftp home directory which on most webhosting environments by default is one level up from your vhost s document root

22366202
super	implements
you could implements something super -like as described here

22366236
hash	salt
as for a good encryption solution check out this hash and salt passwords in c#

22366241
for-loop	arrays
then the for-loop only counts the words in the matches arrays transforming it into the object you requested

22366251
cpu	processors
pure int iret based system call takes 211 cpu cycles and even much more on modern processors

22366280
ready	each
basically the idea is to create an array of promises while usercache is not ready then resolve the whole queue once the request is ready and finally directly resolve the promise with the cached value for each future request

22366282
put	get
i have not fully finished the program but i get this error when i put a false path or file name

22366289
addclass	removeclass
also in an effort to try other animation techniques i updated the fiddle to use addclass and removeclass animations

22366289
addclass	removeclass
the removeclass animation runs consistently but not the addclass animation

22366289
addclass	removeclass
toggle between page1 and page2 to trigger the directive to addclass and removeclass

22366316
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png	tiff	bmp	tiff	png
at the end of the day we only have a few technologies we can work with ant that is jpg gif png tiff bmp svg some things dont support this for image decoding for the end user

22366316
decoder	encoder
they wont be able to decoder it easily without your encoder and hence this is why we stick to the standard formats

22366394
hide	show
it successfully hide show the imageview

22366451
maven	pom.xml
i started to update the jars that being included in the maven pom.xml but moving the plugin to scala 2.10 is non-trivial because it uses reflect.generic.modifierflags

22366454
for-loop	arrays
so far i m having a problem inputing the numbers names into the arrays by keyboard using a for-loop

22366477
int	chars
so i am trying to basically get a chars bunch three of them into a string covert it into an int and then do something with it

22366520
for-loop	arrays
first your for-loop should be formatted the way i presented becuase otherwise it was always ending instantly unless there is only 1 customer and also the .add method you were using automatically adds what is inside to the end of the arrays list

22366521
ddms	adb
you can use ddms or adb for work

22366537
accessor	properties
you can call the validateproperty method on the set accessor of a properties to check the value against the validation attributes for the properties

22366589
stdout	stderr
here s an example of a situation where relaying cannot work if the subprocess writes to both stdout and stderr and the java program is relaying then the java program has no way to know the order of the write calls in the subprocess

22366589
stdout	stderr
so the order of the output on stdout and stderr from the java program will be observably different if the two streams end up in the same file

22366589
stdout	stderr
mixing stdout and stderr is of course not a solution because the caller may want to keep them separate

22366634
children	parent
now you can find all the parent splits very easily--they re all the splits that have children

22366644
hive	hdfs
and then i am creating an external table in hive to point the table to the hdfs folder

22366666
range	min
rescaling subtract the min and divide by the range

22366700
aggregate-functions	sum
you should be using a group by clause which will allow you to use aggregate-functions like sum for each variation in the column by which you are grouping

22366704
spotify	rdio
you can look into streaming audio apis such as spotify rdio beats music and others for audio playback

22366760

in the projects class i wanted to declare the foreign key private int contractor_id along with getter and setter as shown commented out but i kept getting a compile error stating the following multiple writable mappings exist for the field projects.contractor_id

22366839
width	height
the difference between the pictures is there height and width and the proportion between them

22366851
for-loop	arrays
it looks like that it starts off every for-loop by creating an arrays and assigning the value of key index0 and index as 0 and 1 respectively

22366853
width	height
when i used the dimensions returned by minimumlayoutsize i got width 151 height 150 which looks like this

22366853
width	height
when i used the dimensions returned by preferredlayoutsize i got width 220 height 180 which looks like this

22366864
daemon	cron
another possible alternative is to use a cron job that runs every minute and acts on logged in users or to have some other daemon that you can signal when a user logs in that does the processing for logged in users on a schedule

22366913
next	except
each row contains a checkbox except the first contains a checkbox in one column a label in the next and a text area in the third column

it turns out that comparing the min and max values is sufficient

22367062
hash	md5
use a well defined hashing algorithm such as md5 rather than the built in hash function in python which may vary by platform or implementation

22367071
many-to-one	one-to-many
family has a bidirectional one-to-many relationship with person but it also has a unidirectional many-to-one relationship with person as well

22367071
instances	transient
according to the database tables the correct columns are created but the build-testdata plugin can t build an instances of family because one of the person instances is transient and wasn t saved

22367080
google-chrome	firefox
i can submit the form and it works perfectly in google-chrome but firefox and ie just sit there like i never clicked the submit button

if you have only two possible rows for every lnumber you should add this important info to your question you can simply use min and max

22378005
free	malloc
also you haven t free the memory which you have allocated using malloc making your program leak memory

22378017
setinterval	settimeout
it s generally recommended to use settimeout to initially schedule a deferred function and then call settimeout again from within that deferred function to schedule its own next execution instead of using setinterval

22378098
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere esb

22378107
google-chrome	firefox
additionally your problem is probably not the use of half a giga byte of memory google-chrome and firefox easily manage to use that much memory by themselves if you open a few tabs but that vlc exceeds your cpu capacity

22378157
versioning	upgrade
if you are building your second versioning and you intend to distribute it as a minor upgrade or especially as a patch then consider taking the warning s advice

22378160
implements	sealed

is there any proper way to connect and access an object upon an action mouse or keyboard on an tree item

22379255

you can use use array dimention as division modulo to derive the index

22379273
innodb	myisam
maybe since innodb has row level locking and myisam table level there might occur some errors if platform wasn t written with the idea of row level locking

22379302
post	put
since the explanation is a bit large to put it into a comment i will post it as answer

22379350

x cos theta x - sin theta y

22379350
cos	sin
y sin theta x + cos theta y

22379350

the files folder is in the root directory

22379541
width	height
it should be enough to use wrap_content as width and height

22379647
int	double
the problem is that in gaze_t the columns 5+ are of type double while in gaze_c they re of type int

22379684
margin	height
your listview item s height is looking bigger because your are applying 17dp padding and 4dp margin at the top and 7dp padding and 4dp margin at the bottom of the textview ...so its taking total 32dp extra space excluding your textview

22379722
accessor	properties
compiling dynamic lambda expressions so you get direct accessor and mutators for the object might really be more efficient than repeating reflection to access properties

22379722
getter	setter
by accepting strings of expressions you do the exact reverse of that and building expressions from that and compiling them just so you get access to getter and setter makes really no sense

22379734
uilabel	uitextview	uilabel	uitapgesturerecognizer	uitapgesturerecognizer	uitextview
if there isn t any pressing reason to use a uitextview such as there being other text being displayed you could use a uilabel combined with a uitapgesturerecognizer to get the effect you re looking for

22379784
ember.js	backbone.js
i guess you want a single page application.make your website using some js framework backbone.js angular ember.js

22379898
getter	setter
i have classes that have getter and setter

22379898
getter	setter
it s ok for me that using this getter and setter but the user of this framework should not see and use this setter

if yes then simply remove installation folder from your joomla directory and refresh page everything should work

22379932

here s the jsbin try clicking the fadein fadeout button and notice how the plate briefly went behind the bottom stack when it s transitioned

22379971
google-chrome	firefox
works perfectly in firefox but not in google-chrome

22379986
for-loop	loops
to loops through each cell column on each row you d need another for-loop

22379986
for-loop	loops
so that code will loops through each row and the inner loops will loops over the columns in that row and the if statement in the inner loops will be true when it encounters a blank cell you can put whatever code in the if and then it will exit the inner for-loop so as to only process the first blank column in each row

22380036
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
so the first big change in your approach would be to use nsurlconnection s delegate approach or possibly use nsurlsession and nsurlsessiontask

22380041
multiplying	division
comparing this with your function it looks as if the problem was one of operator precedence division takes precedence over multiplying

22380044
textview	imageview
i m trying to position a textview over an imageview used as a background image

22380052
min	max

children can belong to more than one parent

22380179

22380203
serializable	deserialization
we ll be populating the cache ahead of time rather than on-demand and it would help to have an efficient containskey-equivalent that only tests whether the specific key is stored without the overheads of serializable deserialization and pulling the content over the wire that come from

22380209

22380374
hide	show
after one step is finished the user should click on the next button and then various div should show hide

22380421

under 64 bit the default comparer treats the type as an unsigned 64 bit integer and so bytes are compared in decreasing address order this being little endian

22380429
maven	pom.xml
and parent projects a b have their own pom.xml as per standard maven rules of parent and child

22380433
button	checkbox
as you may understand below the red highlighted button should un- check all the yellow highlighted checkbox

22380524
google-chrome	firefox
i have checked it in google-chrome ie10 and firefox

google-chrome	firefox
i inserted some text assertions that work in ie but fail on firefox ver 27 and google-chrome ver 33

22380564

have a look at jquery ajax its used to get post data values to any page from client to server

22380565
button	checkbox
i have a input field that validates age and a checkbox that when its clicked it activates the #btn-activation button for the form i want to change my code so the #btn-activation button only gets activated when both of them are true

22380565
button	checkbox
right now if age is invalid you can check the checkbox and the submit button gets activated i only want it to get activated when both of these statements are true

22380611
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition
you then follow each of those two values with an addition subtraction multiplication or division and get the expected mathematical result

22380653
button	checkbox
i click it to highlight it and then click on the verify button at the bottom bar and a box pops up configure domain for single sign-on telling me to go to the directory integration page and complete all steps... there s also a checkbox asking to take me to the directory integration page now

22380674
width	height
remove the height from the image setting only the width will resize the image and keep proportions as well

22380674
width	height
you can use javascript function to get the browser s width height would be something like

22380674
width	height
and you can manage your desired elements width height with the resize and load events by calling this function again

22380699
google-chrome	firefox
works fine on google-chrome but looks really bad on ie firefox

22380756
opera	google-chrome

22380845
nsstring	nserror
- void video nsstring videopath didfinishsavingwitherror nserror error

22380877
packets	pcap
with this filter you will parse out all the packets that contain the host 192.168.1.177 to a new pcap file called 177file.pcap

22380877
udp	tcp	icmp	tcp	icmp	udp	arp	tcp	arp	icmp	arp	udp
you can also specify protocols like tcp udp icmp and arp and parse out those packets into a separate file

22380976
pop-up	dialog
be sure you re in the domains tab in the portal when you add your domain via the pop-up dialog

22381000
stdout	stderr
the deadlock potential exists due to your code trying to do synchronous read from redirected output and doing it for both stdout and stderr

22381000
stdout	stderr
once buffer gets filled up the child process will block on the write to stderr without signaling yet end of stdout stream

22381015
for-loop	arrays
use a standard for-loop for the arrays

22381050
multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
if you are only ever going to add subtract multiplying and divide then you can probably just have those 4 methods

22381061
opensuse	linux
the remote machine is running a fairly recent version of the opensuse linux distro

22381071
filtering	grouping
now i have put in a filtering on the columname grouping that only shows me the columnnames with more then one datatype

22381079
put	get
but when i fill my form end put the enter get not found contact.php error

22381131
keydown	keyup
maybe you should use keydown keys thekey and keyup keys thekey

22381143
monkeyrunner	androidviewclient
i ve also tried with monkeyrunner androidviewclient touch functions

22381154
factors	matrix
in my work r often coerces something into a factors because r does not allow different modes in a matrix but in actuality i would prefer those columns to remain numeric

22381176
children	parent
if your labels are nested inside another element you can have that parent element with an id and then use jquery to handle the children label

22381196
children	parent
finally you would have an xsl choose to output the element if one was found or process the children of the parent element

22381250
int	chars
forcedlog logger log4cplus qbexhabvofstring pbdh1 z referenced in function public void __thiscall oflogger forcedlog int class ofstring const chars const int chars const const

22381444
getter	setter
1 combine the by creating a holder an object with three fields or you can make them private with setter getter

22381456
octal	binary	octal	decimal
it s a program that lets you convert decimal to binary octal and hexa

22381466
for-loop	arrays
i am not sure if maybe the relations are setup incorrectly or that maybe i would have to include an if to see if there is data before the arrays and then implement a for-loop

22381509
client-side	server-side
you re mixing server-side and client-side concerns

22381583
getter	setter
getter setter methods

22381614
post	get
if you re using post in your form you should use and if you re using get in your form you should use

22381691
pop-up	dialog
when click show count button i show in pop-up dialog box

22381770
post	get
you get undefined index post because in the beginning your _session actually does not contain it...you can get rid of the notice by checking if it exists before echo-ing it

22381772
children	parent
event delegation allows you to attach a single event listener to a parent element that will fire for all children matching a selector whether those children exist now or are added in the future

22381777
folder	directory
so your development machine doesn t need to access the production server s folder just point it to some directory on your computer

22381783
traceroute	packets
i m actually in vietnam and when i run traceroute to check path between me and my server in france my packets seem to like travel all around the world instead of going straight to france

22381797
profiling	debugging
the reason is that maybe like in my case the xcode bot was attempting to archive with the development profiling and development profiling is much easier to debugging than 4f96f173-7ebe-4892-b283-52489de2f409

22381835
g++	gcc
your code works with g++ gcc 4.8.2

22381885
minimagick	mogrify	imagemagick	mogrify	imagemagick	minimagick
minimagick is a much more direct mapping to imagemagick commands using mogrify

22381943
octal	binary
inside octal you are calling binary dec instead of octal dec

22381954
pop-up	dialog
i actually discovered this after installing visual studio where the pop-up dialog specifically informs you of this required setting

22381960
equals	gethashcode
it does not work because distinct uses gethashcode + equals to compare objects

22381960
equals	gethashcode
or override equals + gethashcode in your class

22381960
equals	gethashcode
another less efficient approach which doesn t need to create a new class or modify an existing is to use the builtin gethashcode + equals of an anonymous type and enumerable.groupby

22381960
equals	gethashcode
the equals and gethashcode of the iequalitycomparer -class 1

22381976
for-loop	arrays
here i m using the jquery for-loop so specify the arrays then specify a key value

22381986
equals	gethashcode
override equals and gethashcode without implementing

22381986
equals	gethashcode
overriding equals and gethashcode without the interface

22381988
equals	gethashcode
overwrite equals and gethashcode on dns_log

22381990

if you look at in google-chrome and firefox this works fine

22382007
ethernet	wireless
in my current network setup i have a cisco rvs4000 router that feeds into a 48 port ethernet switch and a ubiquiti picostation m2 wireless access point

22382130
put	get
the reason we don t put our models directly on the scope is because persistence.js flushes all changes to all models when you call persistence.flush and if we bind directly to the models some changes that the user didn t want to save might get saved

22382153
nsmenu	nspopupbutton
the only thing which worked in case of a nspopupbutton with an nsmenu was setting it as the delegate

22382173
google-chrome	firefox
especially sensitive in google-chrome as firefox had a better response time---

22382248
hide	show
how it looks with widget here it hide the text for password field but does not show the error_messages properly as set in the error_messages dictionary

22382309
packets	multicast
for some reason client b can receive multicast packets but when sending multicast packets they get lost somewhere

22382338
google-chrome	firefox
but it appears like this in both google-chrome and firefox

22382388
versioning	upgrade
also you can try to do a package upgrade with sudo apt-get update or sudo apt-get dist-upgrade to see if the versioning issue dissapear with a libxml upgrade

22382405
superclass	subclassing
subclassing method calls superclass method

22382408
gridview	onclientclick
but i want the update gridview column value for a particular row based on the some operations in onclientclick button event

22382408
gridview	onclientclick
so i tried to bind the gridview in onclientclick button event also

22382432
int	double
also in your example keys are int but you are declaring them as double

22382463
inherited	subclassing
edit in response to your requirement of needing to print class b b doing something consider composition over inherited since you need b to act as its own subclassing its logger is really not the same as c s unless there are more requirements at play here

22382508
put	get	post	get	post	put
effects of b connection can be lost and data would have to be resent and can be a large amount of data to send at once would have to call a post put as oppose to a get at least i think i do

22382550
plot	heatmap
or 350 miles at the equator and of course you did not provide an actual map but this will plot a heatmap of correlation at the coordinates you provided

22382721
width	height
as i see in source code of datamatrixwriter.encode method arguments width and height are not used for barcode generation at all

22382725
post	get
i have been able to get data via the url on a proxy page but i have been getting the same error over and over again when attempting to post data

22382756

give a try at setting the margins properties inherited from gtkwidget to false

22384966
free	malloc
btw you have not specified the entire structure of your program but a simple data_t msg instance might be sufficient for your needs in which case you don t need to use the malloc and the free

22384966
free	malloc
and as mentioned in a comment by shahbaz if you do end up using malloc and free then you need to make sure that your platform os or bsp supports dynamic memory allocation aka heap

it generates the thumbnails proportional to the image height and width dimensions

22385111
width	height
if we remove the variable in above code it exactly generates a thumbnail with 300 in width so only need is to fill the rest of the height with the white color

22385165
width	height
the problem is when i try to use my svg sprite 1 3 width to height ratio as a background

22385165
width	height
it works correctly when i have a sprite sized 1 2 width to height ratio

22385329
filesystems	fat
you have to exactly replicate the metadata operations that the filesystems handles for you updating the fat tables

22385329
filesystems	fat
in other words you d have to build the entire fat filesystems handling code in your own code

22385342

i am using jquery 1.6 library to find the height but it returns incorrect value for the height and width of hidden elements havin height in percentage

22385496

it works fine in google-chrome and firefox

22385515
width	height
just use auto layout to pin the height and width and the bottom right corner

22385593
width	height
the only reason i have my framelayout set to match_parent is because the user can drag the relative layout anywhere on the screen and if the width and height of the framelayout are wrap_content the relativelayout gets cropped when dragged

22385598
mouseup	mousedown
with this piece of code you can get the position of the mouse pointer on the map you just need to create one handler for the mousedown and the other on mouseup

how can i force user to not use other browser something like when they open the site on google-chrome ie or opera they will receive a message and will be redirected to an info page

22386043
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
so to my eye the issue possibly isn t to do with ie google-chrome firefox or safari - transparency is working fine on all of them - i think it s most likely the way your code is being manipulated or delivered to the browser

22386076
min	max
if you modify wrapper.conf to explicitly set the min and max memory settings to 0

22386128
width	height
this turned out to be non-trivial since for most of the chart s initialization the x y height and width are still zero

22386128
width	height
since position is a percentage both chart areas will always occupy the full height and width of the parent chart

22386148
google-chrome	firefox
tried google-chrome and firefox same behavior

22386273
submit	submission

22386307
typedef	struct
in c++ you cannot use struct mystruct to refer to a tagless structure which has been typedef

22386307
typedef	struct
and you cannot define a different struct mystruct because the name collides with the typedef name

22386310
min	max
chrome works beautifully validating both the regex and the min max values

22386318
multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
you have written a calculator code in any language java c c++ etc which perform 4 operations add subtract multiplying and devide

22386318
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition
and from there you are taking 2 integer inputs and calling your webservice using for addition for subtraction for multiplication and for division

22386318
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition
now you can see each of your webservices operations addidtion subtraction multiplication and division is working as a service and in future lets say you have a requirement to put a equation solving service on your website then you can reuse your addition subtraction multiplication and division web services using those links to make another service

22386322
put	get
i am trying to get the text out of the text file separate it into individual parts and put them into a vector of chars

22386336

22386346
width	height
assuming i can t do this ahead of time with photo editing software should i use the height and width tags in html or in css

hide	show
i would just show hide this view in response to selection changes

22386450
mouse	keyboard
currently it can only handle mouse and keyboard input

22386471
width	height
with the usual approach to use the height and width attributes the whole image still has to be transferred to the browser

22386511
put	get
in multiple places in my program i want to get an int input from the user so i ve separated out the logic for that and put that in its own function

22386513
for-loop	arrays
the strings are being added to the arrays list as i can call them using a for-loop in the main

22386537
google-chrome	firefox
you should look into using google-chrome or firefox extensions for this

22386592
salt	md5
however it should be noted that in laravel you really shouldn t be setting the password by using md5 with a salt but instead use the hashing functions that laravel provides

for example in a file-sharing p2p application the files are stored by the peer and the server is aware of the files that are stored at each peer

22387081
folder	directory
unfortunately the window is still polluted with countless folder paths to unversioned directory created by the compiler ipch folder and these entries make it very annoying to spot the missed code files

22387081
hide	show
i see a ui option to select all files and folders individually but no option to show hide files and folders individually

22387150
mapply	lapply
you can probably do away with your loop by looking into one of the apply functions apply mapply sapply lapply etc

22387150
mapply	lapply
the outer lapply performs the function of the overall higher country-level loop while the inner mapply performs a given set of operations for various arguments for that single country

22387306
mapply	lapply
here i use lapply because you want to change the names in a consistent manner but with mapply you could change each data.frame individually with different names

22387456
post	get
then after the post you can use _post cart_items to get back the cart_items

22387461
int	chars
the compiler will implicitly convert your chars to an int before passing it to isalnum

22387477
udp	tcp
the idea in link above was alice listens to port 5412 sends a udp packet to bob from 5412 the tcp port to 5411

22387477
udp	tcp
bob who doesn t listen uses tcp port 5411 the udp port to connect to alice 5412

and if you have filenames just write a for-loop on an arrays of filenames and customize your error message so that it prints the number of the file that could not be read

22387816
onresume	onpause
for that you didn t provide enough code but i think i can assume the error happens because of the way when you cancel your requests and re-activate them your methods onstop onpause onresume and onstart

22387821
width	height
these units allow you to specify sizes in terms of percentages of the viewport width and viewport height

22387874
client-side	server-side
ok bear with me as this thing is fairly complicated not only to explain - we are trying to provide friendlier client-side validation for file uploads ensuring that any illegal characters are not present in files they are attempting to upload yes we do server-side validation as well but would like to allow the user to fix any illegal characters in files before attempting to upload

22387874
google-chrome	firefox
what is odd is it seems to work fine in firefox 27 but google-chrome 33 and ie9+ seem to exhibit the same issues

22387886
width	height
these units allow you to specify sizes in terms of percentages of the viewport width and viewport height

22387898

it cannot debug firefox or google-chrome

22388068
google-chrome	firefox
webstorm can debug firefox and google-chrome by installing extensions

22388117
oncreate	setcontentview
your locationclass also does not call setcontentview in oncreate so you re not going to see a ui as far as i can tell unless you wanted it through the extends part

22388117
super	extends	superclass	subclassing
if you extends subclassing and put this intent code in oncreate you re probably going to crash as it will call super in myactivity calling oncreate again as it s the superclass and will keep making more intents to start the activity

22388180
loops	while-loop
i tested simulated something similar in a testclass and the result was that a while-loop of course can can update the state in it meaning that if a variable changes in the of a while loops it will of course be checked after every repeat

our azure web application already uses https port 443 with our site certificate we have a wcf service within this webrole that has an https endpoint using our cert to authenticate 1-way ssl this same service needs an additional https endpoint supporting 2-way auth using our cert and the third party s cert

22388259
ssl	https
the key requirement is that it is https port 443 at the above new endpoint without altering the ssl behavior of the rest of the role i have seen entries to change the iis configuration or use the role editor to add an https input endpoint but as we already have an https input endpoint on port 443 using our site cert i don t want to alter affect the whole role

superclass	subclassing
edit i just saw mgamerz answer and realised that line in your superclass activity was where you were trying to make android create the subclassing activity

22388515
superclass	subclassing
i think splitting the class into a superclass and a subclassing is sensible if the superclass has functionality which can will be re-used by multiple subclassing activities

22388515
superclass	subclassing
for example you might have subclassing activities like directionsactivity and searchactivity which have some common map-related activity provided by their superclass mapactivity

22388515
superclass	subclassing
even if you have only one subclassing acitivty now it may still make sense to have a superclass and a subclassing if you think you re likely to write additional map-related activities later on

22388515
superclass	subclassing
i my opinion it s not sensible to split the class into a superclass and a subclassing just because the single class was getting too long

opcache	apc
if you end up using the aws sdk for php make sure you are also using an opcode cache like apc or zend opcache

22388839
int	chars
usually it is fine to pass a chars value to a function that takes an int

22388839
int	chars
so if chars is a signed type this is implementation-dependent and if you encounter a chars with negative value then it will be converted to an int with negative value before passing it to the function

mouseup	mousedown
if the nsbutton is not enabled the mousedown and mouseup behave as expected so when the mouse is pushed down the mousedown is called and when it is released the mouseup is called

for-loop	loops
what i can see by debugging it is going properly till while loops but in for-loop it just stores two strings and prints the same

22389865
for-loop	loops
per the comment above you need to move the for-loop inside the while loops

22411255
for-loop	loops
as of right now all of the panels blink while moving across the screen in random locations i m assuming this is because the for-loop responsible for the blinking is nested within the ticking timer so for each tick it runs through loops fully

22411284

notepad++	sublimetext
i m not sure if notepad++ offers this but you can get an eval copy of sublimetext which does and i highly recommend that anyways

22413884
pdfbox	itext
one major difference is that pdfbox always processes text glyph by glyph while itext normally processes it chunk single string parameter of text drawing operation by chunk

22413884
pdfbox	itext
furthermore the event oriented architecture of itext text parsing means a lower burden on resources than that of pdfbox

post	get
in general you should use a post-redirect-get pattern the user post you redirect and then you use a get to re-render in the browser

22414517
post	get
if you continue to use a full post the httppost version of index should return a redirecttoaction result sending the user back to the get version of index

22414520
versioning	upgrade
so if your linking to versioning 2.6 was anything but an oversite then i suggest that you upgrade to the latest versioning

22415078
jar	war
is there any alternate ways to pull the dependency available in the jar pom file to the war file

22415151
gruntjs	grunt-contrib-connect
this makes sense because grunt-contrib-connect which is the usual server used in gruntjs tasks isn t of any use for a php framework like codeigniter because it won t execute php

22415194
jar	war
the war project should have its own pom file specifying a dependency on your jar project

22415194
jar	war
in this way when you build the war your jar and all its dependencies would be pulled into the war automatically

22415199
google-chrome	firefox
maybe an extension for google-chrome firefox for linux osx

22415204

i did it this way because the categories i want to show hide the columns on are dynamic and the columns are dynamic

22415260
build.gradle	gradlew
to do it create a new gradlew project and just put in its build.gradle the following

22415371

there are ways to do both of these things to some extent in ruby but they are highly dependent on the specific ruby implementation mri jruby macruby as well as the operating system the app will run on

22415470
integer	unsigned
eg unsigned integer + gauge32 + counter32 are all of the type long

22415471
int	double
as a matter of fact java does something similar if you take the max double and try to convert it to an int you will give the max int which is no where near the max double

22415476

bootstrapping llvm clang on various linux distros especially older ones such as rhel 5.x without gnu libstdc++ dependency is too tedious - speaking from my first hand experience

22415694
width	height	width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box	height	border-box
alternatively you could add box-sizing border-box to the box in order to calculate the width height of the box including borders and padding

22415729
post	get
you cannot get the screen width without the client specifically sending it to the server say as a get or post

22415857
versioning	upgrade
since this is a versioning newer your best bet would be to do an in place upgrade on your dev machine which would be fairly quick i assume you are using developer edition which should not cost you anything extra

22415865
avr	attiny	avr	microcontroller
attiny is a range of programmable 8-bit avr microcontroller by atmel

22415868

oracle10g	oracle11g
i just converted from oracle10g to oracle11g

22415918
maven	pom.xml	versioning	upgrade
we are using spring 2.5.6 because it is legacy code previous attempts to upgrade to later versioning of spring by updating the versioning in the maven pom.xml file fail and our deadline is too tight to provide time to fully transition the project to a later versioning of spring

22415958
multiplying	add
therefore generate a standard gaussian distributed variable and multiplying with sqrt scale and add the location parameter

22415985
folder	directory
second option would be create tmp folder within root directory of your application website

22416028
width	height
actually i am looking solution to show as full width and full height

22416066
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
i m not an expert on the subject but looking through the d3 source code and various msdn references i think the problem is that d3 automatically checks whether you re using an absolute url reference and if so assumes that it is a cross-domain request and switches to ie s xdomainrequest instead of xmlhttprequest for older ie

22416066
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
the first line tests whether the xdomainrequest object exists it does for ie8 and up the second tests if the created xmlhttprequest object does not have the withcredentials property for cross-domain requests which only exists in ie10 and up and the third tests whether the url starts with or

22416066
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
so if you pass in an absolute url to any of the d3 file-grabbing functions in an ie8 or ie9 browser it will use an xdomainrequest object instead of xmlhttprequest

22416070
folder	directory
-but for c c++ general additional include directory include the include folder from the connector you installed not server install folder

22416083

22416086
put	get
just updating for current situation s3 natively supports multipart get as well as put

22416118
required	placeholder
another solution would be to add the span and placeholder text outside of the input field but that would required some javascript to control when it is and isn t visible

22416122
webkit	blink
when chrome switched over to the blink rendering engine with version 28 they dropped webkit which is the only engine to support this on mac and ios.

22416122
google-chrome	safari
so unless you re using safari on mac or ios or google-chrome on ios for now you will not be able to support this in other browsers

22416124
ng-style	ng-class
i know there are plenty of directives like ng-style and ng-class but i fear that every tag will have to be a directive because everything could have an ng-style ng-class tag

22416166
sorting	filtering
represents a databindable customized view of a datatable for sorting filtering searching editing and navigation

22416166
datarow	dataview
a datarowview is a row in the dataview so it s a special view of a datarow

22416171

22416250
free	calloc	free	strdup	free	malloc	strdup	calloc	strdup	malloc	calloc	malloc
you can only free a pointer obtained by malloc or calloc or strdup which calls malloc etc.

22416263
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
step 2 we now write a for-loop to run an iteration of n-1 and in that loops we will assign to current variable the first index in the arrays in the first iteration and we will update the current variable by index + 1 each time through the iteration which means that the first time current will hold the first index in the arrays and the second time it will hold the second index in the arrays and so on until loops ends

22416263
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
step 3 we will write a loops within the for-loop used in step 2 to compare the current number to all the integers in the arrays if the integer equals to the next number then we will print the number using a printf statement else update next to hold the next index in the arrays and use that to compare to the current variable and do so until it has been compared to all the integers in the arrays and once this has been done the current variable will be updated to store the next index of the arrays and will compare that particular number to all the integers in the arrays

22416308
inherited	subclassing
even in subclassing and ideally fully implementing abstract classes we are still using inherited

22416314
notepad++	textpad
in windows you can printto a file and open in something like textpad ultraedit or notepad++ and then ask it to reload the file most editors will prompt you to once it realizes a change occurred

punctuation	words
first using tr or maybe sed - slightly slower but more flexible allows more precise removing of punctuation and so on you chunk the sentence file into words

22416320
uniq	grep
you then use uniq to gather unique words and grep -v -f -f dictionary to get all words that are not in dictionary

22416356

min	max
basically i have two arrays and two threads one thread finds the max of array a and another finds the min of array b and stores them in global variables

22418254
min	max
they need to synchronize right before they make a trade the max of a is passed to b and the min of b is passed to a so that array b has all higher values than a - almost like a sorting problem if you will

22418299
inject	interceptor
it s not really true the extension works means it inject the appropriate values into the desired fields as i can see in the log-file but after the interceptor gets applied the inject values are gone

22418301

a transfer-encoding of chunked is traditionally a way of streaming requests to a server where the content-length is unknown in advance. the way you create a chunked request in nsurlsession is to use a nsinputstream with the request rather than a nsdata or file

22428062
chunked	transfer-encoding
unfortunately afnetworking always uses nsinputstream technique for multipart requests at least meaning that all requests are streamed to the server using a transfer-encoding of chunked

d3.js	c3.js
a simple way to do this is using d3.js with c3.js

22428252
c3.js	nvd3.js	d3.js	c3.js
nvd3.js is another d3.js collection of reusable charts like c3.js

3 simplified example of serializable and deserialization

22428441
unsigned	short
i have an assignment from college in which i have to use c to pack three unsigned integers representing a date the year must be between 1970 and 2097 and compress it into an unsigned short then unpack it again and show it in command line

22428442
google-chrome	firefox
the code works fine in firefox and even works in the demo shown in the tutorial in google-chrome but downloading the code and using it separately doesn t work in google-chrome

22428459
inherited	properties
each constructor is a function that has a properties named â œprototypeâ that is used to implement prototype-based inherited and shared properties

22428504
unsigned	short
first you should think about how the date should be presented inside this unsigned short

22428504
unsigned	short
end even firster you should be aware that the length of a n unsigned short is not defined exactly only its minimum which is 16 bits

22428507

width	height
a less hackish version would be to cycle though all objects in the page and compare their offset height width in the page to your point

22428556
put	get
i ma creating android application that get data from web using json and put the data in a listview then after the user click and select a specific data the system will display details in second activity that show the name and some details each value in a textview

post	get
everything works fine when using the dropdown selections to post the data and get a response from php

22428635
submit	submission
if you are not specifying on your add button then two form submission are being triggered - the first by the submit button s #opbutton triggered click

22428635
submit	submission
the submit button gets first go at form submission because the add button will wait till all of its onclick content has executed before moving on to its own default submit

22428635
submit	submission
mobile behaviour comes from how various browser os combos process competing form submission some will block after the first and only send that one the #opbutton submit i guess in an attempt to combat double-click double submit problems while others will begin processing the first but send the second if it comes in time before the page is unloaded

22428726
ubuntu	linux
i solved this in linux ubuntu by switching devices via the v4l2 graphics driver

22428732
pull	push
keeping it as an array allows you to easily push pull shift unshift insert delete or sort elements then when everything is as you want it simply output it

22428766

sum	floor
by starting the sum with 0.0 we make sure total is a floating point value avoiding the python 2 floor division behaviour of with integer operands

22428873
width	height
you can also try to run calculations on the depth height width and weight properties since anything over a certain size and weight probably won t be a portable device and therefore won t be a slate

22428888
int	chars
and i am not sure why you are using all oledbtype chars for eg if u have id int than you must use oledbtype.int32 else it will generate exception hope it will help you

22428932
webkit	gecko
you can also see the support with the wikipedia article comparison of layout engines html5 for webkit gecko etc

22428937
hide	show
the above example show that it is fine to hide a field with an identically named local variable or method parameter as long as the field is always accessed with qualification after a

22428937

22428980
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
according to deanhume.com only safari and google-chrome supports it and maybe firefox also supports it because in their documentation they are not flagged with the warning this api has not been standardized. so w3schools may be right

22428982
onresume	onpause
if you start it by bindservice method in onresume and unbind in onpause of each activity in your application it should run all the time

22428983
next	except
controllers should be the last stop in the middleware chain except in rare circumstances and if you find yourself wanting to use next you can probably solve your problem with policies instead

22428999
opera	google-chrome
when you ve got bugs like which make contenteditable totally irritating for users on google-chrome opera and which hasn t been even confirmed by developers throughout entire year then a small difference in tab s behaviour is a detail which you have to fix and forget

dump does what show does but also might provide an alternate view of the data either hex or binary translations of the values or perhaps tables

22429175
inherited	subclassing
this typically but not always comes about when a language supports inherited subtyping where a type t may be a subtype child subclassing terminology depends on language of a type s

22429189
post	get
i m assuming this has to do with the fact that my variables aren t transferring over i tried reading previous post that were somewhat similar to my question but i can t seem to get my variables to be transferable to other methods

22429371
margin	height
the problem is that both the parent s and the child s height are unknown at design-time so i tried using percentages with the negative margin method but the outcome goes completely insane and i can t figure out what s wrong with my code

22429385
wmic	tasklist
i recently found that wmic windows management intrumentation command-line existed d which is far better w more options than the regular tasklist in cmd that saves me time

22429465
google-chrome	firefox
however if the size is really important for you maybe you could consider to develop a google-chrome or firefox extension that would generate the smallest file to distribute

22429465
tidekit	tidesdk
edit it seems that the people that worked in tidesdk started a new project tidekit with a similar key features and including mobile platforms it s explained here

22429506
for-loop	arrays
that ll give you a mostly vectorized solution where the m-code level for-loop is o n where n is the number of classes not the length of the whole input arrays

22429534
debian	linux
chrome version 32.0.1700.123 linux - debian 7.0 wheezy

22429586
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
when i changed the position to top -8px the image appeared in the right place in google-chrome one pixel off in firefox and safari and completely wrong in ie

22429586
google-chrome	firefox
since i ve solved the problem i have at least one answer but i d be interested if there is better more official explanation for what was happening especially regarding the one pixel shift between google-chrome and firefox

22429592
post	put
in the end i resolved issue 1 by upgrading my project to jersey client v2.6 and configuring the client to automatically buffer all my post put requests such that they are repeatable in response to any 407 challenges that come back from the proxy server

22429592
post	put
i worry about the overhead of buffering large put post requests in memory and the potential loss of efficiency in not chunking the data

22429604
versioning	upgrade
want to upgrade hhvm to a newer versioning

22429626

i2c	spi
the other two serial interfaces can be spi or i2c

22429640
post	get
with post you will get different results than hitting the page directly because you are looking for something to be posted

22429661
width	margin
percentage margin is always relative to the containing block s width so this won t work like you expect

22429678
titlebar	window
the same problem is with window title - method windowtitle returns new title but title on a titlebar is old

22429735
onresume	onpause
it seems you have to clear errors onpause instead of onresume onstart

22429735
super	implements
if you want to handle the state yourself you need to implements and override onsaveinstancestate and not call super

22429759
serializable	deserialization
during serializable and deserialization

22429796
width	height
if you re doing the upload via ajax and the server is returning a very simple json array success width height then your code might look something like this

22429816
liferay	alfresco	liferay	bonita	bonita	alfresco
i am authenticating with cas into bonita alfresco and liferay

22429816
liferay	bonita
the first time i am authenticating with cas everything works fine but when i logout from liferay which should then logout automatically from cas the current bonita session is not terminated

22429816
liferay	alfresco	liferay	bonita	bonita	alfresco
the next time i login with cas the liferay and alfresco sessions are correct they belong to the new user but the bonita session doesn t change the old user is still connected

22429869
hardware	device-driver
the device-driver is where the actual communication with hardware will take place

22429948
lisp	scheme
both scheme and common lisp original binding way did this but you tend to find yourself debugging for hours because you forgot to quote the symbols

22429966
jobs	cron
in the first case probably each language has it s own implementation of cron jobs just get that part of cron that computes the time and use it

22429991
put	get
a service is running in background to get the longitude and latitude and put it a sqlite database

22430011

there are various dedicated libraries for doing this such as smarty and twig or you can just include a php file which you have designated as your template

22430158
put	get
i want to put spaces before the numbers to get the triangles shape

22430160
lisp	agda	haskell	agda
the point is they claim that haskell or agda etc has additional information at compile time that is not available to a dynamic language like lisp

22430187
imageview	picasso
using an imageview with picasso to load the image works without any problem

22430187
width	height
after digging in volley s code it seems that the problem might be related to getting the width and height of the networkimageview but i haven t had time to debug the library

22430198
post	get
you haven t shown the markup for the #showdraw form but based on the description it sounds like the form is set to post or perhaps get i suppose back to the same server-side resource which produces this page

22430198
client-side	server-side
you could wrap this client-side code in a server-side conditional of some sort only emitting it under specific conditions

22430204
post	get
you can get the number of post

22430215
gruntjs	yeoman

and when i deploy my application and put url i get answer in internet browser google chrome as follow

22430236
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i understand that this is possible in google-chrome and opera using the html5 filewriter api but this is not supported for firefox and safari

22430249
width	height
so only images with height and width equal or more than 1185 will be printed with good quality

22430253
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
on google-chrome firefox and opera there is no problem with the footer and making it sticky to the bottom using

22430272
apple-touch-icon	favicon
because the webapp can also run in the browser i have already created some icons like favicon apple-touch-icon and apple-touch-startup-image and want to reuse these icons in the android project automaticly

folder	directory
the simplehttpserver module will only serve things that are within the directory you re telling it to serve and folder beneath that directory for security reasons

22430291
children	parent
create two separate parent type variable to hold the children references

22430320
int	double
smooth motion you need to apply relative dsp digital sinal processing so if you have y10 to y0 the interval is 10 int take this split by 100 10x100 will give you 1000 as you are applying it with the idea of double and repeat then you have 10x100x2 2000 that means a vector with 2000 to be moving in your canvas graph targeted coordinates displayed in your plotting area 1000

22430327
google-chrome	safari
i ve also tried to create a div class for the left part and the right part in the header but some how the text and icons keeps going out of the header in safari and google-chrome

22430342
width	height
as an aside in your example code you are using width twice and appear to be not using height

22430382
width	height
i load up a large stack of large images and get an array of shape num-rasters h w where num-rasters is the number of images and h w are height width of an image which are all the same size

22430397
fileoutputstream	filewriter
calling createnewfile before either new fileoutputstream or new filewriter is not only redundant but wasteful

22430410
opensuse	linux
i am working on a linux machine running opensuse 13.1 w kde specifically and i would like to determine what commands are actually being issued in the background when i do something with an application s gui

i am new at drawing with cairo and gtk and the program i m working on needs to draw a circle tiling of 500x500 or 1000x1000

22430436
keydown	keyup
one thing to be aware of is keypress will fire when a key is pressed and released keydown fires when a key is pressed and keyup fires when a key is released

22430447
int	double
the list.get instead of and it is better style to use int i as index instead of double e

22430453
int	double	int	boolean
variables types primitives first boolean int float double

22430480
macdeployqt	qmake
its actually a qt based app that i build using qmake make macdeployqt and not using xcode

22430485
spaces	delimiter
so i try to do this with the delimiter being the spaces key and it seems that strtok no only reads null after the first run the first entry into the while do-while no matter how big the string but it also seems to wreck the source turning the source string into the same thing as tok

22430492
range	minimum
you can convert the range yourself but change values in the process do an explicit cast and potentially loose precision or instruct matlab to use the minimum and maximum value found in the image matrix as the white and black value to scale to when visualising

22430545
ubuntu	linux
using linux ubuntu 12

22430567
fadein	fadeout
you can fadein the next image in the callback of fadeout as shown below

22430567
fadein	fadeout
you don t have to play with z-index property at all since both fadein and fadeout changes the elements display property itself

22430574
gif	bmp
does the default media receiver support image formats such as jpeg bmp gif etc

22430592
next	except
and everything is fine except i need the end of operation order of elements be exactly the same as the beginning so next should append

22430607
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
it works great in firefox and safari but not in google-chrome ie or opera

22430607
opera	google-chrome
in google-chrome ie opera whenever i click the link nothing happens independent of the content of the html file

22430632
draggable	droppable
after i got this working i tried adding a few other new features like applying a is-swap class to the draggable when it s hovering over a non-empty droppable and applying a is-drop class to it when it s hovering over an empty one

22430632
draggable	droppable
i ve realized that what i need to do should i wish to continue making use of jquery ui is not to sub-class draggable or droppable but rather just use them in a totally new widget

22430632
draggable	droppable
draggable and droppable are both widgets that get instantiated on many different elements each draggable is its own instance and each droppable is its own instance but what i need is one widget that contains many draggable and droppable

22430632
draggable	droppable
right now my plan is to create a widget that can be instantiated on some kind of container element and provide options that allow a consumer of the widget to target the desired elements as draggable and droppable and simply utilize draggable and droppable in their natural state

22430639
width	margin
i m trying to center the rows in a table element on a page and they won t center--and i ve discovered that for some reason the tbody and so the table width are expanding to the entire width of the page so margin 0 auto

22430708
post	get
i don t think it was clear in my original post that in order to get rapid updates i am running multiple copies in parallel of the scripts that grab api data

22430708
hash	md5
each instance already has it s own instance id created from an md5 hash

22430758
post	get
usually with that kind of injection you want to do you will want to use to fetch your javascript functions definitions meanwhile your ajax to get post the script that contains your html structures

22430774
unsigned	short
looking at the utf8-cpp examples i notice that it uses an std vector unsigned short as storage for utf-16 strings

22430774
unsigned	short
and in my utf16to8 function i would have to copy the data from an std wstring into an std vector unsigned short and then use it for conversion

22430785
gruntjs	yeoman
kickstart your angularjs development with yeoman gruntjs and bower step by step tutorial

22430785

but somehow superscript and subscript below it doesn t work

22430967
children	parent
i have a hierarchical lattice structure where each node has some parent and children

22430967
children	parent
the nodes are such that the the objects contained within the children are subsets of the objects in the parent s

22430974
put	get
note if you put the script in the header you should tell to the javascript to run the code when the page is fully loaded or else you are not able to get the element jquery already does this for you but if don t want to use it this is the right way to do it

22431002
keydown	keyup
the keydown and keyup events however pass scan codes instead of character codes

22431082
gruntjs	package.json
to work with gruntjs you need to create 2 files at the root of your project s directory - a package.json file to store metadata about the project and a gruntfile.js that is used to load gruntjs plugins and configure tasks

22431082
gruntjs	package.json
to install gruntjs plugins and have them entered into your package.json file enter into the terminal

22431160
hide	show
i m attempting to use slide to simultaneous show a new div and hide the old one - the problem is that the new div doesn t slide in next to the old one - it slides in next to and underneath it and then suddenly pops into the correct position at the end of the animation

22431182
google-chrome	firefox
i would start using google-chrome dev tools or firebug in firefox and run

22431193
google-chrome	firefox
the docs are pretty good and everything seems to be working great with the exception of firefox i can t seem to be able to get a background.js script to behave how it should which is like it how it behaves in google-chrome

22431193
google-chrome	firefox
unlike ie and google-chrome firefox builder ditches the background.js page and doesn t seem to use the forge.html page at all even though it is present in the extension code

22431196

22437302
width	height
using this way you should remember last height width and recheck container scrollbar ony if height or width was changed because function that run with this small interval should execute as less code as possible

22437302
width	height	hide	show
if you want only to hide vertical scrollbar - do not display it even if it s visible you can use next technique wrap container into another one with overflow hidden but without height width set inner container overflow-y scroll to always show vertical scrollbar and margin-right -17px to make scrollbar to be out of parent container and scrollbar will be hidden

for primitive types you can just use int double float with capital first letters and java will auto-box the objects into primitive types

22438442
equals	compareto
of course it is best practice to have equals match your compareto logic

22438511
textarea	pre
i ve worked around this by rendering divs instead of input fields when i need the field disabled or pre instead of a textarea

22438538
children	parent
must it be explicate by the child view controller or is it possible to do by the parent container - which has no knowledge of what will be presented by its children

i.e lets say the arraypicker has a value of 4 then the for-loop will then select the nsstring from the arrays initialize the sprites object with the image name position etc and then it is added to self s children this repeats 4 times but only the last added instance of sprites will have the image you want and will run the actions

22447164

what i mean is that if you only want to select a random value from the arrays and set its properties maybe you could remove the for-loop

multiplying	add
one way to convert to a datetime from integer start representation yyyymmddhhmm and adding an integer duration in minutes is to just add a seconds portion change from 12 digits to 14 digits by multiplying by 100 and then add an interval and mysql will implicitly convert the integer value to datetime

22448440

this should not be done along with the show hide of the columns no need to reload data you allready have

22448523
youtube	vimeo
i have a video model which supports multiple third party video services such as youtube vimeo and livestream

22448527
children	parent
i would restructure the code and slightly the html to count the actual children present under a given parent rather than use a global counter because the global counter can t possibly keep a separate count for each separate hierarchy

22448527
children	parent
fyi you could keep a per-hierarchy counter by using .data counter on each parent as you add each child under that parent but i see no reason to separately manage a counter when you can just see how many children are actually in the dom itself and base your addition on that

22448551
leaflet	rmaps
i was trying out rmaps package which uses leaflet js api

22448551

uipagecontrol	uipageviewcontroller
uipagecontrol and uipageviewcontroller are out of sync

22448706
ubuntu	linux
on an iaas you need to choose the os you want like for example linux ubuntu and then you have to install configure everything as if it is your own computer

22448707
uiapplication	uiwindow
best approach will be overwriting send event of uiapplication and uiwindow but its not possible in your case

22448712
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
but it would be quite troublesome and time consuming to install and uninstall the program on many computers during versioning upgrade also more complicated to call the program from bat files

22448722
textblock	gridviewcolumn
yeah you can do that but for that you need to define celltemplate with textblock and set background on it since background property is not exposed for gridviewcolumn

22448771
spaces	delimiter
str.split defaults to having white spaces as the delimiter

22448775
free	malloc
the error says malloc error for object 0x7fa7b3501330 pointer being free was not allocated

22448844
matlab	freemat
had issues running parallel as an external command from freemat matlab lookalike

22448865
screens	tablet
beside the fact that you have to make it available for different screens densities and resolutions you must make some screenshots for the tablet version optimize layout for larger screens use icons assets designed for tablet screens make sure you declare hardware dependencies not all tablet have calling functionality or front camera

22448963
screens	tablet
so that site adapts itself to the screens size whether it be tablet or mobile device or desktop

multiplying	add
like this i have more than 40 cells to multiplying and add the sum together

22449012
treeviewitem	menuitem
in case you want to pass server instance datacontext of treeviewitem you can simply do since menuitem will inherit it from stackpanel

22449025
for-loop	loops
you initialize it only inside the for-loop which is conditional and in case the condition doesn t satisfy loops may not be executed leaving str un-initialized

22449040
ubuntu	linux
running hadoop on ubuntu linux

22449079

given that the iv is normaly a binary data of a certain length and for instance a string terminating 0 hex 0x00 can be occuring inside i am puzzled what format is desired

22449100
bugsense	acra
you could also opt for third-party crash reporting mechanisms like acra flurry bugsense etc

22449172
min	max
you could use min and max as correctly suggested by mdebeus

22449188
ng-class	ng-include
as you have probably noticed grid.html and list.html are very similar so if you have only these two options you may decide not to use ng-include with separate switchable views at all but place content view directly into your route s template and just switch classes used in panels using ng-class directive which can switch classes when view is changed

22449192
folder	directory
i am using a nant script in a separate folder and so couldn t just change directory changing the current directory within nant doesn t work for this problem

22449225
children	parent
your approach is not very efficient because you are enumerating parent children for each child in children collection

22449225
equals	gethashcode
more efficient and easy to read way is implementing equals and gethashcode methods for child class or creating custom iequalitycomparer for child class

22449225
equals	gethashcode
if child name can be used as it s identity then you can override equals and gethashcode in following way

22449225
children	parent
if you don t see some child in results then child with same name exists in parent children collection

22449251
inherited	properties
however if you use plain inherited with notimplementederror your code won t fail until you actually invoke the method properties in question

nullpointerexception	classcastexception
as soon as you fix the nullpointerexception you will get a classcastexception

22449933
post	get
you can facilitate this as well by thinking of your view as a light abstraction that handles things like marshalling params get post etc

22450080
comparator	comparable
if you specify a comparator in the collections.sort method it will take that into account no matter even it the class implements comparable

22450107
post	put
i d also like to know if it would be more efficient or smarter to use the post method or any other instead of put

22450175

i have placed the tag into my post but it seems to get ignored using the below script

22450645
sorting	filtering
also there wont be the possiblity of filtering sorting the data since it is just not necessary

22450648
width	height
rows 10 and cols 45 are the height and width of the textarea so you can adjust that to the preffered size of the text area

22450686
hide	show
consequently the os will decide when to show hide the scroll bars and when to let the user use them

22450756
post	get
if you get only one post back the will be ignored see the_excerpt vs

22450763
skphysicsbody	skshapenode
since you may be creating an skshapenode or skphysicsbody ellipse or rectangle using cgrect you should offset it so the center of the rect matches the center of the sprite so that the shape and the physics body are in the expected position

i mean they have to have a public getter and setter method

22451277
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
this uinavigationbar is created automatically as it is in a uinavigationcontroller

22451318
for-loop	loops
since your semi-colon in the for-loop is missing the return is parsed as being the body of loops

22451318
for-loop	loops
adding an empty statement in the form of braces makes the for-loop have an empty body which moves the return to outside loops

22451340

super	extends
interfaces can extends of each other but no a super class for interfaces

22451459
post	get
client- serwer is via post get

22451533
portrait	landscape
create 2 xibs one for portrait an one for landscape

22451558

hex	binary
binary hex utf8..

22451735
for-loop	loops
as in c# development in my past i never create a new instance of some tcp socket in loops if i want to make it asynchronously - i create a single instance with delegates to async functions and if there is a similar situation in c# project like in javascript code here in the question s content because it s doesn t produce new objects in for-loop it takes less memory and as for architecture it s represented as more clean and good solution

22451742
free	malloc
looks like you re changing line inside the loop so you re not free ing the same pointer you got from malloc

22451748
free	malloc
- never mix new free malloc delete

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
if you stick to built-in widgets and composites your applications will work similarly on the most recent versions of internet explorer firefox google-chrome and safari

22452305
equals	gethashcode
if the food class does not override equals and gethashcode yet you can create a special iequalitycomparer and supply it as a parameter to intersect

22452330
folder	directory
after downloading the required npm just place it in the node_modules folder in the root directory of the app

22452345

width	height
basically i want to use a higher dpi image in the pdf but with width and height less than 1000px and 600px respectively

22452619
getter	setter
another way would be to override the getter and setter on the object so they create a changed property list that is stored internally in the object

22452630
backbone.js	backbone-forms
i am trying out backbone-forms backbone.js plugin and want to use jst templates to make custom forms

22452687

however except for special case it is better to customize the uiview subviews when it s initialized from parent viewcontroller you have all you need and more importantly it is a synchronous call

22452879
udp	tcp
as far as i can see the phone only has tcp and udp connectivity

22452963
post	get
i m trying to query wordpress post by using query_posts and trying to save them in an array so that i get retrieve the post from array

22452980
double-pointer	pointers
when you malloc memory for it it s not updating the pointers in your main function only your local copy of the double-pointer

22452980
double-pointer	pointers
you could instead pass in a pointers to the double-pointer the function would take a triple-pointer your code would work then

22452980
double-pointer	pointers
alternatively make a new double-pointer inside your function do your work leaving the code in your function roughly as-is and before you return assign the memory back into the pointers passed in from main

22453005
put	get
simply put i get a exp error when trying to start a different shell from my putty session

22453018

22453029
apktool	dex2jar
we know that using tools like apktool dex2jar can get the source code of an apk

22453152
equals	gethashcode
your equals and gethashcode implementations should involve the exact same set of properties

22453152
equals	gethashcode
in more formal terms gethashcode must always return the same value for two objects that compare equals

22453152
equals	gethashcode
so what happens is that linq calls gethashcode on two objects you consider equals gets back different values concludes that since the values were different the objects cannot be equals so there s no point at all in calling equals and moves on

22453152
equals	gethashcode
to fix the problem either remove the ret_usd factor from gethashcode or introduce it also inside equals whatever makes sense for your semantics of equality

22453175
children	parent
if you remove children and reset their parent property to null however these child records are only updated with null parent reference but not deleted from the database

22453191
accelerometer	gyroscope
my idea is using device s accelerometer and gyroscope

22453193
equals	gethashcode
gethashcode is intended as a fast but rough estimate of equality so many operations potentially involving large numbers of comparisons start by checking this result instead of equals and only use equals when necessary

22453193
equals	gethashcode
if you implement gethashcode in a way that causes gethashcode to be different for two objects where equals returns true then you have a bug in your code and many collection classes and algorithms relying on these methods will silently fail

22453195
portrait	landscape
each time i swipe there will be a new page loaded now i had everything working in portrait first and now i am trying to get it working with landscape and portrait

22453211

22453411
equals	gethashcode
rewrite you gethashcode implementation like this to match the semantics of your equals implementation

22453431
portrait	landscape
this method will retain the state of your app whenever you change the orienation of your from to portrait to landscape or vice versa

22453702
innodb	myisam

22457484
versioning	upgrade
so i think that the fundamental issue is not related to a delphi versioning upgrade but rather is related to you having locked your toolbars

22457695
typedef	struct
also c-style struct typedef are unnecessary in c++ and arguably unclear most places in c so anywhere you have

22457709
google-chrome	firefox
the -webkit-filter declaration works in google-chrome the filter url declaration works in firefox

22457709
google-chrome	firefox
this is a little flaky i can animate the filter property in google-chrome but not firefox but mostly good

22457709
width	height
this doesn t happen in firefox because in the filter url i can define the width height of my filter to give enough space for the blur to show without getting cut off

22457709
width	height
it looks like this setting the width height of the filter to 140 of the size of the original image

22457754
inherited	subclassing
in a nutshell it uses generic code paths if your subclassing defines _pdf and does not define _logpdf then it inherited

22457792
maven	pom.xml
from here it s possible to use maven properties in the pom.xml or in the settings file and maven profiles

22457802
google-chrome	firefox
yes where ie and firefox apply the transition correctly in the above declaration google-chrome ignores it entirely

22457831
width	height
i know the dimensions of the image so i know width height ratio

22457839
fadein	fadeout
i hid it with fadeout and fadein which seems to cause problems with masonry

22457896
folder	directory
if you are simply deploying the .zip file you can place it in a sub-folder in the appropriate language folder inside your itemtemplates directory

22457897
inherited	subclassing
i reasoned that these should be subclassing of the mesh class and inherited the size of the mesh so that when these objects are created they are automatically the same size as the mesh natively

22457897
inherited	properties
i m having difficulty inheriting the properties of the mesh class in this way though so i m wondering if anyone is able to explain how to correctly use super in this case and how i can automatically inherited the parameters nx and ny from a mesh object to an electric field among others object once i instantiate it

22457914
filtering	grouping
i have tried with filtering instances by using resource tag instance id security grouping and subnet

22457939

put	get
i put a break point at the callback and i never get stopped there.

22458081
jquery	scriptaculous
anyway i would suggest using a different probably jquery powered lightbox-script like fancybox so you don t need that overhead of jquery prototype and scriptaculous

22458132
perceptron	sigmoid
note that as the k parameter of the sigmoid tends toward infinity the sigmoid approaches the step function which is the activation function used in the basic perceptron

22458157
preorder	inorder
iv gotten an inorder version of the code i want its a simple insert function that threads the tree but now my problem is changing this code into a preorder insert

22458177
serializable	deserialization
what is interesting is that the serializable and deserialization occurs on a separate thread so i would not have thought ui interruptions would have occurred

22458210
express	node.js
now i have a node.js express application running on at machine1 3000 mynodeapp

22458325
factors	matrix
im running where dist_list is a list of distance matrix in dist class and group_list a list of factors

22458378
width	height
for such case i ve created a custom imageview that maintains it s height relative to width

22458378
width	height
it has the custom attribute height_ratio that s multiplied by width to get height

22458411
innodb	myisam
can anyone please tell if it is possible to create a read replica from a database that contains both innodb and myisam tables in amazon rds service

i need to set up a batch file that will copy files from a preset directory several layers down organized into a folder in the current directory using batch files

22458502
pop-up	dialog
in my javafx application i want to pop-up some dialog box as confirmation box

22458502

22458552
mouse	keyboard
i want to display the line column numbers based on the position of the text pointer when changed using keyboard or mouse in the statusbar

22458594
put	get
just serialiaze your vectorlayer.features feature collection translate geometries using openlayers.format.wkt parser to get the wkt of your geometries and then use simple insert update to put your wkt into your database and convert it back to geometry with the help of a spatial function

22458620
maven	pom.xml
under build enter your root pom.xml location this will be relative to the location of your svn checkout so if your pom.xml is under then enter maven pom.xml

22458631
for-loop	loops
you can use parallel programming to improve the loops save time with parallel for-loop

22458725
int	chars
i m confusing how to transform values in 2d chars array into number int

22458759
integer	unsigned
a usual 4-byte unsigned integer as example as everybody should know it has exactly 32bit

inherited	properties
as you figured out already some properties of window are inherited properly while others are not

22458830
organization	naming
given a sql server database table organization containing a smallint column icompanyid ignore the naming convention it dates back 12 years that is neither an identity nor indexed but must be unique

22458838
addition	multiplication
here is my example in mathematics a group is a set of objects that can be composed with each other using some operation in some sensible way - for example the positive real numbers form a group under normal multiplication x y x ã y and the set of integers form a group where the multiplication operation is is addition m n m + n

22458838
addition	multiplication
for example the identity element for positive reals under multiplication is 1 and the identity element for integers under addition is 0

22458843
pop-up	dialog
i was using a 3rd party commercial library to pop-up window dialog where it was possible i had a reused partial page also containing the same id for a field

22458875
caanimation	calayer
caanimation effects to calayer properties and it finishes immediately if there no changes in animatable properties

22458915
scheme	racket
racket isn t really scheme as for example racket requires a different if syntax than scheme

22458925
width	height
did you tried to set a height width of your elements and add

22458930
min	max
just use value min max comes from calender to set datepiker.maxdate datepiker.mindate

22458972
min	max
you can supply either min max or exact or a mixture

22459023
width	height
what is weird is that the first time i drag the image into the div it returns height 24 and width 24 which is not correct

22459048
hide	show
it s not as simple as replace the template with new data i need to hide show information based on what is returned

22459055
width	height
specifically when window width is no more than 680px iframe height should be

22459071
min	max
effectively this calculates max then min and then subtracts but does 16 values at once with each instruction

22459092
postgresql	mysql
i was using mysql database but i decided to migrate to postgresql because better optimization easy work with openlayers and geoserver

22459173
trojan	botnet
this website believes that my server is infected with a spam sending trojan proxy or some other form of botnet and it is not

22459199
postgresql	mysql
the encapsulation in double-quotes is how postgresql quotes identifiers equivalent to backticks in mysql or square brackets in ms sql server

22459216
next	except
it prints fine every time except when two 2 zeros are next to each other

22459242

ng-show	ng-hide
ng-show ng-hide

22459325
ng-show	ng-hide
angularjs ng-show ng-hide

22459397
min	max
besides the bad logic pointed out in the other answers you could use max and min to do a single logical check for certain cases

22459418
int	chars	subtract	add
this is because when you add and subtract chars java performs a widening conversion to int so to store the value back into the it is necessary to cast it to chars again

22459437
portrait	landscape
it seems you are using a single styling for both portrait landscape orientations that refer to viewport size in a relative way

22459450
children	parent
if the parent doesn t have any children yet it creates and appends the extra ul tag

22459503
instances	transient	persistent	transient
on transient state update persistent state return an attached instances let given instances unchanged and detached

width works but height doesnt

22459572
google-chrome	firefox
same issue in ie11 firefox and google-chrome

22459585
post	get
to be sure you re accessing the correct post s meta perform a reset and get the global

22459621
box-sizing	margin
since you re using the box-sizing property to help control the block widths it is better to use padding rather than margin for the gutters

22459621
width	margin	box-sizing	margin
as explained here box-sizing only incorporates the padding into the element width not the margin

22459629
put	get
1 create parametermap - put parameters to map and validate it with schema - this is preferred solution but problem with this solution is that i get runtime errors instead of compile-time errors now application refuse to compile because of bad arity when i forgot to refactor some part of application

22459654
width	height
however animating a width or height property is a different thing

22459654
width	font-size	width	height	fontfamily	font-size
layout properties height width position left top font-size fontfamily margin-width border-width...

22459654
google-chrome	firefox
of course every browser is different and they especially google-chrome and firefox evolve very quickly so they are being optimised all the time

22459685
many-to-many	one-to-many
in one-to-many relationship a parent table may contain multiple child records with same id but if a record in child table has many parents as well then it should be a many-to-many relationship

22459800
inherited	subclassing
anyway consider to document well what savecore and id stands for since inherited add complexity to your implementation and subclassing might be implemented in a wrong way

22459815
background-image	background-color
is there a way to disregard a background-color where a background-image is positioned

22459816
post	get
get requests are executed well and correct but the post request is getting the http status 415

22459876
put	get
try to drill down to specific authorization like put get setid setall when you start developing a real application

22459885
width	height
i am trying to set the height of a div based on its width and then applying a multiplication factor

22459885
width	height
if the div is a bannerbox ie has the bannerbox class then i need the height of this div to be 1.08571 the width

22459921
prepare	execute
you re then basically given an id for these allocated resources and can execute this prepare statement by just filling in the blanks in the statement

22459957
mouse	keyboard
if this doesn t work for what you need you can open the on-screen keyboard in the remote desktop and click the ctrl + alt + delete keys with the mouse

22460013
google-chrome	firefox
i managed to get google-chrome firefox and ie to actually fire the ajax call even when pressing the back button

22460046
onclick	onchange
generally the onclick event should not be placed on each option instead the onchange event on the select element should be handled to find out the option selected plenty of threads on so discuss this eg html javascript select action

22460194
post	get
if you re using a dart httpclient which provides an httpclientrequest to make requests from a server to another server as far as i can tell the only http methods available are get and post corresponding respectively to the post posturl and get geturl functions

22460204
getter	setter
abstract class employee 4 attributes getter setter

22460251
implements	extends
the extension methods in this namespace extends which is implements by the task collection in your case

22460270
public	protected
i tried changing the functions to protected instead of public - same problem

22460297
post	get
if you look at the httpclient source you ll see that the get and post methods are just aliases for open anyway

22460329
post	get
just wanted to append some issues with the cors rework at the bottom - the problem with it is that if your input does not support the get and post method the options request is not actually returning the correct allowed headers

22460329
post	get
it really isn t looking at which methods are actually allowed on the wcf endpoint - its just artificially saying get post are allowed for every single endpoint in the application when a client performs an options request which is really the client asking what is supported

22460387
int	chars
chars in c and c++ is just another numeric type like int but smaller generally one byte

22460395

22460461
post	get
i have read other post about this deprecation in ios 7 however i can t seem to get them to work for my specific case

22460462
versioning	upgrade
just upgrade to recent xcode 5.1 versioning and accidentally found cool feature in storyboards - pin two elements vertically and keeping aspect ratio between of them

22460526
int	chars
to solve that you could consider using a map from chars to int to store the counts adding chars to the key of the map with a count value of 1 as you find them incrementing the count by one if it is already present

22460530
width	height
not necessarily responsive use media queries for that but it is fluid width and full height with event cards that will adjust columns based on width

22460592
screens	tablet
for desktop and large screens it works great but whenever i load it inside a tablet the image goes over to the next line

22460689
versioning	upgrade
even minor upgrade to the simulator result in a major versioning bump to the com interface. so i have to build my library against every supported versioning of the simulator

22460720
spaces	delimiter
assuming that fel is always a single word that is delimiter by a spaces you could use the following expression

22460767
superclass	subclassing
i want every subclassing of superclass to have the static variable z

22460781
keystore	jks
i have a server keystore jceks type and a client keystore jks type the server uses a truststore cacerts where i imported both certificates because i also want to use this truststore for client authentication

22460834
width	height
problem is the buttons are automatically stretched to completely fill the jscrollpane completely ignoring the set height and width

22460862
width	height
the values of the height and width can be adjusted depending on the size you wish to obtain

22460888
superclass	subclassing
in other words subclassing of superclass share superclass.z but they cannot override it on a class-by-class basis

22460903
post	put
that goes in the url section and it has a raw xml data post section where i put my xml

22460903
post	get
what would be really helpful is if postman had an output that was a literal url with everything in it post url base + authtoken + the xml -- because i can do it in postman 200 ok just can t get the php to do the same

22460975
int	double
you will need to double the size of your working canvas to work in int then scale back to 50 at the end

22460995
implements	extends
the second extends the first and implements a interface

22460999
put	get
simply put the multiple get statements cause the entire stream to be requested more than once

22461033
onmousedown	onmouseup
interesting approach is to add touch handling to onmouseup onmousedown event

22461049
min	max
assuming i understood the question this returns a sorted max to min array of the top 100

22461054
fish	bash
the bash version works so i guess the issue is fish specific

22461111
submit	submission
as mentioned in my comments instead of handling button click event you could handle form submit event and stop the form from submission

22461112
post	get
currently i am not able to get the payload out of the post request - not even a single bit - also using gzencode to encode the input throws data error

22461152
ienumerable	ilist
consider using ienumerable instead of ilist

22461167
tcpclient	networkstream
this concept seems simple enough create two separate applications send encrypted text from the client to the server then send a reply from the server to the client- i assumed that i could simply establish a tcpclient connection between the two get a networkstream and use two cryptostreams on that networkstream one for read one for write

22461169
pop-up	dialog
upon clicking a row in the grid any part of that row a dialog pop-up and shows additional information about that user and actions that can be done for that user disable user ignore user etc. - when one of these options is selected from the pop-up i want to disable that row

i ve been developing with the amazing caroufredsel slider plugin for a long time now

22461244
width	height
and everytime i have to make a fullscreen slideshow that needs to be responsive in width and height i forget how to do it

22461245
slider	caroufredsel
the key is to size the slider before starting caroufredsel and then refresh both the gallery and slider sizes on window resize

22461250
for-loop	loops
frow is a for-loop variable from elsewhere in your code and will still have the last value it took in that loops whereas row is the data you are currently processing

22461266
put	get
i need to get a slideshow below but it only works with background in image slideshow or iframe to put always in the wrong place and over

22461269
width	margin
if the dropdowns always have fixed widths you could position them by left 50 which is relative to their containing block s width and then align them center by a negative margin as the half of their width

22461277
width	height
and the scroll handles have a width and height of 100 and a position of bottom -5px

22461291

for-loop	loops
in this case simulates a for-loop comparing the condition j -ne n j not equal n and adding 1 to the j var in each turn of loops

22461333
addition	multiplication
this is because of operator precedence multiplication trumps addition and the somefunc method must resolve to a value before it can be an argument to the root multiplication

22461340
mousemove	mousedown
put each coordinate from mousedown and mousemove events into a javascript object

22461368

22461496
post	get
my controllers require a different model for get all get and post though they are technically the same resource

22461503
mouse	keyboard
from the long search i ve done it looks like it is deeply connected to vtk not being thread safe and keyboard mouse callbacks interfering with the vtk window

22461516
put	get
what i found is that if i get the tim sim card and put it on the android 4.3 device the receiving end also shows the garbled so it seems the carrier tim is messing up the sms sent through their network

22461586
superclass	subclassing
when this statement executed java will call the superclass cube s getvolume method since subclassing specialcube inheriates its by keyword extends refer below in your subclassing

qthread	qtcpserver
i don t know much about qtcpserver and qthread i read many articles where they are used together to handle multiple client connection but that didn t help me

22461704
portrait	landscape
the general idea is to take not one but two screenshots before presenting a new viewcontroller - one for portrait one for landscape

22461704
portrait	landscape
the resulting landscape and portrait images can be blurred and tinted as desired and set as background for the presented viewcontroller

22461707
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
you would need to make a bitmap arrays then use a for-loop create the screenshots and name them using loops index

22461708
hide	show
using userawareaction is the way to go then it s up to your action code and template to show hide things as needed

22461711
dictionary	map
on the second place i would put document.getelementbyid browsers should use something like a dictionary hash map behind the scene so the access to element with given id is with complexity o 1

22461737
for-loop	loops
so far i ve been trying to use a for-loop and i also tried a while loops but i keep getting incorrect answers

22461796
folder	directory
here is the following code that i have written that produces folder directory

22461861
button	checkbox
those attributes can be expressed in four different ways a text box for continuous values a combobox for discrete values a checkbox for boolean values and radio button for a choice between two values

22461861
inherited	properties
those are the derivedcontrols that inherited from an xaml-less basecontrol that stores common properties and functions. to maintain proper column alignment over the entire collection i specify four column widths in a style at the window level and use a converter to handle alignment for attributes that do not require the units and or the alt-display checkbox

22461867
put	get
edit don t know where did you get your restriction field since it does not appear in models but i put it anyway to respect your code assuming there s no error there

fadein	fadeout
you have to fadein from inside the fadeout callback

22461946
submit	submission
i want to submit form when user clicks on next and after submission then move to the next page

22461971
children	parent
so i coded a parent class which everything inherits and it contains most of the code then the specific children just define the stuff which is different for each class and the hard work was deciding how much could go in indexed to avoid repeating code in the child classes

22461971
children	parent
initially i had a lot of code in the children but as it evolved i moved more and more code into the parent class and thinned out the children

22462002
folder	directory
i did npm install inside the main directory of my workspace using wamp and it installed node_modules folder with a bunch of subfolders inside

22462010
filtering	grouping
because the subreports use grouping by it s impossible to query them in such a way that i can include filtering values in the filtering property

22462028
equals	tostring
overriding tostring and equals on the objects makes this test pass

22462094
button	checkbox
my question is how to configure the button to delete the titles whose checkbox is checked from my db

22462099
equals	gethashcode
i have some classes with equals and gethashcode methods overriden

uiviewcontroller	uipageviewcontroller
before it was insert on uiviewcontroller container and then insert in uipageviewcontroller

22462321
int	double
which does exactly what i want but is uglier than the standard double loop since the int list need to be converted to str in list3

22462338
width	height
be sure to set a width and a height

22462396
google-chrome	safari
this runs perfectly on google-chrome for the desktop windows 8.1 os x mavericks but on ios 7 or safari 7.0.2 throws the following error to the console referenceerror can t find variable promise

22462396
google-chrome	safari
this leads me to believe that it is a safari error as if i recall correctly google-chrome for ios uses a safari control to render the page rather than chromium

22462436
apache	nginx
regarding your index.php questions that is the job of nginx apache htaccess it should ve been the same in codeigniter too

icmp	udp
however it seems what you want is to send out a udp packet over an icmp socket

22463685
icmp	udp
further if you were to layer a udp header over an icmp header the receiving system will only react to the received icmp header and treat the udp header as nothing more than just data appended to icmp

the more pragmatic way that i found was to use a tab control and hide show tabs accordingly

22464513
client-side	server-side
this is questions about the client-side and server-side scripting languages

22464517
pull	push
if you are using presentational classes you should try to use the push pull classes

also the medium grid inherits its size from the small mobile grid however it inherits the push pull classes from the large grid

22464517
pull	push
i am showing this with out the small-11 small-centered medium-uncentered large-uncentered treatment just to more clearly demonstrate how the push pull classes work

22464548

try this if the count is limited to three ages also using aggregate-functions without grouping them will result in a single row you can use sum with the condition which will result in a boolean and you can get the count based on your criteria

22464576
antivirus	norton
in the past i ve seen where norton antivirus will block a legitimate program from running on windows 7

22464576

it seems that any double type numbers that are passed to the moverelative method are converted to an int before being stored in a as if they had already been processed by convert.toint32 the conversion seems to follow the round x.5 to nearest even rule

22464671
children	parent
how do i go about loading the treeview with all the parent and children

22464744
listview	gridview
i am of course aware of the imageview s setimagebitmap method but networkimageview automatically resizes the created bitmap and also prevents view recycling in gridview s and listview s

freeglut and glfw are quite focused on providing a simple framework for opengl development while sfml is a more generic multimedia framework also supporting things like audio output and is capable of creating opengl contexts and windows

22464812
glfw	glew
for learning opengl glfw is surely a good choice. and also some gl loader like glew

you could use a for-loop over the whole arrays to do this if you d cleared the rest of the pointers first.

22465183
screens	mdpi
on this process i started noticing that the icon size and the splash screens size were cycling through the various sizes in the resources folder one time we get ldpi the next mdpi and so on through the sizes

22465208
inherited	properties
i am using inherited already as all of my objects require the same base properties

22465256
post	get
all depending on the data obviously sticking to post validation of data like the above would yield really bad results as i am likely to get allot of false hits

22465266
folder	directory
please note that you must use the path relative to your domain and if the folder path is outside the public htdocs directory it will not work

22465284
width	height	hide	show
the section area with the 4 boxes should fit the width and height and show hide the section related to the nav option

22465355
superclass	subclassing
since the getage method is public in the superclass and thus in the subclassing you can still invoke it to cause the private variable to be printed

22465359
post	get
if you wanted to avoid doing a post back manually you could look into using the ignite ui tree and make a call to the server just to get the updated data

22465375
int	double
double 0.99 converts to int 0

22465390
versioning	upgrade
you can upgrade to newer versioning of entity framework while still using sqlentityconnection

22465396
getter	setter
your setter and getter are public so they are exposed in to the sub-class son

22465396
getter	setter
the code for the setter and getter is contained in the super-class father which has access to the private field age in that class definition

22465396
getter	setter	superclass	subclassing
if you were to change the setter and getter to private then the subclassing son would not have access to age field in the superclass father

22465418
getter	setter
so i cant use getter and setter methods

22465440

22465487
min	max
remove min max buttons

22465496

int	double
although ans is a double the value of the right side of the equation is still an int

22465791
int	double
also note with regards to salah s answer that the cast from int to double has just been moved

22465791
int	double
since you can implicitly convert an int to a double calling the function with an int such as the literal 1 will automatically convert the int to a double

22465799
clang	llvm
runs the clang driver which first runs the clang front-end to generate llvm ir then runs llvm to process the ir then emits the processed ir

22465799
clang	llvm
you haven t invoked llvm at all only the clang front-end and that s why you re seeing different code

22465834
width	height
the problem is that the script doesn t take height and width of the div with .centered class .window but of his parent .logoutscreen

22465850
for-loop	loops
the one and only difference between those cases is the for-loop count case 1 got 1 for-loop case 8 got 8 nested for loops

22465852
puts	gets
the basic idea is that it gets your location and puts a marker on the map in your location works fine then adds a marker for up to 20 local spots of interest however these markers have stopped showing up

22465907
width	height
that way each unique height and width is respected

22465939
int	boolean

22466002
box-sizing	border-box
i would try box-sizing border-box

22466082

22466309
versioning	upgrade
also note that if you upgrade to universal analytics that versioning has timeout callback funcationality built in to link tracking that article talks about outbound link tracking but the principle of using the callback function to do the redirect is the same

22466373
spaces	delimiter
the easiest solution is to create the data file with spaces as delimiter and then your matlab code will contain a simple readable fscanf statement

22466472
for-loop	arrays
your winner method is called recursively so if you re starting with an input arrays with 4 elements bracket.length is 4 then the winner method will be called recursively with an input arrays with 2 elements after it goes through the for-loop starting with the for statement referenced above

22466499

width	margin
given that you are setting a width on the column simply use margin 0 auto to center it

22466712
width	text-align
alternatively if the element doesn t have a fixed width set on it you could simply make it an inline-block element and add text-align center to the parent

put	get
you would put all your filesystem code in the second bootloader where you have more flexibility and get your first bootloader to load it instead

22467116
16-bit	64bit
one could narrow the width of the memory interface but a 16-bit ddr3 interface would require two dram cycles to transfer 64bit

22467171
versioning	upgrade
of course the real answer is that if you want your app to have the features included in modern versioning of windows you should upgrade from your windows-95 era versioning of delphi to one that is more recent.

22467182
post	get
if you try it and get errors that you can t work through post them

22467205

another problem is that the app crashes if i rotate it to landscape and then to portrait upside down

22467236
width	height
to be able to generate the 1d array i think i need to allocate memory for the image to put the values in that memory however i do not know the dimensions of the tiff images and so with i can find the width of one image and with i can find the height of the image

22467241
post	get
this so post would get pretty close but we re developing exclusively in osx which is the one caveat preventing us from going that route

superclass	subclassing
if the default superclass constructor accessed through super is available then the subclassing does not need to have an explicit constructor

22470339

22482148
inherited	subclassing
if instead you are interested in a relation among all subclassing of base then you have to give up on inherited and use a foreign key from every child to base

22482292
free	malloc
in those cases where the program is sufficiently heavy in memory usage then managing memory using malloc and free is not a sufficient answer to the problem

22482292
free	malloc
i ll repeat my key message balancing malloc and free is not a sufficient solution to large scale memory allocation in real programs

22482292
free	malloc
you need serious clever memory allocators which tend to grab memory in chunks using malloc or whatever and free rarely

22482602

i don t actually want these parent classes to have helper methods both because it is causing code duplication across the parent classes and because the parent classes shouldn t care or know about these serializable deserialization details

width	height
without scripting you can t get an element to shrink to the size of it s content without using auto for either height or width and as far as i m aware you can t easily transition from a specified height or width to auto but there are some suggestions here

22482982

so that the height won t transition but you ll still get a reasonably sized box and the width will still expand nicely

22483687
google-chrome	firefox
even when im running it in google-chrome or firefox and i am pasting the url in ie 10 its working fine

22483698
children	parent
however this causes the parent divs height to not be responsive to the children which have varying heights based on amount of content plus dynamic content being added to them

22483702
children	parent
so a child transaction in a regular nested transaction has no say regarding how him or the other children or parent larger transaction could behave other than changing mutual data or failing for an exception

22483708
put	get
so for example if you put state on the level of detail shelf you ll get one data point summarizing each state instead of one for each individual sale

in my project s case we are sending hl7v2 from our hcis -- mirth -- biztalk which then follows the implementation guide + cda schema along with an xslt transform to map the hl7v2 to cda then submit it to the other biztalk cda submission service as though it was an external vendor

this new implementation will check for any image that is being set into the scrollview which is smaller in width or height and adjust the frame of the image view such that it expands to be at least as wide or tall as the overlay rect so you don t ever have to worry about your user selecting an image that isn t optimal for your overlay

22485484
alertdialog	progressdialog
but if you are talking about the scope of both progressdialog and alertdialog then the answer would definitely be no

22485484
alertdialog	progressdialog
basically what both progressdialog and alertdialog actually need is just a reference to a context instance in your case is myactivity in order for it to be instantiated and displayed hence it doesn t matter where they are created as long as that context object is available

22485486
uitextview	nstextattachment
i have a uitextview in edit mode with few images as nstextattachment

use preparedstatement.setboolean int parameterindex boolean x method

i would create a js folder in the web directory and simply copy your jquery.js file into the js folder

22485662
build.gradle	gradlew
if you re using gradlew then including this in your project s build.gradle should exclude the support library from being exported into your main project

free	malloc
i prefer the pooled-buffer approach since it caps memory-use across the whole system avoids continual malloc free with its fragmentation issues etc avoids the more complex bounded queues is easier to tweak the pool level is easy to change at runtime and is easier to monitor debug - i usually dump the pool level ie

the author says we use a common block named bounds containing istart and iend essentially containing the values used in both the main program and the subroutine. i am wondering if the common attribute will be inherited by the calling subroutine of each thread and interfere the private properties which istart and iend are supposed to bear

22486182

final note i know the method is not get post ect.

22494444
qtkit	avfoundation
the qtkit is phased out and you are encouraged to use avfoundation

22494449
versioning	upgrade
i just rename the xcode.app file and get the results i want. but i have been told that the earlier versioning of xcode won t launch on mavericks so my test development machine is held back from upgrading and co-workers who have upgrade cannot run these tests making me a chokepoint

22494466
children	parent
which is to select a parent whose children childa or childb or both childa and childb together contain both the strings foo and bar

22494468

22494545
portrait	landscape
what i m hoping to attain here is the listview found in the current display in portrait or landscape mode the list view will be displayed

22494545
portrait	landscape
my second issue is that whenever i go to portrait mode from landscape mode the application crashes

22494545
portrait	landscape
i can go from portrait to landscape and boot in either mode but going back to portrait kills the application

22494564
opera	firefox

22494616
hide	show
updated to use click handlers on document ready and then use a data attribute to know which page to show hide

22494618
hide	show
in many cases it s much simpler to just hide and show blocks of html using and than it is to dynamically create and destroy html and this has the added advantage of the html is all specified in the page and doesn t have to be shoehorned into a javascript string

22494618
hide	show
for large blocks of dynamic html that wouldn t work well with hide show for whatever reason you can dynamically load snippets templates of html from your server using ajax or you dynamically create the html using javascript

22494618
hide	show
my first preference is generally hide show and then if that isn t practical for some reason it depends upon how much the html i want to insert varies based on the state for whether i d rather load a template or create it dynamically using javascript

22494618
hide	show
in your particular case it sure looks like the hide show method would be simple

22494633
width	height
which is pretty much what you set to begin with note the width and height have been swapped because the page is in landscape .

22494658
prepare	execute
i ll point out that while it is very good to be in the habit of doing prepare execute you do not actually need it here since you are not passing any input into the query

22494686
rss	feed
another thought you might be able to grab the rss or atom feed from the site which will make things easier

22494700
folder	directory
i tend to remove them as source folder in ggts so they re not distracting - i like to only see directory that are being used

22494717
stdout	stderr
i want to redirect stdout and stderr to a socket that i can then use to remotely monitor the status of my application over ethernet

22494717
udp	tcp	stdout	stderr
i d prefer to remove the middle man if possible and just send the entire stdout and stderr output to a udp or tcp ip port and have my monitoring computer connect to it

22494729
decoder	encoder
i wonder if there any ldap request decoder and ldap response encoder for netty

22494746
skscene	skeffectnode
for example i set up an skscene with an skeffectnode as it s first child node and a property root that holds a weak reference to it

22494746
skscene	skeffectnode
he points out that skscene is in fact a subclass of skeffectnode so you really ought to be able to call all of this on the scene itself rather than arbitrarily inserting an effect node in your node tree

22494761
width	height
return the height width of that element s content in addition any applicable padding

22494765
google-chrome	firefox
i ran this in the console of firefox and google-chrome on my 1680x1050 monitor with both windows maximized

22494768
portrait	landscape
i create uitableviewcell and i want to change button position when user change landscape to portrait or portrait to landscape i try to check same this code but it not auto detect

22494802

a faster option is instead of distinct to use group by comment_content and then selecting either the min or max

22494816
google-chrome	firefox
how does postman get a response but xmlhttprequest on latest google-chrome and firefox is confused

22494816

when next and prev are clicked navigate through the db update the textview imageview etc and fire the animations

22494836
serializable	deserialization
includes non-public properties in serializable and deserialization

22494836
serializable	deserialization
of these the second one is the cleanest and easiest to implement while still achieving the result you are looking for the public property will be serializable using the customized property name while the private backing field will not be affected during deserialization

22494856
calloc	malloc
if you want all of the strings to be empty by default then use calloc instead of malloc

22494860

pop-up	dialog
i wrote some code so that when the user drags a file into the page it pop-up a jquery dialog that shows the list of files that have been dragged in with some buttons for managing the list

22494898
children	parent
you attach an event handler once to a parent and it will stay in effect even though you destroy and recreate the children

22494931
put	get
the only way i can get the map to float up on the right is to put the iframe before the text div but then i can t have the map drop below the text when i shrink the width

22494978
free	malloc
since you want the stack to continue to exist after the function completes you should allocate memory for it using malloc and eventually free it using free

22495009

22495124
debian	linux
5.1.49-3 i am working on linux debian

22495148
udp	tcp	icmp	tcp	icmp	udp
the reason reject is working is because it will send a reset for tcp which will stop the rest of that stream or it will send an icmp port unreachable message back for udp

22495148
udp	tcp	icmp	tcp	icmp	udp
reject - block the packet log it and then send a tcp reset if the protocol is tcp or an icmp port unreachable message if the protocol is udp

22495163
for-loop	arrays
you are allocated and initialising your clientlist dictionary outside of the for-loop so you only have one dictionary which you are storing in your arrays multiple times

22495199
inherited	subclassing
if you don t mind multiple inherited it is not that bad after all you may write simple class with private copy constructor and assignment operator and additionally subclassing it

22495231
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
we added a cache control no-cache header and tried no-store as well to the response header and this fixed the behavior in firefox but google-chrome and safari still serve the outdated cached image without making a call to the image s src

22495232
width	margin
in bootstrap the margin grows while the container remains at a fixed width

22495240
google-chrome	firefox

i m trying to get a list of post and comments count for each one

22495261
post	get
but i need get a full list of 20k post

22495265
width	height
that means the width height and length are actually twice as large as those parameters

22495291
folder	directory
either of the above should result in a stream of directory objects all of which are incoming folder

22495294
public	protected
private ivars should be in and you should avoid protected ivars and absolutely no public ivars

22495313

22495378
google-chrome	firefox
everything works great on firefox and google-chrome as always

22495465
free	malloc
save yourself pain and misery and consume this mantra as the one truth malloc should always be associated with a free

22495466
post	get
also i see you re using get to make the request but tell jquery to use post

22495472
stdout	stderr
this way you re redirecting stderr to stdout and then pipe it all together to netcat which will take care of setting up the socket establish connection with the remote host and all that stuff

22495472
stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush	stderr	fflush
in my local tests i ve seen that the data sent to stderr by the application is seen immediately on the other listening end but on the other hand the data sent to stdout is only sent when the application exits or there s enough data in the buffer to fflush it all at once

22495472
stdout	fflush
so if you care about the order and the availability of the info on the monitoring side i d suggest you to place calls to fflush stdout

22495545
hide	show
here is the code i use to hide show the select inputs and it works now i doesn t need only to show but required true too or hide and required false

22495586
width	height	move	drag
when the grid splitter is move either by drag n drop or using keyboard arrows it changes the width height dependency properties of the columndefinition rowdefinition of the grid

22495586
mouse	keyboard
generally it is really not advised to rely on the user input action mouse dragging keyboard inputs... to handle a logical or visual actions events since there are almost always several ways to do the same actions using different inputs mouse keyboards touchscreen ease-of-use tools...

22495619
google-chrome	firefox
i run it on google-chrome or firefox

22495655
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox

22495767
flask	django
i am developing a web-app which would have an web-interface written in one of the mvc frameworks like django or even flask and allow user to login will identify users session and allow to make some settings and also my app needs to run some python process script which basically is a separate file on the server on a per-session per-settings made by user basis

22495767
flask	django
i do understand the bricks from which my app should be built like django or flask and the server-side script itself but i know very little about how this elements should be glued together to create seamless environment

22495785
stdout	stderr
by default the stdout of interactive program is line buffered but stderr is unbuffered that is why you see the 1 at .

22495785
stdout	stderr
on stderr first and zero on stdout later

22495858
equals	gethashcode
or you can implement equals and gethashcode on your address class and use distinct as you do now

udp	tcp	ssl	https
when i look at amazons elbs it has http https ssl and tcp but there is no option for udp or dns

22495895

22496425
google-chrome	firefox
internet explorer does appear to work differently than firefox or google-chrome when it comes to applying the sandbox attribute

ng-view	ng-include
if you want to change the content inside ng-view and not cause url change then you need to use ng-include to dynamically load template based on the current state of the model scope

22496694
put	get
and get the data you put in the intent

22496694
put	get
the second way is the same start your activity as you normally start like use startactivity your second activity and override the finish method of secondactivity put the uri path as extra in your intent and while you finish this activity get the data in your firstactivity via overriding the onresume method

int	double
we ended up with primitive specializations for int long and double

22497858
int	chars
the penalty this imposes on callers is that they have to know that the intstream contains chars values represented as int and that casting must be done at the proper place

22497858
int	chars
this is doubly confusing because there are overloaded api calls like printstream.print chars and printstream.print int that differ markedly in their behavior

22497872

22508143
pipe	freopen
if you pipe in stdin or freopen it making it use the terminal later is not trivial

22508152
next	except
it finds the link to the next page it clicks on it but it not run the loop again like if it goes through the code in except and puts the variable check to false

22508162
int	chars
it s very important that you understand the difference between 1 an int constant and 1 a chars constant

22508230

google-chrome safari firefox all of it

22508337
maven	pom.xml
i converted my eclipse project to maven by creating a pom.xml file

22508361
versioning	upgrade
if a user was at versioning 1.0 skipped 2.0 and upgrade to 3.0 then both the 1.0 and 2.0 blocks would run

22508366
public	protected
as you re running php 5.4 i d recommend creating a toarray method in your objects returning an array containing all the properties without bothering if they are public private or protected

22508390
hide	show
i need to hide all list elements but only show one at a certain time depending on the direction or button pressed by the nav bar

22508403
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and ie but when viewing the site in google-chrome the page appears to be reloading the entire site so it looks like flicker

22508404
afnetworking	sdwebimage
to avoid this problem you can use afnetworking that have great category to uiimageview that load images in async mode or use sdwebimage that have same functionality or you can write your nsurlsession implementation to load content

x86	64bit
when you create a 32-bit msi compiled as x86 and then try to install it on a 64bit os the registry entries will get written to the wow64 hive hkey_local_machine software wow6432node microsoft

22508465
windows	wow64
the 64-bit version of windows looks in the 64-bit registry hive and not the wow64 registry hive when looking for custom registry entries

22508465
x86	64bit
one solution is to build the msi in both x86 and x64 if it finally gets deployed to 32 and 64bit os

22508483
jar	war
your code must be in the src main java packagepath directory otherwise maven will not be able to find it and will create an empty jar war

22508519
mouseout	mouseenter
this feels like it should be obvious but i am having trouble handling mouseenter and mouseout with a series of movieclips in actionscript

22508519
mouseout	mouseenter
but the other 10 of the time on mouseout the mouseenter event triggers and even though your mouse is not on the button anymore it has the hoverstate on such that you do

22508566

i have managed to wrap the children in a menu control inside the parent menuitem and apply the trigger on it but there are unwanted side effects like all menu is highlighted instead of one item

22508629
strstr	substr
the objective is to find whether there exist a substr and i know strstr can be used

portrait	landscape
i have a view that needs to be presented in landscape and portrait view both

22508788
portrait	landscape
the selected view is the view of the viewcontroller that has two views first one being the portrait view and second one being the landscape view

22508788
portrait	landscape
as in the image both the views portrait and landscape have container views linked to view controllers through segue

22508788
portrait	landscape
if the portrait view is kept before the landscape view prepareforsegue is called first for segues from portrait view where i save the destination viewcontroller in an object

22508788
portrait	landscape
but when the landscape view segues are called the destination viewcontroller for portrait segues become nil which were saved in a global object

22508837
put	get
the best thing is to put those objects into array and then get random element from it

22508853
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu linux this file is located in this path relative to the install directory

22508869
weka	libsvm
i have trained libsvm model on weka and then i saved the model

or better yet use jquery s .toggle to hide and show the menu based on alternating click events applying and removing the same styling

22508911
sorting	grouping
in addition lets say if i have an search results sorting function i want randomly pick grouping of users to sort it in descending order by time and other grouping to see it ascending order

22508952
debian	linux
on debian probably other linux too you should remove .m2 repository folder and in eclipse right-click on project maven- update project.

22508961
nstimer	nsoperation
ios performs these kinds of things with nstimer nsoperation or gcd queues

22508966
apache	nginx
this server is running on nginx and not apache so no htaccess but i dont think this is making any difference

22508967
strstr	substr
strstr returns a char pointer to the first occurence of substr

22508972
post	get
in previous post i asked some questions on how to connect and get a result from a query questions that where answered

22509041
multiplying	add
it seems to multiplying or add to the enddate instead of the startdate

i have also put the small purple and yellow blocks on the same row but they get displayed next to each other with the 90 block underneath them

22509343
submit	submission
i am trying to adapt a bunch of existing web apps to prevent users from accidentally bouncing on the submit button and submission the form twice

22509343
submit	submission
this works well for disabling multiple submission while still transmitting the value of the submit button but it does not grey out the submit button so there is no visual indication that the submission has occured

22509351
fflush	gets
when you call .save the entity gets validated and if needed persisted or else waits before it either gets fflush or the transaction is completed

22509392
put	get
when you don t add the objects to the view group they do show up because by default objects get put in the default root level group called the stage

innodb	myisam
myisam and innodb tables are supported also alongside the infinidb columnar tables

22509435

for-loop	arrays
a test with 20 forms in an arrays is 0.7 for-loop to 3.5 linq milliseconds

22509494
ember.js	backbone.js
yes there is a way by using an spa like backbone.js ember.js angular or another one out there which is why they are for

22509559
nexus	artifactory
this is if you don t have your own hosted artifact repository server such as nexus artifactory or archiva

22509568
xively	temboo
you can free up some ram by putting the inputs that don t change your temboo creds your xively creds the address you re searching for any other static strings into settings files that are stored on the linino side as described at the link below

22509592
width	height
you need to take absolute value of height and width to get the correct area

22509636
teamcity	jenkins
if they are only consumers of the repository you should either 1 create a cron entry to update it automatically or 2 use a continuous integration system like jenkins or teamcity that will automatically update the repository when something is pushed to it

22509636
sudo	passwd
make the opt config ownership to a new passwordless user configure sudo to allow the switch to this user without passwd and make the configuration only in theuser .hgrc

22509715
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition
after they have selected their numbers say 100 3 5 6 9 5 they then generate a target number of lets say for example 299 and they then can only use the numbers selected as a means of reaching the target using only multiplication addition subtraction and division

22509753
metaspace	permgen
the permanent generation permgen space has completely been removed and is kind of replaced by a new space called metaspace

22509786
integer	unsigned
i would therefore suggest that you instead convert the value to an integer number of minutes and store the result in an 4-byte int unsigned column capable of storing values in the range 0 to 4294967295 representing 0 00 to 71582788 15

22509804
portrait	landscape
that is if popviewcontroller is presented in portrait mode then it should not change to landscape even if i switch to landscape mode using rotate left or right in simulator until i dismiss the popviewcontroller

22509881
typedef	struct
also don t use typedef struct in c++

22509932

i would like that the image is always 100 in width and height of the users screen even if they are scrolling down

22509947
folder	directory
you can designate your own temp directory and hide it within application folder structure but that is all you can do

22509962
google-chrome	firefox
how do the browsers deal with this since the redirection seems to work in firefox google-chrome etc..

22509970
try-catch	exception-handling
i have written code in which for defensive purpose i enclosed all method bodies in try-catch capturing generic exception-handling in catch block

22509970
short	base
so in short whatever exception occurs anywhere i get base type message and stack trace of all nested exceptions in my logs

22509997
versioning	upgrade
i am working with drools 5.6.0 and iâ m ready to upgrade to 6.0 so this issue is relevant for both versioning

allocate the memory on the heap by using malloc and free

22510163
twig	smarty
i also recommend to have a look in mvc frameworks with smarty twig or templatepower

22510168
width	height
i read that you need the height and width to be specified for the video to display properly on these devices however if i do so they will no longer be fluid

22510191
integer	unsigned
the function you need is cfswapint64hosttobig which takes a 64-bit signed or unsigned int in whatever endian order the host uses and returns an integer with the bytes arranged in big-endian order - the numeric value of the result is effectively meaningless at this point it is an ordered collection of 8 bytes

22510194
put	get
i m very lost and not sure where to start or where to put what when i get the code from other sites

22510213
int	chars
b is the unsigned chars 255 which is in the range of an int so d becomes the int 255

22510274
google-chrome	firefox
they work fine in google-chrome and firefox without any issues

22510274
hide	show
on the page load i hide them and then when a button is clicked it references an on click event for a function that show the progress bar and then submits the form

22510274
versioning	upgrade
i have tried to upgrade bootstrap to versioning 3 but it still doesn t work in safari

22510455
children	parent
if you are going to define blocks then have the children template extend the parent and override the blocks- no includes necessary

22510497
post	get
i would like to get selected values then post by ajax request to server

22510521
width	height
the bootstrap grid system controls column width but not height

22510522
comparator	comparable
i managed to sort the array by implementing comparable and the comparator method in my object class

22510540
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
i am trying to combine them so i can loops through them using a for-loop to produce a new element in the inner most product arrays based on the price and sales rank in each arrays

22510576
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
works on ie9+ google-chrome firefox opera safari support for pointerdown

22510592
ant	maven
you can wrap the project up as a war when you build it if you want to use ant or maven or even doing so through eclipse using export - war file

22510592
jar	war
yes you can deploy a jar but i m assuming you somehow want to be able to access it from a war or ear project in jboss

22510639
apache	nginx
you would now need to set up some kind of redirect in you nginx or apache config as a html form cannot be posted to a port different to the port that your html page is running on which i assume will be port 80

22510667
for-loop	arrays
now i want to add these 9 buttons into a 2d matrix list or arrays and configure their properties in a for-loop

22510682
post	get
i am using ember model library to get and post data from the server

22510709
min	max
this is why sometimes you can find explicit definition of max and min in enumeration type

22510849
client-side	server-side
as we didn t find any good documentation on how the server-side metamodel has to be created by hand we decided to create the client-side metamodel and import this one into breeze when loading the application

22510853
prepare	execute
however there is a feature called prepare statements which allows you to submit a cql query once and then have it execute multiple times with different parameters

22510853
disk	ram
i am not aware of anything that would prevent you from running a 50tb database on one node but you may require lots of memory to keep things relatively smooth as you ram storage ratio is likely to be very low and thus impact your ability to cache disk data meaningfully

22510904
typedef	struct
typedef on struct enum or union are hiding useful information

22510948
hide	show
in my html there are headers which have a button that show and hide the content thanks to jquery

22511046
filtering	grouping
also i want to find the data at a given hospital so i would want to have a way of using a hospital id parameter passed in code behind and then applying this id to the grouping expression somehow to filtering it

22511052
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
or run sudo yum update -y and add your puppet agent user to sudoers without passwd prompt

22511092
folder	directory
my bootstrap folder was in the directory above my apache document root and apparently you cannot have a path that goes beyond the scope of the document root

22511095
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox etc

22511101
ready	each
contents of each page into the dom as you navigate and the dom ready

22511196
for-loop	arrays
before utilising the add-on i used a for-loop to create markers from an arrays of co-cordinates

22511208
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox and google-chrome its working.

22511219
google-chrome	firefox
it works on firefox and google-chrome without problems but not in ie10

22511312
public	protected
check out private public and protected functions

22511335
hive	hdfs
i am trying to import some data from hive cluster to another hdfs cluster with multiple mappers

22511335
min	max
this command is internally generating another query to get min and max dates

22511335
min	max
select min sltrn_dt max sltrn_dt from select upc_cd sltrn_dt sltrn_id loc_id pos_rgstr_id hh_id from strrecommender.sltrn_dtl_full where to_date part_dt 2011-03-04 and to_date part_dt and 1 1 as t1

22511345
listview	gridview
for this i believe i need a textbox and a dropdown contained a listview or gridview

22511345
listview	gridview
if gridview or listview is the incorrect container please let me know if another container would be best

22511414
ffmpeg	libav
rgb-frame encoding - ffmpeg libav

22511417
width	height
i would like to make it match but without losing the 100 width and 100 height

22511477
maven-ear-plugin	pom.xml
you need to add those supplemental jar files as dependencies to your project pom.xml and furthermore you need to add them to your maven-ear-plugin configuration

22511564
sse	avx
you should align on 16 bytes with sse which is also a cache line and i think 32 with avx

22511594
exponent	addition	multiplication	exponent	addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	division	exponent
if we follow bedmas brackets exponent division multiplication addition subtraction we can break this down into a simple function

22511600
pop-up	dialog
when the jar library is accessed it pop-up with a dialog box asking if you want to purchase the license

22511604
post	get
but i need to get the value negado to send the to the database the placeholder works fine the problem is that i don t get the value in the post

22511612
realloc	malloc
while the virtual memory can be sized resized programmatically using malloc realloc free.

22511647
google-chrome	firefox
you can run these tests on several browser like google-chrome firefox or even on mobile devices

22511691
comparator	comparable
your shuffle and swap methods aren t using comparator so there is no reason to make the type comparable

22511716
for-loop	loops
inside a for-loop the elements are aliased to loops arguments so any changes to them directly are made on the real values as well

22511734
min	max
unlike simple linear scales the domain of the the threshold scale is not the min and max values

22511734
min	max
of course depending on what you are using the scale for a custom function like daniele torino suggested may be more versatile since it doesn t require you to specify max and min threshold above below which everything gets bunched in the same category

22511752
gtk	gdk
i m running gtk gdk 3.10.7 but my program targets gtk 3.4 at minimum

22511767
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
i took a quick look at the sorteddictionary and sortedlist but they don t seem to provide 3 and 4 from the list above

22511776
post	get
this blog post shows how to get a stack trace using the api in c so you don t have to parse the output after issuing a k command

22511800
google-chrome	firefox
edit as it s probably a rendering issue i tested in google-chrome firefox and ie same result

22511836
hash	md5
file_version id mtime md5 hash

22511840
int	chars
the second argument is a chars not an int

22511869
hide	show
i currently have a show hide button for scientific functions

22511880
for-loop	loops
in a for-loop you should take if you have a length of 3 then loops will start at 0 and go through index 0 1 and 2

22511891
filtering	grouping
with that said you obviously need to be very careful that you re not changing anything that is relied on by the existing dimensions filtering or grouping

22511921
try-catch	exception-handling
wrapping your entire workflow in a try-catch often seems like the best way to prevent unexpected exception-handling from crashing code or causing unexpected down stream affects

22511953
min	max
what you can do is to use the stats command to get the min max when the script is run

22511953
min	max
this assumes that the min is below zero and max is above zero

22512049
hide	show
i m using the script below to show hide text in an faq format

22512064
uninstall	upgrade
if you want your newer msi product to uninstall all the older files and install the newer ones you need a major upgrade that sequences removeexistingproducts early in the install

22512069
robocopy	xcopy
currently we use xcopy robocopy to make three copies of the webapp in programdata to make webapp_prod webapp_test webapp_train and manually update some config files as well as add them to iis

22512069
robocopy	xcopy
can wix do xcopy robocopy to this effect or another approach is needed

22512155
button	checkbox
i m trying to display a list of posts and add a checkbox with a publish button to publish multiple posts at a time

22512167
hide	show
in your example do not need to hide and show button but only need to change text

22512168
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
everything works really well in firefox and google-chrome but for some reason in safari the affix portion does not stay confined to the div and overlaps the main content

22512168
pull	push
taking a look at bootstrap s own site it appears they don t use any push or pull for their divs so the menu simply shows up at the bottom in mobile

22512181
min	max
where i d want the min of rowid the min of cat_id the min of start_time the max of end_time where there is a consecutive block of rows where the comment values are all the same

22512209
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
for example if samsung will be selected from dropdownlistfor and 2g from checkbox fields rows with id 1 and 4 should be returned

22512210
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
either way you may want to look at arrays lists and enhanced for-loop syntax for each loops

22512214
children	parent
i need parent and children containers that are both sortable

22512214
children	parent
parent that you can rearrange the order within the set of parent and children that you can rearrange and also drag to a different parent

22512219
put	get
the problem is if i put a directory there and some files in the directory i can t browse them and i get forbidden error

22512265
for-loop	loops
in the above code it the break only breaks out of the while loops so the while loops will break when x is non-zero however the for-loop that is encasing it will increment and continue anyway breaking only when loopcnt is 54 above 53 at which point addr will always be 53

22512269
hash	salt
the password and salt reside in that table so theoretically we could recompute the hash that the sqlmembershipproivder is using

22512269
hash	salt
however the stored password hash are 20 bytes long telling me they must do more than simply compute the sha256 hash of the password and salt

22512296
margin	text-align
for some reason whatever i do after it loads - the map div doesn t seem to respond to text-align center and margin auto and get centred as every other div does

22512297
getter	setter
declare the array as make the array static you will have to initialise it with static function or us getter and setter methods to set and get the array

22512455
gson	jackson
you can parse the json string using jackson or gson and go through that array of objects and change the values programatically

22512641
children	parent
i could build the tree by giving the children instead of the parent but i found this representation better

22512652
submit	submission
you can prevent form submission using the preventdefault method of event object and manually submit the form upon confirmation using the submit method of form elements

22512733
debian	linux
i m using python 2.6 on linux debian

22512757
post	put
the error was that my edit controller was sending a put request and my code only checked for a post request

22512758
hash	salt
as a side note it s not a good idea to store your passwords in the db in plain text but hash them instead preferably with a salt value

22512766
sorting	grouping
i have a window with multiple radio buttons first grouping sorting algorithms and second directions ascending descending

22512810
udp	tcp
then server send to c a message tcp that contains info about udp ip port of b

22512810
udp	tcp
- 5th the server will transfer udp ip port of c to b via tcp or udp if you want

uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if you want to add a custom element to the more view without a corresponding uiviewcontroller in storyboard then you need to subclass your uitabbarcontroller to display that item because the view does not reside in the array of view controllers and is therefore not editable

22517285
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the simplest way to display a logout item in the more view is to create a corresponding logout uiviewcontroller and set the uitabbarcontroller as the root controller

objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the objectinputstream blocks waiting for the construction of the peer s objectoutputstream

22517581
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
or possibly it is itself hung up constructing an objectinputstream because your client isn t constructing an objectoutputstream

objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the solution to that is to always construct and flush the objectoutputstream before the objectinputstream

22518125
ng-class	ngcloak
when angular does start up it will process all of the directives include ng-class and ngcloak so your element will then have the right class and be visible

how to oblige the user to only input a number int float long.. so he cannot input a chars or a string when you re waiting for a number d thanks

22519066
int	chars
you are dealing with strings here each chars is still a string and type x will never be int

22519066
int	chars
here the expression str int x + 1 10 casts your chars to an int adds 1 wraps round to 0 if the result was 10 and turns the whole result into a string again

22519903
put	get
my idea was to check the localtimezone get the offset from the data that the user put in to the system he will specify the city and +1 for example if i do the subtraction manually sydney is +10 rome is +1 i subtract 9 hours so will be 0 00 to 2 00am i convert that time to utc and from there i should be able to move it where i want but in that case probably the daylightsaving will break the thing since i m not able to determine if the area where the city is in daylightsavings or not

this solution is much better if you happen to be using a remote server to run your test like saucelabs or browserstack

22520066
jar	war
they let you have web resources propagate through projects via dependencies similar to how source files and classpath resources propagate through jar files and into war files via dependencies

22520115
inherited	properties
the main problem with extending a random object retrieved from some other environment is that javascript doesn t really allow random properties names the random object may have a properties name that shadows an inherited properties

22520115
inherited	properties
but that can be mitigated by using names for inherited properties that are unlikely to clash prefixed with _ or __ which is a bit ugly or use a naming convention like getsomething setsomething calclength and so on

22520203

multiplying	subtract
nextfloat will return you a value between 0.0 and 1.0 and multiplying that by 200 and subtract 100 and bam

22520977
int	double
an easier method to find a single peak or the highest value in an array any numeric array int double is to loop through the array and set a variable to the highest value.

min 1 abs cos theta 1 abs sin theta

22521009
entity-relationship	entities
from an entity-relationship modelling perspective you re describing what sounds like 4 entities

22521045
folder	directory
edit if you need to be sure to have a directory with your set of images at the end of the compilation you could instead use a folder reference referencing a real folder in the finder as opposed to an xcode group as only group files in xcode s project navigator then use code to browse it

22521073
width	height
if you create a cube of say 1 dimension width height and depth

ceil	floor
we have n k parts of size ceil n k and k - n k partitions of size floor n k

22521199
width	height
what s happening is when your first input i 0 is in fact valid width or height is not 0 will_continue gets set true

22521300
mp3	wav

now i was expecting the inner div to inherited the margin and width properties from parent but that didn t happen

22521360

in order for the nfs home directory to work at all i had to run the module on a machine to create the users locally then mount the root directory of the nfs mount for home directory and create those user s folder owned by their uid gid for the autofs to actually work when they log in

22521390
folder	directory
when the module fails to work against the nfs-mounted home directory the error is permission denied when it tries to create the home folder

this might be possible by extending the prototype of the ancestor object within the external .js files to include getter setter methods but not providing those methods in the document root which is where the ancestor would have to be declared

22536065
inherited	properties
we have now created an object class constructor that is an inherited instance of ancestorobj which contains a getter method that returns the private properties of the prototype object

implements	extends
i was under the impression that i could only implements an interface but it turns out that you can also extends a concrete class -- only abstract classes throw the error i described

if you google around a bit you can find lots of free impulse responses as wav or mp3 files

22537092
google-chrome	firefox
here is the codes and fiddle please view it in google-chrome firefox ie

22537144
google-chrome	firefox
so you are better off with a javascript solution like modernizr or just assume the browser supports display flex if your users are likely to use firefox google-chrome on any platform or msie11 on windows 8

22537146
width	height
i try to downsize the video using css or by setting the width and height parameters on the video element but the result is the same

22537188

22537374
superclass	subclassing
every time i create a new subclassing instance the superclass constructor works strange

nexus	artifactory
you might want to consider setting up a corporate maven repository using something like nexus or artifactory and then deploy your .jar artifacts there instead

22537406
maven	pom.xml
once that s done you can distribute a corporate settings.xml file pointing to this repository or include it in each projects pom.xml file and you can then manage your generated code like any other maven dependency

22537442
ant	maven
since this is extremely unhandy process i would recomment to use ant or maven

22537465

then show and hide the two depending on the state

22537470
nexus	artifactory
install the jar in a corporate maven repository like artifactory or nexus

22537685
put	get
i put the text in a div and get the scroll width as width

22537706

22538582
serializable	deserialization
if you register a typeadaptor it appears that it is getting used for both serializable and deserialization

the four parameters are sent as follows url height width title

22538728
post	get
url never start by get or post or anything like that

22538759
junit	testng
it s worth noting that i also have a mixed junit testng environment

22538759
junit	testng
after upgrading to surefire 2.17 both my junit and testng tests started running without needing to declare any surefire providers

bash	zsh
if extracting one value or generally a non-repeating set of values captured by distinct capture groups is enough and you re running bash ksh or zsh consider using the regex-matching operator

22539067
bash	zsh
the zsh syntax is also similar to bash except

22539067
bash	zsh
note how this quoting behavior differs fundamentally from that of bash 3.2+ zsh requires quoting only for syntax reasons and always treats the resulting string as a whole as a regex whether it or parts of it were quoted or not

22539067
bash	zsh
the following shell function abstracts away the differences between bash ksh zsh with respect to the operator

22539067
bash	zsh
as adrian frã¼hwirth notes to write portable across zsh ksh bash code with this you need to execute setopt ksh_arrays in zsh so as to make its arrays start with index 0

22539335
width	margin
when two or more margins collapse the resulting margin width is the maximum of the collapsing margins widths

22539342

and split it in the shader again but if i take my example struct above i have an immense huge arrays very soon and taking the information out of it with a for-loop probably will be quite expensive too- and that only if i want to use a similar number of lights like the max of 8 when using gl_lightsource - while i wanted to avoid using that because of the advantage having an own struct with all information needed at once

22539652
google-chrome	firefox

int	double
multiply your latitude in double degrees from the north pole times 268435455 180 or 1491308.0833333333 cast to an int and take the low-order 28 bits

getter	setter
the getter method is hit correctly every time but the setter is never getting hit

22540888
post	get
that way it can look and seem to behave like a regular link_to sort of link but you ll still have the benefits of only updating data via post and leaving all your actual get requests idempotent

while md5 is a widely known and used hash collisions can be very prevalent in it

22541026
hash	md5
i submit here the issue that there are 340282366920938463463374607431768211456 possible md5 hash since they re displayed hexadecimal style 16 possibly characters raised to the power of the 32 character length but there are an infinite amount of strings which can be hash that of course taking computational limits out of the equation

22541026

22541408
hash	salt
the hash itself already has the salt stored in there

22541408
hash	salt
so the password password will have a different hash each time it is bcrypt ed because it includes the salt

onresume	onpause
this flag is set to false when onpause is called and set to true when onresume is called

22541478

22541602
division	subtract
you can calculate the time in millis and subtract the time with a simple division

22541632
onclick	onchange
i can t say why the onclick action wasn t firing a second time on each dropdown but based a few responses i removed javascript from the event and i was able to change the use of onclick to onchange which made the clearing of the dropdown boxes work as expected

22541639
versioning	upgrade
for major versioning upgrade you will likely be asked if you want to keep your settings or wipe them and start fresh

22541664
post	get
be aware however that while the session variables are stored server-side the session id is either in the get post url a very bad idea or stored in a browser cookie better security but still susceptible to manipulation attack etc if you don t hand cookie based session ids carefully

22541781
width	height
error please set height and width for the chart element

22541781
width	height
it turns out in order for the height and width of the graph to be set you have to set the height and width of the chart with css

22541801

versioning	upgrade
if the versioning of wireshark you re using was a package provided with a linux distribution or bsd this might require that you either upgrade your os to a versioning with a later versioning of wireshark find a package of wireshark other than the one in your vendor s repository of packages or build it yourself from source.

22541959
pop-up	dialog
if i manually call fb.ui feed dialog via javascript it also pop-up a smaller layer on screen with the feed dialog options or asks user to login if they haven t done so

22541959
pop-up	dialog
i would presume that its login pop-up dialog would also be the same as that of fb.ui s smaller layered dialog box

22541965
imageview	picasso

the item interface is implements by a masterwithvalue class or better by a master class which masterwithvalue extends

accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
properties accessor methods correctly handle nil pointers doing nothing but dereferencing an ivar of a nil pointer will generate the exc_bad_access

ideally in that scenario just use the properties accessor method instead and you re done

22542203
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to the most recent versioning and the routing error went away

22542226
post	get
create a controller that had a get and post endpoint mapped to login

post	get
moreover you can use the app access token of the app used to create the post with the post-id to get the post details

22542229
post	get
i m not sure how are you fetching the post data but its a simple get request to post-id using that app token

22542245

if you are using this nsmanagedobject just to display its properties i recommend you pass your nsmanagedobject info to a custom nsobject subclass and use that object on your table data source

22542583
hide	show
the goal is to have the divs fade in and out whereas my result is that they instantly hide show

22542631
jar	manifest.mf
if the jar file has a main-class specified in its meta-inf manifest.mf file then you can load java with the jar file and execution will start in the main method of that class

well if your 50 px for landscape and 100 for portrait can somehow be derived by relations to sibling subviews and fixed offsets to the bounds of superview then yes this can be done at design time and that s actually what auto layout is meant to be for

int	chars
if you need just one byte of memory in a variable you use unsigned chars and assign an int to it

22543216
int	chars
on a different view just think of signed and unsigned chars as int representation

22543229
width	height
try using vw view width actually it is the percent of the view width so 1vw is 1 of the width of your window and vh view height instead of px as your units

22543229

width	height
also check the top left width and height of the savedimages every frame does not need to cover all canvas so you should only overwrite pixels that are different from the last frame

setinterval	settimeout
actually you don t need any setinterval or settimeout you can simply use the .animate callback to run again your function

22543621

it would be better to use an array that maps the int 0 to 9 to the chars 0 to 9

22543883
post	get
turns out there was an unclosed tag used for the search which is a get request so the form s post was never being seen

22543905
for-loop	arrays
i ve thought of some possibilities like a for-loop that checks the stored arrays for identical values and remove them but then i run into trouble with the length of the for-loop as the arrays change size by removing stuff so that doesn t work

22543912
min	max
in that case i would simply affect the min and max

22543912

min	max
for example if my rt_ch_pres_px1 value is 5 and i want to use my min valuse at 6 and max at 10

22544103
min	max
if rt_ch_pres_px1 is within min and max values do nothing

22544112
ontouchevent	ondraw
the reason nothing is happening at all is even though you re drawing those circles again in ontouchevent you re redrawing everything yet again in ondraw invalidate calls draw ondraw

weinre is very similar to the google-chrome safari inspector only for remote browsers such as the native webview

22545557
int	double
because on your platform double s and int s are passed to functions differently

22545557
int	double
normally double s are passed in floating-point registers while int s are passed in general purpose registers

22545561
button	checkbox
what if person unchecked and there is no checked in checkbox and i want to automatic slideup full width box instead of person click close button if there is no checked at all

22545616
stdout	fflush
child-4 exits because the wait will not block causing its stdout buffer to be fflush

22545616
stdout	fflush
this causes child-3 to return from wait and it exits causing its stdout buffer to be fflush

22545616
children	parent
this forces the child s copy of the parent s buffer to be output in sequence order and then the children s own output will appear as they exit in reverse order

22545659
uiview	subviews
the subviews version is definitely faster since having the controls loose on the uiview took more like 2 seconds to update

codeigniter	yii
1- in order to have better solutions try using mvc platforms like codeigniter or yii etc

22545820

also strtok can just return null if line is a zero length string so there is potentially atoi null

22545833
hide	show
have all the content present in the original page and just hide show blocks of content as each successive button is pressed

22545833

free	malloc
first malloc is never free

22545908

hence you need to get your fromview s x and your toview s x and put the difference between them in your translate animation and same with y

22546013
put	get
and it is manual and i have to do it for every test case i rather put the elbow grease and do it so that i get a stack trace right there and there than to need a stack trace and not have it.

22546022
ng-show	ng-hide	hide	show
better use ng-hide or ng-show on the data you want to show or hide

22546070
folder	directory
i think remove the folder bundles in the web directory web bundles before running the update

22546082

22546178
int	double
extends table string int double int int tag some myschema coffees

22546187
dictionary	map
i cannot just put the keys into a dictionary because it would need to map to functions and lots of little functions are bad for scalability too possibly not as bad as massive switches but it s still a pan fire sort of a situation where blindly changing one for the other probably will not buy a huge amount of headroom

22546197
folder	directory
when i try to re-add like google documentation states right-clicking on project - import existing projects into workspace and select the directory whereto i copied the google-play-services_lib folder copied from sdk extras it just states no project file fouind

22546530
multiplying	add
4 at each simulation iteration you add speed to position and acceleration to speed remembering of multiplying it for the integration time dt

22546534
int	double
my first concern was the fractional part of float only has 23 bits and double 52 so they can t store all the digits of some 32-bit or 64-bit int

22546534
integer	fractions
if we let the fractions of y we can store be x we can write y x + dx then we want to make sure that whatever dx we choose does not move us to the next integer

22546534
int	double
it s easy to show this for double as well with 64-bit int

22546534
int	double
for 64-bit int as long as the sqrt of the double always rounds up it s okay

22546607
free	malloc
for c the invokation of jni functions would be slightly different and you d have to use malloc free instead of new delete

22546615
maven	pom.xml
it is like the task except i take the ivy.xml convert it into a maven pom.xml and embed it in the jar

22546621
background-image	background-color

22546656
express	node.js
it looks like you might be new to node.js so you might want to read up on asynchronous programming with node and the req and res objects used by express

22546680
strtok	getline
my preference for clarity of the code would be to use your option 3 - use getline with the standard n delimiter to read the file into a buffer line by line and then use a tokenizer like strtok if you want to work on the c level or boost tokenizer to parse the string you read from the file

22546698
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
once you have decided on a delimiter i would recommend looking into the class file fileinputstream and fileoutputstream

22546858
put	get
put the page in google cloud storage and then return a 301 or 302 redirect to the page from the app - cloud storage will put in the correct caching headers so users will get the pages faster once they are in the edge cache etc

22547057
floating-point	integer
however a basic floating-point error analysis shows that the error in computing sqrt n before conversion to integer is bounded by 3 4 of an ulp

22547065
inherited	properties
in otherwords if anyone added an method or properties to the object prototype it would get picked up by the in operator but not by .hasownproperty which only checks the actual object itself not any inherited properties

22547090
free	malloc
cv mat does not know how you allocated the memory malloc new etc and hence does not know how to free it

22547098
google-chrome	firefox
when i view this in ie 11 and resize the window to tablet size between 481px and 768px the navigation gets all wonky but works fine in firefox and google-chrome

22547117

however when i run my test i get a 404 instead of a 200 in the case where i try to post instead of get i receive a 405 which is consistent with tomcat being incorrectly setup

22547119
uiview	subviews
i have an uibutton that is subviews on an uiview

22547135
libs	buildpath
my buildpath has a libs i titled jogl and i added the external jars gluegen-rt.jar and jogl-all.jar as was instructed by the professor

22547318
inherited	properties
you can also do table per concrete type inherited in which the inherited properties go in one table and the derived properties go in another

22547330
children	parent
parent waits for both children to die reports their exit status and exits itself

22547423
jscrollpane	jtableheader
in the case of jtable it applies the jtableheader to the jscrollpane s column header area automatically

22547431
children	parent
the easy version looks like this a parent with some children and it grows shrinks dependent on the children

22547446
ant	maven
for your second question you ve got that right both maven and ant are tools that among other things help you package your application into something you can deploy to your users or web servers

22547450
innodb	myisam
however if you mean running two queries in the same connection preventing the db access time penalty it depends on the engine your using myisam or innodb but in your case you are just running 2 select queries which will not affect the page load speed

22547480
google-chrome	firefox

22547739
apache	nginx
passenger open source edition only uses one thread per application as listed in your apache virtual hosts files not sure about nginx

22547741
put	get
if your app does need to move the other buttons then it s a bit trickier b c you have to use only customview bar button items and get the initial position of all of them pull them into the toolbar and out of the list of items animate them and then put everything back

22547780
width	height
scale the image uniformly maintain the image s aspect ratio so that both dimensions width and height of the image will be equal to or larger than the corresponding dimension of the view minus padding
