ubuntu	linux
in my opinion and i am not sure if i am right or not if you are on a 64-bit system and try to install something that is strictly 32-bit such as a 32-bit jdk then you need to download and install the 32-bit elf libraries into your ubuntu linux system

16801675

the container s explicit width is 1170px with margin auto on both sides

16802845

16802941
google-chrome	firefox

mixing units can be problematic especially if margins are involved otherwise you could just use box-sizing border-box and not worry about it

16802960
width	height
- includes main_interface linearlayout height width fills parent

16802969
getter	setter
the class for example headquarter building has the variables for these getter and setter methods

16803198
min	max
you can always put them inside a min heap creating a min or max heap from a vector takes o n on average then you can simply extract numbers from your min heap in perfect order with o log n cost for each top +pop operation

16803198
post	get
that way you ll get a nice o n log n cost you ll play with heaps which are always interesting and might have more fun and add some bug that will make you post here again than if you just used std sort p

16803208
for-loop	loops
i read that foreach loops sometimes do not work correctly over lists and it is recommended to use a for-loop and index the list on each iteration

16803226
children	parent
parent and children referenced by these new task objects should of course also be new task objects

16803258

16803769
jstl	taglib
i would probably write a utility class and create a custom taglib which can be called using el jstl to do the job

transactions on any filesystems other than ntfs

16804327
box-sizing	border-box
box-sizing border-box

16804327
width	margin
what this does is calculate the width of the divs to include the border and padding but not the margin

16804327
width	margin
in this case we subtract 20px from the width of both of our div s as they both have a left and right margin of 10px each

16804330
width	margin
it will fill the width of parent but the margin and padding are subtracted from the width of the parent instead of added to it

16804363
for-loop	arrays
also keep in mind that arrays are 0 based so you would want to start your for-loop with 1 or set your month variable to 11 if you use the logic you are using now

16804366
temp	tmp
if you do care and now we come to the right answer then check the logs that get created during the installation in the tmp or temp directory to see what s up

16804366
stdout	stderr
here uncheck include debug output stderr and stdout

16804366
stdout	stderr
then enter the word console in send stderr to and send stdout to

16804409
innodb	myisam
i would suggest you to use a foreign_key constraint with on delete cascade for both tables but it will depend if you are using innodb or myisam engine

16804426
multiplying	subtract
i want to be able to subtract the qty of ondemand to reserved from the same zone type and os and then multiplying the remaining qty by the rate

16804509
int	chars
string has the methods length and getcharat int index which could be used in a for block to save each of the letters as a chars for example in an array

16804509
int	chars
find write a method changebinarytointerger cast int to chars optionally save the chars in an array which again can be build together to a string .

16804510
versioning	upgrade
in short iâ m looking for a good approach for versioning upgrade of ms sql database schema that also demands data being moved from deleted tables into new tables

16804510
versioning	upgrade
until now versioning upgrade have worked fine because all database schema changes have been simple like adding a new column

16804582
division	multiplication
no floating point no division no multiplication just bitmasking and rejection sampling like this

16804624
16-bit	64bit	x86	64bit
32-bit x86 kept segmentation available while 16-bit oses transitioned to the new processor architecture but during the design of 64bit x86 some legacy features including segmentation were removed

16804638
folder	directory
look for it in your computer directory under the eclipse folder

16804656
inherited	properties
or is it because by virtue of inherited canvas and rectangle both also becomes owner of the dependency properties

16804662
min	max
you can t take the max and min of variables

16804662
min	max
however it s easy just to push your variables into an array and find the max and min of the array with a slightly different syntax

16804669
folder	directory
look for it in your computer directory under the eclipse folder

16804690
int	chars
if i were to reverse the order of your int and chars assignments it would be a very different story

16804693
uiview	calayer
i got wiered but unsurprising animation from call uiview animation i don t know if it works the same by using calayer animation

16804693
uiview	calayer
i cannot make animation based on quartz2d but from uiview animation or calayer deeper tech so what i have to do is to make the rectangle itself as a seperate uiviewrect seperately so i can call the uiviewrect animation method am i right on this

16804712
equals	compareto
if you did create every string using new string somestring .intern then you can use the operator to compare two strings otherwise equals or compareto methods can only be used

16804730
pop-up	dialog
if the items you want to show is not too many i think you can pop-up a custom dialog instead

16804739
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the code above works and tested in firefox safari opera and ie

there are 2 animiations one for mouseenter event and another one for mouseleave event

16804859
vim	textmate
snipmate implements some of textmate s snippets features in vim

16804886
folder	dir
if you just run the dir command at a dos prompt you will see that it returns a list of only the hidden folder

16804908
getter	setter	width	height
a typical example that violates lsp is a square class that derives from a rectangle class assuming getter and setter methods exist for both width and height

16804908
width	height
the square class always assumes that the width is equal with the height

16804916
put	get
so put them together we get 0x0b 3fe0 2000 48 316 293 120

16804966

16805071
google-chrome	firefox
looks like it is about a half a second firefox google-chrome is less than that when selecting on two elements over 100 000 iterations

16805117
implements	extends
the mutex code will probably provide the necessary memory fence to ensure that the reads and writes to the protected variable don t extends beyond the bounds of the mutex so i d say that marking it volatile would not be necessary - if you ve properly implements the mutex there is no chance that another thread could try to access it

16805143
dictionary	map
if you know in advance number of dictionary then minimum structure is array of map

16805172
ienumerable	idictionary
i have no problem sending an ienumerable or idictionary in general but i have issues with sending them containing interfaces

see the video height and width

16805384
width	height
see the video height and width

16805417
lsp	principles
what s wrong with it from an liskov substitution principles lsp perspective is that your rectangle s and square s are mutable

16805417
inherited	subclassing
that means that you have to explicitly reimplement the setters in the subclassing and lose the benefits of inherited

16805417
getter	setter
using attr_reader gives getter but not setter hence the immutability

16805417
width	height
with this implementation both rectangles and squares provide visibility to height and width for a square those will always be the same and the concept of area is consistent

16805448
folder	directory
i have a similar use case find the newest folder matching a pattern foo in a directory

16805455
width	height
just so you know width and height are declared globally in main.cpp

16805455
width	height
every other example i ve found for getting width or height out of an uses this notation

16805455
width	height
it fails in a different function when it references width height in a double for-loop

16805459
cpu	processors
the clr tries to prevent the cpu from unnecessary spinning by not handing out initially anyways more threads on the thread pool thread than there are processors present

16805472
getter	setter
i have a class bankaccount which compose of getter and setter of accountno and accountname

16805499

hide	show
i attempted to offset the show hide div to the right but because the footnotes appear in different left right positioning each would be different

16805642
m2e	pom.xml
so i took a look at rad eclipse in full expectation to see some m2e support that would allow me to point-and-pick my ear modules and then see the modules in the pom.xml file being populated accordingly

16805644
google-chrome	safari
well google-chrome safari don t like that

16805684
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
on my localhost all browsers firefox google-chrome ie and safari work great

16805981
put	get
the out put i get i 1 2 3 4 missing 5

16806002
getter	setter
note that getter and setter must be named like they are else the produced json is wrong case sensitive property names and datatables uses this pseudo hungarian notation ...

16806056
multiplying	add
another approach is to add a multiplier field that contains a thousand million or billion - and multiplying the numbers together when required for reporting

16806069
uibinder	gwtp
i use gwt gwtp and the uibinder

16806082

post	get
type is used to define get or post method

16806144
pascal	delphi
from the overall sound of your third sub-question i m guessing you ve been reading up on how to use c code in a delphi project without having to re-write the c code into pascal delphi syntax linking from delphi code to some existing c library you don t want to re-write or convert

16806144
pascal	delphi
for the purposes of linking to c code the differences between freepascal and delphi both variants of pascal are going to be relatively negligible

16806144
pascal	delphi
basically you have to re-write or convert the c header into pascal syntax so that delphi knows what functions are in your c library so you can call them

16806147
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade core plot versioning to 1.2 in my ios app

16806221
jasmine	mocha
but i see in testing frameworks such as jasmine or mocha that they allow for asynchronous testing

16806312
post	get
many examples show how to do simple post or get the last 20 statuses from a user and update the page with those by returning a view but none of these examples show how to deal with twitter s continuous infinite stream

16806331
folder	directory
note if the connection strings have the same name then the one in the directory will override the one in the root folder

16806422
google-chrome	firefox
it works well in ie9 and firefox but it also blocks flash scroll event in google-chrome

16806424
oncreate	ondestroy
so you need to call stopservice to stop the service you started in activity b 1 start service in oncreate in activity b ondestroy

16806428
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
by doing those two things all of my fonts show up correctly on safari google-chrome firefox

16806533
rspec	capybara
this gives you a selenium connector that you can use with your rspec cucumber also capybara tests and it can record the video output of the test to the website while the test result shows in your console

16806585
mdpi	hdpi
and you must multiple mdpi 4 6 to go from mdpi to hdpi

16806615
lpwstr	bstr

16806728
rss	feed
i want to cache the rss feed from our index page in case my website get slows down

16806738

16806789
folder	directory
this php file is inside a directory in root folder like test test.php

16806821

as your propertyactions class extends an abstract class autopropertyactions there are some strict standards on implements the functions declared in the abstract class

16807242
required	placeholder
here is something like that idea of using a special placeholder in the class path for the required macro

16807326
width	height
try multypllying height and width with scale number where you calculate bounding box

16807426
realloc	malloc
my original implementation used malloc and realloc liberally

16807475
getter	setter
getter and setter should be static only in case of the static properties

16807475
getter	setter
some ides give warning if you try to define static getter setter for non static properties

16807479
width	height
i don t know why this bug happens but i fixed it by hard-setting the width and height each time

16807581
textview	imageview
you should use selector for imageview and textview as well

16807615
google-chrome	firefox
the url showing image in firefox and ie but not showing in google-chrome

16807644
width	height
all images have same width and height

16807644
width	height
i want this layout always fit parent s width and all images scale with the same aspect ratio width and height

16807644

google-chrome	firefox
however with the import function the directives works in google-chrome firefox but not in ie8 where it makes 3 sliblings like written in the docs

16807790
setinterval	settimeout
i am familiar with java script functions like setinterval and settimeout but i ve found none of them useful in this case

16807792
maven	pom.xml
this is example from a pom.xml file if you don t use maven you will have to use a different way but you still need to configure it

16807799

16807916
super	self
in -mutablecopywithzone super self still points to an instance object of the derived class

16807944
point-in-polygon	convex
it looks like you are using a 2d point cloud so i d like to direct you to the inclusion test for point-in-polygon testing of convex polygons

16807944
point-in-polygon	convex
this is because as you really need for point-in-polygon testing of a convex hull is the list of convex hull points in clockwise order and a point that is inside of the polygon

16807967
hide	show
and simply used a jquery show and hide

16808009

firefox switched to silent updates for add-ons a while ago by default the user isn t notified about updates - same as in google-chrome

16808326
getter	setter
you can generate getter setter and constructors with mere annotations

16808352
versioning	upgrade
the correct way to investigate this is to set up a new system with the new versioning that you are actually going to be using -- no cut-down data sets no export-import if what you re going to do is an in-place upgrade you want the physical data layout to be exactly the same as production no small representative set of queries using the same storage architecture processor type and memory configuration

16808382
oncreate	onstart
i put initwebview method wrongly in onstart instead of oncreate

16808409
many-to-many	many-to-one	many-to-many	one-to-many	many-to-one	one-to-many

delphi	oxygene
oxygene doesn t attempt to be source compatible with delphi

16808739
delphi	oxygene
what s more the runtime libraries used by the various oxygene flavours differ entirely from those used by delphi

16808739
delphi	oxygene
so you won t find any serious libraries that have single source that can compile on oxygene and delphi

16808739
delphi	oxygene
the way that remobjects have developed oxygene on different platforms is quite interesting and radically different from the approach taken by embarcadero with delphi

16808739
delphi	oxygene
so not only can you single source your app between delphi and oxygene you cannot readily single source multiple oxygene targets

16808739
delphi	oxygene
in the long run you ll want a codebase in one of delphi fpc oxygene or even something radically different

playlists	autoplay
i am trying to add more vimeo videos in a single player that would autoplay and will play the videos one after another and repeat the playlists eventually

16808768
filtering	grouping
because the route needs to close itself i have to ensure that it also closes if every message is filtering out which is why i don t use a filtering but a .choice statement instead and set a custom header on the exchange which is later used in a bean that grouping matches and prepares a single source document for the xquery

i am accessing a server running centos linux distribution with an ssh connection

16809142

16809323
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in google-chrome firefox opera all works fine

16809354
try-catch	exception-handling
this becomes an issue if you add a finally clause to the try-catch block - you may enter the finally clause when exception-handling occurs and the myobject will not be available which the compiler must avoid

and i have conditionals that hide show buttons depending on how much is selected

16809794

although chars can be treated as an unsigned int i think it s a bad coding style to use chars for anything but chars

16810181
pull	push
the user could then pull again and push and everything worked

only when i change the request method from get to post the issue was solved but then i tested on chrome and it still turn the chars to gibberish.

16810199

several consequences result from this difference between awt and swing

16810355

you can see the problem only in google-chrome safari going here

16810573
put	get	post	get	post	put	for-loop	arrays
i use post to get the inputtedd password and then put it in a for-loop and if the password equals one in the arrays it breaks and returns 1 and then checks to see if the numbers match for the username and checks it for a match

min	max
it is related with fact that started chart is generated in the own form min max values in both axss then you call setextrems which is only event called one time

16811124
min	max
so you can define min max values with numbers form setextremes and about events

16811167
minimum	max
if the prefix is always the same length you can reduce the workload somewhat you could create a specialized index that would find the max value in a minimum number of steps

16811182
prepare	execute
what s worse is that the sendsynchronousrequest and the ui code are both blocking sets of code so they will take up the maximum amount of time allotted to them by the os and then the os will perform an expensive context switch to prepare to execute the other

16811185
translation	localization
you should contact the kde localization team if you have questions about licensing of their translation

for-loop	arrays
so i can only imagine that there s only one for-loop done on the arrays and on each step a recursion of some kind is done and altering the arrays value as needed

16812006
disk	ram
of course this is not 100 safe as there are ways to see what is stored in ram and the data can be paged by the os to a hdd-based paging file but it is still orders of magnitude better protected than plain text physical files on disk

cpython	pypy
you could try sharing installations between cpython and pypy by setting pythonpath but this is error prone cpython and pypy don t use exactly the same bytecode format their native-code extension modules are not abi compatible etc so unless you have very specific understanding of these issues and specific requirements for doing so it s not really a good idea

16812611
post	put
one to put the car followed by another to post the owner driver

16812611
put	get
if you don t have the full resource data for the car beforehand do a get for that before the put updating your put request body as necessary

16812611
put	get
if the get returns 404 then just leave the unknown fields blank in your put and define that your server will fill them in with default values rather than say reject the put request

keydown	keyup
also note you should be using either the keyup or keydown event rather than keypress

16813016
keydown	keyup
keyup keydown is handled at a lower level so it will capture all non-printing keys like del and enter

if you want to do clipping of the image beforehand cut off sides or top and bottom then you need to clearly define what behavior you want start at top fill the height of the pciturebox and crop the rest or start at the bottom fill the height of the picturebox to the top etc and it should be fairly simple to use the height width properties of both the picturebox and the image to clip the image and get the effect you are looking for

emacs	aquamacs
for the life of me i cannot figure out how to force emacs or in my case aquamacs to force itself to downgrade the default color scheme to the xterm 256 color scheme like it does in my terminal

16822586
emacs	aquamacs
there has to be an easier way than making a new ridiculously detailed color theme but beyond the term command you can set in your bashrc file which obviously aquamacs doesn t care about or use i can t find anything equivalent in emacs aquamacs that tells it to adopt a 256 color range so that it does things like turns firebrick into the closest available color in this case red

i thought it is probably because ghci cannot tell whether 0 is meant to be int or int or double or other type in num class

post	get
when visiting the url post 1 both model hooks get executed so the server is first asked for all post and then for post_id 1

16824251
int	double
basically ghci will first try int then if that fails double and then finally to resolve ambiguous type constraints

16824277
post	get
i want to see if there is a way to do the validation with get instead of post to have it like this

16824303
int	double
it would then choose the default for a num constraint here unless an explicit default declaration is in scope that would be int or if int does not satisfy the constraints double is tried

16824356
y-combinator	combinators
y-combinator is a construct from the family of fixed-point combinators s

16824383
int	double
e is still a number but now you are assigning a double to an int

16824383
int	double
what if e was a short or an int in these cases you wouldnt expect to be able to assign them a double without casting

16824399
int	double
for example e could be an int long double etc

16824399
int	double
this is why your code does not compile - if e was int for example it would be wrong to be able to assign a double to the variable of type int

16824401
folder	directory
my example has a folder in the root directory named error and an html file in it named 404.html

width	height
here i have 6 divs .sticker inside a single div onclicking one of them i would like to fadeout the others keeping the clicked one in it position that s why i do the postop posleft thing then i want to move it on the middle of the bigger div while it grows by height and width showing a hided div .info

16824448
stdout	stderr
just to supplement with some detail about why you weren t able to capture the gsutil cp output the way you expected gsutil outputs status messages to stderr and only outputs to stdout when the output in question is the purpose of the command you re running

16824448
stdout	stderr
thus for example gsutil ls outputs to stdout because that output is the purpose of the command while in contrast the progress indicator messages for the gsutil cp command are really status about the underlying purpose which is copying data -- so that output goes to stderr

i am using a stretch to make the image fil the imageview so i can take smaller images and make them larger on the screen however the imageview normally just uses wrap_content and this is an issue because the images just show up as their normal width and height

16824466

is there any way i can set the height and width of a view before drawing it because as in this case i do not have control over the view after it has been drawn

the origin header is not included in the response in safari but is in google-chrome

16824688
children	parent
similarly you check all the children to see if they match and then you decide which of the children could match by comparing the value to the parent

16824708
ftell	fread
i checked fopen ftell and fread to see if they have hidden gotcha s where they call new somewhere but didn t find anything in the documentation on cplusplus.com

16824765

i was wondering if any one observed that the time taken to download or upload a file over ftp using python s ftplib is very large as compared to performing ftp get put over windows command prompt or using perl s net ftp module

16824777
width	height
i think that s one of the right methods but i m not one hundred percent sure. you could create a width class variable and a height class variable that all instances of your custom imageview would use

16824777
width	height
however that might be a bit much if you just want to set the layout width and height though

16824790
for-loop	loops
loops through the list with a for-loop and use the index and editorfor

16824802
puts	gets
it then sees that all the a s and only the first groupm end up in one group and concludes that no matter how many a s is puts it won t matter since + gets all in the group

16824814
post	get
set the content-type and use post instead of get as it is a list of complex type objects

16824854

subsequently i want to increase the height of the image to make it equal to the width by adding equal areas of transparent pixels to the top and bottom

now to change the height and width of the image you should use the gd library or imagemagick

16825173
getter	setter
ibatis does not seem to have a mechanism for determining the length of an array in the sqlmap xml file since length of arrays does not have a javabean getter setter

the isequal tag initially looked quite promising but it does not work with array.length since it does not have a getter setter

xslt	xquery
i m trying to use this expression to create word boundaries b is not available in xslt xquery but i would prefer not to use groups | s -- since non-capturing groups aren t available that means in some scenarios i may end up with a large amount of unneeded capture groups and that creates a new task of finding the real capture groups in the set of unneeded ones

16825342
superclass	subclassing
sometimes also called the slicing problem occurs if a superclass instance is assigned its value from a subclassing instance member variables defined in the subclassing cannot be copied since the superclass has no place to store them

for-loop	loops
when iterating through a with a foreach loops in the tests i conducted the items are returned in the same order as they are with a standard for-loop

getter	setter
activerecord reads the schema and creates getter and setter methods for every column dynamically at runtime

16825480
shim	polyfills
i have been looking through some shim polyfills libraries and see that some of them have a shim for object.getprototypeof

16825487
getter	setter
the third one seems the best approach because using getter and setter enables encapsulation of the function s logic and also extension

16825511
google-chrome	firefox
i m noticing a discrepancy between the outputs of printing this simple jsfiddle in google-chrome and firefox

16825575
inherited	properties
returns a javascript object which can have named properties and also a prototype which allows objects to inherited properties from other objects

16825575
inherited	properties
so performance will not be quite like that of a hash table since properties may be inherited from their prototype objects and searching for a given properties by name may require traversing up the prototype tree before it is found

16825653
post	get
if this file is important or a few select files post a question on apple s internal forums and you will surely get an answer to such a question

16825661
for-loop	loops
so you should use the enhanced for-loop by default but consider a hand-written counted loops for performance-critical arraylist iteration

16825677
for-loop	arrays
that for-loop right there is only putting one achievement into each arrays like so

16825737
mp3	ogg
it probably doesn t make a big difference to performance whether you use ogg or mp3 with the webaudio api in firefox

16825737
mp3	ogg
so you need to provide both ogg vorbis and mp3 anyway if you want your webpage to work in firefox on all platforms

16825737
mp3	ogg
you can test if the browser you re running in supports mp3 or ogg vorbis using the htmlmediaelement.canplaytype api

16825749

children	parent
i have a sinatra route where the slug of both a parent and child record are supplied the parent has many children

16825876
inherited	properties
this strongly suggests that all of your c++ model classes need to inherited from a meta-model that provides a generic properties mechanism

16825876
getter	setter
the alternative will be to generate an enormous quantity of boiler-plate setter getter in c++ and binding objects to make use of them in .net and objective-c

16825911
graphics2d	bufferedimage
you can use your same code you wrote for overriding paintcomponent by creating a bufferedimage and calling image.creategraphics on it to get a graphics2d object

16825911
graphics2d	bufferedimage
any painting you do to the graphics2d object returned from creategraphics is added to the bufferedimage

16825911
graphics2d	bufferedimage
once you have your maze drawn into the bufferedimage you can use any of the drawimage functions in graphics or graphics2d

16825912

that said not all memory is the ram because os support virtual memory so part of the memory available to it is really a hard disk swap file

16826160

int	double
one possible answer is that the convert.todouble method is seeing your dbs float as a double yet the expected parameter is an int seeing as you wouldnt convert from double to double

16840833
min	max
first it finds points that have the max and min z value

16840870
google-chrome	firefox
ideally this would support ie firefox and google-chrome

16840873
width	height
when you use absolute positioning it takes the element out of the natural flow of the page and it will no longer respect the height and width constraints of the parent element

16840906
decltype	auto
sorry but without c++11 s decltype or auto you re stuck with either using the big ugly type which is an implementation detail of boost.bind really or else using boost function to erase the type which incurs the cost of indirection on every call

16840944
pull	push
you will be able to perform pull and push operations using the ui

16841198
google-chrome	safari
there is no javascript error in both google-chrome or safari nevertheless when clicking on any of the buttons it just doesn t work

16841217
width	height
i believe you need to load the image as a surface before you can get its width and height

16841217
width	height
then you can get the width and height by creating a rectangle with foo.get_rect and asking the rectangle

16841224

16841514
width	height
check out stage.setviewport float width float height boolean keepaspectratio

i thought firefox and google-chrome had a bigger limit than that

16841590
put	get
in tmp i have one dir and two files when get to readdir after the execution of opendir dir it exits the while and put this error

16841604
width	height
you are dealing with different resolutions and pixel densities so any elements that are of a fixed width and or height are going to look differently

16841604
width	height
in the case of those buttons the height is fixed but the width is something like 95 of the page so they stretch out to fill the width but are narrower because it is a fixed number of pixels high and the pixel density increased

16841618
integer	unsigned
i would suggest storing the number of lines in the file as an unsigned integer and not a string

16841618
integer	unsigned
a better solution would be to keep the first 4 bytes of the file as an unsigned integer and then start the ascii text after

16841674
versioning	upgrade
unfortunately i can t just upgrade the system zlib to a newer versioning since some of the packages poke into internal zlib structures and that breaks on newer zlib versioning

16841683
google-chrome	firefox
i m having an issue in google-chrome and firefox too i think

16841699
gradle	ivy
gradle s configurations are heavily inspired from ivy not ant but they aren t fully equivalent to ivy s configurations and we d have to discuss what you mean by equivalent

16841699
gradle	ivy
they will be mapped to ivy configurations when gradle generates an ivy.xml

as i am not quite sure if uinavigationcontroller will work i decided to manually initialized a uinavigationbar together with its uinavigationitem initwithtitle

16841814
subtraction	addition	subtraction	add
addition and subtraction is worse as these have to be done in sequence of two operations and the second operation requires the first to have completed - this is not the case if the compiler is just producing two add operations on independent data

16841814
division	multiplication
division is a similar problem to multiplication - but here it s ok to take a 64-bit input on the one side divide it by a 32-bit value and get a 32-bit value out

16841814
addition	multiplication
as you can see addition and multiplication isn t that much worse

16841823
titlebar	window
what i would like to achieve is that the user could open like a preferences window or something from the main window both window should have a titlebar etc

and if instead of decorating updatehandlerpage get i decorate updateworkerpage post i get an infinite failure loop instead

16842481
put	get
these should enable you to put python variables into an existing cell array and get python-readable variables out from the cell array

16842522
xslt	xquery
if you re using analyze-string as a function then presumably you re using a 3.0 implementation of either xslt or xquery

16842534
integer	radix
rangeerror radix must be an integer at least 2 and no greater than 36

16842550

integer	unsigned
i tried to convert the query to unsigned integer although not sure if it did work

16842567
accessor	properties
in this example the person class doesn t have any properties accessor there s a getfirstname method but no firstnameproperty method

16842567
accessor	properties
when there s no properties accessor the cell value factory is going to call getfirstname and then wrap the result in a new readonlyobjectwrapper on each invocation

16842567
accessor	properties
if you make sure the class representing the row data has the appropriate properties accessor then retrieving the value is much more efficient as it merely returns a reference to the existing stringproperty

16842619
hide	show
you could give each button and duplicated option a class and then use media queries to show and hide the ones that you wish to display keeping the logic in the js to a minimum

16842632
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried using google-chrome 27.0.1453.94 m firefox 21.0 and ie 10

16842632
google-chrome	firefox
moreover as of this and this ogg should be playable in google-chrome and firefox

16842634
implements	extends
in fact while an enum may not extends another class it is perfectly allowable for an enum to implements an interface

16842661
stdout	stderr
you can use this syntax to redirect all output stderr and stdout to stdout.txt

16842662
super	abstract	super	extends	super	implements	implements	extends
any class that extends reportview and is not abstract must implements generate_report and any other abstract function in its super classes for that matter

16842878
typedef	struct
note the struct definition is really what is at issue here not the typedef

16842903
put	get	post	get	post	put
my spec has no problem doing straight equality checks on other headers but i have been unable to figure out how to check the access-control-allow-methods header for each of get put post delete and options

16842913
int	double
the second conversion is from the long double value that resulted from the first conversion to an int value

16842957
for-loop	loops
hence in the for-loop all three expressions are true always matched and hence results in an infinite loops

16842957
for-loop	loops
if the controlling expression of a while loops is a constant because loops will exit in the middle consider replacing the while loops with a for-loop

16842957
for-loop	loops
you can omit the initialization termination test and loops increment of a for-loop which causes loops to be infinite like while 1 and you can exit loops from the body of the for statement

16842958
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i ve tested this on google-chrome and chromium 27.0.1453.93 windows ok os x ok linux fails as described ie 9 windows ok opera linux ok firefox 21 linux ok

16842968
for-loop	loops
essentially a for-loop is a shortened version of another loops with this syntax

16843016
division	multiplication
you want to use elementwise multiplication or division

16843028
hide	show
i want to implement a button as in the red circle which on click hide show my 1st column the input portion and hence the user can see the entire output on the whole of the screen

16843032
opera	safari
i know that the reverse is true by taking a link like and changing it to o you are able to navigate from mobile safari into opera mini

16843036
width	margin
basically what i m trying to do is to center all of the left aligned text based on the width by getting the width of each then making the left margin negative half of whatever the width was but right now it s only applying to the first paragraph

16843045
addition	multiplication
i don t know whether you just wanted to count binary operations like addition and multiplication or also unary operations like negation.

16843050
width	height
now all the images will have various height width so i want to show images in it s original height width

16843050
width	height
please note my model class contains image name path height width

16843053
children	parent
i think what you can do is use expandable listview having 1 parent which will contain profile+pic and many children

16843087
width	margin
i can t set margin of the body to a specific size because the width of scrollbars differentiate between browsers

16843119
qobject	qwidget
as written in this answer this is because at the point destroyed is emitted the widget isn t a qwidget anymore just a qobject as destroyed is emitted from qobject

16843124
width	margin
you need an .each loop to find the width and apply the margin to each paragraph individually

16843156
postgresql	mysql
i am creating databases in mysql and postgresql

16843169
folder	directory
also instead of mucking around with the program files directory i copied the lib and dll s to the working folder and modified the .pro file to build out of qtcreator

16843250
for-loop	arrays
this seems to tell me that my for-loop is not looping through every item on the arrays and i ve been scratching my head over why that would be for a quite a while now

16843271
public	protected
this includes public protected default package access and private fields but excludes inherited fields

16843303
folder	directory
according to the qt5 documentation in deploying an application on windows it sounds like when deploying an executable it would be in a folder called platforms in the save directory as the executable

16843322

16843441
google-chrome	firefox
when the link is clicked in firefox ie or google-chrome the page makes multiple requests and then returns a problem loading page error

16843444
postgresql	mysql
the good news for this specific problem is that for db2 postgresql oracle and mysql you can simply wrap extend a query to become a query with a limit

16843484
min	max
you could also use the min max size parameters of detectmultiscale to find objects that are only smaller or larger than your reference

16843512
switching	screens
if you notice the focus behavior in the stock camera app or the uiimagepickercontroller after you tap focus some area and you move the phone away the camera can automatically switching to continuous auto focus at the center of the screens

16843515
multiplying	multiplication
hopefully the compiler should recognise how much simpler it is to multiplying a 16-bit value by ten compared with separately implementing multiplication by 1000 and 100

16843571
nswindow	nspanel
nsfontpanel is a subclass of nspanel which is a subclass of nswindow

16843604
width	height	google-chrome	firefox
i ve been trying to fix the way my website looks on different browsers and i finally achieved that on ie and google-chrome but it s so ruined on mozilla firefox it keeps appearing on the top left corner of the browser because i set every main div to be absolute even though i gave each one the necessary height for the image included and i set the width to be 100 at each

16843611
base	fractions
to avoid this problem instead of doubles you ll need to use some kind of 3rd party mathematics bignum library that stores numbers internally using decimal base two decimal digits per byte or something or uses fractions ratios instead of floating point numbers

16843619
google-chrome	firefox
i am using following code the dialogue is showing up in my google-chrome but client and client s client google-chrome it is not while in ie and firefox it is showing up for them

when my msi package upgrade installation is completed all shortcuts immediately work as expected except that the label in the taskbar refers to the binary being executed rather than giving the shortcut link and icon

16843749
google-chrome	safari
i am revealing an element using a css transition that is triggered by a javascript scroll event however this transition is affecting the background color of an adjacent element in safari 5.1.7 and google-chrome 27.0.1453.93 on a mac 10.6.8 which makes no sense at all

16843782
google-chrome	firefox
i created svg element with javascript and its working fine in google-chrome firefox and ie9 but not working in ie8

16843784
equals	compareto
i am attempting to use dry methodology by having my equals method simply call my compareto method and test equivalence to 0

16843784
equals	compareto
one question is whether i need to include the above code in my equals method add it to my compareto method or if it is already covered by comparetobuilder

16843937
width	height
and because i didn t specify the width height of the label that will adjust based upon the text you put into that label

16843983
free	malloc
just remember you need to free what you malloc

16844021
folder	dir
dir gets just the file name and left helps trim down the string to just the folder path

16844090
crypt	salt
you pass a different salt value into the second call to crypt - this will result in different return values even if the passwords are the same

16844167
collabnet	svn
if there was a mistake and your os isn t that old you can go to svn binaries on collabnet and see what they have

16844210
post	get
the request for the access token needs to be in the form of a post request with the parameters included in the body of the requestâ it looks like you re sending a get with the parameters as url parameters

16844233

google-chrome	firefox
the jfiddle works in google-chrome and firefox but not ie9

16844395
google-chrome	firefox
this is working fine on google-chrome and firefox but on ie its setting the background color of textarea to white

16844448
instances	transient
i was reading a bit on the singleton design pattern and it turns out that a good way of implementing a serializable singleton is to have a readresolve method which returns the true instances and all members declared transient

16844461
post	get
for this case you can substitute the u s with users and the m with post in get the same results

16844467
post	get
i m just making a newsfeed that is database driven right now i have it working but at the end of every news post i get a string like so

pop-up	dialog
prevent the default action pop-up a confirm or a dialog with a settimeout and redirect programatically

16844612
google-chrome	firefox
regarding the differences that you ask besides a few structure differences and of course google-chrome or firefox specific code that is not going to work in the other platform i think that it should be easy port an addon from one platform to another no automatic but pretty straightforward

16844616
mouse	keyboard
i have a requirement to make the application functionality accessible through keyboard not just the mouse

16844638
post	get
i have already asked around but decided to post it here to see if i can get any answers as well

16844650
children	parent
suppose then a file on the parent node is split up into blocks and divided among the children

16844650
children	parent
if the parent were to then request the blocks back from the children how can the original order be reconstructed without retaining a list of all the files on the parent

16844650
children	parent
given the list a parent should be able to use the list somehow to validate the blocks coming back from children

16844661
bash	subshell
when bash merely forks sets up a command and execves it it doesn t count it as a subshell

16844691
inherited	properties
if ado were in the picture i would just use the data type properties inherited in recordsets but i am limited to foxpro and its own cursor functionality

16844709
punctuation	words
if you don t the search term is treated as a words query and that will cause punctuation to be removed as mblakele explains

16844778
entities	entitymanager
the entitymanager is in charge of managing an in memory representation of all entities of the associated persistence unit

16844801
return-value-optimization	nrvo
the return-value-optimization and nrvo same link as above are two examples of these - the compiler is allowed to elide the copy constructor in these limited cases - which is what you are seeing

16844833
min	max
the arbitrary choice here is max but you could arbitrarily use min instead

16844833
min	max
max returns the largest value for that columns min the smallest

16844848
stdout	fflush
endl causes the buffer to fflush and be written out to stdout

16844860
google-chrome	firefox
we create all of our tests for firefox google-chrome and ie9 in vs2010r2 using selenium2 and c#

16844860
google-chrome	firefox
both the google-chrome and firefox tests run perfectly but the ie9 tests are painfully slow and usually timeout but the test is exactly the same for each browser

16844884
inherited	subclassing
the solution because you assume single inherited and direct subclassing relationships is to just create d 1 as a subclassing of c n in which case all ds will also be in every c class

16844930
cpu	affinity
based on number of thread following code is used in threads_func to change cpu affinity for each thread

sometimes the people that make the api are nice enough to give you a .h file that contain helper functions to automate this process and give you all the function pointers that you need but if not you can use loadlibrary and getprocaddress on windows and dlopen and dlsym on unix to get them considering that you know the entire signature of the function

i have set up a few arrays to gather information and so far i have set values to my 3 arrays and set up a for-loop to run through the arrays and pick out the desired information based on what is put into my textbox course id but it s not printing anything and i m not sure why i thought by assigning the arrays to variables and then putting the variables in the text box that would work and at this point i am beyond lost and i know my explanation isn t necessarily helpful but all help is appreciated

submit	submission
my suspicion is that it is something to do with the tracked entities in dbset.local it appears this collection is happy to store entities which violate database constraints and even after the db has thrown an error ef does not remove the faulted entity from its cache and i guess that every time i call datacontext.savechanges ef keeps trying to submit the faulty address entity that it has in it s bdset.local property and thus prevents me from submission anything further to the db until the whole project is restarted and the various dbset.local collections are flushed

treemap	linkedhashmap
if you want to perserve the order of the items you can either use a treemap or a linkedhashmap

16863433
treemap	linkedhashmap
the difference between these is that treemap keeps them ordered by their natural sort order while linkedhashmap keeps the insertion order

16863433
treemap	linkedhashmap
treemap uses a red-black tree for its internal implementation while linkedhashmap uses doubly linked list

int	chars
be careful though an int element generally has a size greater than a byte so storing int values in an int array won t have the same internal representation as a chars array -- you may end up with null bytes as padding in between values

16863659
int	chars
furthermore if your intention is to hash the ascii representation of your int you will have to first convert the values in your array to a string chars sequence perhaps using sprintf

16872315
inherited	properties
in classical inherited it s impossible or at least very difficult to choose which properties you want to inherited

16874333
int	double
1.71799e+09 is the double representation of the int you got

16874343
int	double
technically this code is in violation of the rules about aliasing - basically you are using the same piece of memory for two different purposes and the compiler is not obliged to do the right thing in this case - i suspect it does something of what you can expect in this particular case - if what you expect is that you get an int value represented by the four first bytes of a double that is

16874418

that s 8-bits per channel unsigned and normalized stored as an integer

16874739
int	double
because y is a double not an int

16874739
int	double
now if you mean to ask why doesn t y have an integral value since it should be the result of the conversion of an int which must have an integral value to double take a look at the output of the following

16874739
int	double
in fact your program is not actually legal because you re violating the aliasing rules when you access the double x through a pointer to int

16874754

also you should possible put that statement inside the function where you assign window.distance because that document.getelementbyid thing will be called when the interpreter gets to that line of calcroute where as the line where you actually assign a value to window.distance is a callback function passed to directionsservice.route so there s no way to know that window.distance will actually have a value when you try to get it because the callback function can be called whenever directionsservice.route decides to

pop-up	dialog
as i said these are only conventions and there is not much technical difference between them but a very important difference is that browsers will warn the user if they try to repeat a post -- clicking refresh will pop-up a dialog box warning the user that this may cause an operation to be repeated and confirming that they really want to resubmit

concurrenthashmap	skip-lists	skip-lists	tree
as an alternative to the copyonwritearrayset you could use a concurrenthashmap with meaningless values always use boolean.true as the value - you only care about the keys or else you could use a concurrentskiplistset which is essentially a concurrent treeset that uses a skip-lists instead of a balanced binary tree

try using a css transform scale instead of just changing the width and height

16879331
memcpy	memmove
if speed is not what you d concern you can use rtlmovememory and wsprintf supplied by kernel32.dll for memcpy memmove and sprintf not actually that slow just cannot do link time optimization

16879333
width	height
replacing 800 with the width of the window and 600 with the height should you change the resolution

16879335
versioning	upgrade
in actions upgrade the modules that have the new versioning and reinstall these modules

16879362

stringstream	fstream
create a stream from file so that to read from the stream you have fstream input output stringstream .

16879508
folder	directory
then in your vs2010 project properties common properties - vc++ directory - include directory type your boost folder c boostsourcefolder

16879508

what i am trying to achieve is to hide the pop-up window by pushing the button to send the dialog

16879611
google-chrome	firefox
correct display google-chrome firefox ie

16879626
typedef	struct
typedef associates baz with the struct - the attributes comes after and applies to nothing - gcc ignores it

16879626
typedef	struct
to fix this allow typedef to associate the whole struct declaration including the attribute by placing baz after the attribute

16879633
leaflet	openlayers
openlayers and mapbox openlayers.org is an open source javascript web mapping library distinguished from other alternatives like leaflet or google maps apis because of its huge set of components

16879685
post	get
after implementing a post i started to find various articles saying you should only use post to update data and get for retrieving data

16879694
width	height
my first thought was that is equivalent to negative value are subtracted from the width or height of the superview

16879694
width	height
but then i looked at the width and height of the superview and they re both 0.0

16879697
folder	directory
you only need to copy emails folder from userena templates userena into you project template directory with same directory structure

16879697
folder	directory
after that just change activation_email_message.txt file content in emails folder of your project template directory

16879698
for-loop	loops
then if newgem gets called while in your for-loop and this loops succeeds

16879715
switching	screens
if you log cell.frame you ll sometimes see a large number for its y value as you scroll up and down so sometimes your switching is off the bottom of the screens

16879770
pull	push
it does seem strange that the push and pull for the same type of action a check-in would have different values just because they were going through different apis

16879770
pull	push
be consistent about the data for the same activity regardless of push vs pull

16879771
folder	directory
i have a directory named filmreview in my computer and filmreview.git in my github and it is empty i want to push this folder into

16879807
cufft	fftw
when doing one fft at a time i find that fftw and cufft give comparable numerical results

16879807
cufft	fftw
however when i use batch mode to perform multiple ffts my fftw and cufft results look nothing alike

16879807
cufft	fftw
when i use the cufft and fftw results match

16879807
cufft	fftw
the cufft results are essentially unchanged when i change howmany from 1 to 2 but the fftw results change completely

16879807
cufft	fftw
my hunch is that fftw is right and cufft is wrong here

16879807
cufft	fftw
you can reproduce the problem by downloading my code fftw code cufft code all code

16879815
postgresql	mysql
the relational databases are a mix of postgresql mysql oracle and ms sql server

16879815
wan	lan
if the results of the jobs are intended to go into one or more of the databases then this is accomplished by a separate job that is not part of the inter-node job system i am trying to optimize. my objective is to minimize the network bandwidth required by these jobs first to minimize the inter-node wan bandwidth then to minimize the intra-node lan bandwidth

16879815
wan	lan
i assume a uniform cost for each wan link and another uniform cost for each lan link

16879815
wan	lan
the amount of data transported across the wan lan for the aggregation jobs is small relative to the amount of database writes that are local to a cluster or to a specific database so it would not be practical to fully distribute the databases across the federation

16879827
folder	directory
copy the entire line to a text document and add your install directory for python.exe and the scripts folder using

16879827
folder	directory
once python is registered in the path file download and unzip setup_tools to a folder within your python install directory called modules

16879863
post	get
anyways you can get the disqus comment box code and add it at the end of the post

16879877
int	chars
just so you know why the error occurred the data types of your variables int chars string etc have to match the data types that the function expects to receive

16879885
g++	gcc
with gcc g++ clang try -wall or -wextra as moshbear points out

16879897
filtering	grouping
the best way to achieve this would be in a before filtering that you apply to the route grouping

16879919
typedef	struct
the normal syntax for describing a struct without doing it anonymously and having to typedef it is

16879919
typedef	struct
i would advise putting on a hit on whomever suggested you use the typedef syntax for describing struct

16879940
mouseover	mouseenter
it doesnt use the jquery built in mouseenter event but rather the js native mouseover event and it ignores when mouseover is of the button

16879940
mouseover	mouseenter
this is the jquery code that runs on every mouseover to execute the mouseenter behavior

16879941
int	double
for best practices sake you should not be casting denominator from int to double constantly--you are only using it as a double so it should be a double typed variable

16879941
int	double
casting int to double or back is not free

16879947
width	margin
the width of the ul block is related to how much margin the li element has but if that margin is a percentage of the ul width then both elements are depending on each other and it just makes no sense

16880046
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i m running up-to-date versions of firefox google-chrome and safari on os x and the gifs do not ever freeze for me unless i click the frozen gif button on the jsfiddle so this appears to be a localized glitch for the op

16880054
pull	push
3 you need to add your user scheme and workspace file to .gitignore to push and pull from a remote you have to have a clean working repo

16880131
post	get
unless your protocol stack knows how to format post and get requests then you will need to do that yourself

16880150
google-chrome	safari
but when viewing the site from my iphone s safari or google-chrome ios for that matter the images adjust horizontally but they stretch and get distorted vertically

16880162
google-chrome	firefox
no it is no longer possible to capture values passed to the or constructors in firefox 21 google-chrome 27 or ie 10

16880162
opera	safari
the es4 spec in section 1.5 requires the global standard bindings of object and array to be used to construct new objects for object and array initializers and notes in implementation precedent that internet explorer 6 opera 9.20 and safari 3 do not respect either local or global rebindings of object and array but use the original object and array constructors. this is retained in es5 section 11.1.4

16880198
jruby	rubinius	jruby	mri	mri	rubinius
it was designed to be the go-to server for rubinius but also works well with jruby and mri

16880214
width	height
to give you a basic idea for the collision function you can determine the actual position width and height of an element with element.getboundingclientrect more info

16880289
width	height
basically you draw what ever you want around the center of the component based on it s width and height

16880292
nsinvocationoperation	nsblockoperation
you can use nsblockoperation or nsinvocationoperation to quickly create operations

16880294
google-chrome	firefox
the weird thing i noticed today working on a website is that in footer section of site i have a quick contact form which i cant focus on email field in firefox in google-chrome it works as it suppose to but i have no idea what s wrong with it in firefox and i didn t really have the time or will to check it in ie too

16880313
itunes	iphoto
itunes and iphoto sharing will suffer the same fate as your app on these networks

16880322
serializable	deserialization
to understand the significance of field serialversionuid one should understand how serializable deserialization works

16880322
serializable	deserialization
so we conclude that to make serializable deserialization process successful the serialversionuid of serializable object must be equivalent to the serialversionuid of the class

16880322
serializable	deserialization
serializable might be done on platform like windows by using sun or ms jvm and deserialization might be on different platform linux using zing jvm

16880322
serializable	deserialization
but in case if serialversionuid is not specified by programmer then while doing serializable deserialization of any object java runtime uses its own algorithm to calculate it

16880361
width	margin
i use a div tag into another div with a simple width margin and padding

16880370
hide	show
also i d suggest you to not create a dynamic element for the overlay but just use always the same and hide show it as needed

16880392
versioning	upgrade
so either you need to upgrade the hardware or degrade the xcode versioning

16880395
maven	pom.xml
i am using maven 3.0.5 and super pom.xml is located inside

16880410
width	height
i m using the nivo slider and all the images are the same height width 766x400 but when viewing the slider in firefox it up-scales everything to a masive 1 333px ã 696px

16880419
integer	radix
an integer that represents the radix of the above mentioned string

16880449
hide	show
add a client-side on-click handler to the applicant type element that removes changes the class or show hide the registered community section when the applicant type has the desired value

16880469
public	protected
if a private versus protected distinction would make sense for your application you can simply document that _foo or foo is not part of the public user interface but can be relied upon by subclasses to always have certain semantics

16880473
pull	push
it allows you to keep copies of the remote repository but still maintains that repository s history and push pull back and forth at will

16880506
express	node.js
i am making an application using the express framework of node.js

16880519
post	get
you use a get request in your android app but you try to get post data in your php code

16880534
google-chrome	safari
as for why this happens in safari but not in google-chrome

16880587
post	get
the second asynctask doesn t add any parameter to the request i.e company project and component.in addition you are not checking the existence of the params in the request and as mentioned in koesie answer you must change the request type to post instead of get

16880590
width	height
however the basics for responsive images is to make sure the width or often preferably the max-width is set to 100 and that the height is set to auto

16880652
rss	feed
i was trying to make a rss application that supports searching through the rss feed

16880683
int	chars
chars int is called widening primitive conversion

16880683
int	chars
and int chars is called narrowing primitive conversion

16880683
int	chars
in java a chars is just a 16-bit int

16880683
int	chars
when casting int which are 32-bit int to chars you are keeping the 16 least significant bits of the int and discarding the upper 16 bits

16880683
int	chars
chars stores the first 16 bits of the int ascii

16880691
jobs	cron
in this case you should look at managing the cron jobs via something like cron tabs

16880691
jobs	cron
managing cron jobs with php

16880717
draggable	droppable
sure its possible use jquery ui draggable and jquery droppable and an ajax post

16880722
children	parent
i recommend looking for the parent first then look for the children

16880773
box-sizing	border-box
however the method i prefer for handling this issue is to change the box-sizing of the element s to border-box

16880851
box-sizing	border-box
and i also have the setting as box-sizing border-box

16880900
pop-up	dialog
just use datepicker dialog when you change orientation on the pop-up dialog it will give you an error

16880906
width	height
suppose the black div below is the outer container with display flex width 300px and height 200px

16880906
width	height
when you assign padding 30px padding to the outer div this will result in 360px in width and 260px in height

16880906
box-sizing	border-box
if you are using box-sizing border-box

16880921
for-loop	loops
when i n loops breaks but this happens only after the for-loop condition is checked

16880958
post	get
i tried a lot in various way bt i failed jquery get load method works fine but when i try to use jquery post nothing happens

16881010
put	get
i get errors every time and honestly i hardly know where to put it or what to do with it i did change the instance name to yourvideo and myflv ...

16881035
width	height
if i understand your question correctly there is no need to set a height or width because their default setting is auto that being said you can use auto but the only problem with this is that if you wanted to change the background or put a border it will make it around more than the desired field

16881035
width	height
notice i set the container with set width and height because i was working on a project at the same time and to simulate a full screen with text

16881039
children	parent
padding on parent elements for gutter between its edges and its children

16881039
children	parent
remove margins from said children when its margin connects to the parent s padding the first and or last children in a row the last child in a column

16881075
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox it says 80 but in google-chrome it says 60

16881091
svg	vml
but i would like to know if using svg and vml is worth for that

16881134
hash	salt
it is true that randomly generated salt produce a greater amount of security but it is also true that anyone who gets access to a list of your password hash in order to crack them probably has access to your database in which case they have access to your salt

16881138
maven	pom.xml
maven uses the resources folder for your project as you mention them in pom.xml

16881145
maven	pom.xml
i am using maven 3.0.5 and i have the following in pom.xml

16881147
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you fire up the debugger i think you ll find agencies is an ienumerable but not an iqueryable

16881147
ienumerable	iqueryable
correct it by changing the return type of searchagencies from iqueryable to ienumerable

16881147
ienumerable	iqueryable
this may be safer as iqueryable inherits from ienumerable

16881165
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
simple answer make the widths in percents i.e width 30 and so on height auto and the padding and margin 0

16881172
gmail	hotmail
send email via hotmail to gmail

16881187
super	self
i thought of using delegates on the initial view controller but i believe that delegate code is lost when i call self super initwith... on the code above

16881211
goto	break
this is not allowed because neither break nor continue are intended as a substitute for goto

16881221
hide	show
i have a submit button that on clicking the handler hide the current panel and show a verticalpanel which has had quite a few labels added to it

16881242
hash	salt
you use salt to prevent an attacker s brute force attack to amortize across a whole database of hash passwords

16881242
hash	salt
with a unique salt per password even identical passwords will hash to different hash hence forcing an attacker to brute force every single password individually

16881242
hash	salt
by using a static salt which is actually called a pepper to distinguish it from a real salt identical passwords hash to the same hash hence allowing an attacker to brute force a large set of password hash much faster you wouldn t believe how many people use monkey as their password

16881254
gridbaglayout	springlayout
use jpanel layed by springlayout gridbaglayout custom tablelayout

16881264
qapplication	qwidget
qwidget must construct a qapplication before a qpaintdevice

16881279
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
this is because jquery uses an xmlhttprequest object when it s available but ie 8 and 9 xmlhttprequest do not support cors headers and need a xdomainrequest

16881279
google-chrome	firefox
browser inconsistency google-chrome and firefox support cors via

16881320
int	chars
take a look at the format chars section of the documentation if you need something different a signed int which would be h for the fmt parameter of the unpack function call

16881343
serializable	deserialization
the focus is during serializable and deserialization you may end up in creating more than one instance of a class which you want to be singleton

16881343
serializable	deserialization
but you are stopping your singlton to have more than one instance during serializable and deserialization which is of more importance in the context of singleton

16881345
uilabel	uibutton
this is uilabel and uibutton

16881392
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in google-chrome firefox and all other proper modern browsers on pc

16881420
width	height
as i remember it this is fixed by setting html body tag to width height 100

16881420
width	height
and don t forget to set all divs up to the div where it should have effecto to width height 100

16881435
onmouseover	onmousedown
this code works fine for onmouseover and onmouseout events but it doesn t work for onmousedown

16881442
width	height
other than playing with overflow hidden you can try adding default values for width and height or simply play around by using width auto or height auto or both

16881481
vrml	x3d
x3d is indeed a scenegraph representation of 3d worlds and it replaces vrml

16881484
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i m guessing firefox 21 is rendering it wrong because ios safari latest version too renders it like google-chrome desktop latest version as well as google-chrome for ios latest version

16881486
for-loop	loops
but if there is one more loops within that for-loop then time complexity will be o a n 2 +c and so on.

16881517
scatter	graphing
the example implements a 3 graphing but currently i just implemented one the scatter plot without using storyboard

16881520
put	get
and if i try to put strings that are more than 1 character in length i get a number of columns mismatch error

16881578
post	get
so the session had no chance to be persisted except for post requests therefor the login worked but the get for the same page did not.

16881675
division	modulo
is the modulo it gives you the remainder of integer division

16881703
mp3	wav
i am looking for a way to record with js directly to mp3 or encode the bits somehow to mp3 instead of wav

16881705
int	boolean
that overrides the boolean isenabled int position method the way you need it

16881749
pow	sqrt
i am getting different results on using sqrt and pow functions

16881749
pow	sqrt
using sqrt gives the correct answer plus using pow function takes more time

16881836
gmail	hotmail
myemail mydomain.com to any another account whether live hotmail or gmail etc

16881840
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome are using the same rendering engine which is webkit

16881840
google-chrome	firefox
btw below code should also give the nearly same effect as firefox on google-chrome

16881897
width	height
this will in effect center and resize gauges based on the cell width height and your settings

16881953
pow	sqrt
if i is the square of a prime number you are relying on high precision of the sqrt and pow to have the correct result

16881975
pow	sqrt
sqrt on the other hand is guaranteed to be correctly rounded by the ieee specification and that s why your code works with sqrt and not with pow

16881997
getter	setter
this class consist of setter and getter method

16882037
put	get
i tried using breakpoints and see that when i put a breakpoint after getentity the program doesn t get there because it crashed early or something

16882090
rspec	minitest
they rely on rspec test unit or minitest to do the actual pass or fail work

16882103
google-chrome	safari
i ve created a simple binary clock in javascript using canvas and in google-chrome safari even though i m drawing to the canvas many times every second it only updates the screen exactly once per second

16882107
accessor	properties
the javabeans designation only concerns the convention of providing accessor methods for the public properties of the class

16882107
getter	setter
most typically they provide only a setter no getter

16882112
stdout	stderr
the thing that i think is confusing me most is the stdout and stderr args

16882120
min	max
the parameter convention used by both find and count here is that i is the node being counted or flipped min is the lowest index represented by that node and max is the highest index

16882120
min	max
if a b is disjoint from min max do nothing

16882120
min	max
if a b contains min max flip the flipped marker

16882120
min	max
if a b is disjoint from min max return 0

16882120
min	max
if a b contains min max return the count in this node

16882139
stdout	stderr
this will echo all of the non-directory arguments to stderr and print the sorted list of directories on stdout

16882176
stdout	stderr
all console applications have 3 file streams stdin for input and stdout and stderr for output

16882176
stdout	stderr
usually error and diagnostic information to stderr the rest to stdout

16882202
min	max	range	max	range	min
if you require a range larger than 32767 specifying min and max will

16882202
min	max
therefore dont use default values and specifi min and max

16882258
maven-assembly-plugin	pom.xml
the existing configuration defined in pom.xml uses maven-assembly-plugin to create single executable jar-with-dependencies

16882267

you can use a gem like whenever to handle the cron jobs

16882301
google-chrome	firefox
neither in firefox nor in google-chrome

16882301
google-chrome	firefox
then i have tried this code with try it yourself in w3schools and it is not working even there also neither in firefox nor in google-chrome

16882357

16889147

so if i can somehow generate small bitmap slivers on the disk i can use them by loading them in a listview preventing loading the image as a whole into ram

maven	pom.xml
to add a new maven dependency look for the pom.xml file in your project and add the dependency as shown in the maven tab of the first

if you cannot access the properties of a superclass then you did something wrong with the inherited chain

16900426

int	chars	int	double
it uses string.substring to grab the first chars from your string operand and then uses a combination of the ef-only method sqlfunctions.stringconvert these methods are found in system.data.objects.sqlclient with a cast to double 1 and finally a string.trim 2 for your int operand

16900475
int	double
1 the cast to double is necessary because sqlfunctions.stringconvert does not have an overload for int and there is no other single best match so i force one

16900485
versioning	upgrade
this was coded originally against restlet 1.1.x and has been upgrade to 2.1.x via 2.0.x and although it works and is reasonably neat there may possibly be an even better way to do it in either versioning 2.1.x or 2.2.x

16900537
tripledes	rsa

disk	ram
the targets only have 512mb ram we have other models which have 1gb but they see this issue much less often and have no disk swap files to avoid wearing the emmcs

16900680
disk	ram
the behaviour seems like that of a system frantically swapping out to disk and making everything run dog slow as a result but i don t know if this is a known effect in a free - cache ram exchange system

16900789

using a qa configuration the correct web.qa.config is put in the root of my website however the referenced class library configuration is not working i get a sql connection error on the home page which alerts me that the correct app.config transformation is most likely not being used for the referenced dal project

16900940
folder	directory
i thought this would be a .dll.config file in the bin folder for the webui but i am not too sure as i have this working on another web server where i manually changed the default app.config and web.config files and there is no .dll.config file present in the root bin directory of the website

16901442
post	get
note that you need to change logic in server side as well to receive post data instead of get data

16901447
versioning	upgrade
to get the clickonce application back into the upgrade loop simply link to the current server versioning from the local versioning

uiview	subviews
edit please note that viewa is animated to its position over viewb using uiview animatewithduration animations just prior to adding it as a subviews

16901569
mouseout	mouseleave
you should use mouseleave instead of mouseout as mouseout will get triggered even if you hover over the a or p which is inside #meist

16901569
mouseout	mouseleave
the mouseleave event differs from mouseout in the way it handles event bubbling

16901570
int	double
when you say ti means that type is an object and not a primitive data type like int or double

16901572

i have loaded all file datas in an array of unsigned integer values uint16_t

16905487
memcpy	memset
if you use memset instead of memcpy and your caches are write-through this benchmark should be identical to the direct cpu-to-memory path

16905487
memcpy	memset
a better approach might be to test reads and writes separately and not bother with functions like memset and memcpy

16905491
pull	push
right now the push and pull buttons are gray because git can work locally without a remote host you don t have to use bitbucket or any other remote host with git you can run it all locally i recommend reading up on that here if you want more info

16905969
put	get
then just use put instead of append and get instead of pop

16906324
google-chrome	firefox
well it should be possible with css flexible boxes but browser support is not great ie10+ only for example although google-chrome and firefox have good support for the model

16906333
inherited	properties
the box-sizing properties is not inherited by default as you can see from the link - in fact text elements have a computed box-sizing value of content-box not specifying a type attribute will default to text like most elements - the exception is buttons and certain replaced elements like etc

16906333
box-sizing	border-box
all have a computed box-sizing value of border-box

first approach would be to use settimeout or setinterval whatever you prefer

16907600

this script grabs the height of the #footer div and sets it as the bottom padding of the inner body wrapper #nonfooterinner and the top margin of the #footer

16907617
x86	mips
however for arm and x86 and i think powerpc and mips thus covering nearly all modern processors this type of construct isn t part of the instruction set anyway and compilers are a lot more clever these days than they were say 10 or 20 years ago

16907625
height	border-box	width	border-box	width	height	box-sizing	border-box
use the css definition box-sizing border-box to prevent padding from affecting an element s width or height

basically i would like to understand best practices to get the most performance out of both examples queries i put in the code

16907878
serializable	deserialization
while i could manually write a converter to produce the correct json format that would seem to defeat the purpose of the automatic serializable performed by the api controller and automatic deserialization performed by the datacontractjsonserializer

16907882
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
i was able to parse the large text file using bufferedreader inputstreamreader and fileinputstream

16907884
int	boolean
you can use the wrapper types boolean int long etc to return null because these are real objects in java

16907928
int	chars
however my code does not work as expected seeing as even if my code ends in an int between 0 and 9 the if statement will be met and print out last chars in code is non-numerical

16907928
int	chars
also i apparently cannot compare actual int values with an | which is mainly why im using string.valueof and taking the string chars of 0-9

16907972
rss	feed
rss feed are xml files and the content-type type should be application xml you are currently returning text html

but someone has to put in some time to discover how to get metadata from the server how to insert update delete and how zumo data flow over the wire

16908168
width	height
i have until now just been calling g.drawimage image rectangle and passing the width and height of the image as the width and height of the rectangle so that they are forced to be drawn at the correct size but i feel that this should be a short term fix and i am overlooking something simple

16908183
folder	directory
change your app.yaml to serve up the books folder as a static directory

16908262
subobject	instances
the int it is pointing to is the s x subobject of the s instances as returned by

we can fix the ajax after the type error resolution but initially it appears your controller is set to get while your datatables ajax is set to post set the ajax to get and see if that resolves the issue

16908323
post	get
after 2 days of trying to get this to work i post a question on here so i can figure it out

16908330
google-chrome	firefox
it worked in firefox and google-chrome to my dismay because as most web developers know script debugging with ie s developer tools is a blast

16908330
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome this works as expected

16908330
google-chrome	firefox
interestingly enough this works in all three browsers internet explorer 9 firefox and google-chrome

using one of the private protected or public visibility modifiers

16908499
children	parent
i bet you got the answer from the other posts but i d prefer using parent when selecting the parent through the child direct parent instead of travelling recursively than using closest and children over find when selecting a direct child of the parent s no traversal over descendants of children because td is always the direct child of tr

16908564
width	height
wrap both your sliding drawer and framelayout with another framelayout and set the width and height to match_parent

16908604

timsort	heapsort
btw heapsort is interesting theoretically but it s not stable and isn t generally as fast as timsort nor does it take advantage of partially sorted data as well

16908752
uilabel	uitextview
its a lot of ways to do it from just make an photo of formatted text + images and put it in to uiimageview to using different standart ui elements uilabel uiimageview uitextview uiscrollview uiwebview etc. or even creating custom

i can tell from the similar questions posted that it is most likely a problem i am freeing the next pointer but i went through and fixed those errors at least i attempted to and now i only get this from running valgrind --tool memcheck --leak-check yes

16908995
post	get
in terms of your original post you d want to add functions to your view model in order to get your logic out of the bindings

16908996
post	get
whether this is via post or get ajax or not a request still needs to be issued - there is no quick hack to get around this

mapquest	directions
see mapquest directions web service on how to use javascript to get routing data from their route service

16909123
division	modulo
in general you can think of the modulo as performing an integer division and returning the remainder

16909144
put	get
actually thinking about the problem a little further if your regex does match a carriage return or new line character that would need to get put back into the replacing string

16909184
division	modulo
you can use the modulo to verify the division results in an integer

16909195
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari

you do not have to change the type rule after adding these new definitions but after adding the definitions you will be able to check if a token type is int or chars as part of your parser result handling code

16909281
width	height
explicitly give them a width height like the li and you get

16909281
width	height
alternatively you could set width and height to 100 of the parent instead of explicitly setting it

16909301
firefox	safari
safari is the only browser to come with third-party cookies disabled by default firefox will be following suit shortly

16909301

16909343
tolower	uppercase
you also don t have to check whether a character is an uppercase letter before using tolower -- it converts upper to lower case and leaves other characters unchanged

16909343
tolower	toupper
note that when you call tolower and toupper isalpha etc. you really need to cast your input to unsigned char

16909365
folder	directory
what i am trying to do is grab the current user logged in i want it to check the directory d personsuser appdata roaming local to see if the folder local is created if it isn t created i want to create one via createobject in vbs

16909511
easymock	powermockito
i m using powermockito easymock and want to test a class which has a private enum like this

16909512
int	double
if x 4.5 and y 5 and you call method foo x y then your method definition foo double x int y is called

16909512
int	double
and the int is simply type casting double value of 9.5 to its int value which is 9

16909512
int	double
sum of two int is always an int sum of an int and double will return you a double value

16909583

16909702
int	double
it means that even if x and y are double the result x+y will be cast to an int

16909702
int	double
in the method static int foo double x int y x is a double is added to y which is an int

so the method modifies the parent string if found and looks at its children if found and replaces those strings with those found in the method parameters

16909986
getter	setter
if you have getter and setter they also have to follow the same rule

16909990
super	implements
the problem is that you don t have actually have a stuff method on the class so methodsignatureforselector will return nil - it looks like you discovered that and so implements your own version but that fails on the super call and so ends up returning the signature of forwardinvocation - which is not what you want

16910016

16910075
range	median
the easiest fix is to adjust your median element s index initialised to 81 2 on each iteration upward according to how many zeroes you added or just count how many non-zero pixels you used and then find the median mid-way through that range in your sorted array taking account of sort order

16910075

super	implements
if you get a compile error due to the method being private and super not appearing to implements it you can use instead to do exactly the same thing

16913891
superclass	subclassing
since these methods have exactly the same method signature same name return type and arguments none they are considered equal and the runtime always checks the class of the object before looking in superclass so it will find the subclassing method implementation first

width	height
the problem is not only coming from miglayout but also from layouts like scrollpanelayout which assumes that the preferred height will remain the same after a different effective width which is not the preferred width

16923995
width	height
as you will probably use it as a view on a viewport you will have to hack a bit the getpreferredsize of the view if you use it with the scrollable.getscrollabletracksviewportwidth returning true so it doesn t return the real preferred height but the one that matches the width

16923995
width	height
in my code there is a getter for the grid and the grid has a function to return a preferred height for a given width

16923999
for-loop	loops
the other change was to remove the for-loop from the bottom of the while loops and replace it by this works because z and v represent the intersection and you already initialized res to be a two-dimensional list of all the intersections so looping is unnecessary

16927049
getter	setter
type safety is ensured by the setter and getter so it s no worse than the other solution

according to kendo ui support forum - this is expected behaviour when the filtering sorting are applied on the client side because when the new record is created outside the current view it cannot be edited

16928708
sorting	filtering
possible solutions is to enable server sorting filtering or implement custom add record button which first clears the data source current filtering and sort and then add new record using grid api

16928708

my problem is that i cannot control all the images they will use and am looking for a way to set a height in proportion to the original width of the image used

16929137
width	height
what i want is to set a specific height to width proportion of the class .two and just set overflow hidden if the image height is beyond that of the predetermined proportional height of the .two div

16929140
getter	setter
it seems that another disadvantage of having all in the same file is the update regeneration of the entities for example when a new field is added and the getter and setter need to be regenerated

16929156
folder	directory
either make sure that you call your code from the same folder or run path from the command window and check if that directory has been properly added if you did so

fflush	gets
this is why writable files that you never close may lose the last few writesâ the __del__ method never gets called and therefore there s nobody to tell them to fflush and at least on posix the underlying doesn t automatically fflush either.

16929268
atexit	main
if you want something to be cleaned up when the main thread finishes you have to use some kind of close function rather than relying on __del__ and you have to make sure it gets triggered via a with block around the main block of code an atexit function or some other mechanism

16929279
int	boolean
if you need to change some primitive int boolean strings in the parent scope from the view you need it to be an attribute of another object in that scope so the assignment may read

because number 5 is an int between 0 and 4 while is a boolean

16929351
int	boolean
unlike languages like c c++ where int can be considered boolean 0 - false 1 - true for example in c# the condition of an if must be a real boolean

16929374
puts	gets
this basically gets the first element and puts it as a key in my_dict and put the list as the value

16929385
apache	nginx
in fact according to a few stackoverflow posts here here nginx and apache perform better for serving static assets

16929430
children	parent
nested sets are similar to adjacency lists but offer additional operations that can t easily be performed if parent and children only know about their immediate joins via parent column

16929442
sbt	giter8
i started by using the giter8 template created by ymasory to produce a sample build.scala file that supports the checkstyle and pmd commands in the sbt console

16929459
getter	setter
instead you should add setter and getter methods or the properties you want to access

16929462
express	node.js
if node.js isn t an option there s also iis express

16929498

16929631
google-chrome	firefox
my idea is to do that task preferably with firefox or google-chrome

16929642
cpu	irq
the i flag in the status register is initialised to 1 by the cpu reset logic and of course can be modified by the sei and cli program instructions as well as by the cpu itself for example during irq processing

16929642
cpu	irq
by defaulting the i flag to on the cpu begins its reset program execution knowing that the software can initialise the rest of the host system - including support chips such as vias and cias - without the possibility of a spurious irq occurring before the entire system is in a state where they can be handled

16929642
cpu	irq
as an example consider a scenario where the cpu irq vector in rom points to an indirection vector in ram which is initialised to an irq service routine address by the reset code

16929642
cpu	irq
and therefore arguably if the software has to cater for that scenario it s not much more effort to do the same for irq - meaning the defaulting of the i flag to 1 could have been dropped from the cpu initialisation circuitry or alternatively that nmis should be hardwired to be ignored during reset

16929654
width	height
do your styling on the outer div wrapper and set the width and height of the video element to inherit

16929677

margin	height	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this is the last code i made and seems to works i tested it in differents browsers google-chrome ie firefox opera safari but with just 2 divs 1 absolute e 1 not by changing the height and by playing with margin top bottom and top bottom

16929708
int	boolean
the expression is indeed an expression of boolean type while the assignment is int because 0 is int

uilabel	nsstring
you are trying to assign a uilabel instance namelabel1 to another label text which is nsstring

16929734
width	height
i noticed once i hover over the image it is in the correct place but because the image only loads after the javascript ran it is pushing the pointer tag down if the image is of a certain width and height

16929750

16929919
hide	show
i thought of dirty ways of doing this like using hide and show liberally but that doesn t seem wise

16929923
stdout	stderr
my understanding is that lua popen uses popen3 that can subdivide between stdout and stderr

16929973
division	modulo
the modulo will return the remainder of a division

16929975
next	except
everything seems to work except for the remove so i seem to be at a loss for what to look at next and i am too new to javascript or knockout to know if this is a clue if i run ko.applybindings command in the self.deleteitem function i get the update to happen but it does give me an unhandled error

16929990

however stakx linked to bart de smet s blog post on how to get the c# compiler to generate a fault handler

16930074
width	height
information about the rois width height location relative to a point on the image etc is then sent back to the camera in effect telling training the camera firmware where to look for things like barcodes text liquid levels turns on a screw etc

16930074
width	height
the strokethickness and fontsize of the roi s need to keep there original scale but the width and height of the shapes within an roi need to scale with the image this is critical to capture exact pixel locations to transmit to the camera

16930123
gif	png
probably you can think of many yourself but besides csv there are html files pictures png jpg gif archive formats tar zip text files .txt

16930155
jcomponent	bufferedimage
instead either draw on a bufferedimage which is displayed in a jcomponent or jpanel s paintcomponent ... or just draw in paintcomponent ... itself

defaultdict	enumerate
here are a few more hints that can make your code neater but might be too advanced for now enumerate defaultdict list

16930171
copying	overwrite
your overwrite the pointer instead of copying the string into the space you just allocated

16930173
int	chars
you should use sizeof chars instead of sizeof int since it is a string

16930213
multiplying	multiplication
cv multiplying performs element-wise multiplication of two matrices

16930231
entities	entitymanager
a breeze entitymanager listens for changes to any of the entities it holds in cache

i think you can redirect stderr to stdout in the call to popen like this

16930339
accessor	properties
use properties and accessor except in init and dealloc and these problems will tend to go away

16930346
draggable	droppable
you might wanna try jquery sortable or combination of jquery draggable and droppable

i would like to specify 2 variables a string of chars that will be iterated through and an int showing the max length depth of the results

16930523
for-loop	loops
in c# 5.0 .net 4.5 there was a breaking change in relation to closing over foreach loops variable but not to closure over for-loop variable

16930528
multiplying	multiplication
trying to multiplying two vectors together will result in errors since matlab will try to perform a matrix multiplication

16930529
for-loop	loops
if the inner for-loop is a constant number of loops rather than a variable number of loops while the outer loops is a variable number of loops or vice versa the time complexity is o n c where c is a constant which just means o n since big o notation is only concerned with growing factors

16930540
opera	google-chrome

google-chrome seem to read it directly from the system as-is while firefox and ie9 seem to correctly based on that definition identify the color precision color depth of the screen

16930784
width	margin
with a maximum width and using margin 0 auto the list will center in the .left container

16930816
width	height
that way wont get out of the screen in height and width

16930816
width	height
or you can play with the width and the height

16930841

16931077
post	get
but no matter what i do i continue to get the your post appears to contain code that is not properly formatted error message

16931150

i ve tried all kinds of approaches using min height max height but just can t seem to get the intended result

16931158
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter
use mouseenter mouseleave instead of mouseover mouseout

16931158
mouseover	mouseenter
the mouseenter event differs from mouseover in the way it handles event bubbling

16931162
mouseover	mouseout
you will need to bind the mouseover mouseout events when the object gets appended

16931165
rank	max
i ve considered rank and rownum instead of aggregating w max but can t get the logic right

super	extends
and since the declaration of the copy method stipulates that its first parameter should be the super class of t and unlike extends super is exclusive clause so

16931410
for-loop	loops
since this for-loop doesn t handle an index value as in the common the programmer declare and initialize the index i before using this for and then using it inside assuring the value of i raises on each loops by using i++

16931423
getter	setter
private getter setter also make things clearer and establish which things should be seen by other classes and which are only meant to be used inside a single class they are apart of

16931424
getter	setter
furthermore if you make a habit of using getter and setter then later on if you need to add logic to the getting or setting process such as you need to make the value derived from some other new field you already have the methods and won t break any caller s code by making the variable private

16931424
getter	setter
so it s considered best practice to always use getter and setter in java

16931452
roauth	httr
following the suggestion of hadley rather than solving the roauth problem i have switched to using the httr package instead

16931459
toolchain	binutils
you can also switch to a different toolchain using a different binutils and

in checkbox set android button property to the custom_checkbox_design.xml drawable like

16931557
getter	setter
the getter and setter methods eg

16931557
getter	setter	put	get
by using the getter and setter methods and hiding the inner fields by using private you ensure that anyone willing to set or get a field will have to go through the checks that you have put up

i ve already round the double to the closet int so there are no fractions parts what left is a really really long double that far exceeds the largest long long int

16931641
addition	multiplication
it s restricted to addition multiplication and function application which i included to demonstrate that the two comma-separated lists are not a problem

16931671
integer	fractions
you could always promote the fractions part to an integer by multiplying by 10000 then modulating by 10000

int	boolean
a model can have many attributes like boolean values or int

16931901
post	get
i also need that same view to handle a regular form not a model form both displaying the form on get and validating it on post

16931901
post	get
in get for simplicity of the question i will only show the issue with get since post has a different issue it does not work because the form never gets added to the context

16931901
post	get
this can be fixed by creating a mixin view where all these nuances for get and post can be taken care of however i do not feel it is a clean solution

16931927
getter	setter
there is a reason i m not using your getroomname and getroomexits methods - getter and setter methods are unnecessary in python

16931927
getter	setter
it gives you all the flexibility of getter and setter without needing the boilerplate code up front

16931968
for-loop	arrays
so in the above code i am able to get the first name and last name from the list and add them into the arrays similarly how do i get mobile phone number and add into the same arrays and get the result in the displaynames function as it is another for-loop

implements	extends
treeset has another behavior since it implements sortedset this interface extends the set interface

16932034
comparator	comparable
note that the ordering maintained by a sorted set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if the sorted set is to correctly implement the set interface see the comparable interface or comparator interface for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a sorted set performs all element comparisons using its comparator or compare method

16932067
for-loop	arrays
then run a for-loop and pick the object and assign to the arrays

16932082
super	extends
since number extends object and object is a super type of object

16932091
getter	setter
if you ve written no other code at all your user has an instance variable called _name and a setter and a getter called name and setname

16932091
getter	setter
in both cases you re calling the setter and getter

16932091
getter	setter
for a proper wrapping you d need to write actual getter and setter for each property

16932091
getter	setter
create a setter and a getter for a property also called name

16932091
getter	setter
ensure the setter and getter use the instance variable for the property

16938176
min	max
so even for lists of 1000 elements the min and max functions are fastest

16938176
min	max
conclusion even for large lists you are better off using the min and max functions anyway

16938192
for-loop	loops

16938721
128bit	64bit
but because your data can be interpreted as a structure or as a vectorization the data has to be split up into two 64bit chunks which will still have to be in the xmm 0-7 registers because it can be treated as a vectorization but it has to be maximally 64bit long that it can be transferred to a register which is only 64bit wide and would overflow if 128bit were transferred to it

16938736
coalesce	nullif
you could use a combination of nullif and coalesce

ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	idictionary	idictionary	ilist
btw. it seems worth pointing out that the relationship between ienumerable and ilist is somewhat similar to the one between ilookup and idictionary - the former is immutable the latter is not.

16944655
firefox	safari
this doesn t seem to happen in the ie safari or firefox versions i tested with

16945060
equals	icomparable
yes your code will work so long as the keys all implement icomparable and both the keys and values have an equals method that compares what you want it to compare

16945060
icomparer	iequalitycomparer
your method also doesn t provide functionality for custom icomparer or iequalitycomparer objects to be passed in to account for the cases where the object doesn t have a desirable implementation of one of those methods

16945060
equals	gethashcode
a key reason that both this method and your method works is due to the fact that keyvaluepair overrides it s definition of equals and gethashcode to to be based on it s own reference but rather on the key and value it wraps

16945082
subtraction	addition
once you have global instances of account which can be looked up via hashmap you need to actually do the addition and subtraction using the acnt.setbalance methods

16945513
jar	manifest.mf
if you know for sure that the jar built from this project can be launched using java -jar the.jar then it means the meta-inf manifest.mf has a main-class entry you should look in there for the class name

16945604
width	height
i ve tried pinning the width and height and several other things i know to get the height and width to stay the size of the view 320 x 505

16945604

16945747
width	margin
your margin plus the width of the elements and the whitespace between them totals more than 100 which is causing the break

16945764
jhat	hprof
i m not sure there is a way to do this with just command lines to the jvm but you should be able to use hprof to dump the heap and then analyze the dump using jhat to find the large objects and where they were allocated assuming they are still in the heap when hprof dumps it

16945779
inherited	properties
for instance you might need access to a private function or properties you can t do that if you inherited override

pull	push
then the workflow is that i would git pull first then do manual hand merges between the two local repositories and do the necessary git push to r1 and r2 to make each other repo changes appear on the other

ideally what we would like to have is more or less transparent pull push between r1 and r2 remote repositories

16945971
opera	google-chrome
i m happy with how it looks on google-chrome and opera

16946002
google-chrome	firefox
any date that falls within the extend range of dst prior to that change is reporting an incorrect timezone offset in google-chrome and firefox

16946002
google-chrome	firefox
it s like firefox and google-chrome don t pay attention to the fact that dst used to have different days

16946016
prepare	pdostatement	prepare	execute
another good habit is to check for errors after every call to pdo prepare or pdostatement execute

16946065
opera	firefox
you just need to use the version without the -webkit- prefix for ie and opera and -moz- prefix for firefox

16946072

submit	submission
in your case you have multiple submit buttons for the same form but you really aren t submission the form when you upload the image

16946444
client-side	server-side
one last thing to check for in these cases is whether you have values that are only sometimes in the view which will not cause client-side validation they re not in the view but do result in server-side validation issues

16946458
post	get
for example i have a controller that will only allow ajax requests and these must be post and not get

16946458
post	get
so if an end user was to request using get or post using non ajax they should get a response to indicate this is not allowed

16946478
int	double
a small note if you use json because your application is partly in javascript javascript has no 64 bits int but only one number type which is the ieee754 double precision float

16946492
ienumerable	iqueryable
as linq is built on top of ienumerable or iqueryable the same linq operator may have completely different performance characteristics

16946507

16946803
implements	extends
classes designed for inheritance item 17 should rarely implements serializable and interfaces should rarely extends it

16946803
implements	extends
violating this rule places a significant burden on anyone who extends the class or implements the interface

16946803
implements	extends
for example if a class or interface exists primarily to participate in a framework that requires all participants to implements serializable then it makes perfect sense for the class or interface to implements or extends serializable

16946803
implements	extends
if an interface superclass implements it the costs will be forced onto the extends classes

16946970

subtract	add
so we can see from the assembly that the variable subtract add plus in your given code are all pointers and comes from the label of the start point of the function

since the plus add and subtract are all the same type function pointers just like luchian grigore says they are the same

16961834
integer	fractions
my idea is to create a struct which holds the full representation and a processable integer and fractions part

16961834
integer	fractions
and after creating the struct with either only the received binary representation or the integer and fractions values there shall be a function which does the conversion

16961860
int	boolean
since this is an int and not a boolean like the checkbox expects you may have to use the grid events such as cellformatting to read the value from the data source and set the checkbox accordingly but i m not sure

16961860
int	boolean
or if this is an object you could expose the int value as a boolean using another custom property

16961872

children	parent
you an do this very simply by applying a pseudo-selector to the parent element and include the children after it

16961941
width	height
the only way i know how to do it is to explicitly change the height and width in an animation call and not switch classes

16961943
uiview	calayer
the reason for calayer s backgroundfilters doing nothing on uiview is that unfortunately the backgroundfilters property is not supported on layers in ios

16962823
disk	ram
in the code below you can see how i try to allocate all the combinations at ram memory an array instead of writing they to the physical disk so i want to write this code using a logic method and in a better performance way then i want to save all the combinations in the memory first and thats the reason too why i don t want to use a lot of fors the performance

16963085
post	get
using wordpress export to get the custom post types out form the course catalog and import into the main site works but for two problems existing post will not be updated to reflect changes and categories from the course catalog create categories in the main site instead of using the already existing identically named categories

16963118
affinity	processors
use processors affinity for the jvm

16963118
affinity	processors
note you are setting processors affinity for the jvm not the java application

16963146
getter	setter
i would personally recommend encapsulating your access to the dictionary with a separate singleton class that then wraps your dictionary getter and setter something like a repositorystore class

16963167
division	multiplication
in almost any case you can apply a multiplication or division to it and are done

16963186
listview	gridview
lets say i have a listview gridview with each row consisting of an imageview

16963186
width	height
the only solution i could come up with is to add an extra empty view on top of the imageview that matches in height width and use that empty view as the selector

16963201
range	minimum
the damage of these guns at its maximum range is the same at its minimum range

i have a function that works just fine in ie and while in debug mode works fine in google-chrome and firefox

16963328
google-chrome	firefox
it s when the code is not in debug mode where the function does not work in google-chrome and firefox

16963430
range	max
note with regards to on 32 bit sys.maxint for your specific system being the largest number you were correct in a sense since xrange has a limit on the upper bound this doesn t mean python int has a max size though also note that python 3 fixes this with the normal range

16963453
button	checkbox
this contains controls like checkbox textview and two button dismiss validate

16963470

16963581
width	height
the height and the width of the canvas this is 500 500 are differents from its offset scroll and client size

16963581
width	height
so before to draw you need to calculate the ratio 500 150 will be the height coefficient and 500 300 the width one so a will be multiplied by 1.66667 and b will be multiplied by 3.33333

16963581
width	height
same for the old example canvas 300 300 the coefficent are 300 300 1 a width 300 150 2 b height

16963644
cvs	svn
bluej doesn t support git only cvs and subversion svn

create a custom template file for rss feed which contains all queries to pull your required content and rss code

16963716
rss	feed
the code above will override your standard feed so it uses your new custom template file for rss feed

16963719
implements	extends
keyword extends is appropriate for named classes which can implements interfaces in addition to extends classes

16963719
implements	extends
in contrast anonymous classes can either implements an interface or extends a class but not both

16963733
hide	show
i m looking to add a twitter feed into my site that show images posted but rather than click on an image and it takes you to twitter to see the photo i would like to be able to click on a link called view photo and the image reveals itself underneath and then reverse the process by clicking hide photo

16963782
http-get	http-post
if you don t want to use sdk you can simply do http-get or http-post to your calender link based on spec

16963794

16964112
int	double
the widths are positive int not wider than the double significand 53 bits

16964112
int	double
the limits on the int assures that conversion to double is exact and that overflow and underflow are not encountered during the operations used in this problem

16964134
min	max
you can group to get max min creation date

16964134
min	max
min would be the earliest date max the most recent

16964136
google-chrome	firefox
you can write simple scripts or you can use google-chrome s firefox s or ie s developer tools to explore the contents of a database

16964235

problem it is showing icon in mozilla google-chrome and safari but not showing it in ie

16964259
width	height
to locate the source of the problem i changed the width and height of the listview to a fixed 400dp rather than match_parent wrap_content

16964302

int	chars
i am doing some experiments with sqlite with a simple test harness using a single table that contains a chars string key and a single int value

16964484
isnull	nullif
i thought there would be a solution using isnull and nullif together but i just can t quite get that to work and nullif doesn t work in the transformation editor

16964507
pull	push
but i actually never tried that and i would advise against it as it removes the symmetry between push and pull that upstream or simple achieved

16964520
post	get
my understanding of this limitation suggests that you can only send post or get cors requests and these requests may only contain simple headers

16964544
kerberos	ntlm
instead it uses either kerberos or ntlm to authenticate

16964544
kerberos	ntlm
see understanding kerberos and ntlm authentication in sql server connections for details of when each protocol is used

16964630
min	max
so far i managed to generate a two-dimensional array which i have filled with the numbers 0-100 these are max and min of randomly generated numbers in the other array

what i m trying to do is toggle the class of a div to show and hide the content by using a link then change the link text in conjunction to it

16964816
onkeyup	onkeydown
ps i ve also tried several other onkey methods using onkeyup onkeydown and action_up and none of them worked with the nexus one

16964850
disk	ram
then you have methods to clear the cache for ram cache or disk cache or both

16964882
isnull	nullif
i m assuming since you mention isnull nullif you d want to take the same logic for that value being 0 as null so your expression would become

16964899
post	get
as i see from your code you are trying to sign your get call with requesttoken you have to take first an accesstoken then use this accesstoken to sign any get post calls

16964916
put	get
for example when i put #ff1d0a63 i get black or brown totally different colors

16964968
min	max
if expr is greater than or equal to min and expr is less than or equal to max between returns 1 otherwise it returns 0

16964968
min	max
this is equivalent to the expression min expr and expr max if all the arguments are of the same type

16965019
pull	push
i m able to fetch and pull changes from our repository but i can t find an option in intellij where i can specify refspecs for push operations

16965065
put	get
the issue is calling save generates a put request and successfully calls the spring endpoint handler but i get a response code 200 which is what i expect

16965153
post	get
you just need to get an access token through facebook and then you can access a json feed of post through the facebook api

16965175
post	get
when i try and see my app s urlloader http get post calls nothing shows up in charles

16965237
post	get

16965240
rss	feed
i have created a little rss feed application

16965242
children	parent
i feel that it is better design to avoid adding export methods to the nodes themselves cause that means a node is handling multiple responsibilities managing its parent children exporting

16965261
post	put
restkit post not sending object â 1 â put request change headers and save .

16965286
google-chrome	firefox
and its works perfect in google-chrome and firefox but on ie its not working

16965298
getter	setter
then you access them by creating getter and setter

16965298
getter	setter
so if we pull together all the changes i ve talked about-- moving the method variables into fields using getter and setter using useful method signatures using constructors and using a base class instead of a misleading interface we end up with something like this

16965306
getter	setter
is create a getter and setter

16965373
put	get
when every i put an int value on the variable item the answer from the math equation i get an out of bounds exception but when i don t put an int value on item it loops and outputs the same answer for every item i have in the array then moves on to the next answer and does the same thing

16965387
getter	setter
you need to restructure your objects to have proper constuctors and setter getter

16965387
getter	setter
this gives the benefit of protecting all your private variables and forcing other classes to adhere to your classe s contract by only allowing them to access it s inner variables via those setter getter and constructor

16965421
width	height
i also need to make the widget able to change its height and width dynamically

16965516
super	abstract
create an abstract super class for your classes

16965544
haskell	ocaml
ocaml and haskell also use garbage collectors despite static typing and obviously python ruby and other dynamically typed languages rely heavily on garbage collection and heap space

16965557
width	height
i ve tried hiding the overflow and even playing with the height width for page data role but nothing seems to be working

16965588

once the feature is activated you will see debug pop-up dialog and connect to the process

16965737
put	get
what i want is see exactly what the server put in logs when it get a request to execute a php script and run out of memory

16965761
pop-up	dialog
you could use a non-decorated dialog as the pop-up

16965814
google-chrome	safari
this bug is not present in google-chrome ie safari or mobile applications

16965843
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
only google-chrome and the latest verions of opera and firefox support it

16965863
put	get
the standard sql way to do this is to put the dates into a table or subquery and then use left outer join and group by to get the counts

16965865
public	protected
this occurs despite changing the access modifier to both public and protected

16965950
button	checkbox
if you don t give them a name attribute each radio button essentially becomes a one-way checkbox

16966027
jobs	cron
cron jobs is the solution but it is not script it s server based application that runs every given time

16966048
width	height
it s not possible to do animate height and width to auto

16966089
width	height
fixed pixel size on the height width 600px

16966104
post	get
my idea is that when you scroll onto a image post the background auto-dims to be a dark gray so you can see the content better but when you get out of the photo post it goes back to the regular user set color

16966118
getter	setter
i am following mike bostock s pattern for reusable charts - closures with getter setter

16966170
wmic	tasklist
i can use tasklist but it doesn t give me the commandline info that wmic does

16966191
width	height
fixed will always take screen width height as reference it s meant to stick in this area

16966200
pull	push
but a good reason to have a central server is to have an always on place to push code once a feature is completed that other developers can pull from without having to have access to your local machine

16966200
pull	push
if i push to something like bitbucket or github or just an always on server in the office any of the other developers can simply pull the changes i ve made when ever they are next online

16966223
int	chars
i m not aware of any architecture where --counter or counter-- asssuming we re talking about simple datatypes like int chars etc is slower than ++counter or counter++

16966261
ant	maven
yeah yeah i know maven is not supposed to do this and it s better to use ant or gradle for these purposes but we are forced to work with maven and can nothing to do with this

16966277
gridview	entitydatasource	gridview	detailsview	button	checkbox	entitydatasource	detailsview
i have a gridview with a list of items and on checking a checkbox and hitting edit button it sends you to a different view where there is a detailsview that has entitydatasource as it s ds

every writeablebitmap has width and height defined

16966946
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
the debug function is my own it just writes to a textbox in the window but it allows me to see that google-chrome isn t crashing so far. but a debug line at the beginning of processfiledata never gets reached in google-chrome version 27.0.1453.110 even though it works fine in ie firefox and safari

16967014

i want to integrate editable comboboxes and spin entries inside a treeview cells i am using glade 3.6.7 and gtk+ 2.18.9 on linux centos 6.4 x86_64 and coding with eclipse 3.6.1

16967017
int	double
in order to get the int value you need to do a double dereference

16967026
nexus	artifactory
ci builds should always share binaries via a binary repository artifactory or nexus not via a local repository

16967054
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if you re doing the redirect within the httpd.conf i probably also wouldn t add as it could stop other valid redirects within any .htaccess files from working

16967074
linqdatasource	objectdatasource
linqdatasource or objectdatasource what should be the datasourceid for the listview

16967140
min	max
for three items you could use max and min to sort them

16967174
width	height
to work around this we now mimic the behavior of the stock camera app we attempt to find a preferred size from the getsupportedpicturesizes list before falling back to selecting the largest as computed by width height

16967288
google-chrome	firefox
this appears to work well in ie firefox google-chrome for me

16967435
nsurl	nsstring
a quick glance at the header reveals that you should be passing in nsurl instances as the values for the imageurl and sourceurl so once you do that it will no longer complain about trying to invoke absolutestring on an nsstring

pop-up	dialog
if you want to have the dialog pop-up without a link at all you should be able to set it hidden using display none in the css or style attribute and then trigger it via code anyways

16967523
nsurl	nsstring
you need to send nsurl objects not nsstring s for the imageurl and sourceurl

16967545
cpu	processors
was testing and timing some computations was trying to find a for-loop that runs 4 times faster when paralleled with all 4 threads on my processors when i noticed that this one won t run at 100 cpu usage despite the compiler reporting that it was parallelized

16967561
sorting	filtering
plus the grid will have sorting and filtering abilities

16967562
pop-up	dialog
yould could just pop-up a dialog with the progress in there but if you do not want to block the user from using the map then another alternative would be to overlay another layout on top of the map fragment and put the progress bar in that layout

16967826
getter	setter
play seems to have trouble accessing the fields of your model class es it looks like it s not generating getter and setter

16967826
getter	setter
the fairly obvious solution is then to explicitly write your own getter and setter so play can find them no matter what

16967897

directshow renderers display video with directdraw or direct3d surface which stands alone from hosting window and is not interacting with host in a way supposed to get you combined picture with transparent video and something else as well

16967954
integer	unsigned
the reason the compiler chooses the second constructor in case of your a is simple your 10 is a value of signed type int while size_type is some unsigned integer type

16967954
integer	unsigned
this means that 10 has to be converted to that unsigned integer type

16968021

i mean a mutex which at first behaves like a spinlock and only if the lock has still not been obtained after a certain amount of time or retries or any other measuring factors the thread is really put to sleep as mentioned by mecky at when should one use a spinlock instead of mutex

16968206
implements	extends
for example an application can use a dynamic proxy class to create an object that implements multiple arbitrary event listener interfaces interfaces that extends java.util.eventlistener to process a variety of events of different types in a uniform fashion such as by logging all such events to a file

16968215
getter	setter
you write explicit getter and setter as a sane plan for future development

16968215
getter	setter
if you write a getter and setter the compiler will optimize it to be time-equivalent to direct access if that is all it does and you can later change the logic if you need to - without having to change a ton of other code

16968232
getter	setter
that s the main reason of getter and setter even if they are very simple it s better to have it

16968234
getter	setter
on the other hand if you have getter and setter only those 4 functions will have access to the internal representation of your class

16968234
getter	setter
having getter and setter allow you to implement any of those changes without requiring to change the client code

16968262
getter	setter
jsp el has exactly what we need - expressions using getter and setter methods

google-chrome	safari
i found that this runs fine in ie but in google-chrome and safari an error is displayed to the user after debugging for a while i found that the cause for the error was that the ajax call returns after the iframe is removed and google-chrome and safari don t like returning an ajax call to a removed iframe

i want to preserve the state of the radio button checkbox because it ll be very common for the customer to add several of the same type of instrument with the same requested services changing only the serial number and possibly the part number which can be left blank s n is required

16969217
button	checkbox
to refresh the button checkbox states if i don t refresh and the customer just accepts the defaults that show up i actually get a null input instead of what it says in the box so i can re-check the button checkbox for the next instrument they want to enter

you should either use a list containing some custom object that holds both values or use something like multimap from the google collections library which allows you to put the same key multiple times and get returns a collection of values

16969823
int	chars
the confusion here is that you re thinking of strings as a native type in the same way as int and chars

int	chars
â the int argument is converted to an unsigned chars and the resulting chars is writtenâ

16969823
printf	strstr
that s the null-terminated string convention that s baked into functions like printf strstr etc

multiplying	subtract
if upper limit is less than 0 than multiplying it by -1 and then later the result subtract the max.

16970238
int	chars
however pil s font_getchar function which produces that unsigned long only accepts python string and unicode types and since it doesn t seem to do any translation of the chars encodings itself it seemed that the only way to get the correct value for the big5 chars set was to coerce a python unicode chars into the correct unsigned long value by exploiting the fact that u ua7da was stored internally as the int 0xa7da either in 16 bits or 32 bits depending on how you compiled python

16970275

i then pass a reference to this uinavigationcontroller to the sidebar menu which is just a subclass of uiview with a uitableview and this is where the uiviewcontroller are loaded

16970894
keydown	keyup
there is a big mess in how different browsers implement keydown keypress and keyup events even the keycode values in keydown and keyup events are not yet standardized across browsers

16970894
keydown	keyup
the value of pressed key is stored in either keycode or charcode property but never both keycode is always set in the keydown and keyup events charcode is set in the keypress event

16970894

16970894
google-chrome	firefox

16970897
memcpy	strcpy
then also you shouldn t use strcpy or similar functions but memcpy etc

16971168
put	get
i was finally able to get around the problem by using .ajax to make the put request thereby bypassing the whole backbone sync thingy

16971169
int	double
since r is of type int and i k are of type double there maybe comparisons which are theoretically equal but may not evaluate to be so due to floating point precision

16971225
post	get
that part works fine but i m not sure how to actually get the data into my new post dialog when it launches

16971239
folder	directory
the assets folder is read-only and packed so if you want to save any new changed data the only place where you can do this is in the writable directory

16971310
hide	show
i can get it to work using the show and hide methods for the 3 cells that are all in the 2nd table row by assigning each of them the same td class but canâ t figure out how to make the single top row cell clickable so that it will hide the bottom 3 or click any of the bottom 3 and hide the top row cell along with the other 2 from the second row

16971311
for-loop	loops
use i++ in your for-loop statement instead of in loops body like this

16971340
stdio	fflush
if a library routine internal stdio fflush is attempting to grab a lock on a stdio stream in the exiting thread that some other thread is holding it might be possible to get a similar hang even without your own atexit

fast-forward	merge
when git tries to merge commits from another branch it will find the common ancestor from which the current branch and the branch to be merge diverged and it will find that both the current branch and the branch to be merge already moved their heads to a nearer common ancestor so it most probably can be fast-forward if you do not introduce modifications that cause conflicts before merging in upstream master

16975636
hide	show
i asked a question earlier about how to hide and show sql results upon a click using jquery

16975888
width	height
so when this happens i need to query the for the correct filepath update the image width and height fixed width height for each thumbnail size and apply the changes to the entire list of results

16975910
width	height
text area is with height 240px and width 240px

16975966
hide	show
not the code i would write but using your own code here is how you would solve the hide show problem note the addition of this assumes the data has a field called id change this to whatever the actual unique field name is

16975966
hide	show
so what you are doing is giving the hiddendiv a unique id and then passing that same id to the show hide js function so it knows which one to show and hide

16975975
serializable	deserialization
this only works for fully populated objects if you require that any objects composed in your top level object are also serializable then they cannot be null for this test to be valid as serializable deserialization skips the null objects

16976055
post	get
my problem is after adding a few extra date ranges when i get the value it is not showing the appended html element s post values

16976062

note i do have a minimum set to 4 so even when there is one result to y-axis range will be 0-4

16976079
gif	png
even though the demo says upload server currently unavailable you can still recreate the issue by going to the demo and trying to upload a zero byte file must have a jpg gif or png extension since that is all they allow

16976079

- gives height of the element without padding border and margin

16976273
margin	height
- gives height including padding border and margin

16976304
margin	height
in jquery height will give the height without border or padding innerheight gives the height including padding but without border and outerheight gives height with border and padding with the option to include margin as well

16976333
put	get
but java has some origins in c which did the same thing and in the 80 s that decision was explained to me as being because then the compiler could turn the switch into a jump table basically each block of code s address is put in a table and the switch becomes a range check followed by a table lookup usually indexing into an array or at least linked list of arrays using the value you pass in to get the address and then jump to that address

16976373
division	modulo
however you re using maths modulo and integer division to recover the 2d indices from a 1d index based on the array s dimensions

16976382

if width 5 and height 2.

16976411
margin	height
description get the current computed height including padding border and optionally margin

16976412
width	height
in your case using the big image as thumb by specifying width and height the browser already fetched the big image so if you use the big image afterwards it will not be fetched again from your server but from the browser cache

16976412
width	height
if you want to keep your big image as thumb and show the big image when you click on the img -tag you can for example just remove the width and height from your img tag with jquery like this

16976470
post	get
since only post have dates the disqus code will never get rendered on a page

16976489
int	chars
jdk6 switch statement worked on chars byte int primitive data types and enum

16976516
range	minimum
if you put your example inside another div that has a large font-size set you ll notice that you do see a change at the 0.1 - 0.4em range because it evaluates to a reasonable actual font size above the browser s minimum

16976524
vbscript	jscript
its syntax works with vbscript but not with jscript

lodash and underscore.js are both excellent libraries

16977523
width	height
you are using so the function is executed when the dom is ready but not necessarily all the images and such are loaded so height and width info are not available yet when you refresh the page the info is available and you get the desired behavior

16977523
width	height
to overcome this use so the function is executed when everything on the page is fully loaded and info like width and height are available and you should get what you are expecting the first time the page is loaded

16977545
width	height
an alternative would be to use the scaletofit method that requires the width and the height of the rectangle

16977798
vsto	add-in

16977811
qtimer	qthread
a slightly nicer method would be to break up the initialization task into smaller parts -- do 50 milliseconds worth of initialization then if there is still more initialization left to do call qtimer singleshot 0 this slot dosomemore and return from the method such that the dosomemore slot gets called on the next iteration of the qt event loop but in the meantime any other pending signals such as a pleasequitnow type of signal coming in from the main thread which could be connected to the qthread s quit slot would get processed

16978009
width	height
and furthermore you have do define height and width of the element.

16978009
width	height
the problem is that you have to give a height and a width to the wrapping or the span in it otherwise the text does not know where it should get floated

16978009
width	height
if you don t define any width or height the text is just wrapping around the rotated text which is a big rectangle

16978009
width	height
but you could also define the width and height trough js but thats kinda hacky solution i think

16978230
getter	setter
what you can do is use something from the java book and define methods for getter and setter so either function getname and or if you prefer you can use and either set or get depending on the passed in value or you can assign those values in a constructor if you don t care about the laziness part and the only thing you ll do is assign values

post	get
the problem is that because all of these ui elements are always on the page only the values in the first one will get bound to the model on post back

16979571
int	double
so basicaly the biggest number what you can store as an int at least the format is 9999999999999998 which is strange a bit while it should not relate to a decimal reprezentation in fact the bson datatype is a double

16979640
width	height
height of each row must be 27px so i decreased the height and width of my swfloader object to make them fit in each row and also set these atts

you need to define your class as following override object s equals and gethashcode methods

16980614
equals	gethashcode
now union will call your overridden equals and gethashcode methods

16980614
equals	gethashcode
also you should always override gethashcode when you override equals method

and of course this lets you put a semi-colon at the end so ides and you later don t get confused about what it is

16980817
jobs	cron
your more serious concern is that if one of your cron jobs takes a long time to complete and another one starts it could double the load on your server taking twice as long to complete then you could end up in a loop that eventually takes your server down

16980883
installation	upgrade
the only situation where i wouldn t recommend a severe rework of your logic is if this is only related to an automated installation upgrade procedure

sqldependency	sqlcachedependency
edit not sure if sqldependency will work with mysql maybe something like sqlcachedependency could be used instead although to be honest unless you must absolutely have live data a polling solution is nice and easy and more maintainable something like sqldependency is bug ridden and can be a pain to implement

16981132
put	get
enummap is not any kind of hashmap that would use hashing internally to put and get data

16981132
put	get
it uses array to store the pair where k is an enumeration constant and uses ordinal value the position of the enumeration constant in the declaring enum is known as ordinal value internally to put or get data

16981132
put	get
in other words enummap does not use hashing but ordinal values of the enumeration constant as the index to put or get the pair in its internal array

16981188
put	get
in order to get to that variable you d need to put it outside of the function itself

children	parent
if the current child s bottom is lower than his parent take it and all the following children and put them in a new div content

16981265
implements	extends
the reason of this is that while it is exactly known that a category s method always win against a class method that is if you implements a method in a category that s already declared in the class you are extends with the category the method of the category will be called. when you have multiple category implements the same method which implementation takes precedence is undefined

16981272

16981538
width	height
the timing of the orientationchange event with relation to the change of the client height and width is different between browsers though the current implementation will give you the correct value for event.orientation derived from window.orientation

16981538
width	height
this means that if your bindings are dependent on the height and width values you may want to disable orientationchange altogether with .mobile.orientationchangeenabled false to let the fallback resize code trigger your bindings

16981558
width	height
each image has the size in width and height of 80 pixel

16981558

another option is to use the length of one of the arrays in a for-loop which does the same thing but in a different way

16981619
int	double
i would like to avoid having to write a separate function for each type of data i may wish to write int float double etc

visualvm	yourkit	profiler	yourkit	profiler	visualvm
i would say you would want something like a profiler such as visualvm - free and included with the jdk or yourkit

16981971
ilist	icollection
so in your case casting to icollection would work cause clear method is defined in icollection interface not on ilist interface

16982028
superclass	subclassing
array covariance means that if two classes have a subclassing - superclass relationship their arrays also have this relationship

16982049
width	height
your pixelselection needs a width and a height but that s it that doesn t require a bitmap and it would be bad to add an extra dependency if it is not needed

16982183
integer	unsigned
the int d -1 is converted to total_elements-2 type which is sizeof return type an unsigned integer

16982183
integer	unsigned
this is usually done by reinterpreting the bits as an unsigned value -1 signed integer 0xffffffff if int has 32 bits unsigned integer

16982325
maven	pom.xml
i have complex maven project which has a parent folder with parent pom.xml and some subfolders for subprojects each with its own pom.xml

width	height
the new editor creates a style parameter and adds width and height as a style

i know lua is best-in-class for embedding but i want to use scheme or some lisp dialect as scripting language for my c app

16990383
min	max
it s pretty fast for martin s example data but will only work if the factor consists of non-negative integers and will consume memory on the order of the largest integer in the factor vector one obvious improvement to the above is to subtract min from max to decrease memory usage - which can be done in either the r function or the c++ one

16991699
versioning	upgrade
even if you convince your customers to move to sql 2012 you ll have to upgrade the packages to 2008 first and then upgrade again to 2012 so the sooner they agree to upgrade to some newer versioning the better although i appreciate that - rightly or wrongly - many customers will not see the point in paying to upgrade something that still works

margin	height
notice i combined the declarations into a single selector as the css is the same and used half the height to form the margin

mvp	presenter
in mvp you can have a single view working with multiple types of presenter and a single presenter working with different multiple views

16993115

this one changes the unhandled exception to go to stdout rather than stderr but you could add all sorts of handlers in this same style to the logger object

16993399

it will build as many column needed to fit in the height of its container . set a width else it s one line

lombok getter setter

16993521
awt	swing
after searching for this on the internet for a while i read that it is no good mixing swing adn awt but after trying to remove all awt packages from my code i just could not manipulate some simple thins font colors and dimensions without having a awt imported

16993562
google-chrome	firefox
the following code works fine in google-chrome and firefox but ie9 and probably earlier versions ignores the margin-top of the .container making it appear behind the .header sticked to the top of the page

16993778
awt	swing
some classes are shared and swing toolkit is in fact just built on awt ones

16993778
awt	swing
the bad idea is to mix awt and swing elements - for example having an awt.label in a swing.jpanel

16993841

i could write an introduction explanation to priority_queues implementation max min heaps push pop operations etc but that paper has i think really good examples explanations and pictures

16994394

https http through ssl tlc is what you want

16994395

16994631
google-chrome	firefox
for a reason i haven t yet been able to understand when running java inside firefox the locale does not influence the formatting methods but on google-chrome chromium it does which leads to it generating locale-formatted floats 0 0 instead of 0.0 in the brazilian pt_br locale for instance which java can then not parse properly presumably using a locale-independent conversion

as pm.ls returns a list of real objects and not just the names you can safely rename a parent node and still have a valid handle to its children

16994736
children	parent
if you really want to do it in mel you need to either rename from the bottom up or recurse so that you don t ask for the names of children before dealing with the parent

16994736
children	parent
in this way you are guaranteed to never rename a parent before its children

16994783
gif	png
i m trying to get any content with the jpeg | gif | png | pdf extension to redirect from

stdout	stderr
when you do you are saying print to stdout 1 the things that would go to stderr 2

16995472
stdout	stderr
in the examples 1 and 2 you get the output message because it is being printed to stderr as a regular redirection only redirects stdout

16995472
stdout	stderr
and when you do the redirection you are not creating a stderr the processes always have a stderr and a stdout when they are created

the basic difference between swing and awt is that swing apis are purely java libraries they don t at all depend on the native libraries to draw graphical components

16995702
awt	swing
moreover swing components are not inherently thread safe you explicitly have to write synchronized code to manipulate or redraw them whereas awt components can be trusted in a multithreaded environment

16995707

in jquery you d do something like this where copyfn is implemented to do the copy and perform the submit afterwards although you ll have to stop the form automatically submission in the first place this isn t difficult

16996361
post	get
perhaps you may want to send the request as post instead of get which won t use joomla caching

16996443
for-loop	loops
you can translate most for loops to while loops with a simple recipe so if you figure out how to do it with a for-loop then you are good to go

16996453
google-chrome	firefox
different observation in firefox and google-chrome

16996527

for-loop	arrays
also i changed your for-loop as it was set to 5 but you only had 3 items in your arrays

16997095
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
for example say your tab bar controller has 5 tabs each tab having a uinavigationcontroller which has particular uiviewcontroller as root view controllers

16997096
children	parent
you could do this via dom traversal parent children and siblings but i would recommend giving your elements ids so that they can be uniquely identified on the page

16997118
accessor	properties
to do otherwise as you are doing above with bypasses all of the memory management built into the properties accessor

16997203
width	height
you will need to set display block for an a tag to respect height and width values

16997212
folder	directory
also you may need to visit linker - general - additional library directory and add a path to your boost libs folder and possibly its subfolders so that you don t have to specify full path for each library you are adding to dependencies

16997242
groupbox	panel
you would of course need to add support for special cases for other controls than panel and groupbox that can hold other controls image controls and so forth

16997362

however if instead of using qgraphicsscene addpixmap i first create a qgraphicspixmapitem and add it to the scene using qgraphicsscene additem i get a segfault

16997736
post	get
the problem is that you assumed the page request you received was using both get and post methods which is impossible by the definition of the http protocol

16997736
post	get
if you want to make your page to be able to handle both post and get methods equally you could replace all occurrences of _post and _get with _request

16997829
width	height
this works because the method expects getrgb int width int height but you provide height width to it

16997841
wav	ogg
i have a problem converting wav files to ogg using oggenc

16997841
mp3	wav
all my wav files are generated from mpg321 from the mp3 source

you would probably want a map dictionary here in a real-world caching object but i m trying to keep it simple

16997939
puts	gets
but this is easily fixed when a thread gets the special value it puts it again into the queue immediately

16997971

google-chrome	firefox
working like a switch on google-chrome v27. firefox v21. and ie9

16998259
sctp	tcp
a more radical solution but i think the most awesome one is getting rid of tcp altogether and moving to a more powerful protocol sctp

16998262
post	get
you re using get to post a form which creates something in the database

16998263
ssl	https
so if you want to consume expose secure data then you would publish your webservices over https only which basically uses ssl tls internally to communicate to server

16998292
membase	couchbase
i m using the membase mode of couchbase 1.8 now

16998296
post	get
please note that cronjobs post get and rest are 3 different things and they do 3 different things

16998319
folder	directory
within the project directory i have a folder with an external library called boclib which is build by a regular makefile

16998346
128bit	64bit
at some point in the future i predict that 128bit machines will exist but i also guess that this is far into the future since we are currently only able to use 75 of the available bits in 64bit machines for memory addresses size_t relates to memory addressing

16998477
portrait	landscape
if on any smartphone portrait and landscape 2 li per row float left

16998477
google-chrome	firefox
for now i tried and tested it on laptop ie firefox google-chrome by resizing to test how it adjusts seems to work rather ok

16998493
integer	unsigned
however you can safely and portably calculate the exact number of relevant value bits for an unsigned integer type at runtime

16998535
int	double
instead of int class use double

16998542
post	get
this way you would get an email containing all the post variables so you can see which one you need to reference in your _post array

16998573
nsubstitute	moq
now you could use a mocking framework such as moq nsubstitute or rhino.mocks to mock the repository in your unit test and be able to define expectations

16998582
width	height
its contents are run 12 board width board height times

16998593
maven	pom.xml
i think it s not possible to run the copied code without the pom.xml file in the maven project

16998668
for-loop	loops
when you nested loops if you want to break a for-loop you should define target to break so you can you label to solve that

16998687
free	malloc
unfortunately since it s going to be released with a call to free we need to allocate it with malloc even though it s c++ code

16998693
folder	directory
finally you could go to the deployment directory copy the war to a separate folder deflate it and check if its content is as you expected

16998718

it defines generic tuple types for arities from 1 unit to 10 decade and all essential methods like equals hashcode tostring and even compareto

16998785
move	drag
it s because when you drag and move the scrollbar button to scroll the scroll event is called multiple times depending on how fast or slow you do that and during that each time the function you ve specified on scroll event is called computed and executed which may take a few fractions of seconds to complete

16998851
gitolite	gitosis
i ve imported a repo with just copying gitosis bare repo into gitolite

16998881
multiplying	multiplication
integers with more bits are slower to multiplying and a double-width multiplication not expressible in c is slower yet

16998883
width	height
by using layout params you can set the height and width for button

16998949
config	ini
if you are looking at config then use ini or json

16998960
viewdidappear	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear

17012551

17014887
unsigned	short
when you call characteratindex on the nsstring object it returns a unichar unsigned short variable

action-filter	onactionexecuting
should i remove the action-filter s onactionexecuting method and just close my session in the mediatypeformatter

17026728
free	memcpy
if you re talking about actually moving the object you can placement- new at the new address in memory then call the copy constructor or memcpy for a pod but this is pretty iffy depending on what your object holds if it insists on ownership of pointers and when you call placement- delete that memory gets free you re pretty sol

17026734
for-loop	loops
by definition then this is not an infinite loops just use a for-loop instead

17026764

filewriter	bufferedwriter
note you can also use a bufferedwriter and pass it a filewriter in the constructor if that helps at all but i dont think it s necessary in your case

17027404

17028009
folder	directory
here s a screenshot of my application folder s home directory

17028023
integer	unsigned
colors are mostly represented in hex format with popular implementations in the format of 0xaarrggbb or 0xrrggbbaa so 32 bit integers will do unsigned signed doesn t matter the hex value is still the same create a 64 bit variable add all the 32 bit variables together and then divide by the amount of pixels this will get you a quite accurate result for images up to 16384 by 16384 pixels where a 32 bit value is representing the color of one pixel if larger then a 64 bit integer will not be enough

17028073
g++	gcc

onfocus	onblur
strangely enough when i remark out the onfocus event the onblur works as expected alerting the previously-focused div

17031737
onfocus	onblur
i cannot seem to find out why the onblur event fires the same index as the onfocus event

17031748
google-chrome	firefox
but both google-chrome and firefox still appear to be getting old versions of the xml file

cognos upgrade it s versioning from cognos 10.1.1 to cognos 10.2 i have extracted new jar file out of cognos 10.2 sdk and inlcuded in my project everything complied successfully but at run time i got the following exception

17032055
serializable	deserialization
my best guess is the problem arises from the fact that you inherit your vehiclecollection class from observablecollection and that serializable and deserialization have a piece of code in them like if object is observablecollection

17032055
getter	setter	serializable	deserialization
i ve tried your sample solution and the getter of the members is simply not called on serializable nor is the setter called on deserialization

17032065
calloc	malloc
if i use the code the way it is now one as malloc the other as calloc it works as intended

17032148
addition	multiplication
the point of this homework assignment is for the student to implement arbitrary precision integer addition and multiplication in mips and then use it to implement the factorial algorithm

17032194
textarea	textbox
or if you want them on the same line which would only work for a textbox really not a textarea you could float them

17032230
public	protected
you will have access to protected and public properties and methods

17032250
google-chrome	firefox
i why does the console in google-chrome and firefox evaluate the current to 1

17032302
width	height
consider your options for height width of the div and the background-size as well the browsers interpretation of cover for those tags respectively depends on its parent div s and the window size as well

17032345
post	get
i need to say if 5 post in an archive get this footer

17032345

it has some very nice features for sorting filtering etc

17032455
folder	directory
when you create your visual studio s project in sitecore s web root folder and you will keep all sitecore s dlls files inside bin directory don t forget to add to project s references all these files

17032488
int	chars
i have to wonder 1 why you declared message as rather than as and 2 why you re using a string containing the control chars 003 to represent the int value 3

17032488
int	chars
you can certainly represent small int values as single bytes but that would generally use a single chars or unsigned chars object not a string or array

17032552
width	height
in this case width is specified but height isn t yet height jumps around

17032565
hide	show
i wrote a simple show hide script as well that will display the song title and duration of the song then when play is clicked hide that div and display the player

17032565
hide	show
my show hide fn works fine and displays the player but it is not playing the song listed.

17032597
getter	setter
then i use the setter getter by calling

17032612
strdup	malloc
a function can return a pointer to the first element of an array but it s more problematic you either have to malloc the memory like strdup for the array or have a static array like ctime

17032612
free	malloc
malloc gives the problem of having to remember to free the memory memory leaks static means the array changes with each call therefore passing an existing array is easier

17032652
inherited	properties
when dealing with static properties if you want the inherited classes s static properties to differ from the base classes you have to provide a home for it to live in

17032708
packets	pcap
there is a free tool called rawcap that can sniff localhost and save the captured packets in a pcap file

17032711
put	get
basically i get the name of the agent and put caller in that queue

17032731

can i open a request inputstream to tera peta bytes of data and write it to an outputstream byte by byte without any problems ignoring the amount of time it would take and time outs

17032732
hide	show
i m trying to make a button that will show hide a color-selection slider

17032806
getter	setter
i ve left out getter and setter for readability.

17032886
jobs	cron
in case you are using windows you can take a look at this use php to set cron jobs in windows

17032895
textarea	textbox
by default browsers render most form elements textarea textbox buttons etc using os controls or browser controls

17032940
subtract	add
just take the day of month subtract 1 divide by 7 then add 1

17032988
serializable	deserialization
minijson supports both serializable and deserialization to and from strings

17033000
versioning	upgrade
if it s different i change the canvas size and then reinitialize it using kineticjs 1.0 i know there are newer versioning but we re not ready to upgrade

17033003
nsoperationqueue	nsrunloop	nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
you need to ensure that a nsurlconnection s delegate methods will be scheduled on a nsrunloop or a nsoperationqueue

17033012
width	height
if all your table cells are the same dimensions within a given table taking the position obtained from the touchmove event and dividing it by the width and height of the table would give you the answer

17033012
width	height
so if the width of the table is 80 and the height of the table is 100 and the x and y coordinates is 42 and 67 respectively then xindex would yield 1 and yindex would yield 3 meaning the second cell from the left and the forth cell from the top using zero-based indices

17033042
int	chars
you are writing out utf-16 chars codes as int

17033125
hash	salt
you are not using your own salt so for every call salt is automatically generated and salt password is hash

17033125
hash	salt	crypt	salt	crypt	hash
to get the same hash from this password you need to run crypt with exact salt that was generated during first run

17033125
salt	md5
generated salt varies depending on algorithm used for hashing but from your example it s md5 and salt is delimited by first and third dollar sign inclusively

17033169
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
it looks good in google-chrome and safari and fails gracefully in firefox

17033178
hide	show
this way all you need to do is expand out the scores array above rather than creating more and more dom elements to show hide information simply replace it with what you have

17033311
equals	gethashcode
the idea behind gethashcode is that if one knows that two objects have different hash codes one can safely assume that they aren t equals without having to look at them

17033320
rtsp	rtmp
instead it may require another protocol to stream rtmp rtsp mms

17033372
with-statement	continue
you don t need to close the file as it done as soon you leave the context as soon as you continue with your code an the same level as with-statement

17033379
google-chrome	firefox
but the following crash on ie8 works on ie10 firefox and google-chrome

17033395
uitableview	nsindexpath
- uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

17033405
free	malloc
then you only need to call free on the array that you malloc d no need to free the individual floats

17033405
free	malloc
then you will need to perform a free for every malloc as in

17033406
photoshop	fireworks
regardless of the route you take i would resize or edit the original files in a program such as photoshop or fireworks to preserve the integrity of the ui elements

17033411
mouse	keyboard
fake virtual keys that actually represent mouse keys and not keyboard keys

17033418
free	calloc
in this case there should be one call to free for each call to calloc

17033418
free	calloc
edit if you won t be rearranging the pointers to sort the rows in-place for example you can do all of this with just one calloc and one call to free afterwards

17033451
move	drag
if u using ftp select files and drag into domain path folder like htdocs www or you can move using cpanel

17033466
versioning	upgrade
and as loamhoof mentions 0.3.3 is ancient history please upgrade to newer versioning of backbone underscore and jquery

17033475
quicksort	median-of-medians
it s very uncommon to see the median-of-medians algorithm used in quicksort since the constant factor in the o n runtime of the median-of-medians algorithm is so large that it tends to noticeably degrade performance

17033475
quicksort	heapsort
you could also try writing introsort which uses quicksort and switches to a different algorithm usually heapsort if it appears that the algorithm is degenerating

17033485
ssl	https
because our site is ssl i want to format the embed codes to https and change sizes of iframes etc

17033507
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
a general rule is that for each time you call malloc or calloc you will need to do a free call on the returned pointer

17033527
jquery	bootbox
that s not your jquery event callback function anymore but the bootbox callback.

17033536
width	height
i first came to this method to calculate the height of the hidden child but this method has a fundamental flaw if your child s width in some cases is greater than your parent the contents in the child will be wrapped when it is placed inside the parent

17033536
width	height
this method will not calculate the height accurately in that case because an absolutely positioned element has no regard to its parent s width

17033556
debian	linux
i have linux debian wheezy

17033597
post	get
then on the client side you can in this example do an ajax post to ajax my service and get back the jsonresponse

17033629
debian	linux
edit i m doing this in linux on xorg preferably on debian squeeze

17033653
getter	setter
and dont forget to add your getter and setter

17033662
width	height
embed width 20 height 106

17033662
width	height
but after adding this to functions.php and changing the width and height to 100 both i didn t see a difference in the post preview

17033682
versioning	upgrade
in an old versioning of the script i had no problem importing multiple image-galleries on one page but since i upgrade to a newer versioning i m getting the following error i left out the exact path on my server

17033692
pull	push
the issue we are running into is when you commit and push to the develop branch or continuous integration branch since we have multiple teams working on different branches you are bound to run into merge conflicts since you would never pull down from develop prior to pushing

17033753
post	get
i did something similar except i had both get and post use the name instead of the uri

17033753
post	put
if you just want the post put to use the name you should be able to define the hydrate_tags method of your resource

17033784
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
this works fine in web browsers like firefox but in google-chrome and safari i noticed the empty from the first row has a width of 1px and it is breaks the design

17033784
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
looks fine in firefox you have to use google-chrome or safari to see the issue

17033919
scatter	graphing
for each pixel we loop through it looks up the density from plots listed by x coord then y and matches this against an rgb value in colours its basically plotting a colourful scatter graphing

17034000
viewdidappear	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear
viewdidload will not be called again but you can refresh your viewcontroller inside of viewwillappear and viewdidappear

17034006
hide	show
then for the line that you want to draw i would use a uiview because that way you could just use it s hidden property to hide show the line

17034010
getter	setter
it s all about getter setter and annotations

17034010
xstream	jackson
but it is also possible that you may not even be using jackson since this is typical behavior by xml-based tools like jettison and xstream

17034163
versioning	upgrade
also it makes it easy to upgrade to the latest versioning of mono

17034163
versioning	upgrade
now that we are doing all this fun git stuff it is easy enough to upgrade to the latest pre-release versioning of mono any time we want.

17034163
versioning	upgrade
to just upgrade to the latest versioning after the first time building from git

17034268
hide	show
selectively hide or show stuff

17034268
hide	show
you could use this plugin that lets you use shortcodes to hide or show things for mobile desktop

17034268
hide	show
anyway if you use the functions you can hide show at the template level not just the edit window level

17034301
hash	salt
storing the unique salt used for the particular user along with the user s hash password is a very acceptable approach that probably not used nearly as widely as it should be

17034301
hash	salt
to confuse anyone who may get direct access to the user table of your database consider storing both the salt and the hash in the same field of your database

17034301
hash	salt
use a character that won t be a part of your salt or your hash such as a colon to separate them

17034328
width	height
the 70 percentages are for example they are the width and height of the background size change them as they suit you

17034333
getter	setter
remember to create getter and setter because jackson needs it

17034341
versioning	upgrade
i ve confirmed it s due to the control library upgrade as no code has changed on this form since upgrading and using source control to revert to the prior versioning re-enables the horizontal scroll bar

17034392
for-loop	loops
now i know how to add this up using a for-loop but the course has not even gone into loops yet so if i use loops i might lose marks

17034449
implements	extends
public class mainactivity extends activity implements onclicklistener

17034459
freeglut	glew
you can download freeglut glew and the opengl examples and build them with vs 2012 i just did it this week

17034504
int	double
this means you don t have to explicitly write the same code to handle int double int int double int double double etc

17034522
button	checkbox
i am trying to make a simple checkbox list where i can select my candidates press a button to insert them to database

17034529
margin	height
height does not include padding margin or border

17034579
google-chrome	safari
i tried appending to document.head with a one-line approach -- worked in ie 10 and google-chrome but not in safari

17034609
google-chrome	safari
appending the style details worked in google-chrome ie 10 and safari

17034636
int	double
however convert.todouble will check the type and handle this case then convert the resulting int value to a double without an exception

17034655
setinterval	settimeout
using setinterval and settimeout the application became more performant

17034661
comparator	comparable
this question deals with generics and using the comparable and comparator interfaces

17034676
maven	pom.xml
you can put system properties inside the pom.xml but it is usually better to put them in the maven invocation

17034724
for-loop	arrays
i m thinking of turning posx into an arrays and adding a for-loop to it

17034737
gmail	hotmail
after clicking the send button i want a pop up to come up and select which mail client u want to use dependent on what client app you installed gmail hotmail yahoo etc

17034742
uiview	calayer
since here self.plane is a custom calayer as opposed to the layer backing a uiview it will not respect the parameters of uiview animatewithduration

17034792
post	put
i guess the reason you want to do this is also the reason this isn t allowed which is for a site or app to put marketing text into the post made by users from about the site

17034795
width	height
whereby the css defines the width at 100 and the height is assigned by js code

17034815
16-bit	64bit
a read only needs a read a write needs a read-modify-write the farther away from the memory requiring the read modify write the longer it takes the slower it is no matter what the read-modify-write cant be any faster than the read alone so the read will be faster the trimming of bits off the read generally wont take any time so reading a byte compared to reading 16-bit or 32 or 64bit from the same location so long as the busses and destination are that width all the way take the same time from the same location in general or should

17034815
16-bit	64bit
say worst case if you want to read 16-bit such that 8 bits are in one 64bit location and the other 8 in the next 64bit location you need to read 128 bits to satisfy that 16 bit read

17034815
16-bit	64bit
a painful case would be reading say 16-bit unaligned such that not only do they cross over a 64bit memory width boundary but the cross over a cache line boundary such that two cache lines have to be read instead of reading 128 bits that might mean 256 or 512 or 1024 bits have to be read just to get your 16

17034815
16-bit	64bit
unaligned reads across one of these boundaries like the 16-bit across two 64bit words costs you an extra read 2r vs 1r

17034833
unsigned	short
short answer is as long as they are the same rank size a signed is implicitly typecast to unsigned

17034840
border-color	background-color
note for privacy reasons browsers strictly limit the styles you can apply using an element selected by this pseudo-class only color background-color border-color border-bottom-color border-left-color border-right-color border-top-color outline-color column-rule-color fill and stroke

17034868
for-loop	arrays
you could use a for-loop if instead of creating five separate arrays you created an arrays of arrays

17034879
jboss	glassfish
no tomcat jetty jboss or glassfish is pretty much mandatory

17034880
for-loop	arrays
you can use a for-loop if you store all your strings in a single arrays

17034892
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
objectoutputstream and objectinputstream keep read and written objects in memory

17034904
draggable	droppable
however inside of a function that gets called due to an event in a directive jquery draggable and droppable event fires when an element is dropped the resource will not fire a request

17034913
lzo	snappy
it is better to use block compression with snappy or lzo along with sequence file format

17034935
hash	salt
no need to try to store a hash and salt as parseable strings because the salt and the has are all one string that can be passed in as is for comparison operations

17034976
versioning	upgrade
at 10 30 the site is upgrade to versioning 4b571377

17035005
put	get
we can do that either using get and put functions or by converting the mat data into a primitive java type such as arrays

17035027
opera	safari
i have tested this on all other browsers and it works fine webkit mobile dolphin mobile safari pc safari mac ie10 pc opera pc nightly pc .

17035034
post	get
an actionlink is a great way to use progressive enhancement because of course there is also a delete action with get and post methods to perform the delete for those with javascript disabled

17035034
post	get
the other option would be to use the actionlink onbegin method to wrap the button in a form but the unobtrusive ajax library does not seem to pass any reference to the element causing the ajax get post foolishly in my opinion - you can upvote this issue on codeplex

17035041
int	boolean
the other glaring issue is that i am trying to return int when the username is a string and the active and admin flags are boolean

17035060
dictionary	map
how can i use a dictionary to map these types of units

17035064
post	get
additionally when you set the action contact.php for testing you re using a post and your ajax call is a get

17035081
put	get
when i put this in my public_html .htacess i get

17035091
rss	feed
so the above would exist as three rss posts within the rss feed

17035097
int	chars
as you have written ptr is a pointer to a function that returns int and takes as an argument a pointer to an array of chars

17035106
google-chrome	firefox
i get security warnings from firefox and google-chrome

17035152
oncreate	setcontentview
dr if i start my traceview after oncreate s setcontentview it takes 2110 msec less time to load my activity than if i put it before setcontentview

17039108
libpcap	wireshark
note by the way that if your goal is to support monitor mode on ndis devices you are very strongly advised to implement the apis that already exist in libpcap for monitor mode the pcap_create pcap_activate apis for opening a device the pcap_set_rfmon api for requesting monitor mode and the pcap_can_set_rfmon api for checking whether monitor mode can be turned on as those apis are what programs such as tcpdump and wireshark expect

hide	show
to add hiding functionality to hide all rather than just hide the sibling div s when showing another unfortunately requires a link to trigger a hash-change in order to stop the target selector matching the div s which in turn requires a link either in each of the div s to show or elsewhere in the document either linking elswhere as follows

17042570
width	margin
but i think a solution might be to have a static width on the inner-content so for example the content that is mis-aligning itself which i think is your footertable - apply margin 0 auto to it to centre align it this is assuming it s parent is 100 width which i believe it is

int	chars
eof is negative but i haven t found a mandate that to_int_type has to non-negative values it isn t in 21.2.3.1 and i see no way to deduce it from other constraints but i wonder if i miss something as my expectation was that to_int_type c had to be equivalent to int unsigned chars c -- it is the case for the gnu standard c++ library and i somewhat expect to get the same behavior as in c where functions taking or returning chars in int return non-negative values for characters.

17042947

min and max are also a handy way to bind

when the user clicks on the parent component it receives the focus but then also one of its children gets it which i m not interested in occurring

17043884

17043921
matplotlib	scipy
i am only familiar with the usual matplotlib and scipy libraries.

in other words for your listeners to be able to receive notification that the property has changed they must add their propertychangelistener to abstractmodel and your backgroundthread class must have a method for doing this

17043963
propertychangelistener	listeners
your code proves that my assumptions are in fact correct that you are adding a propertychangelistener to the wrong propertychangesupport object so that the notification in the swingworker -- which never has a propertychangelistener assigned to its support -- will have no effect on the listeners which have been added to the abstractmodel s suport object

rss	feed
some quick testing confirms that the front-page rss feed in drupal 7 does not utilize the views-view-rss.tpl.php or views-view-row-rss.tpl.php

17050486
rss	feed
i am aware of the ability to create a custom rss feed via the views module

17050486

build.gradle	gradlew
the target project is and i succeeded to build it using gradlew but if i naively add apply plugin checkstyle to my build.gradle

17050675
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you probably want to put the in the viewwillappear method instead of the viewdidload method

17050682
mouse	keyboard
however since the widgets are hidden they do not respond to mouse or keyboard events

17050733
folder	directory
instead if the images folder is at the same directory level as your php script all you will need to do is

17050849
ubuntu	linux
i am on a linux ubuntu machine

17050878
folder	directory
in netbeans i then set up the include directory under the source files + header files properties to include all necessary files and folder

17050899
int	double
the only times when this is different is if you are storing primitives like int double float etc. or if you reconstruct the object you have received from the hashmap

17050906
int	double
this only gets you to c functions and primitive types pointer uint int double float and thats about it

17050918
mouse	keyboard
here s a list of the mouse keyboard focus related properties you might find useful

17050921
ember.js	backbone.js
i m wondering if anyone has tried to use backbone.js angular or ember.js with d3 and if so which one seems like the best fit for a front end mv framework

17050948
children	parent
reshaping your data frame and calling functions once on that data frame instead of repeatedly within your for-loop both help a very little bit but your real time-saver is going to be assigning children to parent within the call to newxmlnode

17050989
google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome but not in firefox

17050992
realloc	malloc
after allocating memory for you overwrite the returned pointer with strauth which i don t know what it is but probably a string which was not allocated using malloc or one of its relatives like realloc

17050995
free	malloc	free	strdup	strdup	malloc
if you want to allocate memory by standard malloc or strdup then it is a good idea to stick to standard free for freeing it

17051076
thin	webrick
while the server thin webrick is running i m editing files in my host

17051086
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stderr to stdout as you have in your own example

google-chrome	firefox
i ve been using the jquery ui datepicker as an event calendar and it works great in firefox and google-chrome

17051105
width	height
too and make the width and height of it 100

17051110
postgresql	mysql
two weeks ago we migrated our database from a postgresql instance hosted on the web server to a mysql instance hosted on amazon rds

17051181
free	malloc
so if strauth is some string literal or something not malloc d then a call to free would indeed fail

17051181
free	malloc
so you need to decide if you want to stick pointers to constant strings in your array and donâ t malloc or free or if you want to malloc free and then copy your strings into the array

17051181
free	malloc
g_malloc and g_free are more than just wrappers around free and malloc and so you should use them as such.

17051189
range	minimum	range	min
i was thinking to get the cell location of the minimum value in a range -- address of min array -- and then offset that cell one less than the number of rows it is from the top -- - row +1

17051189
range	minimum
its works fine if i explicitely give the location of the minimum cell in the range i am looking

17051215
folder	directory
how am i supposed to transfer a subversion directory and take care of those .svn folder

17051218
width	height
the exception you are getting is because of the minimum width and height size that you have define for your widget in widget info xml is too much for this device

17051222
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
works in google-chrome and safari as well as firefox not sure about ie doesn t work on opera 12 but will work in opera 15 since same engine as google-chrome

17051243
httpconnection	downloading
but if i try to downloading the xml using httpconnection it only downloading the half and skips the root element and some attributes in the beginning and at the end

17051245
implements	extends
this requires you to implements a class extends isamplegrabbercb

17051250
opensuse	debian
this is tested with opensuse debian and windows 7

17051287
onresume	onpause
onresume is the right place to register your listener and onpause is the right place to unregister it so that battery life is optimised

17051340
required	placeholder
if your query ever grows to required additional parameters which i assume they will you can simply add additional param placeholder in the query and bind the value with the bindparam method as shown

17051344
width	height
i have tried different combinations of width and height for example r -w 600 -h 400 plot 1 without success

17051392
put	get
my last option would turn execute into a resource like i am creating a new execution but that doesn t feel right because it is not like i am going to have get put delete verbs on it

17051404
int	double
i am making a tree essentially a prefix tree but for numbers not strings which is built from sorted list of tuples of numbers 1 1 2 1 2 5 2 1 0 etc... each one associated with a single scalar value int or double most likely

17051432
rss	feed
once you have identified your themes you ll need to find the template files utilized by the rss feed

17051432
rss	feed
most commonly rss feed are adjusted via views-view-ros-rss.tpl.php or views-view-rss.tpl.php

17051440
tapestry	struts
one of the most expressive els available today and widely used with webwork struts 2 and tapestry

17051462
mouseleave	mouseenter
so to solve this problem i used mouseenter and mouseleave event

17051492
put	get
if you want to ensure that you don t get this same blue glow on any of your other form inputs you could instead put this somewhere near the top of your css file

17051527
put	get
however if i put this into the data browser i get results

17051537
aggregate-functions	sum
having an aggregate-functions like sum in your select clause would normally cause only one row to be outputted containing the total from all rows matched by the where clause

17051538
put	get
but you can get more elegant design if you put your search action as well as other iterations processings into the base class as a virtual method and implement it in branchnode and leafnode the implementations would be different

17051553
button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
to add a little button such as linkbutton and button by default will cause postbacks but other input items like checkbox and dropdownlistfor do not be default

17051594
width	height
so that the container of the the has a width and height of 100 behaves as if it has nothing inside it

17051613
google-chrome	firefox
on the header nav and footer gets rid of the unwanted browser additions this only works in google-chrome and firefox in ie you still have to select no headers i have a border 0

17051613
width	height
finally i put a width and height on the container div similar to the size of a standard 8.5 x 11 piece of paper

17051623
spaces	delimiter
i would like to split up a string using a spaces as my delimiter but if there are multiple words enclosed in double or single quotes then i would like them to be returned as one item

17051666
translation	localization
the second line specifies which resource localization to load - which will contain your translation content

17051674
range	infinity
range without arguments creates a list from 2 to infinity

17051680
children	parent
i based my approach for this off of this very helpful link mikesdotnetting.com article 57 â but taylored it to be for many parent with many children

17051719
google-chrome	firefox
it works on the latest firefox google-chrome and ie10 but it doesn t work on ie8

17051731
folder	directory
so step two is to find your temporary .net folder in the windows directory

17051779
equals	tostring
tostring is one of the few methods like equals hashcode etc. that gets called implicitly under certain programmatic situations like just naming a few

17051786
free	malloc
a similar approach for testing would be to use stack versions of the buffer that are longer than the input you expect and use them like the malloc buffers of course don t free them and see what difference this makes

17051868
boost	allocator
also an interesting read are the allocator that come with boost interprocess

17051876
stdout	stderr
it pumps at same time and stdout and stderr in almost correct order

17051882
hide	show
and then if you need something to show or hide later you nest that in a qwidget and you show and hide that widget to adjust when it is visible

17051962
google-chrome	firefox
if my initial browser is google-chrome or firefox - no problem

17051975
post	get
most search engine use get and not post

17051999
put	get
and finally the php code you must put this line php before any other output else you will get a warning and the ajax call will fail

17052064
getter	setter
create a wrapper class which contains one getter and setter corresponding to the field you want and ignore all the other properties as follows

17052093
button	checkbox
you may just scrap the textbox just use the button i mean a button-looking checkbox with ownerdraw or bitmaps

17052107
width	height
if you weren t just using the div to solve the image map scaling problem you could put a blank image a completely transparent .gif or .png in your div with the image map applied to it and set its width and height to 100

17052126
google-chrome	firefox
the div with z-index set in its class does not stack as expected in google-chrome 27 windows 7 ...it works well in firefox 21

17052185
udp	tcp
routing udp packets as well as tcp is not the task you should solve in your code it is performed by routers

17052241
width	height
landscape rectangle width height

17052241
width	height
portrait rectangle width height

17052241
width	height
if we call the height h as marked on the diagram and the width b as previous then simple trigonometry states that

17052308
width	height
you need to give your body a 100 width and your height a 100 and set your display to block

17052379
public	protected
i ve tried your code snippet and it works fine for me fine with public properties but if i change the property protection to protected or private

17052380
versioning	upgrade
in versioning 1.1.1 of matplotlib the program was working okay however when i upgrade to 1.2.1 of matplotlib i started to notice my plot is getting squashed to the left by the color bar as seen in the attached images

17052385
rdf	owl
don t query rdf or owl with xpath

17052385
rdf	owl
it s a very bad idea to try to work with rdf as xml and hence the rdf serialization of an owl ontology and the reason for that is very simple the same rdf graph can be serialized as lots of different xml documents

17052385
rdf	owl
this is the same rdf graph and thus the same owl ontology

17052386
profiler	visualvm
to see what s really being allocated in your program and what references are hanging around run your program through a profiler like visualvm

17052388
width	height
so the example of my-class-2-6 would target the start of the class name my-class-2 giving a width 50 and target the end of the class name -6 which would give a height 16.666666666666668

17052394
kde	gnome
if it s a gnome or kde flavor you ll need to find out those respective desktop environments run things when a user logs in

17052396
codeigniter	fuelphp
all of it is similar to codeigniter or fuelphp and any number of other frameworks but we wanted something specific to our needs and decided to go from scratch borrowing and modifying some libraries from the above

17052399
for-loop	loops
you can complete your parsing by adding another loops within your for-loop

17052409
client-side	server-side
the uncommented would surely not work because the client-side control doesn t have the same id as the server-side one

17052431
google-chrome	firefox
actually no matter what accented string i use in my json it s always sent incorrectly i ve tested in firefox and google-chrome both latest versions - i can see the request data wrong in google-chrome devtools firebug

17052473
build.gradle	gradlew
my app contains also a build.gradle file however i can t reference dependencies from other folders because they are in the parent folder and this afaik can t be done with gradlew

17052493
min	max
in this case however they want a random function that just looks like different lumps and pits or hills and valleys as the context might suggest so they choose random terms from the fourier series between min and max and set their coefficients to 1 and conceptually 0 otherwise

17052498
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade my versioning of the apache commons.daemon library and that did the trick

17052515
for-loop	arrays
so far every time i open a new window this one is added to the arrays i ve been using a for-loop to see if the user and id is already in the arrays but i don t actually know how to structure my code because there is no way to check at the first time if the user is in the arrays because the arrays is empty i will appreciate if you guys know how i could achieve this i know my code is not the best all this is for my learning purposes so i accept all kind of tips

17052575
128bit	64bit
use decimal instead 64bit vs 128bit

17052576
fadein	fadeout
but i would like it to fadein and fadeout instead of just appearing on .mouseenter

17052615
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop before it assigns the first_element_array to the first 4 slots in the arrays then converts that to a string

17052625
for-loop	loops
however on the first run through the code although it by-passes the if loops as it should it throws an error on the final line in the for-loop

17052631
post	get
user_photos only allows you to see photos using get and does not allow you to post a photo

17052658
int	double
numbers int double bigdecimal etc are parsed automatically and do not need special validation

17052687
pop-up	dialog
when i hit the button a modal dialog pop-up i fill the form with the requested information then i save

17052713
width	height
the large superview textview is constrained to a specific width and height in ib with constraints

17052721
folder	directory
anyway if for some reason you want to revert this functionality you could try adding an old version of the django contrib admin directory to your project folder and then it will use the old admin

17052730
inherited	properties
however iflexmembershipuser does not have my adminaccount properties only my class that inherited from iflexmembershipuser has that

17052758
width	height
changing the width to the double seems to have doubled both height and width to the double

17052794
client-side	server-side
even later one is better off validating both client-side and server-side imo

17052794
client-side	server-side
there are many ways client-side validation can fail both innocent and malicious and even if that weren t the case it is nice to be able to reuse server-side code without worrying about all the validation being gone because it was located in client-side java script

17052811
strcpy	strncpy
you are also assigning string literals to name and address which could come back to bit you later on you may also want to consider dynamically allocating space for those variables and copying using something like strcpy or strncpy

17052840
width	height
you could also write a if statement that sets the width and height of your uitextfield depending on the length of the text that is entered

17052874
subtraction	addition
i am trying to print an integer value addition and subtraction but my output is some random digits

17052927

i recomend you use a jquery plugin like autocomplete or typeahead from twitter bootstrap

17053060
hide	show
i want to hide show a rdl parameter from c# code based on condition

17053063
implements	extends
and then another class that extends the abstract class and implements its own version of foo -

17053100
public	protected
must not use a less restrictive access modifier can make protected to public but not private

17053111
free	malloc
by rereading the question i notice that you have also tried allocating from the heap using malloc so it does not seem to be because the array has gone out of scope unless you called free before the callback was called

17053140
air	flashdevelop
running air 3.7 flashdevelop 4.4.2 windows 7

17053149
devise	cancan
i have a rails application built on top of the devise cancan bootstrap repo

17053152
inherited	properties
the reason we get this post-instantiated behavior is because js inherited actually operates on a lookup process where any method call runs up the chain of instances and their constructor prototype properties until it finds the method called or quits

17053158
highcharts	highstock
using the highstock highcharts library

17053174
client-side	server-side
in contemplating my next asp.net site where i am going to be dynamically generating href-laden html to display i am unsure as to which approach to take -- i don t know yet wheter i will use ajax and json calling server-side code from jquery in a .cshtml file to return json or simply use jquery to generate the html client-side

17053213
width	height
to make it worse if the circle size changes the radial stops will not change unless i use some kind of converter based on the circle width height

17053226
mathml	mathjax
when i load the page the first time if runs the mathjax script and displays all the mathml perfectly

17053289

2 i m using a listactivity and providing the textview and array of strings for the arrayadapter #3 but for some reason i still need line #4 otherwise the list items are blank

17053293
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox will always perform a round-trip to the server asking for the current resource no matter what parameter you pass to .reload

17053293
post	get
the parameter was originally introduced to force post requests be repeated as get requests - this has nothing to do with caching

17053307
pandas	pytables
i d also be happy with any pointers to code in pandas pytables where i can start digging deeper myself

17053308
dllmain	getprocaddress
from within your dllmain use loadlibrarya to get the hmodule of the library containing the api you want to hook user32.dll and pass it to getprocaddress together with the name of the api you want to hook messagebeep to get the address of the api itself

17053330
width	height
if that s happening i m assuming your textview resource must be set to wrap_content for both height width which would mean the only touchable area is where the actual text is

17053402
portrait	landscape
i am not talking about portrait vs landscape view detection

17053402
accelerometer	gyroscope
i am new to ios development and i think what i am looking for is the accelerometer specifically the pitch property perhaps or gyroscope

google-chrome	firefox
that question was specific to webkit but i have tested this in webkit google-chrome ie and firefox and get the same results in each browser which puzzles me

17053666
for-loop	loops
this shows that the normal flow of the if statement is standard but under certain conditions the if statement was exited early -- much like using last or next in a while or for-loop to exit loops

17053677
width	height
if document.getelementbyid test .innerhtml iframe width 560 height 315 frameborder 0 allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen src iframe

fiddle that must be viewed in google-chrome or firefox ie cors failure

17053764
min	max
and i d like to get a know the max min and mean salaries by paybasis

17053777
express	node.js
i m now learning node.js and express and want to use mysql module to render multiple unique pages so instead of writing out line on every file located under routes directory i m sure it s better off to just call my own mysql config file on each routing file

17053788
hide	show
depending on what data the user is viewing the viewcontroller will either show or hide the headerview

17053931
uicontrol	uibutton	uilabel	uibutton
for that i would either create my own custom button by extending uicontrol or add a uilabel and set it s frame as opposed to using uibutton s settitle forstate and add it as a subview of the button

17054040
g++	gcc
all of the paths embedded in gcc and g++ have references to the path in the virtual file system

17054052
int	double
also you are using an int float and double all in one equation and then casting all of that to a decimal

17054076

17054492
viewdidappear	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear
second initwithnibname is not the proper method for adding subviews to the controller s view for that you should use viewwillappear viewdidappear or viewdidload

17054492
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
third what you are doing is not changing of view controllers is simply adding a view controller s view to another view controller view for changing uiviewcontroller you should use addchildviewcontroller and removefromparentviewcontroller methods or use uinavigationcontroller

my objective is to create panels to hold this objects and keep them in order but this panel cannot exceed a width of 300 pixels or a height of 600 pixels so i have to fit as many objects as i can within this panel and if they don t fit then i need to create a new panel until there are no more items to append

what can be the best way to generate a unique same salt value every time for the given string so when i hash the value i get the same output back to help me search with the hash value

17055222
hash	salt
to make this hash column more secure we thought of adding a salt to it

17055222
hash	salt
and since salt should be random we will not be able to generate same hash function every time for same value unless we use the same salt for all rows

17055226

finally set your string s width and height

17055264

17055336
versioning	upgrade
this seems to be a known issue and as far as i can tell the official response from microsoft is upgrade to a newer versioning of .net

17055615
width	height
each cell node has the same height and width

17055615
min	max	width	height
to ensure that each cell node has the same height and width you can listen to the height and width properties of the gridpane and on change set the min max preferred sizes of the child elements so that they all have the same size

17055615
min	max	width	height
the color swatches themselves don t necessarily maintain the same height width ratio but you could easily achieve that by setting appropriate min max preferred sizes on the child elements

17055615
min	max
as an alternative to using change listeners and setting min max preferred sizes on children you could implement your own layout manager by subclassing pane to create a uniformgrid class and implementing the layoutchildren method

hash	md5
key to this process is using a calculated md5 hash and byte counts to determine on the host side if the complete file was delivered

17061196
hash	md5
for example if the client sends 1mb but the host only gets 500kb and the md5 hash sent from the client does not match the md5 calculated by the host based on the bytes received we set the status of the upload data record to imcomplete and store the byte count

17061196
hash	md5
the client app then takes this information from getstatusoflastupload and calls resumeupload sending an md5 hash of the complete file and the remaining bytes that the host needs

17061196
hash	md5
the host again on receiving this combines the bytes and calculates the md5 hash comparing that to the value sent by the client

to do that you have to download sqoop and the appropriate connector microsoft sql server connector for hadoop in your case

int	double
the int value or long in indexes are stored as double in mongodb which i guess is 8 bytes

17066936
children	parent
i feel that would work best if the divs in question aren t arranged in a way that other selector patterns would match better for example css3 supports quite a few structural pseudo-class selectors that weren t previously available so if the divs with child class1 elements to be styled are in a predictable order predictable locations amongst the children of their parent element s you could perhaps use nth-child or one of the related pseudo-classes to select the necessary divs

if you are talking about the kind of snapshots built in to a copy-on-write filesystems like btrfs or zfs then write requests on snapshots just work as a side effect of how the filesystems works when new data are written they are written to a new location and new metadata are written to reflect this

17075151

also if a user installs your free app to a device that does not support iab3 then you can have your app detect that and provide a link to the paid versioning for them to install as an alternate to iab3 upgrade path when they signal to the app that they are ready to upgrade

17075276
versioning	upgrade
if you decide to retain your paid versioning then you can just add in-app billing to your free versioning to enable the upgrade to your paid feature set

17075276
versioning	upgrade
finally i would not worry too much about splitting your installs between two apks because the free versioning will probably get the lion s share of those simply due to the ease with which it can be installed and tried so long as the iab upgrade process is seamless

in my experience it is standard practice for custom mallocs and frees to be named uniquely such as the kernel malloc kmalloc and kernel free kfree

17075904

in my opinion this is the route you should take so i wouldn t be too hasty to dispose of the built in malloc and free functions unless you have good reason or strong desire to do so

put	get	post	get	post	put
within the controller you add methods prefixed with an http verb get post put delete

17076407
put	get	post	get	post	put
there are very few reasons why you d want to use the same code for both get and post let alone put patch delete and options too - generally this reveals some bad design - but if you really do then you can use the any prefix for actions that respond to any verb.

varint is some form of integer but could be signed unsigned or zigzag which allows negative numbers of small magnitude to be cheaply encoded and could be intended to represent any width of data 64 bit 32 bit etc

17082583
integer	unsigned	floating-point	integer
32-bit could be an integer but could be signed or unsigned - or it could be a 32-bit floating-point number

17082583
integer	unsigned	floating-point	integer
64-bit could be an integer but could be signed or unsigned - or it could be a 64-bit floating-point number

17082583

pull	push
options for add merge push pull

17082821
pull	push
this option is only valid for add merge push and pull

17082842
int	chars
it means that when you assign chars to chars array they go to memory in same order but when you read that memory as int it goes to processor register in reverse order

17082842
int	chars
sorry the same but in reverse order you initialize int with abc multi-character literal which goes from processor register to memory in reverse order and as chars array it becomes cba

17082844
serializable	deserialization
check storable for any kind of perl data serializable deserialization

17083049
filtering	grouping
grouping by name and filtering out the rows using having

17083084
cos	sin
having seen that you want to integrate stuff like sum a sin bx+c n cos dx+e m for different coefficients for the a b c d e m n i suggest doing all of those analytically

17083084
cos	sin
another thing i noted when checking those functions a bit better is that sin a x+pi 2 and sin a x+pi and stuff like that can be rewritten to cos or sin in a way that removes the pi 2 or pi

17083084
cos	sin
if you had the formulas in a way which didnt involve a massive txtfile or so id check what the most general formula is that you need to integrate but i guess its something like a sin n bx+c cos m dx+e with m and n being 0 1 or 2 and those things can be simplified into something which can be analytically integrated

17083199
post	get
i am trying to do the following to get my post

17083219
equals	gethashcode
anonymous types correctly override equals and gethashcode methods but the implementation of these methods relies in turn on equals and gethashcode methods implemented for the types of the properties defined for this object

17083219
equals	gethashcode
the implementation of equals and gethashcode of this anonymous object will call equals and gethashcode of the type int since property a is of type int and the type string since property b is of type string

17083219
equals	gethashcode
to correctly work as key in dictionaries hash-tables gethashcode and equals methods of object s have to be correctly defined

17083223

ubuntu	linux
for that you have to install ssh server in linux system openssh for ubuntu and on window for eg winscp also

17084126
subtraction	addition
in this case complexity addition subtraction and shift are of o n complexity at least so your algorithm then applied to such integer would be o nâ² complexity n operations of o n complexity applied

jlist	jtable	sorting	filtering
wrong idea there is more than contraproductive to create a new xxxtablemodel one xxxtablemodel can be used for all views for a few jtable jlist notice only in the case if isn t there used rowsorter or rowfilter then logics in code must contains filtering sorting for all jtable based on one xxxtablemodel

17084954
jlist	jtable
jsplitpane and there could be one area for all input masks laid by cardlayout second for jtable only one jtable with one xxxtablemodel you can to add standinddata in jlist or another jtable on south or west east area with intention to fill free space in the container

post	put
both put and post may create a new record

17085162
post	put
the difference between post and put is that put is expected to address the record with it s id so that the server knows what id to use when creating or updating the record while post expects the server to generate an id for the record and return it to the client after the record has been created

17085162

children	parent
another solution is to explicitly merge children once they are removed from their parent

17088182
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
i coudn t figure out why that happened because i did add a n character at the end of the message so i instead changed the bufferedreader and bufferedwriter objects to java.io.datainputstream and java.io.dataoutputstream and used the readutf and writeutf methods and this worked

first idea i had was a for-loop that creates the arrays than grabs the ice cream id for the first instance and checks its flavour against the arrays if no duplicate is found the id is increased by 1 id++ and then that ice creams flavour is ran in the arrays if a match is found i would set a boolean to true

17088309
int	boolean
to gather each icecream tag and allow me to check if any of the icecreams have the same flavour and output something set a boolean to true if a match is found my understand was to make an array then run each icecream though the array by using its id to identify it and inside each loop do id +1 int id 1 then in the lopp id++

versioning	upgrade
if you find it then you can unlock the feature in the free versioning without the need for the user to purchase the upgrade as you know they have the paid versioning installed

17088406
versioning	upgrade
the only problem is whilst you can persist the flag for the paid versioning being installed if they setup on a new device or factory reset for example when they put the free versioning on the flag for pro versioning is gone and the paid package won t be installed so they will be prompted to pay to upgrade again

hide	show
then set the href attribute of each link to the id of the element it s supposed to show or hide

17093840
super	self
super b self returns a class not an object which makes sense - a class doesn t have a superinstance it has a superclass so you then call __class__ on that class which results in the unexpected result

memcpy	memmove
plan to use memmove or memcpy instead

17098782

you simply apply the collapse-toggle class to anything you want to trigger the hide show effect and then use the data-target attribute to specify the id of the thing you ll hide show

i ve a simple jdialog with joptionpane and it works fine

17117053
client-side	server-side
you are doing a good thing and targeting a significant progress by willing to write both a complex server-side part and client-side javascript code but as i can see from your questions sorry if i m wrong your missing the point with server and client interaction

17117053

in other words user can pass some argument through http get post put delete methods to your servlet jsp which are reading those params and modifying beans information according to passed parsed data from the user

17117125
width	height
it s hard to understand your layout without some diagram or sketch but i think you can stay with the grid layout if you set the row height column width to auto

17117160
hide	show
also instead of switching to position fixed you could show hide a totally separate nav might actually make life easier

17117168
accessor	properties
your implementation of the imagechannels properties get accessor will create the list every time it is accessed

17117174
comparator	comparable
you are implementing a generic interface comparable but this its unique method once generic type erased will become comparator object hence it clashes with your own comparator object

17117192

17117647

17117869
rolify	cancan
it s probably too late but you could also use has_and_belongs_to_many on user and company and thus avoid sti altogether by using gems cancan and rolify

17117873
datamapper	activerecord
try refactory this in one designe patterns start your studing by activerecord and datamapper add inheritance

17117961

17118317
portrait	landscape
page printing layout is portrait by default to change to landscape and see the difference try the below

17118318
post	get
sven see comment elsewhere is right about post sometimes not being cacheable - but you can cache the response from a surrogate script on your own site accessed via get returning appropriate caching instructions - and this could return the data as a serialized php array object which is much less expensive to process

17118318
memcached	apc
apc is faster on a single server - but memcached is distributed

17118331
post	get
i have found many post on managing gesturerecognizers but i have not been able to find my answer or rather get anything to work correctly

try-catch	exception-handling
i seem to end up with try-catch exception-handling around pretty much half the code just to prevent it from crashing on a non-fatal error such as failing to update a text field and a lot of static variables that needs to be updated upon onstart because that seems like the only sane way you can reference android objects without them being in an illegalstate

17118493
google-chrome	firefox
so if the styles are applying in ie10 google-chrome and firefox then that suggests that either you re using some other mechanism for detection that circumvents the conditional comment which should ignore the stylesheet for all of those browsers or you have duplicated the style rules inside style.css somehow

17118508
width	height
you should wait for image to load to get its width and height

17118513

use float or int instead of double

17136494
min	max
there is no such property on menuitem and setting pref max min width on the contextmenu seems not to work

17136496
hide	show
i have an html paragraph tag which holds an error message i also added the server control or property so that i can show hide using server side validation

17136509

i have div content and hide show hyper link

17136549
hide	show
initially the div content is visible with hide link once user click hide link the div content get close and link value change into show

once user click back it should show div content and change the show link to hide

17136585
post	get
delphi tidhttp post is very slow vs get

17136597
listview	gridview
it s up to you gridview and listview are different in the ui

post	get
so i ve already done an ajax request using get and so now i wanted to try my luck using post instead

17136665
children	parent
ok guys so i am testing if elements are hidden problem is if the parent element is hidden then the children are considered hidden as well so the line that i append is being appending even if the children elements that aren t technically display none

17136665
children	parent
if #left is hidden parent and none of the children are i don t want the resetleft to be prepended

17136672
onresume	onpause
use oncreate onpause onresume methods but in my case i ve got 5 different tabs and according to this solution i ll have to check each fragmentactivity s methods also these methods get called not only on app resumption but also tab switching and initial creation of fragmentactivities..

17136676
int	chars
likewise for your example struct it has a size of usually 8 bytes but it consists of an int which requires 4 byte alignment and a chars which requires 1-byte alignment

17136713
profiling	instrumentation
use the time profiling instrumentation

17136760
google-chrome	firefox
this fiddle has been tested in ie9+ should work lower firefox and google-chrome

17136840
for-loop	loops
you probably want to get rid of that while loops and use a nice for-loop instead

17136856
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
right-click on the element select inspect element or something similar then scroll down in the right bar i think it should contain applied styles event listeners and how the box is rendered with the width height margin border and padding of the element

17136922
background-image	background-position
use the same background-image on the html or body element and a before pseudo element for the bottom bar with background-position 50 100 on both then apply a blur filter for the pseudo-element

17136924
super	implements
either your class or its super class must implements all methods in the interface

17136933

i don t know how to use for example the min and max functions related to the next line or the line before to compare the date

17136942
google-chrome	firefox
it doesn t happen on my other laptop with windows 7 and firefox or google-chrome same version 27.0.1453.110 m

the manifest.mf file must be inside the meta-inf folder of your jar

17137012
plone	buildout
i ve just fixed my plone 4.3 buildout to avoid download.zope.org 2

17137041
apache	nginx
use a apache or nginx reverse proxy in front of the datasnap servers and rewriterules based on the authentication data however my google-fu for today seems to be exhausted maybe this can be placed as a http apache specfifc question here on so

17137095
put	get
what i m trying to do this when i select one item in a listbox it will get that selected items value and put it into a textbox this is just for testing when i want to use the value for msssql

17137098
hide	show
after the show hide decision update the .previoustop with the currenttop value

17137098
hide	show
you can fade in out the header or use some other animation instead of a simple show hide

17137104
put	get
if you want your function getparieddevices to be called after your subactivity finishes you have to put that call inside your onactivityresult function if not it will get called because the oncreate function will continue executing the rest of the sentences

17137106
subtract	addition	addition	multiplication	division	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtract
i have a string like the string can be longer or shorter but in both cases i need to parse it and calculate the division and multiplication first before the addition and subtract

17137106
division	multiplication
but i need a way to detect multiplication and division and calculate them first and add the result to the rest of the string

17137117
hide	show
then use jquery to hide and show the content

17137127
min	max
you should use heap when you only want to keep track of the min max without requiring to know the complete ordering of all elements

17137165
put	get
if you get an operator you take the last 2 elements on the stack and then put back the result of those two with the operator you re on

17137213
equals	gethashcode
i see that if i override the equals and gethashcode on the key s class or i create a new class which implements iequalitycomparer i have the same result

17137262
margin	height
i have three divs that are set to the window height by jquery and they have a bottom margin they re called .pannel

17137320

the object s equals anf gethashcode implement the concept of equality intrinsic to the object

17137345
inherited	properties
declare the attached properties with inherited -option

17137389
google-chrome	firefox
you can however use something like selenium to remote control a web browser google-chrome or firefox

17137396
spaces	delimiter
-d - mean use spaces as a delimiter

17137410
width	height
if the height and width of the tables are fairly consistent you can just use a rounded corner svg image as background-image to the table or a block enclosing the table

17137410
width	height
you can scale it to fit width and height

17137491
subshell	ifs
the part in parentheses is executed in a subshell so changes to ifs variable are localized

17137577
phpstorm	webstorm
i just installed the new android studio and i m looking for a way to be able to get support for css and js autocomplete highlighting for incorrect usages as i would in phpstorm and also webstorm both intellij products

17137586
post	get
that accepts queries and commands to your database via http parameters either get or post

17137596
for-loop	loops
i think the way to do this would be to rewrite your while loops as a nonterminating for-loop and check the end condition manually

17137620
google-chrome	firefox
this code works in google-chrome but not in firefox

17137624
for-loop	loops
the second much faster kind of loops or compiles down to very simple il just like you d get with a for-loop in c# java c etc

17137628
typedef	struct
example of your struct typedef uncompiled

17137631
portrait	landscape
remember that android allows you to specify different layouts for portrait and landscape orientations

17137631
oncreate	setcontentview
android decides which layout to use when the activity is first created or more correctly when you call setcontentview which you typically do in your activity s oncreate . if you override the default behavior of an orientation change then the android system will not load the correct layout for you

17137698
width	height
i have tried hard coding the height and width with no avail

17137711
put	get
i do however get the alert box coming up when teh page is loaded if i just put

17137757
width	height
i would like the canvas to be 2 3 the width and the tabs to be 1 3 and the height to be the whole screen height

17137787
post	get
i get my own post but not post made by others and also the limit clause works in mysterious way from what i have read around

17137806
mouseleave	mouseenter
as have been suggested by joe in the comments you should check the window size on mouseenter and mouseleave instead

17137870
lxml	beautifulsoup
i noticed a strange behavior when scraping some webpages using beautifulsoup 4.1.0 and the lxml parser

17137953
maven	pom.xml
i have a maven project with multiple maven modules organized around parent pom.xml

17137976
post	get
if you re using github and pull requests then check out hadi hariri s blog post about how to get the pull request after it has been merged with master

17137990
std	ostream
even if you were to successfully get it to use std ostream as the first parameter and return value it would not work correctly

17137990
std	ostream
another problem is owstream is implicitly convertible to std ostream

17137990
std	ostream
for instance if an object of type owstream is passed to a function that accepts a std ostream you may end up encountering the problem you are currently experiencing

17137990
std	ostream
this will prevent any implicit use of owstream as a std ostream

17137990
std	ostream
using private inheritance also has the benefit of preventing you from unknowingly using functions in std ostream which may lead you back to your original problem

17137990
std	ostream
for instances where a std ostream is absolutely necessary you can use an accessor function to explicitly retrieve a reference to it

17137990
std	ostream
the last issue is that std ostream includes an overload of that handles std ostream specific io manipulators such as std endl

17137990
std	ostream
if you do not provide an overload to specifically handle these the one in std ostream gets used and once again you end up right back where you started

17137990
std	ostream
the solution below is similar to the one provided by jrg and includes the accessor function and overloads for double float and std ostream io manipulators

17137990
std	ostream
it also uses private inheritance to prevent implicit conversions to std ostream

17138007
children	parent
create a file with the parent process and write pids of all children

17138012
wordpress	joomla
i am not using wordpress drupal or joomla

17138022
super	extends
i have two classes which extends from the super class viewpart

17138034
mouseover	mouseout
it does in fact compresses the text height or size for one second when i mouseover or mouseout but then returns to normal size quickly

17138040
getter	setter
no setter and getter

17138157
crypt	hash
hash it with crypt to keep the operation expensive in resources slow

17138177
public	protected
even if i want to have a different color for a keyword this class static extern transient public private protected etc i d have to be able to know how i should implement this scanning algorithm

17138194
many-to-many	one-to-many
it s all one-to-many relationships for now - i m not worried about many-to-many relationships at this point

17138217
centroid	convex
next take the centroid of the points you re fleeing from then determine which vertex of the convex hull is the most distant from the centroid

17138302
hide	show
in general though this is not advisable and rather you should add or show hide the element and remove the other element by hand .remove

17138310
width	height
it might be a better idea to move your scroll content into another div with the scroll width and height and put the buttons there

17138323
google-chrome	firefox
to let it work on firefox and google-chrome use

17138354
interbase	firebird	coalesce	nvl	coalesce	nullif	nvl	nullif
for your db try look at nvl nullif nvl2 coalesce case-when clauses oracle or iif function firebird interbase

17138370
nspersistentdocument	nsdocument
the op mentions that this is a b2b application and that they wont be using nsdocument nspersistentdocument to handle things on the os x side so a container object could be a good choice here

17138376
google-chrome	firefox
someone can fire up wireshark ie s f12 developer tools firefox firebug or google-chrome s developer tools and see exactly which page things go to or debug any call that touches dom even if your code is complete gibberish

17138389
put	get
it s also worth noting i have dabbled with pyobjc a little on mac and therefore do understand a little about the ns foundation classes and such and i ve also looked at apple s reference documentation and i m sure that once i get the basics down i could put good use to it but i still don t know how to actually get a functional ios app that does something useful going

17138395
crypt	salt
therefore the crypt function assumed des and only took the first two characters 2 as salt

17138395
crypt	salt
according the the crypt manpage the salt may be up to 16 characters following the id

17138449
subtract	add
for each node in your ast if you assign it the yytokentype value found in y.tab.h you simply subtract 258 and add 3 to index into token_table yytname

17138449
subtract	add
you have to subtract 258 b c that is where yytokentype starts enumerating at and you have to add 3 b c yytname adds the three reserved symbols end error and undefined at the start of the table

17138456
getter	setter
and then to define count sent and received on the prototype use object.defineproperty not to pollute enumeration and also to have getter setter

17138461
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
for using the nsdatecomponents methods you will actually have to make use of nscalendar

17138519
hide	show
when you refresh the browser on my site - click here i noticed the visibility of my show and hide menu s are visible for about a second when the page is loading

17138519
hide	show
below is a snippet of my show and hide functions.

17138533
width	height
none of them give satisfactory answer all we know is google maps api v3 has a limitation that if the panto target is more than 1 window height width of the current center it will not be smooth

17138541
width	height
i was told by someone that i need to re-declare my screen buffer width and height which i have done keeping in mind there is a border to my window and also a menu at the top

17138543
for-loop	loops
you need the found flag because once a for-loop ends you can t really tell whether it stopped because you broke out of it or if loops stopped on its own because it looped through the whole list

17138593
int	double
generate x int values over half the range and for each value double it and add 1

17138656
versioning	upgrade
it is recommended to install from the repositories because you can later update your software to a newer versioning with a simple yum upgrade

17138656
rpm	yum
rpm packages installed manually even with yum which then only acts as an installer will have to be managed manually as well

17138672
hash	salt
if you hash at the client side then salt and iteratively hash that hash the same way you would a plaintext pw

17138697
min	max
change min max and n 5 according to your needs

17138753
google-chrome	firefox
it is better if you use a rest client fiddler restclient extension for google-chrome or firefox to test your service calls

17138754
ready	each
rapache is definitely ready for production but please note that only for rather stateless algorithms by default apache would start bunch of workers so the same user client would end up interacting with different r sessions in each query

17138754
ready	each
there are bunch of tools ready for production and each has its own advantages and special use cases

17138785
google-chrome	firefox	puts	gets
note my current code isn t working properly and is not cross-browser compatible google-chrome puts the arrow on the top right but on firefox it gets squished down outside the bounds

17138796
queue	fifo
if all you care about is the forward traversal order the order in which the algorithm discovers the new vertices of the graph then yes you can take the classic bfs algorithm replace the fifo queue with lifo stack and you will get pseudo-dfs algorithm

17138836
multiplying	add
the multiplying vs add doesn t really make that much difference except in the loop3 case where it adds approximately 30 on the loop time

17138843
fiddler	charles
another benefit of this is that if you proxy your curl command through a packet sniffer like wireshark fiddler or charles you can easily view the http transaction and debug what is going on

17138882
firefox	safari
i have the same problem on safari and firefox

17138914
jcheckbox	jradiobutton
isselected is used by toggle style buttons like jradiobutton jcheckbox and jtogglebutton

17138928
charat	indexof
if the distance between and is expected to be large for your actual inputs you can rewrite the method to use indexof to directly find left and right instead of testing the charat for each character

17138928
charat	indexof
in this case there would be many fewer calls to indexof than calls to charat and while characters in the string between the outermost braces would be examined at least two times the internal implementation of indexof may exceed the performance of what the jit is doing with charat

17138953
margin	font-size
using line-height value + font-size to set size of arrow and margin

17138978
serializable	deserialization
the .net framework provides various techniques for serializable and deserialization of class types which are supposed to automate the process but all of the built-in techniques i m familiar with have various limitations

17138999
width	height
also don t forget to specify image s width height

17139003
width	height
in my html i have the following to make the canvas resize to width and height percent

17139006
openlayers	proj4js
i have heard of openlayers and proj4js but am not sure how a java script solution would work in a server environment

17139016
width	height
i m afraid i cannot access fb or fb devs from work but as i recall this can be done by increasing the height width attributes

17139045
int	chars
this bad boy worked turning it into a chars then into a signed int

17139077
width	height
meanwhile you have canvas width and height in your html set to be 800 600

17139077
width	height
you should use canvas.scrollwidth and canvas.scrollheight to get the actual width and height information

17139081
google-chrome	firefox
ie8+ firefox and google-chrome all handle this like they should ie7 is the only browser giving issues because of haslayout

17139114
width	height
when the canvas is resized you need to reset its width and height accordingly

17139116
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
to that end they put malloc realloc free etc

17139116
free	malloc
once you understand the algorithm it should be clear why linking your own malloc and free does not cause a link error

17139116
calloc	malloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
linking any moderately complicated program with your implementation will likely crash because when you replace malloc you also need to implement realloc and likely calloc and memalign and posix_memalign

17139116
free	realloc
otherwise you ll get a mixture of implementations and when someone passes realloc ed pointer to your free things will likely explode

17139132
ssl	https
communication should take place over ssl https

17139142
folder	directory
the problem i am now encountering is that each time i launch a debug instance the assembly is put in a different path guid folder under local appdata directory

17139148
carrierwave	fog
i am working to get with rails 4 ruby 2 fog carrierwave integration

17139149
hex	binary
what i am ultimately trying to achieve is just to read the file and at the same time write the binary data all including the header ftm and data or all that is hex readable data and dump it into a simple beep.txt file

17139188
prepare	execute
and execute it as a prepare statement

17139194
highcharts	highstock
since most of the functionality of highcharts is found in highstock you re probably better off to just use highstock for whatever application needs the range selector

17139201
post	get
note one get one post and note the headers on the post

17139204
treemap	linkedhashmap
you may want to consider using a treemap or a linkedhashmap if you want a sorted or source sequence list for the key value

17139256
google-chrome	safari
this link works on the desktop version of google-chrome and safari but does not work in the ios simulator version of safari it says safari could not load the page because the address is invalid

17139279
width	height
you can update the canvas by setting its width and height properties - to set it to the size of the window you can use

17139330
awt	swing
a note for all naive swing programmers all creation and manipulation of swing objects must be done on the awt event thread in a runnable added to the event thread when called from a different thread otherwise bad things can happen

17139346
loops	if-statement
i d like to use a while loops for this and no methods as i want to get more practice using the while loops and if-statement

17139363
width	height
that means that its width and height and top and left positiones will be calculed based on the first parent div absolutely or relative positioned only if width or height properties are explicitly declared in css

17139381
put	get
i get that this should put the code in queue but i don t actually seem to have any guarantee that the handler will definitely perform it s code after the map is done so i feel like it could still be null in some cases

17139409
chunked	transfer-encoding
turns out content-length should be ignored when transfer-encoding is set to chunked

17139446
pem	pkcs#12
the paypal button is an html form where the contents are encrypted by a recipient s public certificate pem format and i load the pkcs#12 certificate which contains the public certificate and private key of the signer

17139446
put	get
when i put this up on my webhost arvixe and try to do exactly the same as above when i get to the payment page generating the paypal button it churns away for a long time

17139446
pem	pkcs#12
on my webhost i can publicly access the pem and pkcs#12 file no

17139462
mpfr	mpc
recently we realized the latest gccs 4.8.1 got extensive optimizations for arithmetic calculations including the usage of mpfr mpc etc

17139472
scala	typesafe
i m using scala 2.10.0 play framework 2.1.0 typesafe slick 1.0.1 and play-slick 0.3.2

17139520
post	get
what you will do is when the user presses the button then you make an ajax post or get to your server and receive the address

17139544
post	get
depends on if the form that the select is contained in has the method set to get or post

17139609
profiling	instrumentation
i m trying to run time profiling in instrumentation and when it fires off i do not see anything in the call tree

17139636
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox it aligns to the left

17139638
centos	linux
i m in linux centos trying to run a basic perl script from a file

17139651
google-chrome	firefox
this happens to me both with textboxes with validation and without it and it only happens in ie firefox and google-chrome make it work just fine

17139765
google-chrome	firefox
it is working perfectly in firefox and google-chrome

17139797
put	get
note that even if you put the file originally in the app_code folder you won t get intellisense until first time building so it is anyway not a difference.

17139802
button	checkbox
since you want to have button and not a checkbox for the boolean field you can have a checkbox which is styled like a button

17139804
folder	directory
alternatively you may create a folder called lib and put the jar in the lib directory then you may perform the following steps

17139844
flask	django
i have an flask app that serves an api to a django consumer

17139844
post	get
my problem is this when i test my api i get post data in request.form and when i hit it from my consumer using requests library i get post data in request.data

17139869
width	height
your textblock has a fixed width and height

17139869
width	height
remove the height and width properties

17139937
width	height
for example set the initial frame of the header subview to 0 0 width height and then in scrollviewdidscroll set the frame to 0 contentoffset.y width height

17139974
debian	linux
i am using a raspberry pi debian linux to record audio with the alsa library

17140017
tunnel	packets
for writes if you write a partial packets the driver will think it s a full packets and deliver the truncated packets through the tunnel device

17140040
post	get
you can t get output by post require_once pages homepage.php you should try following code for store output of file into variable

17140056
width	height
the reason you want to explicitly set the width and height of the fabric.path is because otherwise the default size will include the additional size from the stroke of the arc

17140075
keyup	mouseup
i even tried to bind keyup mouseup click .

17140087
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
this works in google-chrome firefox and ie10 but not in safari 5.1.7

17140137
expander	grid
third the datagrid is inside a grid which is inside an expander which is inside a usercontrol

17140156
web-inf	context-param
it might be because you have added web-inf dispatcher-servlet.xml to contextconfiglocation in context-param

17140174
rss	feed
atom rss feed

17140174
rss	feed
atom rss feed still require an aggregator to pull the data from the server and thus do not accomplish my goal of a push-only solution to my gas url to then in turn trigger my script via doget or dopost

17140198
post	get
it can also make http requests get and post listen for response

17140198
post	get
the ability to make pages that will interact with the simple http get and post requests coming from my game work with the database and handle the backend logic

17140224
calloc	malloc
or if you want your memory to be filled with physical all-bits-zero pattern use calloc instead of malloc

17140381
kde	gnome
example are esd old gnome sound server arts old kde sound server portaudio portable library usable across windows linux and mac

17140422
rss	feed
i am parsing an rss feed that i create myself with a really long description but the other tags you are interested in feed title date and url are always short

17140422
rss	feed
it might not work for your situation if you dont control the feed unless you know there is always a certain string at the end of your rss description

width	height
the viewbox re-sizes the canvas to fit inside it - although doesn t appear to apply any transforms to the canvas and doesn t change its width or height some other magic goes on here - but fine it works

17145506
portrait	landscape
the idea is that the user can draw a rectangle on the left canvas which will represent a zoom area and then the right canvas will zoom in so that rectangle will fit to the viewbox containing the canvas - by fit i mean without cropping or stretching squashing any of the zoom area so if it is a landscape zoom area in a portrait viewbox the sides of the zoom area will meet the sides of the viewbox leaving space at the top and bottom which is fine

17145506
width	height
i though this would be straight forward as there are no transforms applied to either of the canvases and they both have the same width and height even though some magic from the viewbox is making the right one smaller

17145506
width	height
so the right canvas is just normal size too but is contained inside a border with fixed width and height

17145511

17147129
swt	draw2d
swt just provides a platform to draw2d where something can be drawn

17147129
swt	draw2d
hence for swt there is no way to differentiate between a draw2d label or say a draw2d connection

your current code with the prototype suffers from the problem that you re trying to get the function like a variable while it s a inherited properties of your instance referenced by this

children	parent
the above query only works if the parent id is a lower number than all the children

17147641
children	parent
this is because the secondary sorting orders by id and if the parent id happens to be higher than any children the parent may not show up on top of the children

17147641
children	parent
to explain what s going on here you first order by the parent row s id field and the children rows parent_id field

17147641
children	parent
if you order by that all the children will be grouped up with their parent and the overall list will be ordered by the parent s id field

just look at this site stackoverflow plenty of notifications and ways of collecting user input without a sniff of a pop-up message dialog

17158188
udp	rtp
also the socket method here isn t very flexible- you can perform finer alterations of the packet data to a network i m attempting this at the moment for live streaming by providing it with a local socket and then connecting to that local socket and processing its output independently in a thread for instance for transmission over udp rtp etc

17158191

i would have to ask users to create a new constructor for every subclassing even if all it does is call the superclass constructor

chown	chgrp	chown	chmod	chgrp	chmod
i use command chmod 777 and chown and chgrp to change the permission of the file but it still doesn t work

post	put
i recently had to do this and had to sift through all these answers and their comments to eventually piece the information together so i ll put it all here in one post for your convenience

17159012
free	calloc
you need to both calloc and free the array in the usual non id way and you also need to annotate the id objects like the other thing that s really counterintuitive but is required to make sure the elements in myarray are deallocated correctly is to explicitly set each element of myarray to nil before you free myarray

17159034
hide	show
you should use hide after adding each fragment and then later you can use show to make it visible and hide again to make other fragments invisible

memcpy	strcpy
to extend the answer recommending strcpy i d use memcpy and use a #defined length to make sure you always use the same value

17159250
pthreads	fork
complete pthreads means fork mmap signal and such and these are almost impossible to implement on nt

17159250
pthreads	fork
to drive the point home gnu hurd has problems with fork as well because hurd kernel is not pthreads

17159381
put	get
one of those conventions is that you put modules into the helpers folder because they get included into your controllers and views

17159461
hide	show
it doesn t work right now because it uses class names to define the content to show and hide

17159462
iequalitycomparer	ilist

but there is only getter for it and no setter

17172584
width	height
within the html is a body content wrapper - any time the window is resized it gets an explicit width and height set inline to the window width and height

17172584
google-chrome	firefox
but google-chrome and firefox still prioritize the inline style

17172649
listview	gridview
if you don t have to specialize the behaviour of the application for each view of the viewgroud listview gridview etc. surely the first alternative is better

17172695
swt	swing
when lunching my java application that use both swing and swt the window is freezing right at the opening

17172713
vmware	virtualbox
virtualize your postgresql installation using vmware or virtualbox and use the snapshot feature of the virtual machines

cpu	hyperthreading
the most powerful cpu s today can go up to i think 16 real cores + 16 hyperthreading cores see here

17172732
unsigned	short
alphabet is an array of 10 unsigned short elements

17172732
unsigned	short
its size is where sizeof unsigned short is commonly 2 but it can vary for different implementations

17172745
single-quotes	double-quotes
the real problem you are having and you continue to use what you have is that you are mixing your single-quotes with your double-quotes incorrectly

17172745
int	double
notice how i adjusted your single double quotes so that way the strings literals are wrapped in single or double quotes and then i properly terminate the string literal and concat by way of + the variables int additional strings.

17172747
google-chrome	safari
i looked at both the browsers and the only difference was that google-chrome had web inspector on while safari didn t

17172810
soql	apex
better to create a vf page that has apex which does a soql call to get the related opportunity- custom object records

17172943
mousemove	mousedown
you can use the touch class included with easeljs to enable multi-touch - which translate into normal easeljs mousedown mousemove events

there is also a sort filtering project with animated sorting and filtering

17172999
post	get
edit so it seems like its simpler when i get rid of the ref post part now my code looks like this

17173040
versioning	upgrade
something else that makes the versioning upgrade explanation compelling is that in several records the created_at timestamp is in the first format listed and the updated_at timestamp is in the second

17173068
ddms	adb
go to window- preferences-- android -- ddms -- adb connection time out ms an put the time milliseconds you need

17173083
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari

jar	manifest.mf
since you ve exported your jar using eclipse manifest.mf details must have been taken care of by the ide

17173110
implements	extends
your concrete functional requirement isn t exactly clear but based on the information provided so far you can safely replace extends uiinput implements namingcontainer by extends uinamingcontainer and get rid of getfamily override

17173123
rss	feed
in addition to using the api method you could parse the rss feed for the channel using php

17173123
rss	feed
i did something similar with rss feed using wget to retrieve the feed xlst to format the results and ran it via cron

17173153
google-chrome	firefox
this code will work in firefox and google-chrome

17173173
width	height
in your specific instance overriding width height to prevent content overflow changing the display type will do what you need

17173173
width	height
elements set to table-cell will treat width and height properties as a suggested value rather than an absolute value

17173221
textview	imageview
if you don t want to increase the size of your apk with the different drawables you can code a custom imageview and set the text over it with a string that will be translated or put a textview on top of the imageview setting them inside a relativelayout like this

17173286
express	node.js
i m writing an api using node.js and express

17173287
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if that is acceptable then you need to enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

17173301
submit	submission
the code above saves all the file names that i deem worthy of persisting to the submission page before the submit actually happens

17173356
hide	show
i have a report that uses parameters to hide or show data on a chart at runtime

17173418
typedef	struct
in c you would need a typedef to use callback as a type name when you only declared struct callback

17173422
memcached	ncache
i ve tried using the distributed cache packages like appfabric memcached ncache

17173430
onresume	onpause
i solved it by changing my onresume and onpause methods to modify the isrecording boolean

17173494
int	boolean
depends on whether name is an object nor a primitive boolean string int

17173510
google-chrome	firefox
i don t know about ie8-10 ie6-7 definitily no go but in google-chrome and firefox i get the thinnest border with box-shadow

17173510
google-chrome	firefox
the thin border on the hr is more prominent in firefox than google-chrome but also google-chrome renders 2px

17173528
minimum	max
yes minimum cost is a special case for max flow

17173528
min	max
rather than max flow min cost assumes that after going through each edge there is a cost to the flow

17173528
min	max
therefore if you set the cost at each edge to be zero then min cost is reduced to the max flow

17173528
range	max
for a given range of values binary search can be used to more efficiently locate the max

17173536
inherited	properties
even though the op s original problem has been solved the answer to the question is as follows hibernate search will treat inherited field -annotated properties as properties fields of that class and will index them accordingly even indexedembedded properties of a superclass will be indexed with no extra configuration effort

17173539
viewdidload	viewwillappear
after navigating back the methods viewwillappear or viewdidload are not getting called and thus this uitextview controller doesn t get feed with updated data

17173550
box-sizing	border-box
i have a pretty basic layout utilizing multiple containers and floating divs i m also using box-sizing border-box

17173556
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
when i try and display the image to a qgraphicsview through a qgraphicsscene the view is unchanged

17173556
bmp	png
i also tried saving the qpixmap as a png jpg bmp using the save function as well to no avail

17173558
monkeyrunner	adb
at some point in my monkeyrunner i want to launch random monkey tests the ones we can get through a command adb shell monkey -p my.package -v 500 so i added this line device.shell monkey -p my.package -v 500 to my python script

17173573
google-chrome	firefox
the unexpected behavior is due to the way in which firefox and google-chrome handle the closing of a websocket

17173573
google-chrome	firefox
when the page is refreshed both browsers close the connection however firefox will execute your onclose code while google-chrome closes the connection and skips straight to re-loading the new page

17173573
google-chrome	firefox
even stranger is the fact that from my observations calling websocket.close in google-chrome will immediately close the connection and call the onclose function while firefox waits for a close message back from the server

17173596
google-chrome	firefox
this is my code and transform is working in google-chrome browser but in firefox it is not working

17173600
post	get
edit i thought about using the viewsets available through the rest framework but they split this functionality into get and post methods with get retrieving a record and post either updating or creating one

17173647
queue	fifo
it will open a named pipe usually a fifo queue and you will see on the process list something like

17173652
int	chars
the number of registers in the cpu is limited but variables cannot take up half a register usually - x86 is a bit strange there so whether you use int short or chars you probably lose a full register anyway

17173679
x86	64bit
in a loop the variable is most likely stored in a cpu register which means it is for example 32-bit on x86 or 32 to 64bit on x86_64 etc

17173827
versioning	upgrade
an upgrade of mod_wsgi to versioning 3.4.0 fixed it

17173915
prop	each
also quite a few jquery functions take callbacks addclass width attr and prop so you can usually get rid of each

17173949
metaclass	subclassing
metaclass conflict the metaclass of a derived class must be a non-strict subclassing of the metaclass of all its bases

17173965
width	margin
you may need to tweak the width margin of your .span4 s accordingly

17173966
int	chars
if it s not in a register it ll typically be on the stack and on most cases the sizes of items on the stack are also fixed 32 bits on a 32-bit architecture 64 bits on a 64-bit architecture etc. so allocating a single chars for example can will frequently end up using just as much memory as an int would have anyway

17173988
appfuse	spring
we have a spring+hibernate application using spring 2 from appfuse 1.9 which is in a desperate need to be updated to spring 3

17174069
margin	height
top bottom padding or margin doesn t affect the height of inline elements relative to their parent

17174099
cout	cin
mixing cout and cin the c++ io library has to synchronize cout every time cin is used

17174103
put	get
the writeafter event is the right place to get the final data and have the output directory tree set up so i can put my .json files next to the .html

17174108
filtering	grouping
i have an ssrs report with grouping that filtering by top 3 and bottom 3

17174110
getter	setter
it would be good to practice to use instance variables in private or protected mode and using getter and setter methods to access it

17174112
width	height
you can move the mouse left or right or up or down while resizing from a corner handle and the diagonal arrow is displayed and change only the width or the height of your object

17174118
getter	setter	public	protected
then control access to them through public or protected getter setter methods

17174140
int	chars
and it appears that on your platform a pointer to chars does not fit into an int hence its truncated and then printf tries to dereference the thus invalid pointer

17174172
pull	push
git performs pull and push so it normally performs this operation for full repository rather than single selected file s

17174174
unsigned	short	int	chars
i was thinking about creating functions to convert from unsigned chars result of sqlite3_column_text to short array and int to short array

17174196
spaces	delimiter
i am trying to turn the words in a string into elements in an array by splitting the string with spaces as the delimiter

17174209
public	protected
if you still want to trigger that function outside you can declare a public method that triggers your protected method

17174232
post	get
like adviced in this post i use libproc to get a list of all running processes

17174268
portrait	landscape
this makes the viewport fit the content in both portrait landscape orientation

17174280
int	double
i am trying to parse the retried value from the database into double long or int but it throws a formatexception

17174290
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in google-chrome and firefox but for some strange reason ie isn t showing any changes

17174290
google-chrome	firefox
if i make a change in ie it will show up in google-chrome and firefox but not vise-versa

17174290
google-chrome	firefox
i can even delete data in google-chrome or firefox and it still shows up in ie even though it doesn t exist in the database anymore

17174312
viewdidload	viewwillappear
a modal segue like the one you are describing is technically on screen the whole time so viewdidload and viewwillappear are never called

17174313
serializable	deserialization
my current solution is to get this serializable string extract the type from a predetermined type field and then use a switch statement to call the appropriate subclass deserialization method

17174322
min	max
zoom min and max are both 1

17174335
jsdom	cheerio
on the receiving end i d like to be able to parse that html via cheerio or jquery or jsdom so i can then run queries like .some_selector on that data

17174361
uicollectionview	uitableview
the desired effect is a uitableview with n rows of horizontally scrolling uicollectionview

17174376
accessor	properties
i also tried accessing the public properties in the pageradapter entries to modify that directly but that is not accessible for some reason even though the class and the properties both have a public accessor

17174377
put	get
for the life of me i can t get the compiler to actually load the templateurl even when it has been put into the templatecache

17174379
hex	binary
i ve used the keolabs ride7 to produce an intel hex as well as a binary file of some basic code for the stm32f205rg

17174379
hex	binary
however given the binary hex files i ve got where do i go from here

17174407
min	max
the very inefficient method that works is where minval and maxval are the min and max values in the original 2 byte numpy array and paddingval in the original will be set to 0

17174461
children	parent
the example given by the author doesnt appear to clone recursively the children of the default parent

17174469
width	height
css this animates the width and height and background color .animate will not animate background color so that is an added bonus

17174491
width	margin
this makes sense to me the bodycontainer controls overall width bodyoffset has a negative left margin so we can float the newscolumn onto the right but bodyrestrict then brings the body back inline by offsetting the negative margin with a positive margin

17174521
concave	convex
the application of this to concavity is fairly simple if you understand what it actually means to be concave or convex

17174521
concave	convex
the triangle you are given is concave if it is cutting an area out from the plane and it is convex if you are adding extra area to it

17174521
concave	convex
that is the exact same thing we were doing to determine the our area so positive area corresponds to a convex shape and negative area corresponds to a concave shape

17174545
google-chrome	firefox	hotmail	outlook.com
the following happens with outlook.com hotmail and google-chrome firefox

17174545
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it shows same as google-chrome firefox in opera on the ipad

17174565
profiling	instrumentation
here is a snapshot of what s happening while profiling with instrumentation

17174673
stringbuilder	stringwriter
basically i need to use html.renderaction .. and in the action itself use stringbuilder stringwriter and then return content ...

17174686
submit	submission
the actionlink you see is not related to the form or the submit it is a regular link which is in effect a way for the user to go back to the previous page instead of submission the form

17174709
draggable	droppable
there is an init javascript function client side which makes all the controls of a certain class draggable and droppable

17174709
draggable	droppable
my problem was that these controls were losing there draggable and droppable property after post-backs so to fix it i started registering scripts code behind using registerstartupscript with a different key whenever an event was fired which would recreate the controls

17174759
width	height
determining the height width of display - client side

17174769

so when you do a composer update composer will pull in the version of guzzle from the local directory so you can test the code for a library in another application that uses that library without having to push to a repository between each code change

17174807
folder	directory
placing these emails that have always been sent out this way in the past without an attachment in the spool directory causes it to go right back in the undelivr folder and resulting in the same error

17174824
put	get	onmouseup	mousedown
this appears to be timing dependent...if i put breakpoints on the mousedown event i get click otherwise i get mainly onmouseup

17174833
folder	directory
you therefore need to go a level up first out of the css folder and then into the image directory

17174856
put	get
you need to read in the contents from the url using ajax and then put that into your variable or use the data as soon as you successfully get the data

17174882
width	height
ideally you wouldn t be doing anything to hardcode height or width you d be using the various layout systems to place things in relative positions and resize gracefully instead of explicitly setting sizes and locations

17174914
post	put
it usually makes sense to put your post handler in the controller it s related to

17174936
stdout	stderr
i would like to execute external command rtmpdump and read it s stdout and stderr separately but not to wait till such command ends but read its partial outputs in bulks when available.

17174944
versioning	upgrade
the error you re seeing is probably because some gem wants active_support to be in the 3.x.x versioning range while you seem to be trying to upgrade to rails 4

17174994
post	get
i want to get the data from the post that my java executes and then work with them as strings in my php

stateless	stateful
what is difference between stateless and stateful knowledge sessions.i read some documents both are maintained state.but when can i use stateless stateful knowledge sessions

17175052
width	height
in order to get the width and height of the screen user must load javascript to their browser

17175052
width	height
then you can get the width and height of the user s screen

17175055
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
the example below has no error checking but the actual implementation version would throw lots of nullpointerexception s and illegalargumentexception s for bad data

17175134
width	border-box
if you are using the border-box model where padding is subtracted from the width susy can adjust for that but you have to tell susy that

17175137
jobs	cron
i have only run rake jobs on herokus cron that is called heroku scheduler but if you can load the java app on heroku you should be able to do it

17175141
width	height
it sounds like you are looking to give a minimum width and minimum height forcing your element to overflow

17175182
width	height
so if height and or width change dim is updated and since dim has changed cost is updated

17175219
uiview	subviews
uigraphicsgetcurrentcontext can be used to take a picture of a uiview but not to save the subviews locations

min	max	range	max	range	min
i have a form that gets from the user min size and max size of a shoe and prints on the same page by post method all of the shoes with this size range

17175351
min	max
you could pull out data that you would like to retain by grouping on your key columns and using min or max on the other columns since you say you do not care which value of you keep from column 2

17175382
int	chars	int	double
chars int double short string fixed-size array or record made of those - are simple types

17175408
width	height
display a box showing a full width height image also containing a trigger

17175434
width	height
i thought that sticking it inside of a container and giving it a fixed height width would do the trick but i tried that locally and had no success

17175510
post	put
you could put a conditional a the top of the page that sets the values to defaults if the post wasn t set

17175533
google-chrome	firefox
i ended up using google-chrome firefox to debug with instead

17175603
google-chrome	firefox
tested with ie10 and latest google-chrome and firefox browsers

17175630
post	get
in my application i am trying get the response using post request

17175660
distance	polygons
moving on now to finishing out the other 576 functions in that library not including the two polygons functions that are finished the three sphere distance algorithms that are done and two new ones an angle_box_2d and angle_contains_ray_2d

17175660
distance	polygons
so just a quick update i haven t finished the whole library yet i m only about 15 of the way through but i ve added these untested functions in case you need them right away on github to add to the old point in polygons and sphere distance algorithms

17175660
distance	polygons
the ones that i ve commented above probably won t work the others might but again - polygons sphere distance definitely do

17175660
distance	polygons
i put this together this morning so it currently only provides the point in polygons point in convex polygons and three different types of spherical distance algorithms but at least those ones that you requested are there for you to use now

17175685
rss	feed
i want to remove rss feed icon from category in joomla3 k2

17175688
int	chars
the idea being to input an int then cast it to a stringstream to be split into single chars then back to an int

17175700
x86	64bit
one practical example why you face the bad image format exception is that in your project you might be referring a assembly which is built with 32 bit x86 configuration and your project might be getting built with 64bit x64 so when this project tries to load the referenced type i.e 64bit assembly trying to load 32 bit assembly it will cause badimage format exception

17175743
dbcontext	objectcontext
if you make changes to cached data directly in the database entity framework will not see those changes until you create a new dbcontext or tell the underlying objectcontext to refresh

17175798

quicksort	heapsort
the linux kernel includes an implementation of heapsort which performs similar to quicksort

17176194
quicksort	heapsort
the kernel developers recommend heapsort over quicksort within the kernel and give the following rationale

17176217
width	height
vary some parameters by mutating the image scaling rotation etc make a fit of the expected vs observed angle see how they rely on the size of contour min height or min width eccentricity etc

17176217
width	height
choose some factors see what power they have then hope that they fit well into some visible formula like angle_deviation a1 x n1 a2 y n2 a3 z n3 1.234 width 2 1.111 height 2 2.8 area

17176239

resulting unsigned integer type

17176262
crypt	md5
currently supported algorithms are pbkdf2_sha256 pbkdf2_sha1 bcrypt_sha256 see using bcrypt with django bcrypt sha1 md5 unsalted_md5 only for backward compatibility and crypt if you have the crypt library installed

17176267
jar	manifest.mf
if you are using an older version of netbeans and don t have those parameters in manifest.mf you may add it manually by editing the jar file using winrar or any other archive manager and add javafx-class-path followed by names of each jar files in lib folder

17176271
hide	show
they way i m triggering it is enter 3 characters show password is weak tab to next field which fires the validate error on minimum length not 6 and hide password is weak and then go back to add more characters to the password i still have the validate error message but as soon as i key up on character 4 i get the password is weak

17176318
photoshop	coreldraw
to type in pagemaker photoshop coreldraw etc

17176345

the messages typically have simple data types like string int double etc

17176671
rspec	minitest
found this tutorial using minitest and was wondering if there is an equivalent matcher in rspec

17176732
prepare	execute
update you need to use prepare execute instead of query to run prepare statements

17176756
put	get
we could try to put everything in a lookahead so that nothing is actually matched but two zero-width matches will also never start at the same position - so we ll still get only one match per candidate line

17176757
public	protected
it can also be mentioned that it increase code readability incase there are some variables that are protected and other private or public

17176768
post	get
i first do a get then a post

17176768
post	get
the reason i programmed it this way because it seemed from the chrome dev tools i determined that it first used a get for the first two and then a post to login and get the third one

17177008
solaris	aix	freebsd	aix	freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
windows aix hpux linux solaris are supported but there s no build for os x or even freebsd

17177034
int	chars
if you re allowed to convert chars to int s you need only use 1 array

17177053
hide	show
the rel would be the id of the div so i know which tabs to show hide later on

17177124
hash	salt
the password gets hash with sha256 and salt

17177218

i want to track upgrade from a lite versioning to paid versioning of a app including a clicks on cta to upgrade b conversions from clicks to actual installs c how that cohort of users who clicked behavior is different if at all from users who discovered the app through other means

17177255
jtextfield	jtable
here s a demo with a read-only jtable with cell selection on and a jtextfield to paste into

17177274
post	get
you restrict the queryset in the get branch but not the post branch

remove this syntax error and you should see the test data header show when the check-box is checked and hide when it is unchecked

17177436
post	get
i would supply more detail but i don t know what this error means so i m not sure what the relevant files are and django apps are rather large in the amount of code spread around so i ll post some code once i can get an idea of what this means

17177458
spaces	delimiter
oh and changed the delimiter to a spaces rather than

17177484
versioning	upgrade
my development group recently upgrade from versioning 1.1.9 to 2.8.1

17177484
children	parent
through the changeset dialog i can walk through the parent s children but that is a really tedious way to navigate if there are numerous changes

17177496
portrait	landscape
it might be a white canvas or a landscape or a portrait you name it

17177499
put	get
no need to get bootstrap involved here just change the blog-tag element to a span and put it in the title div

17177612
pop-up	dialog
i get a pop-up dialog saying access is denied

17177655
tex	mathjax
the code i provide looks up the math element created by mathjax and tells it that it should change its tex code to the new string this automatically re-typesets it

17177681
children	parent	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
when you mouse over any secondary pages that have children under then the menus should appear to the right of the parent page and it does this in google-chrome firefox safari and ie9+

17177748
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
the current code runs perfectly on google-chrome but safari and firefox are really slow

17177791
setinterval	settimeout
i tried setinterval and settimeout but could not get them to work properly

17177798
google-chrome	firefox
i recently started having a problem where if i called the app from firefox everything works fine if i called it from my iphone or from google-chrome it fails

17177807
getter	setter
one way to do this is to override the enabled getter and setter to do what you want

17177822
switching	screens
if you want to switching back to the screens enter this command screens -r screen_name

17177834
macports	homebrew
i ended up switching from macports to homebrew and reinstalling my rubies and packages

17177894
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
don t know if you can use flexbox but the following works on google-chrome firefox and safari

17177965
equals	gethashcode
and in equals and gethashcode

17178000
implements	extends
what will happen if i write several classes extends this abstract class and implements the fourth method of the interface

17178016
google-chrome	firefox
the following is not working in google-chrome but works in ie and firefox

17178056
box-sizing	border-box
zurb foundation sets the box-sizing style on everything to border-box

17178069
subclass	abstract-class
keep in mind that when you instantiate a subclass and refer it as super abstract-class or interface it s still the instance of the subclass

17178069
superclass	subclassing
any method called on the object bubbles up from subclassing to superclass if its not available in the sub class

17178085
superclass	subclassing
superclass can refer to subclassing objects

17178095
express	node.js
modular web applications with node.js and express see 2 25 by tj looks very promising when he talks about bundleddependencies

17178098
short	base
long story short you may only assign a variable declared as base a value that is of the same type base or a derived type

17178117
firefox	safari
i have tried this both on safari and firefox on a mac and both showed the same effect

17178139
width	height
seeing as how you have specified the figsize to be 2 2 and having the ax occupy 80 of both the width and height you have very little space left over to pad the ticklabels

17178150
bower	npm
the bower team is planning to add the ability to publish packages to a server similar to how it works in npm

17178181
loops	while-loop
i have confirmed the while-loop loops

17178190
profiler	yourkit
i ve looked at both of these using the yourkit profiler and it shows exactly what i suspected which is the heap is not consumed and very few gcs have occurred

17178195
typedef	struct
i also found q a here that i can t specialize on two typedef which are actually the same type and since these are just numeric id s i don t want to use struct instead of int

17178208
sammy.js	durandal
durandal 1.2 provides a guardroute method which will allow you to intercept the call before it reaches sammy.js

17178237
profiling	instrumentation
open instrumentation and use the time profiling

17178244
xwpf	hwpf
however since you are using the .docx format you need to use xwpf instead of hwpf

17178261
superclass	subclassing
hence casting a subclassing object to a superclass reference works since the derived class object is capable of fulfilling the contract defined by the superclass

17178261
superclass	subclassing
on the other hand a superclass by the very way you define the classes clearly doesn t implement most of the methods present in the subclassing

17178261
superclass	subclassing
so casting a superclass object to a subclassing type is an inherently unsafe operation because the base class object cannot fulfill its subclassing contract completely

17178263
folder	directory
i have a directory called futures_contracts and inside is about 30 folder all named with the underlying asset and finally inside the 6 nearest expiration contracts in csv format

17178263
dataframe	multi-index
task from here the goal is to load in the futures data into a multi-index pandas dataframe in such a way that the top-level index is the underlying commodity symbol the mid-level index is the expiration month-year and finally the ohlc data

17178305
post	get
while the latter is probably safe in most cases it s better to get in the habit of using the former because there exists an edge case where can be empty with a valid post request and it may be a hard bug to track down

17178309
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
it works in safari tested 6.0.5 8536.30.1 firefox tested 19 and 21 and opera all four on macs

17178314
background-image	background-color
for ie and old browser declare a background-color and for gradients declare them as background-image

17178374
operands	scalar
scalar or list context propagates down to the right operands if it is evaluated

17178374
operands	scalar
scalar or list context propagates down to the right operands if it is evaluated

17178392
hide	show
when i click on a button to hide one div and show another which has the calendar only the calendar header loads

17178414
mouseup	mousedown
you ll probably want to still capture those contextmenu events so you can cancel them but then use mousedown or mouseup for specifically handling right-clicks

17178441
put	get
i found that for me i provided my pipedoutputstream to the get method with no mode provided defaults to overwrite and then provided my pipedinputstream to the put method with a parameter of resume

17178445
firefox	safari
here are some optimization techniques that can be applied to make this work more fluent in firefox and safari as well

17178445
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
that being said google-chrome s canvas implementation is very good and much faster at the moment than the bone provided by firefox and safari

17178445
google-chrome	firefox
i preset this to 2 in the demo and this works great with google-chrome and good with firefox

17178445
multiplying	multiplication
instead of diving on 6 we multiplying with 0.1667 as multiplication is a tad faster

17178486
width	height
it might be better to attach a cashapelayer to the view as a mask layer and animate the shape layer s path from an empty rectangle width 0 height full height of view to a rectangle that is the full size of the view

17178490
superclass	subclassing
you would only be invoking it on a subclassing of this abstract superclass which would be forced to provide an implementation or be declared abstract itself

17178523
int	chars
you still need to declare desired data type like int or chars

17178578
google-chrome	safari
ie and google-chrome safari have different tolerance level to some syntax errors in js - for example comma before the closing bracket - ie will not tolerate that

17178582
min	max
if you take the min max of that field you will get the one line you desire

17178591
bytearrayinputstream	bufferedimage
in a service method i take the byte construct a bytearrayinputstream from it and then create a bufferedimage from that

17178649
google-chrome	firefox
i ve gotten it to the point where phantomjs can do everything that google-chrome or firefox canâ is loading pages accessing the dom etc

17178654
pull	push
i also desperately tried to push the tp-grid back and pull the images to the front to make them clickable as buttons...no success though

17178658
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried looking at related googling but still cannot get it to show up in the browser tab firefox google-chrome ie...all latest versions to not work as well as clearing cache and restarting browser

17178667
qthread	qcoreapplication
note that qcoreapplication exec must always be called from the main thread the thread that executes main not from a qthread

17178667
qthread	qobject
but regarding qthread in general - you ll find the the link provided describes qthread as qobject that is a wrapper around threads

17178667
qthread	qobject	qthread	qcoreapplication
so qthread like any other qobject require the qcoreapplication to interact with in order to coordinate notifications events when the thread finishes

17178712
opera	firefox
so i m looking for a tool that can reliably and reproducible craft http queries most importantly also the uncommon cases like chunked transfer + multipart post in a single query my attempts at making curl wget firefox chromium or opera creating such a query were fruitless

17178742
multiplying	add
what i want to be able to do is loop through all of the inputs in #myfields get the value of the field as well as the value of the data-weight attribute multiplying them together then add them to a running total

17178770
sharepoint	spsite
i d like to know if it is possible to connect to a remote sharepoint site via a new spsite object from a sharepoint development box

17178777
prepare	pdostatement
but you were passing the return result of prepare to it which is a pdostatement object

17178777
prepare	execute
prepare is used in succession with execute not query

17178777
prepare	execute
it makes sense to prepare your statements when you have input parameters that you want to pass to execute

17178780
post	get
to pass get post parameters the urllib.urlencode function can be used

17178817
google-chrome	firefox
it seems to be working in google-chrome and ie as intended but not in mozilla firefox

17178854
hide	show
i ve tried splitting the operation into two parts with transaction1 add_new hide transaction2 remove_old show and firing the second transaction after oncreateview has executed on the new fragment but i didn t get much improvement at all

17178876
background-image	background-size
ifu wanta specific size of a background-image you can use the background-size css

17178876
width	height
or you can also use width and height

17178878
int	chars
if you read getc documentation you ll realize that it returns an int not a chars

17178878
int	chars
so basically what you re doing is truncating the eof which is an int generally defined as -1 to a chars when

17178878
stdout	fflush
you may want to move the n to the end of your senteces on printf calls to force a fflush on stdout

17178902
prepare	execute
when you execute the prepare statement it generates the actual sql code and then execute it in mysql

17178902
prepare	execute
thus when you use prepare statements you need to do execute so that the code is send to mysql

17178905
puts	gets
i got around this by just calling stdin.gets which works fine but i d love to be able to just use gets the way i can use puts rake seems to have no issue with stdout by default - as a static method

17179016
floating-point	integer
the value used for the case expression must be an integer floating-point decimal or string

17179085
strcpy	strcmp	strlen	strcpy	strlen	strcmp
strcpy strcmp and strlen

17179100
button	checkbox
but does anyone know of an extension that would add an option for the content creator to simply press a button tick a checkbox etc

17179659
jar	war
as a workaround you could try moving the problematic jar to a shared library and then associate the shared library with the war module

17179659
jar	war
this will have the same effect from a class loading perspective as including the jar in the war but it should prevent the annotation scanner from looking at the jar

17179670
put	get
the simplest thing to put it into a namespace is the following there are better ways but this should get you going

17179685
bash	tcsh

google-chrome is showing it correctly but safari is not

17180029
post	get
but this code was using post not get

17180237
getter	setter
particularly this about internal getter and setter

17180237
getter	setter
it s reasonable to follow common object-oriented programming practices and have getter and setter in the public interface but within a class you should always access fields directly

17180237
getter	setter
avoid internal getter setter #39

17180237
getter	setter
it seems that simple getter and setter are inlined now

17180237
getter	setter
in gingerbread we added simple inlining for getter setter

17180237
getter	setter
but the inline cache mechanism is implemented so that virtual getter setter can be inlined without problems

17180241
int	double
if i do this somewhere in the function it firstly creates a 40.000.000x10 matrix of double and then converts it to 8-bit int matrix

17180241
int	double
i have to work with even bigger matrices and i ran out of ram when it initializes such matrix of double although there would be enough memory if it initialized the matrix as int

17180263

17180776
hide	show
it sounds like you want a datatemplate that show or hide certain elements based on the properties of the object it is bound to

17180776
hide	show
since a user may or may not have an email address your datatemplate can use a converter to convert the string value of email into a visibility value that can be used to show or hide the field

17180776
hide	show
which essentially says show the email but hide this field if the email is null

17180805

17181396
google-chrome	firefox
i ve discovered that making a span element contenteditable results in some buggy behaviour in both firefox 1 and google-chrome 2

17181396
google-chrome	firefox
however the mozilla developer network lists the heading elements h1 through to h6 as block-level elements and making a heading element contenteditable is buggy in firefox 4 and can crash the page in google-chrome 5

wan	lan
you d be bouncing packets off your cable company s router back to your wan service and then out and back to your nat ed lan

17181552

for-loop	arrays
it would also be nice to use the enhanced for-loop to instantiate my new arrays instead of a typical for-loop

it is impossible to create two folder with the same name in the same directory and it doesn t make sense to have two versions of extension installed

17182320
int	chars
in other words comparing an unsigned chars to an unsigned int will first promote the unsigned chars to be compatible then do the comparison

17182320
integer	unsigned
otherwise if both operands have signed integer types or both have unsigned

17182329
button	checkbox
you can not reliably because the users can prevent the window from being resized by unchecking the edit preferences advanced scripts plug-ins allow scripts to move or resize existing windows checkbox in mozilla or tools options... content tab enable javascript advanced button move or resize existing windows checkbox in firefox or by setting dom.disable_window_move_resize to true in about config or by editing accordingly their user.js file

also your form send data two times - at onclick and onsubmit

17182729

to answer your last point which is interesting the other parts of the question are best answered by a debugger a double that is too large for an int will cast into the largest possible int

17193526
int	double
similarly for a double that is too small for an int will cast to the smallest possible int

17194153
post	get
then it sees searchindex with no attributes meaning it accepts both post and get and uses it

17194153

the point that the article is failing to get across right there is that the default behavior for a method is to accept both get and post

17194161
put	get
but when i want to put the front end in a different project i get the following exceptions

int	chars
but when i change limne int p 5 to chars p 5 for using it as array of pointers to string and do the necessary changes in the above code it produces segmentation fault.i read ian a book that we cant do this as some garbage value will be assigned to the array of pointers to string.so what can be the possible way to implement the above code with array of pointers to string

you re trying to use the result of aggregate functions max min on a row-by-row basis but those results are not available until the db has scanned the entire table

17195464

17195566
width	height
i tried inserting the background-size 100 trick but if i put only that yes it will strech to fit the div s width as intended but the height will be all messed up

17195566
width	height
that will solve the problem only when site is maxed since div height is a fixed valor if the site is at maxed all will show ok but if i shrink window the pic will get smaller both in width and height but the div will be the same size thus showing the greenish background as show in the example .

17195589

for-loop	loops
i was just asking myself what is faster i have a for-loop where i have to check a certain table column against my loops variable

17195930

the second option is to fetch all the rows i need and within my for-loop i run a foreach-loop and check if i have a valid match between my desired field and my loops variable

pbkdf2	salt
probably the best way is to use pbkdf2 using sha256 which will generate 256 bit output and a application specific salt iteration count

17196232
pbkdf2	salt
you should be aware that using an application specific salt removed quite a lot of the protection from pbkdf2 so you may require additional protection to alleviate this issue

width	margin	width	height	margin	height
besides setting width and height to 0 which might have some undesirable consequences another possible solution would be to give a negative left margin equal to exactly half the full box width and a negative top margin equal to exactly half the full box height where full width height width height + border + padding

17196807

for the box in your fiddle which has width height of 100 pixels and a 1 pixel border this would mean adding

17201082
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried it both in firefox and google-chrome it doesn t work

17201092
submit	submission
you should probably do submission with ajax not with submit method

17201106
post	get
unless you have some extra magic on the page that you are not showing this line will proceed to post get your form to whatever url you have configured in that form

17201106
post	get
to get around this if you truly need the form post in the middle you would need to post to a specific url and use that url as a trigger on page load to disable those elements

17201124
mono	xamarin.android
i try to understand how xamarin.ios monotouch and xamarin.android mono for android work

17201275

17201367
for-loop	loops
put in the a photo and scale it to row-height and check your row-width help confused how to do this with the django for-loop since the forloops just loops through the whole set

17201367

scale down the height of this row and the contained photos until the width fits done

17201424
toolbar	docking
my guess is you are asking this because you re struggling with a tbx - sptbx migration and you want docking areas which can handle both toolbar and dockable panels

17201424
hide	show
are designed to shrink a form can get too small or a user can drag a toolbar over another and a toolbar will show only the items it can and either hide the others or show a chevron a tiny button to open a menu containing the other items.

17201424
toolbar	docking
are meant to hold complex controls including standard vcl controls - they re meant as a toolbar and docking system-compatible way to build complex docked forms

17201424
width	height
of course if one particular edge of the form has only a dockable panel on it not a dockable toolbar then the toolbar dock is invisible width or height of 0 and so the panel sits next to the edge of the window too

17201438

17201473
debian	linux
the same behaviour is observed on 2 intel machines with latest debian linux version

17201486
int	chars
you are printing out the decimal representation of the int value of the chars in your array

17201486
int	chars
will print out 54 because the int value of chars 6 is 54

17201493
hash	salt
in whatever persistence mechanism database you re using you would store the resulting hash alongside the salt and number of iterations both of which would be plaintext

17201493
hash	salt
you would then compare the new plain text password hash that using the same salt and iterations then compare the byte sequence with the stored one

17201495
inherited	properties
and signednativeanalysis just inherited nativeanalysis with one extra properties

17201505
post	get
starting with angular i am trying to get data from the server and then post back modifications with resources

17201546
next	except
relying on nothing except the fact that they are next to each other is very fragile and your code will break if someone decides to change the layout and moves them into separate table cells for example

17201566
subnet	ip-address
i have a backend database to store the allocated subnet from which i can calculate the available ip-address space

17201601

which includes the specific hash algorithm used as well as the number of iterations the salt and the resulting key

17201720
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in firefox but but does not scroll within google-chrome can tell me why this wont work

17201754
hash	salt
basically you will do the same thing with the challenge password that you did with the original but use the salt stored in the database instead of generating a new one and then compare the two hash

17201754
hash	salt
another advantage of bcrypt is that the output of the gensalt function contains both the hash and the salt in one string

17201781
dictionary	map
you can create something like a two-level dictionary that is a dictionary which comprehends two dictionary that map the same data in reverse order

17201807
post	get
on the server side you would need to get access to the raw post data to obtain the json

17201807

as with content-type it s good practice to set the content-length

17201812

tunnel	vpn
another option is to set up a secure tunnel such as a vpn between the two servers networks and ensure that the routing for traffic between them is entirely through said tunnel

17201828
range	minimum
for range that have a different count you can refine the search until you can quickly do a full comparison within that range experimentation and benchmarking is the best way to determine the optimal minimum range size

my first idea is to create a uiview that will represent the badge and in a custom uitableviewcell i will add these rectangles as subviews

17207130

17207836
children	parent
if a div s children are set to inherit their parent s border settings then they ll get a border when you set their parent s border

17207836
children	parent
you also probably can t cycle through a parent s children and remove their borders because its possible the children actually need a border

17208125
memcached	apc
the difference between apc and memcached is that apc doesn t need a separate installation and is not distributed so you can t store the data on apc and get this data from a pool of servers

17208125
memcached	apc
memory is about as fast as apc and memcached because with this storage engine all the data is persisted in ram so if you reboot your server you are going to loose all the data stored in the table but it is very fast and fits your needs

17208230
post	get
when we used post method than data are encrypted so we have to used servletfileupload to get requested data and using fileitemiterator we can get all form data

width	height
plotoutput has height and width parameters as well

17209387
width	height
the width defaults to 100 meaning 100 of the available width in its container and the height defaults to 400px 400 pixels

17209387
width	height
renderplot s height and width parameters control the size of the generated image file in pixels but doesn t directly affect the rendered size in the web page

17209387
width	height
their default values are both auto which means detect and use the width height of the corresponding plotoutput

17209387
width	height
so once you ve set the width and height on plotoutput you generally don t need the width and height to be set on renderplot at all

getter	setter
you can always use csvbeanreader to avoid any casting - you ll just have to create a bean with 2 fields word string and count integer and their getter setter

17213336
superclass	subclassing
my best guess is that you have ended up with two different versions of bouncy castle on your classpath and it happened so that the classloader has loaded the superclass from one version and is now trying to load the subclassing from the other

17213347
qgraphicsitem	qobject
qgraphicsitem doesnt t inherits qobject then you should change myclass

17213363

here by size i mean total pixel count not the on-disk size as what matters is the decompressed size in ram not how big the image is on disk

when i get these transient objects back from the server and the user selects one it needs to be copied into the persistent store at that point various interactions beyond that point will load additional objects from the server and attempt to tie them back to the original object - which will fail if they re in two different object contexts

17213833
outputstream	inputstream
calling the close methods on the inputstream or outputstream of an httpurlconnection after a request may free network resources associated with this instance but has no effect on any shared persistent connection

17213925
tabs	tabpanel
i am having a tabpanel in which there are two tabs are there let say tab1 and tab2

17213980
post	get
in this case two tables will be updated every time but then if in future you want to get the number of post for a particular thread you can query the thread table which saves the overhead of querying the post records for a particular thread in the buffer and then getting a count

transform all private members in protected members attributes + methods and make a wrapper class inherits the tested class and call the protected method through public method

17214592
qgraphicsitem	qobject
as many of the answers already given have pointed out qgraphicsitem does not inherit from qobject which is used for signals and slots

17214592
qgraphicsitem	qobject
however rather than using multiple inheritance with qgraphicsitem and qobject you could simply derive from the qt class qgraphicsobject which is designed to provide a graphicsitem that requires signals and slots and is itself derived from qgraphicsitem

17214876
pathtoolongexception	argumentexception	notsupportedexception	argumentexception
and here you can catch argumentexception notsupportedexception directorynotfoundexception securityexception pathtoolongexception etc

17214912
min	max
if you can narrow down skiresort_locations prior to the calculation then this would save a fairly bit of time for example denormalising a bit but maybe you have a region table that joins to accomodation on region_id and it might contain the min and max latitude and longitude for that region which you could use for the join then put the complex calculation into the where clause instead

17215230
post	get
i have read several post where manual cache handling get nsdata save check and load is suggested

17215255
versioning	upgrade
this is unnecessary unless you plan to support the pre-release versioning of ie10 which of course is pointless as anyone using them would have upgrade to the real ie10 by now

17215333
jquery	scriptaculous
values include jquery prototype scriptaculous yahoo or

17215349
ienumerable	iqueryable
invoking asqueryable on an iorderedenumerable invokes the extension method on ienumerable and returns an iqueryable rather than iorderedqueryable

17215367
int	double
2 or change the double to an int and then throw

rss	feed
the type of data to be transmitted from the app will include addresses of rss feed and keywords and sundry metadata

17215426
rss	feed
the xml responses from the server will again consist of rss feed addresses keywords frequencies of the keywords and other metadata

17215442
pop-up	dialog
so i like to know the way to show progress dialog which will pop-up wherever i need it

17215484
int	double
in section 10.5.1 of stroustrup s new book the c++ programming language - fourth edition he says that before an arithmetic operation is performed integral promotion is used to create int out of shorter int types and similarly floating-point promotion is used to create double out of floats

17215521
portrait	landscape
works alright...on portrait but not landscape

17215523
post	get
regardless i get a 400 error when i attempt to post my data

by the while in your method you should use ni to get just the folder name because the list of names returned by the for include the directory .

17215565
google-chrome	safari
we have a image but it s showing flipped on google-chrome safari ios and iphone

17215567
width	height
to get around this i totally removed the imagesloaded check and had to explicitly set the height width parameter of the images in its container

17215567
width	height
this way even if images are loading you can trigger the masonry script which now gets the correct height width and thus no overlapping

17215600
ienumerable	iqueryable
it s a little roundabout but the relationship is that you turn an ienumerable to an iorderedenumerable using orderby and you change iqueryable to iorderedqueryable via the same method

17215609
printf	fgets
just a note fgets will read the newline character n too into your variables so when you print them like printf s n myvariable you will have an empty line between each line of output

17215617
range	max
if you know the range that n has generate a big random number of order 10 k where k max n

17215630
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari et al is honoring this field while the software that shows the image correctly doesn t

17215635
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in google-chrome firefox and ie 10

17215637
ubuntu	linux
i have managed to read a text file over an ssh channel using an ubuntu linux to serve as an ssh server

17215664
google-chrome	firefox
also note that if you re editing extension code directly you will need get firefox to refresh by using the reload all google-chrome extension using the tips mentioned in this answer before the debugger will list the updated code

17215674
folder	dir
suppose resources is a first dir under the src folder which contains message properties files that you need to convert

17215710
for-loop	arrays
use a single for-loop to iterate through the sorted arrays

17215713
sorting	grouping
calculating the sums would be a loop after sorting the array where you have to grouping by date and sum the temps

17215771
draggable	droppable
this feature makes use of html5 s draggable droppable features the new filereader object and jquery ajax

17215799
pop-up	dialog
a dialog will pop-up with your user-specific environment variables as well as your system-wide environment variables

17215809
put	get
you can get the real size and position in the onwindowfocuschanged method here is where you put the code

17215837
post	get
you must use the get method to achieve this not post

17215872
mouseout	mouseenter
it s because the mouseenter and mouseout are not working on same element you should do something like this

17215875
multiplying	add
if they were independent you wouldn t add them you would multiplying them

17215905
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
but in there i need to create some things in the delegate like a uinavigationcontroller that i can t use because i am using a uitabbarcontroller

17215926
fileinputstream	filewriter
after that you can use a filewriter or fileinputstream to save it in file .json and you can get it from other activitys using a jsonparser

17215955
client-side	server-side
i wanted to mostly response with json and then render them in client-side using javascript templates but one more option is to to render templates from server-side itself and just let the client javascript just load it and put into place

17215960
post	get
but see the specification for reasons why you should use post or get and use those to decide which you should be using

17215976
google-chrome	firefox
it s not the best but it works fine with google-chrome but on firefox and ie9 when it comes to breaking the word it overlaps text and loses track

17215978
portrait	landscape
i created a report using the designer and having set its masterpage orientation to landscape and page type to a4 there s no way to get it working using the report engine of my server it always renders with the portrait orientation

17216023
google-chrome	firefox
the control s login logout link only works in internet explorer but in firefox or google-chrome it s not clickable

17216081
udp	tcp	stateless	stateful
since you cannot send raw ip packets your server wouldn t allow it you want to use a transport protocol like tcp or udp tcp allows stateful connections while udp is stateless which both require a port number to distinct the process on the destination server

17216084
post	get
as far as i know sql profiler would not be able to send an http get post etc request to a web browser

17216115
gruntjs	yeoman
found here angular with yeoman 1.0 and gruntjs

17216116
int	boolean
another possible variant if your language allows you to cast a boolean condition to an int is to take advantage of that to reduce the number of source code lines

17216116
int	boolean
this works based on the assumption that casting a boolean false value to an int results in 0 and casting true results in 1

17216154
verilog	vhdl
if you program in vhdl or verilog some hardware circuit then for sure the first would give you the fastest result

17216168
int	double
try using int math.round to convert a double value to an int

17216212
google-chrome	firefox
this plays the video in firefox and google-chrome

17216212
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
however if i go to the url directly in any browser i can watch the movie in firefox + google-chrome and download it in ie + safari

17216232
interpreted-language	compiled-language
mostly interpreted-language are a bit slower compared with compiled-language but i guess the difference is almost negligible in coffeescript javascript because of node.js

17216232
yacc	bison
i agree with the guess given below that most compiler developers would answer because most of compiler related tools bison yacc emit c code

17216256
java.util.date	simpledateformat
but you could use the same simpledateformat to print out the java.util.date without its time component

17216277
put	get
there are examples on the page using both put and get methods

17216283
ienumerable	ilist
lists are usually processed purely by looping over the items inside them via the ilist -of-t optional and ienumerable -of-t optional apis

17216320
ubuntu	linux
i am using linux ubuntu

17216330
put	get
when i put in the above edited code i get error

17216351
post	get
that dialog would have to post to an unsecure page via ajax in order to avoid the redirect and the session cookie would get returned on that post

17216382
jar	war
i have a multi-module project which has a war and multiple jar dependencies

17216429
uiview	subviews
return a custom sub-class of uiview that contains subviews

17216440
dictionary	map
ocaml types for dictionary are hashtbl and map

17216442
decoder	encoder
it seems that there is something missing in the encoded path when i decoder the path and then encode the path again there is a additional -sign at the end it will also be added when i use the interactive encoder

17216454
width	height
is it possible to have values such as height width and margins set by using say a percentage of another element s values

17216465
prepare	execute
i wanted to generate a prepare statement and return a value my natural inclination was to use a function however apparently you cannot use prepare and execute from within functions

17216509
opera	firefox
looks like this has historical reasons by the time support for firefox opera and ie was added they all supported only 2d transforms

17216509
opera	firefox
support for 3d transforms was added a few months later in firefox and ie10 also supports it so it s actually only still neccessary for opera but i guess it s left there for backwards compatibility

17216527
portrait	landscape
if setting the view port width to 800px works on portrait like you said then maybe you can use a css media query to set the view port width to something better in landscape

17216554
oncreate	onstart
1 on starting the async task in oncreate everything is loaded but my dialog can only be shown when onstart is called which makes the whole process kind of pointless as there is a long pause with a blank screen then after everything has loaded the loading dialog flashes up for a split second before disappearing

17216554
oncreate	onstart
2 i can t move object loading creation etc to onstart because a it will be run again even when the app is resumed after being sent to the background which i don t want to happen and b when when calling restoring the savedinstancestate in oncreate i ll get a nullpointerexception because i m restoring properties of objects that won t have yet been created

17216559
hide	show
i use css to hide the default text and use a label to show what i want

17216566
screens	tablet
then simply decide a minimum screens size in inches cm to use the tablet ui

17216579
put	get
if i put the iis webapplication element directly into the component i get the following error the component element contains an unexpected child element iis webapplication

17216593
noexcept	throw
in c++11 throw x is deprecated the new form of exception specification is noexcept and can be noexcept true or noexcept false equivalent to throw and throw ... which is all that msvc supports

17216612
folder	directory
so i can switch back to the desktop directory and the type in just the folder name

17216629
width	height
you can try this - you can add width and height of a to the left and top to show box at proper position

17216634
int	boolean
one more thing you have different value int key value pair like string and boolean type so you have to use dictionary type

17216661
width	height
check your original image width and height

17216661
width	height
assuming width is bigger in size then height scale the image width to the holder width

17216661
width	height
center the image on your holder the width will fit perfectly section2 and the height will simply be cropped follow above and below the holder

17216729
put	get	post	get	post	put
i d like to expose my nodes via a rest interface using get to query by id post to save a node with its related nodes and put to update a node and its related nodes

17216729
put	get	post	get	post	put
get is working just fine but i m having an implementation question about the post and put case

17216752
stateless	stateful
name attribute of the stateless stateful annotation defines the name of the bean

17216752
stateless	stateful
mappedname attribute of the stateless stateful annotation is used to map the bean to a jndi name

17216767
std	ostream
the reason that the operator returns a a modifiable reference to an ostream object rather than a copy or void is that it allows for chaining for instance a common example with std cout as the ostream object

17216778
cout	cin
try to use std cout not printf cin getline not scanf

17216881
children	parent
i want to disable menu parent and children with user s permission

17216953
apache	nginx
however substituting nginx for apache and php-fpm for php5 caused a break

17216984
hide	show
initially hide the span.on button click hide the input copy the text to span and show the span

17217005
post	get
when i post the form via jquery i get warning undefined index

17217014
children	parent
one thing to note here is that you wouldn t need to continue disabling any children when you disable a parent because with enabled set to false it s not going to be allowed to fly out any children

17217018
std	ostream
first reason std ostream s are not copyable in general in c++11 the copy constructor is actually delete d

17217018
std	ostream
second reason all the actual stream objects you will use derive from std ostream

17217018
std	ostream
s would only hold string1 in this case because when you returned the std stringstream by copy of std ostream the returned object is no longer a std stringstream object and calling on that passes string2 into a temporary object which just gets destroyed by the end

17217024
accessor	properties
something similar happens when you are trying to access properties â 11.2.1 properties accessor spec

17217091
yacc	bison
i suspect that the majority of them will tell you that common compiler-writing software yacc flex bison etc produce c code

17217179
udp	tcp
data transmission between peers and server are on tcp while data is sent on udp between peers

17217186
sse	avx
this is a class to use sse avx

17217186
sse	avx
but you ll find the best answer if you add the tags sse and avx to your question

17217206
versioning	upgrade
i am trying to upgrade sonar 3.3.2 to sonar 3.5.1 and getting this error fail to request server versioning

google-chrome	firefox
it works with other browsers like firefox and google-chrome but not with ie10

17217268
getter	setter
is it necessary to lock getter and setter in general when multiple threads will access a property field through get set-functions

17217333
int	chars	ord	chr
the chr and ord functions for transforming between int and single chars to name two can deal with int values larger than 255

17217336
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
the code works really well in firefox but there are some inconsistencies in google-chrome and safari webkit-based browsers in general i assume since they both appear to behaving similarly

17217339
portrait	landscape
everything works fine when i test it on my computer but for some reason if i take a picture on ipad ipod iphone in portrait the image with the watermark gets rotated to a landscape mode

17217399
hash	md5
the problem is that due to the fact that i receive the password and the username from another service i receive them in hash form encrypted with md5 because they can t be passed in clear from a service to another

17217438
disk	ram
nodejitsu gives you 2 gb of disk space 256 mb of ram and unlimited traffic

17217444
asterisk	freeswitch
there s a page on the freeswitch wiki addressing most of these asterisk to freeswitch questions rosetta stone

17217465
maven	pom.xml
i set up a maven project and my pom.xml has many dependencies for the apache directory server and api artifacts

17217470
post	get
i m think the only way to get the circle position post that transform is to call getbbox

17217529
client-side	server-side
as of right now i am validating checkbox list in the model by overriding the isvalid function so it will get validated on the server-side but i was wondering if there s a way to add validation on the client-side

17217537
getter	setter
so there may not be getter and setter methods created for your ognl expression on your respective action class

17217603
post	get
one way for you get your goal is use a sql server procedure get max id from your table post and plus 1 and you will get you next id

17217609
put	get
when i put the same plugin 2 times on the page the plugin i put on the page first will work fine but the second one won t get any results

17217619
kerberos	ntlm
i saw a post on stack overflow defective token detected error ntlm not kerberos with kerberos spring security ie active directory and thought someone can help me with our situation

17217619
kerberos	ntlm
i think when we login to the domain we are authenticated using kerberos not ntlm i don t know whether it is correct or not

17217660
post	get
i am sending post requests instead of get

17217697
int	double
edit removed some unused variables from earlier attempts and also i should mention that the reason i am casting my xmove and ymove to int is that while they are double whenever they are used they are casted

17217743
mojolicious	catalyst
and yet another way is to use perl web frameworks like dancer mojolicious and catalyst

17217757
inherited	properties
i also dislike the use of inherited in service models for trying to dry properties which hides intent in your service layer which is your most important contract

17217766
width	margin
problem is this that the left div gets padding margin automatically as i increase width in

17217766
width	margin
so at 65 width the left div is having some padding or margin and is not perfectly aligned with the right div i tried to padding margin 0 but no luck

17217780
google-chrome	firefox
with those corrections its working fine here ie google-chrome and firefox

17217822
arrayfire	thrust
i am new to arrayfire and cuda development in general i just started using arrayfire a couple of days ago after failing miserably using thrust

17217826
hide	show
given some basic html structures you can recreate the toggle show hide capacities of javascript implementations

17217826
mouse	keyboard
unfortunately the closest alternative native css has to a clicked selector is the active or focus pseudo-classes the first selector of which will cease to match once the mouse-button is released the second of which will cease to match once the given element is no longer focused by either keyboard or mouse focusing elsewhere in the document

17217845
decoder	encoder
i have a rough idea that that you have to write at least a demuxer first and then the specific encoder and decoder etc

17217852
spaces	delimiter
i found the answer remove the spaces from the delimiter

17217866
post	get
once user clicks sign-in button on page i call a post method of registration servlet to get authorization url and store some parameters in session

17217931

if not you will need to install the folder to the blender modules directory of your install and then try running it

17217936
put	get
if a put the first composer to render to screen i get the correct values for the limits but when i put the second composer i get the wrong values for the limits

17217973
onmousedown	onmousemove
so you should move disabling of scrolling from onmousemove to onmousedown

17217982
width	height
by looking at the bitmap pixel width and height i want to be able to change the property of my picture to match one of the three classes

17218089
hash	salt
i am using the following methods to create a salt and hash password from the crypto lib in nodejs

17218172
post	get
for instance a resource that says something like here s how a dictionary is supplied to a controller via both http get and post

17218260
superclass	subclassing
a superclass an always reference a subclassing object

17218289
profiling	instrumentation
i recommend you learn how to use instrumentation to profiling your app it s kind of complicated but a lot of fun once you get the hang of it

17218350
subtract	add
the exported excel needs to have 5 977.71 in the background so that they can manipulate like they can add or subtract data and change rounding to million

17218380
textarea	textbox
it correctly sets focus on the textarea but character 1 ascii code 49 doesn t appear in the textbox

17218381
int	chars
some suggests storing it in int is better but other suggests tinyint and enum but some others suggests store it in a chars 1 m for male and f for female

17218383
spaces	delimiter
note in the string input example you would likely want to use a delimiter for instance separating the string input at instances of white spaces

17218394
google-chrome	firefox
the effect is working in google-chrome and internet explorer as intended but i seem to be having issues getting the code to execute in firefox

17218396
post	get
the form works well and post correctly using get to the current page

17218403
ant	maven
note i am using maven instead of ant for build and dependencies

17218416
toggleclass	each
then once a column is dynamically added on click on each cell i have a toggleclass function to switch a css add_week_bg class function to display it being marked as show below

17218435

on a windows 2003 iis 6 webserver with a virtual directory pointing to a windows 2003 dfs folder 2 dfs server nodes i get 401 access error for the anonymous user

17218435

interestingly after rebooting the web server all other folder and virtual directory are set to active on dfs1.production.domain.com share active except this one

17218528
put	get	post	get	post	put
i know that i should use post put delele get but i can do everything with just post as u saw

17218528
post	put
send actions through http post put delete update to a resource a user an event

17218616
children	parent
there s also no reason why you cannot have similar controller logic within a parent dialog to control its children and don t forget dialogresult is great for simple forms

17218627
profiler	visualvm
visualvm has an excellent profiler

17218667
min	max
every field in the select list must either be in the group by clause or inside an agregation function max min sum avg etc.

17218739
post	get
the method get is idempotent as it just asks for the resource and requesting a resource over and over again cannot cause any problem but post consists of form submission and entering the form data more than once can cause serious problems

17218739
post	get
get requests are less secure because all the parameters are visible in the url while post requests are more secure as they are not shown anywhere in the url

17218741
jar	war
i ve got an ear with jar and war and a beans.xml with my spring definitions

17218788
post	get
imho there is no classification of post and get methods on the basis of heavy operations

17218788
post	get
get is idempotent whereas post is not

17218788
post	get
get is idempotent meaning thereby that the same operation applied multiple times should yield the same result where as with a post it has side effects

17218788
post	get
get as the name suggests is used to get something back from the server whereas post should be used to post data to the server for further processing

17218788
post	get
with get you can post limited data to the server using the query string and again they are limited as urls cannot be of infinite length

17218795
gruntjs	package.json
the gruntjs documentation states that it and any plugins should be included in the devdependencies section of package.json

17218828
hide	show
only display sort show and hide columns select row for some action

17218953
pop-up	dialog

it doesn t matter whether you do it in a get or post request

17219007
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i have a dropdownlistfor that allows an admin to assign a user to a role and it is supposed to automatically do so when the index is changed but unfortunately its not doing anything until i click a checkbox that is totally unrelated

17219159
free	malloc
whenever you malloc just be sure to keep a pointer on it so that you may manipulate it or free it

17219185
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval and settimeout can be used instead for creating animations but they cannot interact with the browser and eventually end up hogging up the cpu and the performance is also quite slow

think of this as adding more empty pixels to the width and height of the canvas rather than stretching the existing pixels

17219501

n-gram	words
but i can t try to use a phrasequery approach for a real world example i think i have to use a words n-gram approach like the shingleanalyzerwrapper but as my input documents can be quite large the combinatorics will become hard to handle.

17219664
free	malloc
malloc simply returns you memory from heap and its the responsibility of the user process to free this chunk of memory by calling the free system call

17219675

and then in the python use some sort of post variable like in php and get the data

17220032
children	parent
i have a hierarchical table that i need to query and display the results grouped by the parent with associated children

17220059
int	chars
qstring number doesn t have an overload that takes a chars so your input is being promoted to an int

17220078
put	get
i wasn t aware of this and tried to put it directly into the code to get a clearer error message

17220154
std	ostream
and this isn t even possible since it s not possible to copy a std ostream

17220155
for-loop	arrays
all of the benchmarks that i have performed show that a simple for-loop that only contains something like an arrays fill is typically twice as fast if it is decrementing versus if it is incrementing

std	ostream
since you do not need to control the lifetime to std cout you could simply pass a std ostream raw pointer or reference around

17220313
apache	nginx
you should be able to set up apache nginx whatever in the normal way and simply forward all traffic to on the host and port you are running on

17220324
std	ostream
the requirement you have is strange but you can of course store a pointer to std ostream in a provided you take care of a proper disposer action

i would prefer to do it without writing callbacks myself for keyup and keydown

17220661

i know this function cgrectmake x y height width but apparently x and y cannot have negative values

17220672
maven	pom.xml
you can set the value for maven properties in your pom.xml like

17220672
maven	pom.xml
if you choose this you need to configure the liquibase maven plugin by replacing the conofiguration section in the pom.xml like

17220674

the website works fine in google-chrome and firefox but strangely when some one uses internet explorer the user is kicked back to login page each time he clicks on to go to a new page

17221158
maven	pom.xml
well you can script that and use the -f switch of maven to specify which pom.xml to build one after the other.

17221158
maven	pom.xml
if you want to stick with maven you can make a dedicated pom.xml for invoking the sequence of your build by using the maven exec plugin

17221184
post	put
and here is a post of mine where i made a sort of hands on walkthrough for migrations - possible issues and all put together in one place that i could think of

17221202
comparator	icomparer
i am using comparator and a icomparer

equals	compareto
compareto defines whether your base student is greater than less than or equals to your studenttocompare and you can define these with any criteria you please

17221209
icomparable	compareto
the reason you re getting errors when you don t write a compareto is because if you didn t have one your class wouldn t actually implement icomparable

kerberos	ntlm
if the user is on the domain he she will authenticates with adfs just like if it was another app on the intranet configured with windows integrated auth through kerberos ntlm

17221363
children	parent
alternatively you could just fetch the children by using the property on the parent object and store that in an array sorted by your sort descriptors

17221421
put	get
sonum what you want is to put upload something to user hard-disk s selected location but as it is not an ftp access so anything user downloads will go to the location that is defined in browser s download location one can change that by going to settings of there particular browser or user get a choice to select explicit location if he she is using any download tool

17221473
int	double
rather than try rounding to the nearest 0.5 double it round to the nearest int then divide by two

cout	cin
it works in c++ using cin cout

17221536
width	height
i can define width in percentages but what about height

17221539
ssl	https
it is virtually impossible more accurately computationally infeasible to derive the private key from the public key assuming the key length isn t really short of course otherwise ssl tls https would be broken

17221601
loops	while-loop	for-loop	loops	for-loop	while-loop
you can also try to use application.doevents inside your loops in timer1_tick function if you have a for-loop or while-loop inside the function

17221614
width	height
that shrinks the report width and height

17221616
mouse	trackpad
as far as i know there is no shortcut for that behavior but - as in any web view - you can swipe with your finger 1 finger on the magic mouse 2 finger on the trackpad

17221658
min	max
i find myself needing to set min-width and min-height too at times which is better to do on a containing element ie7 at least has issues with height auto and min max widths

17221661
sorting	filtering
attributes are stored directly in the index and can be used for sorting filtering etc

17221662

hash	md5
basically i ve got a game server in which had the password hash as sha1 and another as md5 for when new users registered an account

17221691
hash	md5
basically i want it to when they change their password it replaces the md5 with the sha1 hash password

17221727
put	get
frustrated by the many limitations and compatibility issues of css and finding myself constantly needing to write javascript code to get my webpages to layout the way i wanted suggests you ve either been using css wrong or have not actually put in enough time learning the ins and outs of css to make it do what you want setting up good universal css is hard -just like programming js- and there are a million ways to do it wrong - just like programming js

17221755
post	get
it generates the axis fine can t post an image but i can t figure out how to get the distance

17221772

i want to populate a spinner with the elements inside my arraylist but if the boolean is true i want to show all the elements otherwise i wish to hide some elements in a range

17221796

17221807
stdout	stderr
but if an ampersand is concatenated to execute it in background it seems to execute but no output is printed neither on stdout nor on stderr and even a redirection to a file inside the braces does not work...

17221827
children	parent	box-sizing	border-box
also i feel i should point out that point #1 and #2 can be easily be done in css by using position relative on the parent and position absolute on the children and point #3 can be solved by setting box-sizing border-box on the child

17221842
min	max
i am using canny parameters as 0 20 for min and max threshold

17221885
spaces	delimiter
without all # is just added to the already defined white spaces delimiter etc

17221959
libstdc++	libc++
however it s not a good idea to link libc++ and libstdc++ libraries executables together - they are incompatible

17221969
google-chrome	firefox
it s either lower or higher in both firefox and google-chrome by one pixel

17221990
width	height
i am fairly certain you can get by with just adjusting the width of the img tag but you can also use percentages when dealing the height

17222006
spaces	linefeed
try making the connectionstring on one line i think the linefeed spaces is throwing it off

17222032
google-chrome	firefox
the transition work fine in google-chrome but not in firefox nor i.e

17222043
int	double
you re dividing by an int so it first computes it as an int and then converts it to a double

17222054
try-catch	exception-handling
the better way is to just wrap the code vulnerable to throwing exception-handling inside the try-catch block

17222084
opera	google-chrome
for non-firefox google-chrome browsers i added -o-transition which will let older opera versions work and transition which will let ie10 work

17222085
int	double
dividing two int will be cast to an int before it is assigned to the double

17222137
put	get
whether you should put the call to calculate within the try block depends on whether you want to handle an unchecked exception from calculate in the catch block here or allow it to get thrown outwards

17222141
put	get
after i run the code i do not get an error message but my code does not run the way i want it to and i believe it is because no data is being put to the database which is what the rest of the code relies on

i am using woocommerce for a shopp cart and i have a basic php question

17222336
sorting	filtering
it means that don t caring any filtering or sorting a custom ghost row should be following each normal row all the time which holds data from - for example - last year

17222336
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
i mean don t caring filtering or sorting like all the filtering sorting grouping should work based only on the standard rows and the ghost rows are jsut dumbly following their corresponding standard row after it

17222336
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
without custom binding it is impossible to implement it because in every standard data binding mechanism the grid applies sorting filtering grouping to all of its visible rows and i have no way to tell it that these are just ghost rows

17222336
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
i was confused until custom binding feature but now i can simply query the standard data in the getdata handler make a list from it and insert my ghost rows all after sorting filtering or grouping

17222336
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
as a summary with custom binding as i interpret basically you can process the ui request sort filtering etc. in any way you can put any data in the gridview as a result just as if it were a pure html table but you still have the great user interface for sorting filtering grouping paging etc

17222369
pop-up	dialog
when i attempt to open my windows forms application i ll call it myapplication.exe on a machine other than my dev machine a dialog window pop-up saying

17222388

there s still one weirdness when resizing the browser the height of div.product scales as it should but the width remains fixed at the original width of the image contained within

17222439
folder	directory
for what it s worth i got the skipped paths error when i accidentally ran the svn update command from a folder that didn t actually have anything checked out - i remembered after having come here looking for answers that it was only the child directory that i had checked stuff out in

17222697
width	height
max-height max-width will restrict the div s height width to max of the specified value

17222697
width	height
if you specify your actual height width relative to the parent element window size then it will re-size accordingly

17222847
post	get
the subqueries get the latest date on for threads and post

17222847
post	get
one advantage is that the threads and post are treated independently so you get the most recent thread and separately the most recent post

17222847
post	get
you can get the most recent post on a given thread by changing the order by conditions in the group_concat

17222871
width	height
even if your infowindow content is dynamic you may be able to pick width and height values that are close to values when the content is loaded

17222871
width	height
here try to give projectsub a width and height value

17222884
daemon	cron
my suggestion is that you have your feeds downloaded on a regularly basis you could set up a cron job or write a python daemon and stored somewhere on your disk a plain text file so you just need to display them at your terminal s startup echo would probably be the easiest and fastest

17222891
width	height
the size structure contains both a height and a width

17222896
post	get
i m instead sending the post to a generic page and utilizing the information i get in the form like so

in particular if i click and drag it to a position it does update the plot but then the scrollbar move back its starting position instead of staying put

17222989

width	height
the users will be uploading a picture of unknown dimensions selecting an area that is in 10 13 ratio width x height and then filepicker needs to crop their image before resizing it to 100x130px

17223047
folder	directory
to test this i copied and pasted the classes and functions packages into the deploy_test folder removed the package_dir argument from setup.py removed the manifest file and empty folder and re-ran setup.py sdist and got similar results - the formerly common directory was missing but the classes and functions directory now appear in the deploy_test-1.0 directory but are still empty as is the deploy_test subdirectory below deploy_test-1.0

17223075
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome we can send image data to server via this code

17224279
lodash	underscore.js
i ve also noticed that backbonejs can be used with either underscore.js or lodash

17224308

17224440
int	double
you re performing an int division then the result is getting casted to a double but it s too late you already lost precision.if you just cast one of the two operands to a double the other one will be also promoted to a double and you ll get a floating point value as result

17224476
hide	show
i need to access the column menu function only the ability to show hide columns from a button outside the grid

17224811
opcache	apc
because opcache is designed to replace the apc module it is not possible to run them in parallel in php

17224811
opcache	apc
however it means that if you are currently using apc to store other data through the apc_store function you will not be able to do that if you decide to use opcache

17224811
memcached	apcu
you will need to use another library such as either apcu or yac which both store data in shared php memory or switch to use something like memcached which stores data in memory in a separate process to php

17224811
opcache	apc
also opcache has no equivalent of the upload progress meter present in apc

17225686
hash	salt
since bcrypt is the only algorithm currently defined you can probably assume it s the default but a quick way to verify would be to make a simple php script that hash the same string twice once with each option and with a fixed salt and prints the resulting hash

17225704
oncreate	findviewbyid
findviewbyid in oncreate

int	boolean
if in future you add some non-transient field to the class and you are trying to deserialize it by the older version of class then the defaultreadobject method will neglect the newly added field similarly if you deserialize the old serialized object by the new version then the new non transient field will take default value from jvm if its object then null else if primitive then boolean to false int to 0 etcâ

google-chrome	firefox
it does work for me in firefox and google-chrome

i have a list from the type superclass a and in that list there are multiple objects from two subclassing subclassing b and subclassing c and want to sort them alphabetically and then filter the objects from either subclassing something like this

17235937
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
edit i was getting an error due to a method i had left in one of the subclassing that was already inherited from the superclass and i thought the error had anything to do with the structure of the because i wasn t certain if it was correct but i already had the code as all you guys told me but thanks anyway

ubuntu	linux
p.s. i use c++ on linux ubuntu 12.04 and used libreoffice base to create my database

17236098
super	implements
you need to implements comparable only on the super class

17236098
superclass	subclassing
once implements the subclassing will use the same method in your superclass to compare instances

17236134
post	get
one thing if i get your problem correct is make an ajax call from your page which will make post call to your sevlet

17236154
put	get
i try to get select from two tables and put some data from one to other with ussing where

17236163

user is upgrade to the newer versioning of the application and it re-launches it

17236434
google-chrome	firefox
i have used both firefox and google-chrome to test this

17236448
super	implements
you need to implements comparable only on the super class.because once you will implements sub class then you can also compare instances using that method in super class

17236448
super	implements
so my advice is to implements comparable on super class

17236480
post	put
so i put the post function like this

17236484
sorting	filtering
here you can find my example with two filtering and alphabetical sorting

17236499
sorting	filtering
doing the sorting and filtering in php will not make your application faster it will make it slower for sure mysql is optimized to be very fast given the right indexes so you should certainly use it when you can

17236600
subscript	superscript
in my wpf application c# based i need to have some labels with superscript and subscript as usually in various maths operations

17236618
folder	directory
to get the script s folder as opposed to the current directory use

use typography.variants which meant to have subscript superscript style rendering

17236896
post	get
you can use only one at a time get or post

17236896
post	get
also get is used for limited data around 2 kb and post for unlimited data to be retrieved

17236898
addition	multiplication
now the nice thing about having everything logically indexed is you can combine your slices with addition or multiplication to get the different combination frequencies

17236949
hash	md5
when i encrypt something in md5 with java it removes all the 0s from the hash which isn t ok for me because it doesn t work with php since php doesn t remove the 0s

finally i noticed that the gridview items must have a width height in order for incremental loading to work

17237020
getter	setter
or getter setter like

17237020
getter	setter
the formatter always breaks the lines and i fear that i can t tell him to format them to a single line but is there a possibility to tell him to not break the lines for getter setter at least

17237024
getter	setter
are you sure you have made an empty constructor getter setter that the java class implements serializable

17237115
build.gradle	gradlew
i am using the pmd gradlew plugin in a build.gradle file

17237160
crypt	hash
this will always result in a hash using the 2y crypt format which is always 60 characters wide

17237160
hash	salt
if omitted a random salt will be generated by password_hash for each password hash

17237250
width	height
i ve found a similar jsfiddle but it s doing it on the width instead on the height and i d like the div top to stay fixed and shrink from bottom to top

17237262
getter	setter
however clearly there are getter and setter for the variables involved so they can t be declared final

17237270
apache	nginx
the default installation of ckan the one done via package install sets up ckan running on apache with mod_wsgi with nginx on top

expander	grid
so i have a parent expander that contains a grid with two controls another expander and another grid

17237309
google-chrome	safari
couldn t find the exact reason this is happening but webkit browsers ie google-chrome and safari are notorious for their animation artifacts on rich pages

17237352
folder	directory
i have a folder in trunk with old directory structure and branch where several directory were grouped as subfolders of new folder

17237358

if i put it outside this if statement but still in my page load event i get the correct values but no matter what i select when i leave the drop-down it reverts back to the top item instead of the selected item

17237379
inherited	properties
however for special cases like customercreatevm and customereditvm i would create the commmon properties in base class customervm and inherited it and for more readability i will keep them in one file

17237408
setinterval	settimeout
ok to fix this i changed from using the recursive settimeout method to using setinterval which is inherently recursive and it solved the problem

17237411
put	get
then on the rails side you can get rid of the check action from the routes and controller and just use the default end-points in this case when you do the commit from the ember app it will put the changes to your rails app using sentences#update sentences id update.json

17237482
folder	dir
the runnable impl creates a new classloader and then checks if there is a new version of the jar file inside a folder if so it will copy it to another dir if not it uses the existing version load it on the classpath of the new classloader and execute it

17237542

ant	maven
my plan was or is to migrate the whole project from ant to maven since new components are planned and i would like to avoid these problems in the future and well because it is just horrible the way it is now

17237679

especially when the soa framework must use its own ant files - therefore a combination of ant and maven would be necessary

post	get
i ve always used encodeuricomponent on get requests with ajax but i never knew you had to use that function with post requests as well

17237874
ant	maven
besides something that really helped me when migrating was the possibility to divide the maven project in modules which i initially used to replicate the ant structure i had one maven module for each build.xml file making the first stage of the migration simpler and then i changed the module aggregation to make it more meaningful and more maven-like

17237964
typedef	struct
but if you typedef struct c1 then the typedef name was not allowed to alias an existing function

min and max timestamp are simple but to find the count of rows where speed was zero and not zero i have done an ugly hack

17238358
maven	pom.xml
there are maven plugins in existence that will auto-generate pom.xml files from eclipse plugins

17238363

using the -f flag with curl means to upload a file as a post variable using multipart form-data encoding - which doesn t make any sense with a put request

17238449
apache	nginx
newer versions of php do include a a built in web server to run code so technically you don t need a web server but you should probably set up apache nginx to mimic what your code would run on in a production environment for less deployment headaches

17238452
google-chrome	firefox
if you want to properly test a web application it is better to use the most popular browsers to test it in such as ie firefox and google-chrome

17238463
portrait	landscape
i answered a so question about how to create 3 tabs using separate fragments and as i byproduct i believe i may have answered your question as my code does allow tab rotation so they exist in either portrait or landscape

17238686
ggplot2	gtable
this is because ggplot2 uses gtable to fit the various components together and gtable has no sense of justification within one cell

17238691
filtering	grouping
one of the problems right now is that although there is a parent-child relationship i am filtering on the same field for all grouping

17238702

17238932

put	get
if you want to make sure the letters touch you ll have to get the glyph outline data instead and either use clever algorithms that find projection points for glyph 1 on glyph 2 or use a naive minmax algorithm where you put the two next to each other rasterise them with a transparent color see if any of the pixels coloured are darker than they should be if so move the letters apart by distance d try again if they don t overlap move back together by distance d 2 if they overlap move out again by d 4 if they don t move in more by d 4 then correct with d 8 d 16 etc until the distance is less than a pixel

the problem is that ant allows developers to do wild and crazy things that you have to completely redo in maven

17239578
maven	pom.xml
maven only allows for one per pom.xml 1

17239578
ant	maven
the head of system architecture decided that maven is new and good while ant must be bad and evil

17239578
ant	maven
no ant must go and maven is the way

17239578
maven	pom.xml
this macro did everything the standard task did but it also embedded the pom.xml in the jar just like maven builds do

17239578
ant	maven
using ivy cleaned up our ant build process and allowed us many of the advantages we would have in maven without having to take a complete restructuring

17239578
ant	maven
the funny thing is that once you have integrated your ant projects with ivy turning them into maven projects isn t that difficult

17239578
ant	maven
but you will never have a maven project that builds four different unrelated jars while this is quite common in ant

hash	salt
i was reading about the new password hashing api in php 5.5 it s has hashing function password_hash which makes providing salt optional which means it would make salt automatically but since the salt needs to be same for one password for it to be able to hash again for comparison it must generate salt from the hash or from the password itself

just set a width on the container button-sub heading then set a width and auto margin on the button

17244053
width	margin
you have to have a width set on elements you want to center with margin auto

17244099
put	get
you need to specify the number of contiguous elements from the start of the collection you want to get you cannot put a lambda expression

17244102
min	max
in this update i attempt a kludge whereby i generate the chart once calculate the desired column width based on the width min max of the generated chart then generate it again

17244109
range	minimum
i a pretty sure that scaling in libsvm works like that subtracting the value from the minimum and then dividing by the range for particular feature

17244123
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in google-chrome and firefox

17244134
uiview	subviews
fdgraphview is a uiview subclass but uses uiscrollview also and works normally when added as a a subviews of the viewcontroller view

17244201
versioning	upgrade
if you are talking about client reports stored locally in a vb.net application i could potentially guess that they may have been upgrade to 2012 which uses .net 4.5 and you potentially are trying a lower framework but that is just a guess on the last one and would be highly unlikely since .net carries previous versioning with it and i would not think it would upgrade reports without telling you

17244219
post	get
i have a cgi server side script that accepts get and post with login parameters

17244219
post	get
so the plan is to use perl lwp and send login parameters in get and post and compare the results

17244228
dlsym	dlopen
track it down replace dlopen ing dlsym ing with regular function calls and link against a static version of libxfixes

17244281
typedef	struct
code such as this comes directly from c most likely via copy paste where the struct keyword is required before the name of any type that is defined as a struct unless you add the appropriate typedef statement

17244308
width	height
texture coordinates map x y to the space 0-1 in width and height texture space

17244387
hide	show
if any of the other non-corresponding divs are visible they should hide and then show the corresponding div

17244416
vbo	vao
despite binding the vao vbo and enabling the attribute its resulting in the invalid operation

17244455
rss	feed
if you wish to know more about implementing rss feed you should consider making a seperate question

17244456
put	get
consequently if you put three consecutive values from the recurrence into a column vector v and compute mv you get back a new column vector holding the latter two values from the recurrence plus the next value in the recurrence

17244507
mouseover	mouseout
you have to add a class and add remove that on the mouseover mouseout events manually

17244525
accessor	properties
alternatively to support a fluent design add explicit accessor methods for the properties ismean and mean bool

17244527
lxml	beautifulsoup
i m having trouble making lxml work with beautifulsoup

17244527
lxml	beautifulsoup
now i m getting this error when i try to use lxml with beautifulsoup

17244586
children	parent
what this is supposed to show is id 1 is the parent and id 2 and 3 are children which belongs to id 1 and id 1 2 and 3 all belong to the grandparent 100

17244590
free	malloc
the most important rule of using free is that you must never pass any pointer to free unless that pointer was obtained by or as if by malloc

17244590
free	malloc
some libraries may document that they return a pointer obtained by malloc and that you are supposed to pass it to free when you no longer need it but unless you see this contract in writing never pass pointers obtained by library functions to free

17244596
put	get
i first attempted to use the configuration code in config initializers fast_gettext.rb but did not get any results so i decided to put it in config application.rb to see if i could get it to work

17244599
entity-relationship	diagram	erd	entity-relationship	erd	diagram
it is called rails erd entity-relationship diagram for ruby on rails

17244641
put	get
when the script hits a new organization name it should put all the pieces together and then get started on the next organizaton s email message

17244643
post	get
i ran the compiler with the -e -g3 flags to get a dump of the post preprocessor text the compiler sees and nowhere in the 2.2 megabyte text file is there any of these four definitions g++ says i m violating

17244646
post	get
a workaround is to change type to post or get and then it will successfull call the php

17244669
versioning	upgrade
i m currently having problems with the older versioning so i figured it s best to upgrade and try that one because i can always switch back

17244704
mp4	h.264
you can however enable mp4 h264 support which is described here using mp3 mp4 h.264 using the video audio tags

17244707
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

17244713
filewriter	bufferedwriter
for some reason when i create a new bufferedwriter and filewriter in my program even if i haven t used it to write anything yet it clears the file i have selected of all it s text

17244713
filewriter	bufferedwriter
if i create a new filewriter and bufferedwriter then this loop isn t even run at least i do not believe so as i don t get the encryption of line or the original contents of the file printed which prints if i haven t created the new filewriter bufferedwriter.

17244728
jaydata	datajs
i would strongly recommend relying on a library for this if you re in a language where one is available for example in .net there s the wcf data services client and in javascript there s datajs or jaydata

17244745
hide	show
so i want to be able to hide all the options and then show only the ones that don t include hello_ in their value

17244751
int	chars
or if i changed m_ctrl from an unsigned chars to an int again the problem is obviously fixed due to alignment

17244776
int	chars
read every chars loop ask if it is an int add it to a new string if not continue to next chars do this till the end of the stream

17244802
google-chrome	firefox
what i have found is that in firefox the problem is partially solved but not in google-chrome

17244802
google-chrome	firefox
i have opened the jsfiddle code both in firefox and google-chrome

17244802
mouseup	mousedown
the bad condition in firefox is that when you highlight some text and move the mouse from the yellow to green region mousedown and mouseup will be detected but not the click

17244807
post	get
when i press save post- i get an error showing an empty post and alert saying

17244807
post	get
i know what i m trying to do is simple and i don t get what is causing the empty post

17244811
width	height
i m trying to get width and height of element s background-image

17244829
base	fractions
ultimately a working base proof of concept of the project can be found here we are teaching fractions with music but we are trying to implement the idea of a factory where beats are created and can be dragged onto a measure

17244829
google-chrome	firefox
since we are using cutting edge html5 audio we are limited to google-chrome only so the firefox problems shouldn t be an issue

17244836
mouse	keyboard
no but you can hover your mouse over the project name e hit delete on your keyboard

17244861
firefox	safari
this is only for safari as doing the same thing in firefox is a lot easier.

17244864
folder	directory
an important thing to remember here is that by default your app is deployed to a folder in the program files directory and also that standard users by default don t have write access to this location

17244874
button	checkbox
this works fine when the page loads it does some changes on some radio checkbox button

17244945
typedef	typename
does using have any more overhead in c specifically compiling using avr-gcc for an avr mcu than doing typedef unsigned char typename

17244948
nmatrix	sciruby
when i compile nmatrix or the sciruby rb-gsl fork both of these work fine and have no problem locating ruby.h

17244992
firefox	safari
this is only for safari as doing the same thing in firefox is a lot easier.

17244995
google-chrome	firefox
works perfect in firefox not so perfect in google-chrome but i think i ll be able to fix that myself as the buttons do their job but ie totally ignores the buttons which are labels to be exact

17244996
mouseleave	mouseenter
i ve bound mouseenter mouseleave events to the .child-svg elements but i m finding that the events are firing when my mouse goes to the whitespace in between the elements

17244996
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter
my understanding of mouseenter mouseleave is that they shouldn t fire when the cursor enters leaves the child elements -- this seems like behaviour you d expect from mouseover mouseout

17244996
mouseleave	mouseenter
and of course what i d ideally like is for the mouseenter mouseleave events only to fire when i ve left each section which i ve delineated using colours

17244996
width	height
edit i tried giving the .child-svg elements a height and width but that didn t seem to work either

17245006
post	put
i understand that empty white space below text generally serves as part of that line in windows--for example put your cursor just below this post and click and drag--you will select the last line

17245008
post	get
get the id of your post eg

17245008
post	get
split the id on underscore character and get the second part first part indentifies post author

17245008
post	get
you can test it with graph explorer - to get shared post you need read_stream permissions on your access token if i m not mistaken

17245012
screens	tablet
this would be the nested layout at bigger screens sizes like in a tablet landscape

17245052
public	protected
2 as soon as eclipse compiler see override statement it tries to look for relevant protected or public method in super class which is not there

17245098
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
the windows authentication function works well with internet explorer ie firefox firefox and safari but it does not work with google-chrome

17245098
firefox	safari
here works means when user opens a browser ie firefox or safari and browses to the web application site he she is firstly prompted to provide valid credentials in a dialog box

17245098
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
does not work with google-chrome means google-chrome always let users browse the web pages right away without seeing the credential dialog box and without prompting them to enter credentials in the dialog box as ie firefox or safari does

17245098
firefox	safari
i followed 2 steps below to make my mvc web application work with ie firefox and safari

17245106
freebsd	linux
this functionality is on freebsd - i havent linux

17245117
folder	directory
i guess it was because the current directory isnt actually the src folder its the parent

17245138
int	chars
your alternative of specifying unsigned chars will minimize storage but depending on the platform it might actually slow down access to objects relative to say using something compatible with int

17245155
keyup	onfocus	keydown	keyup	keydown	onfocus
sorry for my rush response before here is a correct version of it and it uses onblure instead of onfocus you can also use keyup keydown keypress

17245166
gif	png
i have tried gif png and jpg file types

17245242
cos	sin
further java math is slow it does not use the processors sin cos

17245253
onchange	onkeyup
use onkeypress onkeyup and onchange to detect changes in the value and then set the display according to whether it is empty

17245272
apache	nginx
if you have a error 500 it s probably the web server nginx or apache that is serving it because the app server like passenger is crashing before being able to display pages or create logs

17245297
button	checkbox
what is happening now is that because of the button has the selectors when i select a checkbox both button are disable

17245338
button	checkbox
i m assuming you re trying to enable disable only the button related to the checkbox

17245353
opera	google-chrome
opera probably is more complete to manage canvas than google-chrome but the problem is always to exclude the finger touch if i m using the pen

17245392
vbscript	jscript
and i have to use vbscript and not jscript

17245421
children	parent
svg doesn t have flow layout so children don t affect size of parent element

17245428
ready	each
if you consider the event-binding only â which occurs on document ready eventually and each time the dom changes on ajax complete â then using only one .on call with only one callback is faster

17245530
post	get
in cgi the get post is indicated via the request_method environment variable

17245566
width	height
it actually returns an array with the image attributes url width and height of an image attachment file

17245582
bazaar	svn
in the list you presented before answering the only one which comes close to my situation is how can i un-delete an uncommitted but unfortunately is for svn not bazaar

17245587
put	get	post	get	post	put
in my system i have a resource called member which supports usual get post put operations

17245588
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
the wcf service has clientaccesspolicy.xml and crossdomain.xml which is why there is no issue with making request from silverlight even though the request comes from a different domain

17245610
hash	hmac
because you said that the algorithm used no longer was sha1 but more probably sha256 i started experimenting with hmac hash sha256 instead

17245669
disk	ram
i think about if it may need less ram if i render the images one by one and store it temporary on local hard disk

17245683
pull	push
i don t want to pull from the remote but rather push the code i have locally

17245718
glut	glfw
i m following an opengl tutorial that uses a certain input window handler glut glfw but i cannot due to platform issues use that handler

17245724
button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
you may want to include a third field with meta-data about whether the question is single-answer only radio button or dropdownlistfor or multi-select checkbox

17245744
x86	64bit
if not found go to â œprogram filesâ if 32-bit system or â œprogram files x86 â if 64bit system

17245774
hash	md5
now i drop all file sizes which only have one file in their list and create another shelve database with the md5 hash as key and a list of files as value

17245778
g++	gcc
as to how to use c_include_path technically your usage is correct - except you are not compiling the code with gcc but with g++ and thus you should use cplus_include_path

17245784
uninstall	upgrade
when signeduninstaller is used without signtool it will require the keyholder to manually sign the uninstall file once and then this can be reused from a shared location without further resigning until you upgrade inno at which point you need to do it again

17245786
glut	glfw
the only difference for you is that toolkits like glut glfw sfml and others do the setup of an opengl context for you

17245805
sorting	grouping
the data is properly grouping by suit_id but the sorting is off and my query doesn t allow me to control the sorting

17245807
put	get
the other suggestion is interesting but put suggests you can then perform a get to obtain a representation of the thing you just put there which doesn t make a whole lot of sense in this context

17245807
put	get
if you feel that there s not enough substance to these workflows to justify them as their own resources or you just wouldn t know what to put in response to get then it suggests that the workflow isn t so significant that it can t simply be hidden from the api users and triggered as a side-effect of changing the user s active value

17245857
post	get
i was able to get rename computer and addcomputertothedomain scripts working but got stuck in this part below.i did a lot of research but i could t understand a lot the scripts that people post like the meaning of acronyms adsi ou...and so on here are the steps

17245931
google-chrome	safari
safari does do this but google-chrome does not

17245949
width	height
my problem is that i changed the width and height properties of the image before creating the pattern but that doesn t actually remap the image and that is also no problem

17245996
opera	firefox
but since firefox opera and ie ignore that.

17246004
getter	setter
the reason setting your getter setter method to public works is because you cannot use a private method externally

17246004
getter	setter
another issue is in your getter setter

17246099
system.in	system.out
i made two threads one for reading from system.in and sending to socket and other one for reading from socket and writing to system.out

17246210
getter	setter
the magento feature you re interested in are magic setter and getter

17246210
getter	setter
the return may be coming from a real method or may be coming from a magic data setter and getter

17246230
children	parent
parent node values that result as sum of children nodes are not stored in the database

17246230
children	parent
i need a query which will recursively compute the values of the parent based on their children and for children with no values zero will be set t-sql sql 2008r2

17246324
olap	saiku
then use an olap tool like mondrian + saiku that can dynamically rewrite your queries to use the aggregates when it is advantageous

17246347
google-chrome	firefox
to see how to do this i looked at the source of the page via inspect element in google-chrome or firebug in firefox

17246361
width	height
besides there was elements that had height and width established to 100 but it s parent didn t have a size

17246363
width	height
for the index.html of domain a.com one can add notice height 0 width 0

17246392
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i have a vimeo video embedded on slide 1 of my flexslider slider and i can play the video fine in google-chrome and safari but not on firefox

17246452
for-loop	arrays
ok now you have a sparsely populated arrays and want to use a for-loop to do something

17246475
post	get
also you shouldn t use match in your routes as you pretty much will never need your routes to be accessible by both get and post methods

17246476
google-chrome	safari
however this make non-functional my application on ipad iphone in all browser i tried google-chrome and safari

17246477
range	median
what i am trying to do is record the amount of sleep a user gets and then be able to display back the median monthly amount of sleep based on a monthly range as well as a yearly range

17246501
filtering	grouping
that s working all well and fine but i want to display somewhere the total number of filtering results across all grouping s

17246501
filtering	grouping
so essentially piggyback a filteredpostlength property on to the grouping when the filtering occurs and use this to sum that property across all the grouping to achieve total filtering results

17246523
int	double
i am unsure as how to write one for this program because i have only written for loops for int or double

17246534
bash	zsh
how to change the format of new mail notification in bash zsh

17246534
bash	zsh
how to execute a certain command after any of my command is finished in bash zsh

17246545
int	double
with that you can write a for-loop just like you would do with int s and double s

17246554
flask	django
if i were you i would take the django templates from the designer and convert them to jinja2 then build the application 100 in flask

17246554
flask	django
you write the two applications one in flask and one in django

17246558
folder	directory
there are already folder for twilio and httplib2 at that point of the directory

17246558
folder	directory
there are already folder in the venv lib site-packages directory and it will let me do a symlink for six but then it recursively creates 4500 more layers deep of the entire six folder.

17246632
hide	show
i am trying to hide and show a menu item in my action bar

17246657
for-loop	arrays
inside the kernel i have calculate the x y z coordinates of the current element in the meshdata without any issues and then i use those coordinates to find all points in the pointdata arrays by using a for-loop

17246657
for-loop	if-statement
inside the for-loop i have an if-statement saying that

17246671
floating-point	fixed-point
it looks like you are trying to devise your own floating-point representation but you used a fixed-point tag so i will explain how to convert your real number to a traditional fixed-point representation

17246671
integer	fractions
just for the sake of discussion let s say that 16 bits will be used for the fractions part 15 bits for the integer part and one bit reserved for the sign bit

17246671
fixed-point	fractions
the accuracy can be improved by rounding instead of truncating when converting from real to fixed-point or by allowing more bits for the fractions part

17246686
mouseleave	mouseenter
use hover for a shortcut to mouseenter mouseleave

17246762
awt	swing
1.non browser based interface.need something like swing or awt based.while i understand the convenience of implementing a browser based solution the business owner insists on a non browser interface

17246803
int	double
i have an object that has properties that include strings int and double

17246816
post	get
straight json responses fit most clients like browsers better such as just a bunch of routes that return json responses in response to get post requests

17246818
firefox	safari
it works in firefox and safari for windows

17246818
submit	submission
behavior in mac safari submission the form to an ssl url hit submit button - alert end shows up - data gets submitted

17246818
firefox	safari
behavior in firefox and safari for windows with an ssl url hit submit button - buttons get replaced alert pops up and the div shows up - data gets submitted

17246818

put	get
if you get none from id_or_name it means the entity has yet to be put

wildfly	jboss
a good example of jboss modules in action is naturally jboss 7 eap 6 wildfly 8 for which it was primarily developed

17246985
int	chars
inserting the punctuation at a given location is easy just use stringbuilder.insert int index chars toinsert

17246992
inherited	subclassing
one thing that you should try and imo it s good programming practice anyways is that if you need a context object then you should declare that in the constructor for your asynctask subclassing instead of using the empty constructor inherited from the parent class

17247002
calloc	malloc
pointer declaration does not result in compile time memory allocation and dynamic allocation is needed using calloc or malloc

17247037
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter
use mouseenter mouseleave hover events as opposed to mouseover mouseout events as the latter will get triggered even if you hover over a child inside the parent where the events are bound

17247037
mouseover	mouseenter
the mouseenter event differs from mouseover in the way it handles event bubbling

17247046
google-chrome	firefox
i just gave this a whirl in both google-chrome and firefox and ie10

17247054
int	chars
so you d read each number into an int using the format string d and you d read the chars into a string array using the format string s

17247056
put	get	post	get	post	put
1 use only http â get post put deleteâ as the way to model your domain â actionsâ

17247064
accessor	properties
this correspondence is broken if such a properties is deleted and then redefined or if the properties is changed into an accessor properties

17247082
keyup	numpad	keydown	keyup	keydown	numpad
you will want to use keypress instead of keydown keyup otherwise your numpad will return the wrong keys and anything requiring a shift shift+8 for instance won t work

17247085
post	get
so i have one video that i need to trigger one event a post or get

17247107
virtualenv	conda
one quick note i actually didn t use virtualenv exactly -- i had to use a conda env since i am using the anaconda distribution and apparently it is not well-tested with virtualenv yet

17247111
int	chars
you cant compare strings like this with a switch you can only do constants such as int bool chars

17247111
for-loop	arrays
with only two lines like that i would have done if else or if you have a lot of lines some form of a arrays and for-loop to check

17247126
google-chrome	safari
opera12.15 but only so-so with google-chrome 27.0 and safari 5.1.7 -- not the browsers i would have expected problems with so it s probably my own fault

17247126
opera	firefox
some sources state that prg prevents that. all three goals are met in firefox opera and ie where no history grows

17247126
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari show a trail of identical page views in the history

17247132
mongodb	bson
use mongodump and mongorestore instead - they use bson which is mongodb s native format and they preserve all types

17247596
for-loop	loops
if you intended to process numerous files you could put the last three lines in a subroutine my preference over creating nested for loops and call it within a for-loop that iterates over the files in question

17247711
ant	maven
ant and maven just happen to be the most popular tools for building java and you should use one of them to keep your project from requiring eclipse to build and deploy

17248140
integer	unsigned
bear with me. it says that the bits of the object representation of an unsigned integer type are divided into two groups value bits and padding bits there needn t be any padding bits and most implementations don t have them

17248140
int	chars
this description does not exclude the possibility that for example an int type wider than chars might have a single padding bit that must always be 1

17248148

this will generate two files the .range file will contain all the information related to the scale process max and min per column and the .scale file which is the output that will look like

17248920
stdout	stderr
i experienced the same problem and as it turns out you need to read the program s output from stderr not stdout

17248929
abstract-class	superclass

17249083
integer	unsigned
so you see if a property name is converted to the string representation of an unsigned 32-bit integer and still has the same value then it is an array index and the associated value is an element of the array

google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i have researched this solution by installing the papyrus font and it works well without any font-face in any css file but researching with several browsers on a mac running lion i found that although it worked well in safari and firefox the papyrus option doesn t show up in the text editor font dropdown in google-chrome

17256349
folder	directory
now i have added html file i.e search.html to a folder called templates which is located in the main directory of the project outside of views folder

17256357
uiview	subviews
if you apply a transform to a uiview a that transform will be applied to all its subviews b in your case

17256364
postgresql	mysql
you will likely have to install either mysql or postgresql on your server and then edit lfs_project settings.py accordingly

17256395
filtering	grouping
this is part of a much larger function that has other filtering etc being applied but i want to make an or_where grouping

17256411
maven	pom.xml
i can therefore only import the project as a general project or use the project wizzard and set up a new maven project which is stupid because all information already exists in the pom.xml

17256412
chunked	transfer-encoding
i found that modwsgi the middle-layer between apache and django does not enable chunked transfer-encoding by default

17256414
express	node.js
i have been using ejs with express and node.js for a little while now and i think i understand the basics

17256436
opera	firefox
since firefox and presumably opera as well have taken middle-click behavior out of the developers hands i would suggest replacing the anchor node s with a different node e.g

17256453
jtextfield	jlabel
i have a 250 350 window for a log in form with a jlabel a jtextfield for username and jlabel jpassword for password with a jbutton at the bottom

17256453
jtextfield	jlabel
what i want to do now is style it so that the spacing between the top and the bottom of the form makes it so that the form is centered as well as adding a line s height space between the jlabel and the jtextfield

17256454
getter	setter
otherwise there s no point in defining those setter and getter and there s no point in creating this instance which you never use

17256455
getter	setter
2 then use getter setter on your purchase object

17256537
put	get
i want to make 1 function which will get a random line from specific .txt file and put it in the other one

17256563
for-loop	arrays
every time i make a for-loop dealing with arrays usually trying to read one arrays and write the values in a second arrays it just takes the very last value from the first arrays and writes it in every single slot of the second arrays

17256603
google-chrome	firefox
when i view the source page of the api request in firefox and google-chrome it tells me the encoding is utf-8 and code examples on the api wiki also show utf-8 in the header

17256611
post	get
to logout use post instead of get

17256621
kde	gnome
before kde and gnome read in the nineties one of the most popular desktop environment was cde based on the motif toolkit

17256623
opengl-es	glsurfaceview
if you are using glsurfaceview on android it has an opengl-es tracing feature too

17256658
children	parent
so the name of the new node is always taken from the value of node but its value may come from different children nodes when they exist of the parent node

17256679
google-chrome	firefox
but it seems to me like you re asking why both your google-chrome and firefox browser aren t emitting an agreement event

17256679
google-chrome	firefox
another user my firefox browser enters the given code and broadcasts it to let my google-chrome know that he s there.

17256679
google-chrome	firefox
your firefox browser only emits to other clients your google-chrome browser through socket.broadcast.emit

17256689
put	get
now i have this other class that needs to get those values and put them in an int array

17256794
typedef	struct
i believe you can accomplish what you want by defining struct with typedef and using a templated function

17256801
gruntjs	package.json
after creating a package.json file and a gruntjs file.js i ve tried running a simple test with grunt-karma with no luck

17256835
google-chrome	firefox
so just changing your first two lines to this and it works in the current version of google-chrome and firefox

17256867
fadein	fadeout
i am open to using jquery as well but i do not see how i could integrate andã or use the fadein and fadeout functions here

17256887
int	boolean
i am following this tutorial but when i add the code to eclipse everywhere the i int is called eclipse gives the error int cannot be converted to a boolean

17256896
width	height
the only jquery that was being used in that linked answer was to get with width height and position of the divs which are somewhat trivial to retrieve using pure js

17256904
hide	show
what happens is that when you click arrow for the next slide it shifts the first one down show the second and then hide the first one

17256926
maya	blender
a mesh made in blender or maya has its vertices expressed relative to the model s frame

17256937
lxml	beautifulsoup
you should use beautifulsoup or lxml

17256967
getter	setter
i am not interested in a discussion about whether one should access fields directly or not my bindings generate getter and setter anyway since there are only functions in haskell

17256996
put	get
the only way to put in the right place the values is through the same variable that is used for the keys but this makes possible only one column to get filled erasing the content of others

17257046
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
you can use the various touches methods touchesbegan touchesmoved etc. in your controller or the main view or you can use a single gesture recognizer on the main view

17257054
post	get
i m not asking for a direct answer here since i m sure this is not trivial and the integration must have some ramifications with external user account management issues with the edit form s target page and post get parameters management and other things i can t think about right know

17257064
subtract	add
i can do a single column left join but i can t seem to find the proper syntax for multiple columns not to mention not knowing how to add or subtract the values on the column

17257075
submit	submission
this script works to clear a form on submit and fades the response in and out but for some strange reason it is submission the form twice

17257079
stdio	fflush
the scanf trying to read beyond eof might be doing something in the stdio library internal buffers that is causing this issue in printf buffer not being fflush at the time of process _exit

17257089
hide	show
this works nicely except that the way i m adding the show class to the first image and hide to the rest is really clunky with the long classes array

17257089
hide	show
there has to be a better way to do this that maybe involves an if else statement that just says the first image gets show class and all others get the hide class

17257109
for-loop	arrays
for now i can only support single 2d and 3d arrays using nested for-loop

17257119
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested this in google-chrome and firefox and the redirect does not happen on both

17257153
rel	src
the divs with class .thumb that you have don t have the rel attribute so it ends up setting the image src to undefined

17257167
button	checkbox
user can just tap and select the checkbox and press the bottom button to perform action1

17257167
button	checkbox
b split the tap into 2 parts if user taps on the area around actual checkbox 40 right part of screen the box would be checked and the bottom action1 button can be pressed to perform the action on selected group

17257196
width	height
i am trying to pass thistime to class and use it to define width and height of two rects.this is just a simplified version of my initial code and i get the errorsyntax error on token variabledeclaratorld expected after this token here are my code

17257205
hide	show
this event is triggered by components within the framework that dynamically show hide content and is meant as a generic mechanism to notify other components that they may need to update their size or position.

17257214
onsubmit	onload
first the obvious error here is that u have to assign a reference to onload and onsubmit functions and not execute the functions

17257217
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the css word-wrap property is compatible with older browsers ie 5.5+ firefox 3.5+ google-chrome 1.0+ safari 1.0+ opera 10.5+

17257218
onsubmit	onload
...you are calling the rectangle and init functions and assigning their results as the onsubmit and onload handler which means the functions are run once straight away and not run in response to the form submission event

17257226
children	parent
on the other hand i have no idea how the otherwise perfectly generic parent view will behave with 1000 s of children

17257237
octal	decimal
both come mixed in the same string and both seem to be ascii the first one being decimal html and the second one being octal

17257277
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsitem
i know how to pass events from qgraphicsview to qgraphicsitem

17257280
sorting	filtering
my problem is with sorting and filtering

17257283
memset	memcmp	memcpy	memcmp	memcpy	memset
so what i wonder is if there is a function for this purpose similar to memset memcpy memcmp etc

17257285
post	get
when i post it i get the following error

17257301
stdout	stderr
redirect its stdout and stderr to files which you can view whenever you want

17257376
width	height
see that the width and height values are twice each in the iframe

17257377
post	get
i have seen this blog post but the api has changed since the post and now i can t get the same result

17257441
google-chrome	firefox
form submission does work everywhere else firefox google-chrome ie

17257445
width	height
there s some more boilerplate eaglview code but note that i m setting the glviewport to whatever gl tells me it s width and height is which is grabbed from the uiview s layer size

17257447
post	get
assuming your connection and post get code is working

17257453
width	height
i have been stumped on how to create a div for a modal display that uses a fixed header and footer scrollable content area and relies solely on percentage values for width height of the holder and the content body

17257453
width	height
div with 65 width 60 height centered on page

17257515
google-chrome	firefox
believe it or not this code works in firefox google-chrome ie9 and 10 to do what you want see the example

17257515
google-chrome	firefox
i believe i worked out a minor bug in firefox and google-chrome that would cause it to sometimes display still when not over just the

17257526
monkeyrunner	adb
without manually pressing the ok button the adb cannot detect the device so my monkeyrunner script will not start

17257526
monkeyrunner	adb
better yet is there a way to auto-accept the rsa fingerprint from the computer so at the very least adb communication can be established so that the monkeyrunner script can click on the dialog

17257542
width	height
if width and height are numbers you shouldn t have trouble with that code

17257557
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
firefox ie and opera work exactly as intended and safari just blindly puts every get into the history

17257599
postgresql	mysql
if you ever decide to change from mysql to postgresql there s very little to change

17257661
margin	height
i d like to know what to change in order to get back my two pixels - i tried tweaking margin and height but no luck

17257664
portrait	landscape
i have a image which fits perfectly on the screen during load but if there is a change in orientation from portrait to landscape the images become enlarged

17257664
portrait	landscape
the first image shows the screen after the orientation has changed from landscape to portrait

17257687
superclass	subclassing
i have one superclass named events and 2 subclassing named talk and workshop

17257711
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
the reasoning behind the restriction is this each subclassing inherited the contract of the superclass and expands that contract in some way

17257711
superclass	subclassing
suppose that one subclassing as part of its expanded contract places constraints on the values of protected members of the superclass

17257752
width	height
remove width and height attributes in img tag

17257755
stdout	stderr
this redirects stderr which is where time sends its output to the same stream as stdout then redirects stdout to dev null so the output of ls is not captured then pipes what is now the output of time into the stdin of grep

17257787
stdout	stderr
time writes its output to stderr so you need to pipe stderr instead of stdout

17257787
stdout	stderr
with bash v4.0 probably universal on linux distributions but still not standard on mac os x you can use to pipe both stdout and stderr

17257836
submit	submission
i need to call the validation above if the user clicks the submit button and stop the submission if the isvalidusername variable is false

17257854
int	chars
a chars is essentially an int 8 bits wide but by default probably signed on your compiler

17257885
firefox	safari
i have tried using different hosts and both firefox and safari

17257887
g++	gcc
edit here s the assembly generated by g++ -o2 -s with gcc 4.7.3 on mac os run through c++filt and annotated by me

uiviewcontroller	uipageviewcontroller
i have a uipageviewcontroller lets call it intropages inside a uiviewcontroller introview that takes up about half of the screen

17257916

i also tried to make introview the uiviewcontroller containing the uipageviewcontroller to be the delegate of firstname but that did not work either gave the same problem

17257924

layers and library is a directory within the same folder everything else is just there not in any subfolders

17258062
hide	show
it still gets loaded into the dom but the browser doesn t show it since there is a hint to hide it

17258068
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
then use this css to assign the color and the margin you have to tweak the code to get the width and height where you want it

17258084
portrait	landscape
it looks proper in portrait mode but in landscape orientation the gradient doesn t cover the entire view

17258088
versioning	upgrade
however i have a need to allow the application be upgrade to a newer versioning when the user sees fit - not on any kind of schedule

17258090
google-chrome	safari
for webkit browsers there is a very simple solution courtesy of the fact that they google-chrome and safari allow the scrollbar to be styled

put	get
i am just trying to get an out put like the following

17258339
google-chrome	safari
none of the functions like changecolor etc. work when rendered on google-chrome safari browser

17258364
min	max	range	max	range	min
if you have the min and max you can divide the range by the number of bins

17258364
min	max	range	max	range	min
the idea behind the script is that we can divide the range by bin_count to get the size of every bin max - min + 1 bin_count called bin_size

17258407
put	get
to put the image on top of the text but then you have extra markup the text in the h1 and the img that says the same thing and if images are disabled you get double text

17258834
for-loop	loops
as for the final part of your question asking whether you can write a for-loop in a foreign language and then just use r code inside loops i am pretty sure unfortuately that there is no good way of doing this

17258866
queue	fifo
when you call dispatch_async you add the job to the queue but since all dispatch queue are fifo data structures you actually add the job at the end of the run loop which potentially gives time for initialisation wherever that is done

17258874
pull	push
after self-study now i had created gerrit git system on site a sucessfully developer in site a could using gerrit to clone code review changes with no problem but developer from site b complains the gerrit site a performance is not acceptable for them the clone push pull take several hours it is not possible to do dailywork

17258965
.htaccess	httpd.conf
besides httpd.conf you may also have redirect rules in your .htaccess which resides in the webserver root and it s a hidden file so it could have been skipped by your grep have a look into that as well

17258965

- emgucv opencv

17259170
google-chrome	firefox
i get the same results in both google-chrome and firefox both recent versions

17259170
width	height
i did discover that to keep the canvas from doing confusing auto-scaling on the image it s necessary to set the canvas size using the width and height attributes as above and not in the css

17259188
google-chrome	firefox
they won t interact it s like having firefox and google-chrome both installed at once

17259237
opencv	emgucv
aforge emgucv opencv are only wrappers on top of apis that work with files directly so they cannot be fastest they are underlying access method + additional overhead

hide	show
you can keep the xslt unchanged and script the html document in the iframe to hide the table rows that should not be show

17259332
hide	show
you can hide a row by setting to show it again you can simply set

17259332
hide	show
as an alternative you might simply define a css class and set the classname of the rows you want to hide and unset it to show the rows again

17259332
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
for the alternative to apply the xslt with javascript inside mozilla opera safari google-chrome you have the same api with all ie versions you however need to use a different api

17259374

then it is correct that the len variable will return a positive int this will not however be the number of array elements in your json but instead the number of chars in the string

put	get
but it does have some classification of a container like the fact that you can put some of the basic types into it even if they are not chars and perhaps most amazing thing is that you can get an iterator to it as if it was a normal container

not sure if maven discourages this kind of thing but logically i thought of defining one execution per related set of ant tasks

multiplying	add
now the question is how we form sum firstly we just take our a representation in bit wise so sum become 10000001 next we take b in bit wise form and multiplying it to 256 which is in fact just bit wise shift on 8 bits to left that means that is the same as 256 in bit form is 100000000 and now when we add this with previous sum that means just substituting last 8 bits with a bit form

base-class	subclassing
you can change the class-name here btw by registering a subclassing of a base-class domdocument as base-class and javascriptlibrary as subclassing and then domdocument will - when creating a new object instances - use that class instead

17262180
base-class	subclassing
if you want to develop that fast i suggest you make use of a php 5.4 feature called traits as even most of those domdocument-extension-classes extend from domnode you can not for your own subclassing they need to extend from their base-class otherwise this won t work

17262180
inherited	subclassing
as php does not have multiple inherited traits can help here to not duplicate write code between all the many subclassing you will need to create for your instance object management

17263121
background-color	transparency
all elements are transparency regardless of their parent s background-color

17263266
width	height
if you can only use javascript then use this function to read the width and height values

probably because one is stored as an int and the other as a double

17263332
french	hebrew
it works for french but not for hebrew

17263388
post	get
now i am trying to get post to work

you can t overload the operators for standard types int float chars etc

17263590
libs	buildpath
almost every possible combination of buildpath settings and libs imports

17263650
int	chars
if all you want is to turn a chars array to an array of 1-byte int numbers then you are already done

17263650
memcpy	malloc
you can use the buffer you already have or use malloc memcpy to copy the data to a new one

17263650
integer	unsigned
you might want to have a look at the explicit width integer types defined in stdint.h uint8_t for a one byte unsigned integer

17263652
inherited	subclassing
so when you will inherited it in a subclassing like this

17263696
pop-up	dialog
it s free but time after time not too often though it pop-up a dialog asking to purchase the bugging-free version

17263784
int	double
your whole approach is wrong it has been mentioned that you cannot do math with generics as the math operators are not defined for the autoboxing classes int double etc

17263818
salt	md5
please do not just a md5 better use something more secure from todays perspective and salt it properly to minimize the risk of rainbow attacks

17263818
hash	salt
this leaves sha2 if you want to hash with mysql though don t forget to salt the string before hashing

17263818
hash	salt
my way of doing it would be to hash the string with your application see python hashli b for reference salt it like this and then just store the hash in the database

17263857
feof	fread
do an fread after seeking behind the file s end and you will have feof returning a non-zero value

17263869
post	get
joris kluivers wrote a great blog post on how to get it going

17263883
fgets	feof	fgets	fread	feof	fread
feof is set after an attempt to read fails so fgets or fread before

17263898

typedef	struct
the use of typedef to avoid having to say struct myexample everywhere

17264234
rvm	bundler
i m still not completely sure what all went wrong but it appears that rvm installed bundler which messed things up when it went away because of ruby_noexec_wrapper which belongs to bundler being inserted into all kinds of things

17264235
width	height
html body are defined by default with the width height 100

the problem is that while the width is set like what i wanted the height of the images remain the same so they look like this on a bigger screen this is the nexus 7

17264390
put	get
the value updates correctly and even the change event fires when i put onto the hidden field i get everything logged nicely

17264395
width	margin
if i was using margin it would be easy since the width of the list element would be same with the element s width

17264453
getter	setter
in this version of the product and accessory classes i have removed the setter getter for all the properties save for a setter for one of the product properties

17264453
getter	setter
so since i have removed the setter getter i am expecting an exception because the field visibility modifiers are private

17264453
getter	setter
you can see for example that there are no properties nor corresponding getter setter for the privately defined model accessories cost and price fields

17264453
getter	setter
so like the line in the product class not failing when referencing the cost property of accessory i do not understand how the unit tests can pass when there is not property nor getter setter for these private fields

17264504
stdout	stderr
you have redirected the stdout and stderr of the xterm process but xterm does not normally print anything on its own stdout and stderr

17264504

int	double
for a sparse data set we have to keep both the double and int indices to represent the non zero indexes so the sparse dot product is doing a lot of additional int operations to see which indices they have in common

17264623
int	double
lsh also allows us to save memory because we don t need to store all of these int and double for each vector instead we can just keep its hash around - which is only a few bytes

inherited	properties
in other words when you ask for the .children properties of each sub1 object they will see that they don t own such a properties and will therefore look for it on the prototype from which they inherited

17266220
width	height
if you specifically want to increase the height and width of the container element then you need to use positioning to take them out of the normal flow so that they can overlap or keep the divs and alter their margins and or padding in a similar way to my code above using parent probably

17266220
width	height
i assume you to intend to add borders or a background otherwise the height width increase wouldn t be needed.

17266256
int	double
example using 2d array of double rather than int s

17266279
width	height
you could remove the height and width properties from the window and set thiem in the usercontrol if you wanted it to define the size

17266327
integer	unsigned
it could be any of the signed or unsigned integer types

17266356
width	height
also the scale filter will allow you to set a specific width or height and with -1 it will automatically provide the correct value to preserve aspect

17266369
width	height
i then want to set the height in relation to the width and keep the correct image aspect ratio

17266408
prepare	execute
avoided by prepare ing the query then timing only the subsequent execute

width	height
i could make it so it only imports a certain amount of characters from the field however there s no point trying to decide on something as the screen width of the devices this can be viewed on varies dramatically 750 to 1920 pixels so it needs to show as much as possible for that screen but cannot wrap as the height of the table rows needs to be fixed

17266528

in my own projects i ve used an object mapper class for this where it matches up the property names for writable properties and identical or coercible types so at least i didn t have to write 10 000 lines of boilerplate though my source wasn t dynamic so i used reflection.emit dynamicmethod to greatly speed it up

put	get
some programs like ms word can use variable-width fonts with which the number of characters between tab stops varies if your c++ program prints some text that you import into word you may find it practically impossible to work out how many tabs are needed to get the desired alignment of output - it s generally easier to just put one tab between values and change your tab stops inside word so it all looks ok or stick to a fixed-width font such as courier

i also have the following link that gives a objective compare for graph databases but not much on pros and cons between neo4j and titan

17269349
super	self
the reason that you pass both the class c and the instance self to super is so that it knows what to call next not just based on the superclasses of the class but based on the mro of the instance

17269349
super	self
essentially super c self .__init__ means call the __init__ of the class after c in self s mro

17269349
super	self
so when you call super c self .__init__ that calls a.__init__ because a is the next class after c in the mro

17269349
super	self
then when a calls super a self .__init__ that calls b.__init__ because b is the class after a in the mro

17269371
width	margin
i created the layout using float and put in some placeholder text.i added a 10px right margin and a 1px solid border for all the columns by reducing each column width by 11px.i added a padding of 5px by applying the padding to the p and h elements rather than the div a tip i picked from adobe dreamweaver s built in 3 column layout though i am not sure if it is a good practice

17269400
hide	show	width	height
if u always want to access the image height and width you could take a different approach and use the jquery hide and show functions

17269400

this way the images will always be loaded and you would only show them when the image is clicked thus giving the user the illusion of loading and giving you access to the height and width

when you happen to know that only one is possible the choice between min max and sum is somewhat arbitrary

int	chars
c-32 expression results in int because 32 will be treated as int and you are trying to assign int value to type chars which is why you are getting possible loss of precision error

int	chars
the expression resulting from chars + int arithmetic is of type int as well

17278471
int	chars
since the range of a chars is a subset of int compiler complains about the potential loss of precision

17278471
int	chars
without it the compiler evaluates this as chars c + 32 which again results in an int due to the higher precedence of casting

17278503
int	chars
this occurs because when you add an int to a chars it becomes an int then you try to implicitly cast that int back to a chars and the int may not fit into the chars so you get an error

17278503
int	chars
now 97 might correspond to a valid chars but we can t know that at compile time as in principle it could be any int if the int is too big or small to fit in the chars then parts of it are thrown away
