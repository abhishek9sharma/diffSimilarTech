if you set the frame when instantiating the tab bar controller be sure to change the autoresizingmask property of the tab bar s view so that it doesn t have flexible width or flexible right margin

26403076
integer	unsigned
no adding one to the largest value of an unsigned integer type is not guaranteed to give you zero

26403076
unsigned	short
if size_type is defined as unsigned short and int is wider than unsigned short the lhs of your addition will be converted to the rhs and you rely on the addition being performed in the lhs s type

26403076
unsigned	short
worse yet but this is far less likely to actually happen if unsigned short has exactly the same number of value bits as int the addition would overflow and result in undefined behaviour

26403101
min	max
if you store per filterbank the index of the first and last non-zero element you can probably eliminate a lot of those zeroes and just store the slice between min and max

26403101
min	max
so to multiply an fft with that filterbank you set all fft coeffecients below min and above max to zero and you only multiply the slices between min and max

26403127
width	height
the height and width attributes are irrelevant as the issue still appears without them

getter	setter
in this case you could make a getter and setter function

26407373

the method of ghost element was tested with ie11 firefox and google-chrome

26408144

tlistview	tlistbox
you should consider using the tlistview instead of the tlistbox

26408278
min	max
i think you can connect this answer to max and min

26408295
children	parent
since by your structure they are siblings not parent children you may use the .nextuntil method from jquery

26408297

26408483
width	height
what i found was if i declare it as the generic type object i can set the height and width properties and use it exactly as i want

put	get
then i began to get more familiar with them and really put in code into bws that can be used for hardware monitoring or other infinite looped always running items

to do that i listen on touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended and touchescancelled and find closest widget for each touch

26408884
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
my problem is that when for example a finger drags out of widget s area in touchesmoved touchcount-- while another finger is just placed there in touchesbegan touchcount++ two animatons leave and enter get triggered even though the final state is that there was 1 finger before this render loop and there is 1 finger at the end so nothing should happen

rtp	rtsp
i looked at the code at github and seems that you only need to specify the multicast address to the sessionbuilder class and then the underlying rtsp server and rtp transport should handle everything at least the rtsp responses seem have code to produce correct transport descriptions

26409360
rtp	rtsp
the clients will still connect to the rtsp server through it s address but the actual rtp stream should be single and shared among all the clients

26409387

getter	setter
in other words when built with a base sdk of ios 8 the compiler does not synthesize the setter and getter in your subclass because it is redundant with the nsoperation

26411540
getter	setter
but when the app is run under ios 7 nsoperation and your subclass do not have this name property so you get the runtime error trying to use the non-existent getter or setter methods for the property

width	height
the trick is to set the offset during load to the half width and height to set the rotation point to the middle of the image and don t call image.cache

26411957
width	height
what i noticed is that most of these grids are based on rows and usually work with the width of the columns not taking the height of the elements modules into account

26411957
width	height
by modular grid i understand such grid where the individual modules could be set in both width and height and be fluid in dependence on the screen

26411957
width	height
a grid where you d know you have let s say 12 columns and 9 rows the width height of each would be given and you d be able to fill it with modules like a mosaic that makes it sound almost too simple

cout	cin
exposing the whole std namespace is against this rule especially if you want to be using let s say only std cout std cin and std endl

what i cannot accomplish is to get rid of the space the details fragment would take - if i were in landscape mode - in the portrait mode

waitpid	fork
what you d probably want to do for this case is subclass or fork the subprocess code but make sure to use subprocess32 backport if you re on 3.1 or earlier to avoid the bugs in communicate √¢ and so that the class actually has the method you want to hook√¢ and change the _try_wait method to use wait4 instead of waitpid and stash the extra results in self.rusage so you can access it later

26413260

however a long can represent a larger value than an unsigned integer

26415428
integer	unsigned
an unsigned integer can represent a maximum value of 2 32 - 1

int	chars
even though chars is an int type it is treated by the operator differently from other int types

26415733
int	chars
for example if you enter 8 as the input a chars recipient variable will receive chars 8 which corresponds to int value of 56

26415733
int	chars
if you enter 42 as the input the recipient variable will receive chars 4 which corresponds to int value of 52

26415745

for me the problem was a rewriterule in the htaccess folder in a directory above the one that was password protected

26417390
jtree	jtable	jlist	jtable	jlist	jtree
you could override the tostring method of the post object but i prefer to avoid doing this as i like the tostring method to provide debug information and the way that the object is rendered in the jlist may not be the way you want it rendered in a jcombobox or jtable or jtree .

in that thread i do some processing and based on some result i do a fork immediately followed by an execvp

26417753
pthreads	fork
i realize that its not best to call a fork from a pthreads but in my design the main process gets many events and the only way to parallely work on all those events was to use pthreads

26417753
execvp	fork
i am wondering if because i am eventually calling a fork from a thread context is it possible that multiple threads parallely call fork + execvp and this somehow results in two copies being created

26417753
execvp	fork
if this is indeed happening would it help if i protect the code that does fork+execvp with a mutex since that would result in only one thread calling the fork + execvp

26417753
execvp	fork
thread code that does fork + execvp -- in case you guys can spot an issue there

26417753
execvp	fork
i looked through this code and i see no reason why i would do a fork and not do an execvp -- so the only scenario that comes to my mind is that multiple threads get executed and they all call fork + execvp

26417782
int	double
in checked mode which is how i run my tests that blows up because int is not a subtype of type double

the way haskell works is that if you give it an integer literal consecutive digits without a decimal point it will assume that it belongs to the integral typeclass and will try to figure out whether to make it an integer or int implicitly but it will never implicitly promote an integer literal to one of the fractions classes including realfrac

26423431

ok so one workaround for this is to first define the c# class that contains the guid such that the guid type does not participate in serializable deserialization but to use a byte array instead

26424653
put	get
however i am unable to define a get and put for this state

26424653

expander	itemscontrol
i d like to have an itemscontrol with each item containing an expander

expander	itemscontrol
on expanding the expander s content should be shown as an overlay overlapping the other items in the itemscontrol and not moving them down

26429428
expander	itemscontrol
i suppose this is due to the zindex as the following items in the itemscontrol are added after the expander s content

26429474
ubuntu	centos
you cannot run ubuntu centos and suse on the server at the same time

26429474
ubuntu	centos
this means that you will not be able to take advantage of ubuntu s vmstat efficiency centos io optimizations and suse boot-up time at the same time as per your example

26429474
ubuntu	centos
if this is intended to be a database server then you will have to run the server on ubuntu with the database for a couple days then repeat on suse and finally on centos or whatever and design indicators to compare the three sessions on database performance

google-chrome	firefox
in a karma.js unit test for an angular.js directive i encountered weird inconsitency in behaviour between google-chrome and firefox

26430074
google-chrome	firefox
the test will pass on google-chrome but on firefox - it fails

26430074
google-chrome	firefox
as a result you ll see google-chrome test passing and firefox one fail

my problem is that after i ve set up a bunch of pivot tables i notice i need to create another column in the source data to grouping data for a filtering which affects the range i originally used in the pivot tables

26430153
children	parent
and the span wont necessarily be direct children of the parent

26430153
children	parent
the can be children of children of child elements of the parent element

26430204
popover	tooltip
you put this js after your bootstrap.js inside the functions where you call the tooltip or popover for example

26430631
serializable	deserialization
downloading that code you will see that they perform all serializable and deserialization manually

26430691
goto	break
if goto weren t on the list and it were added to the language later on existing code that used the word goto as an identifier variable name method name etcetera would break

26430700
int	double
the downside is the reading of one single record from your saved file may be a little more complex but you can easily write a function which for a given index will go to read the int skip the rest of them then read the 3x double

26430700
int	double
if you really cannot afford to multiplex demultiplex your data then you can consider converting your int to double and writing the full array

26430752
multiplying	subtract
now multiplying this number by the divisor 3 and subtract the resulting number from the original dividend

26430756
submit	submission
you didn t specify where to submit the form so it is submission to itself that is your problem

26430900
maven	pom.xml
i assume you mean that developers add repository entries into their maven pom.xml file to get further dependencies and or modify their settings.xml

26430900
maven	pom.xml
potentially you can even use the maven enforcer rule to disallow repositories in the pom.xml and set up an explicit message and allow them to create proxy repositories in nexus

26430956
firefox	safari
they still appear to display correctly in safari and firefox the only other browsers that i am supporting

here is what you wanted and it s super simple to implements

26431071
folder	directory
now i have the directory available on remote server i should be able to scp file to that folder

26431080
uialertview	uialertcontroller
edit i should add that uialertview does work on both ios 7 and 8 but i am just wondering if i should use just uialertview for both or have a check and run uialertcontroller instead if they re on ios 8

26431094
width	height
i set the width and height of the texture to 2 and my coordinates to place the texture is composed of two triangles that make a square and fill up the whole screen

26431124
button	checkbox
the advantage of this approach is that you can add radio button or checkbox without the inputclassname class - that have values less than 6 characters and your logic will still work

26431159
comparator	comparable
you can also implement the interface comparable and override the comparator ... method

26431266
for-loop	arrays
i want to create an arrays of variable size size and set all elements inside that arrays to 0 without using a for-loop because i am testing the speed of something and need to avoid something like a for-loop going through a size like 50000

26431286
post	get
since you haven t posted any code you pretty much always get a better answer if you post your code the only theoretical answer we can offer is no you can t do what you re asking

26431383
for-loop	arrays
i also suggest using a for-loop to set multiple elements in an arrays rather than manually writing out each line of code

26431383
for-loop	arrays
added a for-loop at the top that generates a random number enters it into an arrays of ints and then prints it to standard output

26431413
vbscript	vba
then call this vba code from r using a vbscript

26431416
uialertview	uialertcontroller
at that time you can replace all uses of uialertview with uialertcontroller

26431416
uialertview	uialertcontroller
then next year you drop ios 7 support and then you update all of the existing code to remove the check for uialertcontroller and remove the code to use uialertview

26431433
filtering	grouping
the predicate in the where filtering out all rows that were assigned a row number greater than 1000 the rest is a straighforward grouping by and and avg aggregate

26431494
google-chrome	firefox
it was running unit tests through google-chrome firefox and ie and everything was working great

26431494
google-chrome	firefox
ie and firefox were still connecting and running all the unit tests but for some reason karma is not able to open a connection with google-chrome so it times out after 60 seconds and the build step fails

26431494
google-chrome	firefox
karma start --reporters teamcity --single-run --log-level error --browsers ie firefox google-chrome

26431494
google-chrome	firefox
as you can see firefox and ie report fine but google-chrome just falls on its face every time

26431513
maven	pom.xml
however if you have a maven parent pom.xml that uses the tag you can easily just reference this parent pom.xml and then easily only make references to the dependencies you need in that sub project

26431537
width	height
i had the same problem but then noticed the width and height were swapped around for ios8 so now my initwithframe looks like this

26431544
fish	zsh
if you are using a different shell zsh or fish they should also contain info and man pages that tell you how variable substitution works for them

26431550
bash	subshell
starting in bash 4.2 you can just set the lastpipe option which causes the last command in a pipeline to run in the current shell rather than a subshell

26431550
for-loop	loops
then replace the while loops with this for-loop instead

26431560
chunked	transfer-encoding
i m trying to handle the response using transfer-encoding gzip chunked

26431570

26431611
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox both drop the logincontrols div down to the next line

26431615

multiple web services calls may take time to execute but won t necessarily tie up the cpu as the processors may do other things while it waits for the i o involved with the service calls to complete

26431684
children	parent
i was wondering if it were possible to make the parent container while having ishittestvisibile for the children as true and still be able to access the children

26431685
explode	implode
i think you could probably make a prettier solution using explode and implode and a let block with a pattern match but i don t remember enough sml syntax off the top of my head to do it

26431751
sqoop	hadoop
i am importing data from oracle to hadoop using sqoop

26431753
client-side	server-side
as the previous speakers already explained you need to think in terms of client-side running code and server-side running code

26431755
createfile	getlasterror
also your getlasterror check after createfile is wrong

26431774
sorting	filtering
it works great when dealing with a straight-up array of objects but if some of those objects have nested objects the filtering and sorting has strange behavior

26431779
subtract	add
i have been working on some code to add and subtract matricies and place them in a new matrix

26431783

there are tons of questions posted on ux stack exchange on the topic of radio button vis a vis segmented controls and there is one in particular about inserting radio button and checkbox into button but i cant seem to find it at the moment

26431784
osx	yosemite
this worked for me on osx yosemite

26431804
dictionary	map
its usually unwise to use built-in types or functions as variable names list dictionary map etc... because you mask objects you may want to use later and generally confuse everybody

26431817
google-chrome	safari
-chrome- was never a true prefix because google-chrome uses webkit to power itself so it has the same vendor prefix as all other webkit browsers for example safari

26431823
gson	jackson
try using jackson or gson for these tasks

26431886
uialertview	uialertcontroller
however take some time to consider how you re currently using uialertview and whether you are able to give ios 8 users a better experience by supporting uialertcontroller

26431886
uialertview	uialertcontroller
if you re using uialertview for something like this consider using uialertcontroller on ios 8

translation	localization
my rails app s localization works fine locally but when deployed to heroku some word don t get translation and renders the missing translation span tag

26432055

we can see again that the class exists in the illuminate support facades namespace but it does not extends the illuminate support facades facade class nor does is implements a getfacadeaccessor method which means confusingly it s not really a facade

26432102
projectile	angle
it is supposed to have the user input a distance and then calculate the angle at which you would need to shoot a projectile to reach that said distance at a set velocity

26432112

versioning	upgrade
i wanted to upgrade my project to support android lollipop and api 21 so i changed appcompat versioning at the dependencies to 21.0.0

26432128
swift	objective-c
hint that the above code is in swift if you are using objective-c you will need to override isequal instead of the operator

26432137
width	height
i also seem to have better luck using an outer element that is of odd width height rather than even width and height

26432138
min	max
pretty simple if you use a list to store the numbers and rely on max min functions from the standard library

26432154
children	parent
children scope automatically inherit the parent s scope and can specifically access the parent s scope with

26432193
rubygems	bundler
also version 2 seems not to use bundler so you ll have to install the gem with regular rubygems

26432235
hash	md5
and why does the same string produce a different md5 hash when read from stdin rather than as a command line parameter

26432242

i set the margin for #cmtabwrap to -200px the width of #cmcontent leaving only the tab showing

26432426

so far i figured out i can do it by storing all loaded data in int array of width height length each entry represents 32-bit rgba color in bufferedimage object or in image object

26432446
phpstorm	aptana
probably worth considering an ide such as netbeans or phpstorm or using aptana solely as an editor

tbb	thrust
thankfully the website says that thrust code can be used with threading environments such as openmp intel tbb

26432471

in the responses to this question and particularly in the comments to the accepted answer people conclude - it seems - that storing a randomly generated salt next to the hash password in a database is the best way to secure passwords

26432597
hash	salt
in this question the accepted answer states that with access to the all the possible hash data values the salt doesn t do much - conecptually - to make things anymore secure though that would be an unfeasibly large amount of stored data

children	parent
you could only use a service if you maintained a dictionary of parent and children in the service and managed routing the calls to the right associated parent child which is the same problem you have using events

children	parent
in this case if you are broadcasting from the root and or multiple children are receiving the message give each parent child a unique identifier and add this to the emit broadcast on

26446391
int	double
i ve tried to declare couple of methods with same name one using object to accept string int and double and another only accept arraylist

26446422
swift	objective-c
swift does not automatically create an ivar for your computed properties like objective-c did

26446422
getter	setter
note doing it that way you don t need the _priority property anymore since you re not implementing a customer getter and setter

26446427
int	chars
exp it is given that size of int is 4b and of chars is 1b

26446427
int	chars
let the array be declared as type x a b c where type int chars and a b c are natural

26446450
spaces	delimiter
i have a spaces delimiter file that looks like

26446459
next	except
it works and all except sometimes the left view doesn t resize the way it s supposed to and therefore overlaps with the next fragment

26446459
width	height
i m not sure if it matters but i used this solution to fix my viewpager s wrap_content height and i used this solution to get my viewpager to scale fragments down to 90 width

26446481
profiling	benchmarking
from there you do testing profiling and benchmarking and if only if you find performance or other issues then you go into the crazy stuff

26446481
profiling	benchmarking
but again the compiler is generally better at optimizations than you so let it do its jobs and then benchmarking profiling to see if you really need to do better

26446525
post	put
the quote is correct the assertion that put and post must have it is incorrect

26446525
post	put
there is no requirement that put or post actually have additional content

26446525
content-length	content-type
but note it is allowable to omit the content-type and still include content say by using a content-length header

26446538
int	boolean
the ide returns the error error incompatible types int cannot be converted to boolean and is referring to the if qualifications

26446543
int	chars
does not compile is because the range of chars -2 15 to 2 15 - 1 is much smaller than the range of int -2 31 to 2 31 - 1

26446543
int	chars
the compiler sees you are trying to assign an int to a chars and stops you because it realizes this

26446545
int	chars
a chars can be assigned to an int without a cast because that is a widening conversion

26446545
int	chars
to do the reverse an int to a chars requires a cast because it is a narrowing conversion

26446552
post	get
use get or post with pagination and the parameters does not shows in the url

26446553
int	boolean
the function then that you would be looking at writing would would likely have a prototype of boolean similar int threshold string foo string bar where the threshold is the maximum number of changes allowed and foo and bar are the two strings you are comparing

26446563
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
the old java.util.date and java.util.calendar classes are notoriously troublesome confusing and outmoded

26446571
equals	compareto
compareto str returns an negative number if str is lexicographically less than the value being compared to 0 if the strings are lexicographically equals or a positive number if the str is lexicographically more than the value being compared to

26446579
int	boolean
your problem is that compareto returns an int value not a boolean

26446579
comparator	comparable
see the java api docs for comparator in interface comparable at

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
if you start by clicking on any given child circle and release on the other google-chrome decides that it makes sense to fire the click event while firefox and safari do not

26446608

you need to use .png in firefox google-chrome and opera and support them with 2 resolutions for different devices and screen resolutions

26446739
width	height
so when you set the positioned element to block it was 100 width but 0 height

26446753

all of the child divs vary in width and the margin declaration for all child divs is margin 0 auto 2em auto

26447000
for-loop	loops
and when i attempt to run -adduser which is insider this loops the changes don t persist i have read that this is normal behaviour within anything but a for-loop but this is maddeningly unhelpful

26447024
titlebar	window
when i don t request a layer for the window s content view then i get more a gray titlebar and window title rather than a pure black one

26447026
int	double
if a single argument is passed and that argument is a double return int

26447028

i ve tried using the list explode and implode but i can t seem to pull id out and assign it s value to a variable

26447033
multiplying	multiplication
f provide scalar multiplication which will multiplying all the elements of matrix a by the value x

26447049
superclass	subclassing
the superclass has abstract methods that aren t actually used by each subclassing

26447054
comparator	comparable
for reference types make sure they are comparable by adding a bound to t and use comparator

26447062
multiplying	subtract	for-loop	loops
you need to use the value of i inside of your for-loop to multiplying the value of what you are subtract from ytop each time loops runs

26447062
multiplying	subtract
so we can multiplying the 100 we are subtract from ytop by i like this

26447081
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
for some reason the style hides the svg this happens only in firefox i tested in safari google-chrome and ie

26447081
width	margin
usually i set it to block and give it a width and then margin 0 auto

26447083
express	node.js
so if you d like not to switch languages remain with the express framework and node.js since that s where also all the tutorials are mean stack for instance mean.io

26447087

when you execute system the os spins see man fork also man execl a new process a copy of your original process

26447129
subtraction	addition
do a round after each addition and subtraction to get the correct result before saving

26447215

ng-app	ng-controller
is writing ng-controller under ng-app mutually exclusive to registering the controller to the app in js

26447257
post	get
if i ask for facebook post of a page with limit 100 i ll get the error

26447268
hibernate	jdbi
if you have very few work upon database then use jdbi else go for hibernate as it is very strong and provide many additional features to your persistence logic

26447289
execl	fork
if you want the child pid after execl for example the easiest way is to just hang on to it when it is returned by fork

26447347
libstdc++	libc++
keep in mind that if you manage to get clang++ working with a newer libstdc++ that libstdc++ and libc++ are binary incompatible

26447353
maven	m2e
most of the maven plugins aren t designed for incremental builds and hence it creates trouble for m2e

26447353
maven	m2e
m2e 1.1+ lifecycle mapping metadata provided by maven plugin

26447353
maven	m2e
4 in case you don t like any of these 3 options you can use an m2e connector extension for the maven plugin.the connector will in turn provide the metadata to m2e

26447353
maven	m2e
this simply means that m2e will delegate the responsibility to that particular java class supplied by the extension author.the configurator can configure the project like say add additional source folders etc and decide whether to execute the actual maven plugin during an incremental build if not properly managed within the configurator it can lead to endless project builds

26447353
m2e	build-helper-maven-plugin
the below image shows how m2e prompts you to install the connector for the build-helper-maven-plugin

26447353
m2e	maven-plugin
5 m2e encourages the plugin authors to support incremental build and supply lifecycle mapping within the maven-plugin itself.this would mean that users won t have to use any additional lifecycle mappings or connectors.some plugin authors have already implemented this

26447432
keydown	keyup
once the keydown or keyup event has been detected you need to check the event.key attribute rather than event.type to know which key was pressed

26447519
wildfly	glassfish
i m migrating a java ee application from glassfish 4.0 to wildfly 8.1.0 final

26447519
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade netbeans to 8.0.1 with jsf to 2.2.8-02 which has a built-in wildfly-plugin but it also brought all most no difference anyway than the previous versioning of the ide

26447550
put	get
to get them to scroll like a normal iframe of fixed height you have to put them in a div and set the divs overflow to auto or scroll

26447550
submit	submission
so the first submission will work but if the form comes back with missing required field errors you can t hit the submit button again

26447599

i need the login_time must be with in the date provided in where condition and it must be max with in the whole table not only within that range provided in that query

26447818
post	get
even if you had made it cors enabled and it is working for get request and you have told it is showing 405 http status for post request

26447818
post	put
this is because post put delete request are not safe request they first send request options request you have to respond to that will required hedaers such as access-control-allow-methods post and then it will again send post request and it will work then

26447832
sorting	grouping
think of how you would manage a grouping of people working on a task of sorting papers

26447863
oledbcommand	sqlcommand
if you are using oledbcommand instead of sqlcommand you cannot use named parameters

26447875
hide	show
however when the user starts inputting values into any of the form fields i want to hide the back link the save cancel buttons should be show to the user

26447875
ng-show	ng-hide
this function is then used in the actual ng-show ng-hide directive as shown below

26447875

range	max	filtering	grouping
having applies the filtering after the grouping by so you can select the max login time for each user and then filtering out the ones that aren t in the range

26448072
for-loop	loops
normally you would initialize j in the first statement in the for-loop which is empty here since it is a looping index and is usually only used inside loops

26448090
switching	screens
i√¢ ve found a way of switching view controllers without triggering this error option 2 but the visual effect is horrible with a little lag showing an empty screens between the two views

26448154
width	height
i then load the data from an api and resize the images to fit it to the width of the current device and accordingly adjust the height of the image to keep the aspect ration i then use that height as the height of the cells for my table view

26448158
ceil	floor
if have points with decimals you need to decide whether you want to round floor or ceil them

26448192
width	height
right now you re calculating diameter height once per inner loop and as well as diameter width once per outer loop

26448224
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop in your javascript code is going to leave the url variable set to the last marker in the markers arrays as you ve noted

26448275
client-side	server-side
you re mixing client-side and server-side code the wrong way here

26448297
post	get
i m thinking that i ll actually have two different signup forms one for regular users and one for creatives then each has their own on boarding process one for the creatives to fill out their profile with the images and stuff and one for regular users to get them to schedule talks and or post problems

26448396
children	parent
this time i would like to send a signal sigcont to child s children aa+ab after receive a signal sigcont from parent

26448410
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
like konrad said by giving it a width and height it will always have its shape but rather than using min-height and min-width just have height and width and then you can also move the check tick into the center of the checkbox using margin

26448429
width	height
was looking for a highly optimized way to calculate which two elements out of hundreds of svg rectangles of varying height and width and random x y coordinates would overlap first when scaling down all of their coordinates at once but not scaling down element sizes

26448434
width	height
the max width and max height can be changed depending on your page size

26448486
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
want to display the value of the checkbox multiplied to the value of the dropdownlistfor and output the product to the

26448516
spweb	spsite
use of objects such as spweb or spsite can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in windows powershell scripts requires proper memory management

26448516
spweb	spsite
when spweb spsite or spsiteadministration objects are used the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the global parameter is not used

26448561
super	implements
note your fruit class does not necessarily need to implements cloneable interface as it is already implements by the object which is always the super class of any java class

26448874
post	get
make sure you only remove the get method lines 64 - 69 as the post one is actually used

26448916
cout	cin
the statements cin and cout in general use seem to be slower than scanf and printf in c++ but actually they are faster

26448916
cout	cin
the thing is in c++ whenever you use cin and cout a synchronization process takes place by default that makes sure that if you use both scanf and cin in your program then they both work in sync with each other

26448916
cout	cin
hence cin and cout appear to be slower

26448945
pull	push
the issue is that this push worked fine before the reset to the server i am assuming the push is failing because the server is modified and so a pull and merger or fetch needs to be done on the jenkins build box first locally

26448945
pull	push
according to my understanding of git a push would fail if the place being pushed to was modified so a pull and merge needs to be done first

26448945
pull	push
i was thinking to pull the origin master branch down merge it with the local master and push those changes or reset the local master to be the same as origin master

there are advantage of having getter setter in comparison to just public variables

26448996
accessor	properties
you need to use the accessor the other way around on your properties if you want to only allow read access on your properties from outside classes

26449031

26449186
mouseup	mousedown
the problem is when i drop it on the other column of dgv i d like to know the target column s index with the same code i think because the hittestinfo member returns a value on a mousedown and not on a mouseup

26449198
folder	directory
probably i m missing something about your complete issue but i solved the problem of finding the scripts simply by putting the shims directory into the web-app js folder in your grails directory

i was using post method to get values from database but post method conflicts with pagination so i decided to use get method

26449406
tax	shipping
i think india karnataka shipping location is matching both the tax rules hence tax is getting doubled

26449488
post	get
to complement this with a quick fix to validate the parameters you are sending and since you have no post you could set the post array to be the same as get therefore passing the parameters to the validation class

26449490
unsigned	short
the array is of type unsigned short thus each element is two bytes long

26449497
hide	show
you could use the jquery toggleclass to add and remove a css-class which hide or show the #item div

26449616
setinterval	settimeout
it avoids multiplying by leveraging existing code in the framework to clean that up for you and it avoids a bug the other answers here all have where they re using setinterval in a loop to do something settimeout was meant to do

26449616
setinterval	settimeout
and both setinterval and settimeout introduce a bug in newer browsers where the sequence will pause then surge ahead all at once if the tab is suspended to save cpu by the browser

26449661
post	get
every thing shoud be right up to here drowpdown list populate from datebase and is displayed in my view but when i post the model to controller model is validated but the id of hotel rate is zero so i get entityvalidationerrors

range	minimum
it also does not support range or minimum length values

26449772

write a function in c# to get md5 hash

26454183
hash	md5
so get md5 hash of file and then using hashbytes md5 varbinarycolumn you can compare values

26454183
hash	md5
this will work because you will have md5 hash generated c# and used hashbytes in sql server to compare

specifically it seems that i need a connection id in order to ask signalr to talk to a specific client but i don t know how to get one of those either in my post action or in the client javascript

26454331
post	get
the view model has a string property that i can use to pass the signalr connection id to the post controller assuming i can figure out how to get it

26454331
post	get
i don t think i ll be able to get the client id in the post controller because i don t have any sort of signalr connection to the client at that point

26454331
post	get
i figured i d let the client get its connection id and give it to the post controller in the view model but i haven t found the magic js code that fetches the connection id out of the signalr framework

ffmpeg	libav
if the mpeg-4 with h.264 videos produced by videowriter are unacceptable i d recommend exporting your video in the highest quality possible or lossless and then learn to use a full-fledged encoding framework library ffmpeg libav x264 or application to encode to the quality and size you desire

the end result is just what i wanted 1 random portrait 2 random landscape 3 a different random portrait

children	parent
that return value is just a way to distinguish the two execution threads and for the parent to keep track which children have been spawned

the reason we need to download a local copy of the image is because most images are stored in a compressed format jpeg png tiff

i have to imagine that most if not all web browsers will actually store the image on the local disk partly to cache the image to ensure fast loading times for subsequent views of the same webpage and partly to minimize ram usage

post	get
doing a post not just a refactor of your code which has the get operation buried in datawithcontentsofurl

26456270
stdout	stderr
you can hide the output by redirecting stdout and stderr to dev null after forking but before execve

26456270
stdout	stderr
the idea is to open dev null then make stdout and stderr duplicates of the obtained file descriptor with dup2 which will also close the originals first

26456293

you then write whatever methods you want in the server-side language methods which talk to the database then have your client-side javascript call those methods

onresume	onpause
dynamically register a broadcastreceiver in your activity with a positive priority the default is 0 making sure to register it in onstart onresume and unregistering it in onstop onpause - this does the foreground behavior and should call abortbroadcast to ensure the manifest registered broadcastreceiver is not called

awt	swing
if you re really intersted in knowing how painting works take a look at painting in awt and swing and performing custom painting for more details

26457355
getter	setter
you are calling your getter and setter by the class name which is how you would call a static method

26457429
for-loop	loops
iirc for-each loops is simply a syntax sugar that will be compiled to for-loop with iterator when iterating thru a collection

26457456
implements	extends
then you can define your class that implements iterable to instead implements your own custom interface extends iterable

getter	setter
i am having trouble filling an object hierarchy by parsing an xml i have the appropriate classes with their respective constructers and getter and setter methods to create the objects

26457614
width	height
if your pixels in your raster have different real world height and width you will have to do the patch-scale for the horizontal and vertical dimension separately

26457616
width	height
it is the desired behaviour you choose the any width | any height combination to make layout decisions that apply to all possible device sizes and orientations but choose the compact width | regular height combination to specify layout changes that apply only to sizes resembling iphone devices in portrait orientation

26457616
width	height	portrait	landscape
so compact width | any height parameters will overwrite any width | any height parameters for iphone devices in portrait and landscape orientation

26457616
width	height
compact width | regular height parameters will overwrite compact width | any height parameters for iphone devices in portrait orientation

min	max
i m trying to create a function that asks the user for a value which then will be stored as the max or min value entered or if the user inputs a number 0 it will exit the dataentry function else it will keep asking the user for input

26457657
min	max
i used the printf statement that prints out the max min data and count values so i could check that they are being stored and they are but when the function gets to the for-loop it no longer does what i m trying to do

26457705
int	chars
the way you re turning int into chars adding 0 will only work for one-character numbers anyway so you only want the least significant byte the one at the lowest memory address for x86

int	boolean
therefore it is working as intended that copying a vector of boolean into an array of int converts each single bool value into an int as 0 or 1

26457854
bitarray	bitset
you could consider some kind of dynamic bitset i believe there s one in boost or possibly which will be fairly easy to convert into a bitarray using a for-loop and bitset s to_ulong function

26458205
width	height
you can detect if the image is out of boundary by comparing the values of translatex translatey and the width height of the boundary

26458206
yacc	bison
bison yacc precedence order is lowest to highest -- the tokens on the first line listed have the lowest precedence while those on the last have the highest

26458246
queue	fifo
another fairly cheap method of directional blurring of sprites is to keep a short fifo queue of where the sprite has been its position over the last few updates

26458283
octal	binary
if you were to use an octal literal 012 then as far as the computer s concerned that s still just a 1010 binary constant - the only thing that s changed is its representation in the source code

26458286
portrait	landscape
one obvious workaround is to declare your activity only to use one landscape and one portrait orientation not full-sensor

folder	directory
i m using the os.walk function and it appears to me that once you borrow deep enough the return results for the directory aren t been cleared when finding an empty folder

in bash 4.2 this can be mitigated by using the lastpipe option which allows the last command in a pipeline to be executed in the current shell instead of a subshell

26471743
versioning	upgrade
then there are much newer versioning think about upgrade jersey for you project

26471828
hibernate	jdbi
i ve used hibernate with gorm in grails as well as in a traditional spring app and i ve used jdbi in dropwizard

26471828
hibernate	jdbi
i have really enjoyed the simplicity of jdbi and here are a couple of reasons why i prefer it over hibernate

26471828
hibernate	jdbi
for your case in particular it sounds like you d want something lightweight because you don t have a lot of use cases and that would definitely be jdbi over hibernate in my opinion

26471843
width	height
so for an iphone 6 or 6 plus in portrait you would choose a compact width and regular height like this

26471898
swift	objective-c
i m working on converting my project from objective-c to swift and a swift class i m using i have a protocol i m trying to access in an objective-c class

26471898
swift	objective-c
how do access a swift protocol in objective-c

26471906
maven	pom.xml
all the libraries related to maven are getting removed by itself from the build path of the plugin-project as soon as the eclipse-pluginentry added in sub module pom.xml

26471915
put	get
now i would like to put another input so that i can get the inputs value of the fibonacci nubers

26471915
min	max
for example if the min is 10 and max is 150 the result will be 13 21 35 55 89 144 but in the third input i would like if the value is 2 to give me only 13 and 21 as result

26471919
setinterval	settimeout
it is possible using javascript methods like but firefox settimeout or setinterval but firefox os doesn√¢ t support these types of methods

26471961
ubuntu	linux
my solution ended up being to install ubuntu and do this all on linux

26471983
for-loop	arrays
im creating an arrays of structs and i need to concatenate a string value with the for-loop index

26472037
children	parent
delete parent then delete children

26472037
children	parent
this will mark the parent as deleted and will force the update of the children s foreign keys to either null or the default value of the key depending on whether the foreign key property is nullable or not

26472037
children	parent
delete children then parent recommended

26472037
children	parent
at this point all of the parent s navigation properties that previously returned these children will now return either null or an empty array

26472078
width	height
by using your size class selector in the bottom of the storyboard window set you sizes as any width and any height and then follow the below auto layout constrains

26472088
many-to-many	one-to-many
the issue here is that you have a one-to-many when obviously it should be a many-to-many viz

26472104
portrait	landscape
i have to set the constraints for the navbar on 0 on 3 sides so it will be centered and full width in both landscape and portrait mode

26472104
portrait	landscape
i tried unchecking the constrain to margins function and putting everything on 0 i tried resetting to suggested constraints and lots of other options but i can t seem to get my navbar look good in both landscape portrait mode

26472153
width	margin
i want to add margin to my map like menu s width

26472173
inherited	properties
keep in mind that scope properties only inherited down the state chain if the views of your states are nested

26472173
inherited	properties
inherited of scope properties has nothing to do with the nesting of your states and everything to do with the nesting of your views templates

26472173
children	parent
in this scenario you cannot expect to access the scope variables of parent state views within the views of children states.

26472175
express	node.js
there is an example of this on the node.js homepage but there are also various frameworks such as express which do a lot of the heavy lifting for you

26472296
memcached	apc
if however you use shared memory caching apc memcached instead of twig s caching or run this functionality in app that runs in an environment that doesn t have high traffic think of back-end app for staff or branch of app that is only used to collect information about app s codebase you can make it work by disabling twig s caching

26472300
hide	show
make one child dialog visible and the other invisible by calling showwindow to show or hide the 5 controls

26472396
post	get
i actually talked to a co-worker who informed me that in order to get the viewmodel to post and have the validation take place for the class referenced in the viewmodel i needed to inherit from ivalidatableobject

26472425
versioning	upgrade
so basically upgrade to latest cran versioning of knitr and data.table and you should be fine

26472425
knitr	slidify
i ve made another change to data.table in v1.9.5 to make it more robust for packages that evaluate user code like knitr slidify and gwidgetswww but don t know about data.table themselves

26472425
shiny	knitr
added shiny rmarkdown and knitr to the data.table whitelist

26472432
cos	sin
you can figure out how to get the x and y co-ordinates by simply doing cos theta and sin theta where theta is the angle you are examining

26472432
cos	sin
take notice that cosd and sind take in degrees as the input argument while cos and sin take in radians

26472432
for-loop	arrays
the way you re calculating your gr arrays is using an inefficient for-loop

26472432
for-loop	arrays
therefore you can get rid of the for-loop to calculate your gr arrays like so

26472474
filtering	grouping
i have a matrix that has a grouping filtering at the matrix level

26472489
rss	feed
so i m trying to add a rss feed into my rails 4 app following this tuto but i m struggling with a actioncontroller unknownformat that i understand it s happening in my controller

26472509
width	height
also i don t understand what width and height i need to set when i want the object to be dynamically maximized depending on the device or orientation - i thought that was the point of auto layout

26472533
google-chrome	safari
the problem is that in safari 5 for windows 7 and sometimes google-chrome the form doesn t seem to submit unless a return happens

26472576
oncreate	ondestroy
i tried doing this below my oncreate method with an onpause onstop ondestroy and entered the methods value as 2 for the object which means to cancel the timer

26472600
onkeyup	onkeydown
onkeydown onkeyup and onkeypress are not tnotifyevents

26472600
onkeyup	onkeydown
onkeydown and onkeyup are tkeyevent and onkeypress is a tkeypressevent

26472608
installation	upgrade
i cannot run any ssl sites on my mamp pro installation since i upgrade to v3.07 and ox yosemite

26472644
width	height
add uibuttonin uibarbuttonitem and adjust its width height as required

26472647
uiview	subviews
i created one by returning a 50x50 uiview with a uiimageview subviews but it shows up outside of the extension view too far right and it does not push the textview in the share extension over to the left

26472657
folder	directory
i have a new directory that all the files in the test folder was moved to called newfolder and i need to write a command to update the paths in the database table

26472664
equals	gethashcode
note when you overload equals it is almost always correct to also override gethashcode

26472665
equals	gethashcode
you should override equals object and gethashcode to be consistent with each other - and for sanity s sake consistent with your overload too

26472670
stdout	stderr
if you can edit the programs being tested in some way√¢ make them print their real output to stdout but their extra output to stderr or provide a command-line argument that makes them skip all the extra stuff√¢ that s great

26472674
post	get
you could then get the title for each post

26472695
post	get
i would make sure you re doing a get and not a post

26472700
hide	show
i want to toggle between many divs while one show the rest hide

26472700
hide	show
there s also another javascript code i tried before this one works sorta fine the only thing it doesn t do is toggle it just show the work and doesn t hide it although it does toggle between different work

26472715
express	node.js
typically to get the kind of functionality you are looking for in node.js you would use a templating framework such as handlebars along with express to handle the webserver and routing

26472717
google-chrome	firefox
the 3d preview works well in firefox google-chrome and ie11+ but it won t work with ie9

26472736
width	height
what i want to do is have an html5 video scale 100 width of the page but maintain a fixed height of 650px

26472761
nav	affix
i am using bootstrap s affix to stick a div and a nav div on left side

26472762
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
seemed to have different performance on a desktop google-chrome firefox vs iphone tablet safari

26472771
put	get
now you technically don t need to put the full path when doing the get then

26472791
equals	gethashcode
override equals and gethashcode like

26472807
int	double
how can i declare a number of variables with legal and illegal names such as int double 0

26472808
hash	salt
here you salt but even that doesn t help if as the attacker i m aware of the salt being used and the hash algorithm both pieces of information you ve provided here

26472888
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you can never find anything before setcontentview when using activity findviewbyid

26472923
osx	yosemite
i ve updated to osx yosemite and see that one of the new features of xcode is blur transparency effect for the project navigator window

26472939
post	get
just get rid of the myarray object and the associated mapping and directly pass the nsarray of myexampleobject s to the post method

26472944
width	height
try listening for the updatecomplete event before you grab the height or width of an image in flex because it has to asynchronously load it first

26472956
hide	show
i am using a toggle link to show and hide some page content on a search page

26473001
rss	feed
i want parse the image url from tag in my rss feed

26473017
integer	unsigned
i am not finding where the unsigned integer is and do not know how to fix it

26473058
swift	objective-c
it is an existing objective-c app that i have recently added one swift class to

26473058
swift	objective-c
i have setup the myproject-swift.h and swift bridging files both myproject and myprojecttest and i am able to build and run the app just fine using both objective-c and swift code

26473066
chisel	verilog
it is possible that if you use a newer version of chisel or rocket-chip to regenerate the verilog you will get slightly different verilog

26473066
chisel	verilog
some of the updates to chisel tweak its internal passes so it sometimes results in slightly different verilog output

26473083
system.in	system.out
this process still supports standard input output error streams so ides and we can use them via system.in system.out and system.err

26473092
firefox	safari
i ve tested in firefox and safari with the same results

26473142
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
for example on the first line the user-agent is 881087 instead of being something like google-chrome opera safari etc

26473152
execvp	fork
after fork you might be able to use execvp instead of execve mdash

26473197
libxml2	libxslt
i have installed both libxml2 and libxslt with homebrew but it doesn t want to install libxml2-dev or libxslt-dev

26473200
for-loop	loops
i think i got confused because the condition statement in normal for-loop will be executed on each loops

26473254
versioning	upgrade
however i don t want to upgrade deployment target because i want to support any device that has os versioning 7.0 and above

26473306
phpunit	codeception
and i also tried to install codeception and phpunit by composer using these commands

26473317
width	height
well the text-overflow ellipsis worked for me but just if my limit was based on width i has needed a solution that can be applied on lines on the height instead the width so i did this script

26473337
kerberos	ntlm
normally corporate credentials will be negotiate kerberos or ntlm

26473364
equals	gethashcode
if you only want to consider domainname field as uniquely identifying field in your queue then override equals and gethashcode like

26473364
equals	gethashcode
if you want to include both fields domainname and domainnamecounter then include both fields in equals and gethashcode implementation

26473364
equals	gethashcode
if you don t want to override equals and gethashcode then you can t use contains without instead you have to loop through your queue and check if any item s domainname matches your new domainname

26473384
put	get
again i only get that error if i put the use log report

26473391
srp	principles
this approach follows srp principles where you don t mix responsiblities - i still have a content loader and when i want to implemenet loading multiple elements i delegate this to another class

26473401
width	height
all of the images are different sizes but one the first image i resized the image to like 150px width and 100 width height then the hover start working but i want the image to be hover on 100px width and 50px height and when i do that it only hovers over right side of the image and this image is the first image on left

26473442
google-chrome	firefox
the button that appears on the first section has and this works great on google-chrome but when i try to view it in firefox 33.0 the link doesn t do anything at all

26473489
min	max
start title d path i min max separate | shared

26473513
ubuntu	linux
i have two linux boxes ubuntu 12.04 that i m trying to hit the webservice from using python 2.7.3 and suds 0.4

26473549
int	chars
the problem is that chars is represented as an int internally and t equals 84 hence you get an arrayindexoutofboundsexception

26473557
children	parent
the ef change tracker will notice and load the children into the parent object for you

26473557
children	parent
now we grab just the parent object - its children will still be attached in order just like we wanted

26473606
put	get
if i put in array input old sega i must get the elements playstation and megadrive

26473633
squash	merge
but i don t think i can just squash c2 and c6 because of the merge

26473652
post	get
when i tap the button i get looong error stacktrace which you ll find in the bottom of this post

26473657
width	height
they are just an tag display block with a set width height

26473680
int	double
first math.random returns a double not an int so you have to cast it int math.random however casting this will cause some issue with rounding so do some research on that

26473691

when i connect to 127.0.0.1 7055 manually in google-chrome or firefox it gets the error page

26473756
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
since you are reading data from console writing it to file it is recommended to use bufferedreader bufferedwriter for it

26473775
war	manifest.mf
if you don t have a real dependency from your war module classes to your ejb module classes you can just remove all the entries from the manifest.mf and it should work

26473775
jar	war
then you have to add a dependency to this new jar in your war and ejb modules so that they can find the interface classes

26473778
inherited	subclassing
the reason for this is that the embed segue is not a subclassing of uistoryboardsegue but inherited from uistoryboardseguetemplate which is a private api

implements	extends
when extends a java class it can be very useful to have quick access to the implementation of all available methods regardless of whether they are explicitly implements in said class or inherited from one of its parent classes

26473876
rcurl	rvest
i ll poke at why straight rcurl rvest wraps rcurl isn t working

26473876
rcurl	httr
went one level deeper and used httr another rcurl abstraction

26473876
rvest	httr	rcurl	rvest	rcurl	httr
the original url is causing a 302 response the server is sending a redirect and rcurl won t follow those by default but it seems httr and rvest ensure that parameter is set by default

26473876
rvest	httr
you can use a verbose parameter to httr or rvest url retrieval functions as well

26473879
ddms	adb
you can t use the the ddms to send an sms and debug it as the only way to do it is to disable the adb integration within android studio and it needs this to debug

26473973
queue	fifo
stack is last in first out queue is fifo

26474024
pop-up	dialog

26474159
cgsize	cgrect
the research i ve done yields a few examples of how the new method is used but it appears it is used in different ways cgrect and cgsize and apple s documentation just sends me in one infinite loop

26474159
cgsize	cgrect
if i change the cgrect so cgsize like it was in the original code i get a different error on that specific line about initializing an expression with an incompatible type

26474163

26474189
printf	getchar
only the methods constructs sizeof getchar putchar printf

26474217

if the security office wants to increase security they should switch to a slow hash algorithm with a cost factor like bcrypt or pbkdf2

26474250
post	get
i should also mention these will give you the postids you need but you ll need to join those with a post table presumably to get the actual post content

26474275
lisp	scheme
although it s idiomatic in common lisp in scheme the equivalent and idiomatic syntax should have been

26474488
cpu	processors
i m very unclear about how the following pieces actually fit together processors or cpu register files runtime stack program counter virtual addresses program memory

26474488
cpu	processors
the processors or cpu is what will compile your .c file into executable machine level code that the computer can understand and execute

26474495
ant	maven
if you want to use this then you need to have an build-management tool like maven ant or gradle

26474507

the file is in binary format and contains int or double depends on specific file

26474643
swift	objective-c
in swift something like the following should accomplish your task but it s different than its objective-c counterpart

26474657
int	chars
now the compiler is going to work out that when you add three chars values together they will create an int

26474685
google-chrome	firefox
i ve used firefox s firebug google-chrome and fiddler to see what values are being sent

26474730

so you need super soccer self .__init__

26474737
ienumerable	icollection
at this point your method is not generic since it does nothing with the t parameter - one option is to make the output type a type that is compatible with all of the possible return values with your example your choices are icollection ienumerable and

i want to create a desktop using swing and awt app using databases

26474906
versioning	upgrade
we currently rely heavily on an older versioning 3.x of extjs and the effort to upgrade to the current 5.0 versioning is at least equal to the effort required to move to angular

26474906
ember.js	backbone.js
i ve used several frameworks in the past like ember.js backbone.js knockoutjs and angularjs and they are excellent tools that are reaching a level of maturity that makes them excellent choices

because you have installed phpunit and codeception globally it means that they are installed someplace else and not in the website files and that makes sense too

if you have set a specific height and width for the image via css loading images with different dimensions will not fetch you true dimensions

the difference is js s type coercion and how certain values are represented internally all numbers are 64bit ieee-754 floats php distinguished between floats which are actually double and int which are actually of the c type long

26501966
osx	yosemite
after upgrading to osx yosemite my existing pow.cx install does not work

26501985
implements	extends
it seems the whole thing about extends the asp.net mvc 5 login system with own database is very complicated even though most of the articles i see suggest otherwise...there is just not enough documentation and implements a complete new login system is not a solution for me because there s security concerns

26501996
maven	m2e
the maven development tools you appear to be trying to install requires that the basic maven integration for eclipse m2e is already installed

26502003
width	height
you need to make sure you scale any adjustments you make to those properties as well such as the -100 and -50 that you apply to the width and height respectively

26502003
width	height
the x and y locations are never adjusted and you don t scale the -100 and -50 by changes to the width and height so for example if the form is adjusted below 100 pixels wide the rectangles just disappear completely because they are empty or have negative width

26502035
mouse	keyboard
i have used some code snippets to make this possible and i have now triggered both mouse and keyboard events

26502035
mouse	keyboard
a similar question is answered previously but that is in reference to first finding the state of the other application and then sending the inputs either keyboard or mouse what i need to do is to send an application a set of instructions that must work whether the application is in foreground or not

26502036
rss	feed
i have a rss feed with this structure

26502036
rss	feed
i need the image url so i can build a webpage with images and text coming from the rss feed

26502460
for-loop	arrays
the only other way i know how to do it without it crashing my program is to store the space locations inside of an arrays instead and it works but then i have to declare the size of my arrays as well as make the for-loop the exact size of the arrays or else it crashes and the amount of spaces in the output string will not ever be the same unless someone inputs 3 words everytime

26502484
strcpy	malloc
here i am using malloc strcpy

26502490
fasta	biopython
i wrote a tiny biopython script to extract sequences from a fasta file based on id but it does extract duplicates so i am looking to filter sequences from my fasta files which are duplicate have the exact same id

26502503
getter	setter
the setter and getter are called by the binding mechanism to stabilize the values as some values may depend on each other and the mechanism brute forces this by just setting and getting values multiple times 7 by default iirc

26502515
post	get
this is what i have for my get method but i m just not having any luck creating a post version of this

26502532
for-loop	arrays
indices into arrays strings vectors and such are always numbered from 0 to size-1 inclusive but your for-loop is accessing the vector at size one beyond the end of the vector

26502549
superclass	subclassing
within the subclassing the field in the superclass cannot be referenced by its simple name same is true for the parent class

26502550
min	max
for max and min validation the validation is working

26502618

26502788
listview	gridview
i have a listview that i use like a gridview

26502822
try-catch	exception-handling
as a final recommendation i also wrapped the code in a try-catch block so if an exception-handling is thrown it would be caught and handled

26502860
centos	linux
i have godaddy linux vps centos 6.0 server

26502894
width	margin
replace float left with display inline-block then the width and margin work

26502912
int	chars
i am using an algorithm that requires a mat image saved as unsigned int only and not as unsigned chars uchar provided by mat rows cols cv_8u

26502928
vbo	vao
in fact i have to do all the initialization again context creation vao vbo compile shader... i don t reuse anything

26502935
disk	ram
in the current scenario your queries are slower because your data + indexes size is so large that it will not fit in ram hence there will be lot of i o activity to get data from disk which is the bottleneck

26502955
getter	setter
i have some simple class man which contain constructors getter and setter

26502962
implements	modifiers
given that your format string will be quite limited only supporting s and perhaps width modifiers you might be able to implements this yourself by parsing the format string

26502977
post	get
get request is doing work accurately but when i use post request then it s crashed

26502998
prop	each
but it doesn t seem you need to delegate the event also the each call is not necessary prop iterates through the collection behind the scenes

26503040
google-chrome	firefox
the problem i am having is for some o the smaller zip or pdf files 1mb or so this works fine but for some larger zip files i have 15-20mb the browser tested in google-chrome and firefox throws a network error and fails at the end of the download

26503074
apache	mod-jk
- apache 2.4.10 with mod-jk 1.2.40

26503112
getter	setter
learning ember.js and have a reasonable understanding of getter and setter accessors through ruby and java

26503151
for-loop	arrays
use a for-loop and iterate through the arrays using string.tolowercase to alter both the arrays value and the check value temporarily for checking

26503155
width	height
to make sure the height and width of the image won t be any bigger than it s parent i set it both to 90

26503179
uialertview	uialertcontroller
so my current app uses uialertview in a few places and upon updating to ios 8 i saw the notes in the documentation once saying that uialertview and uiactionsheet had been deprecated since ios 8 and replaced with uialertcontroller

26503179
uialertview	uialertcontroller
i can see how everything works with the uialertcontroller though i m left with a few use cases of uialertview which i don t seem to easily be able to replace with uialertcontroller

26503179
uialertview	uialertcontroller
this all stems from the fact that uialertview show was callable as is to display an alertview where as the uialertcontroller must be presented from another viewcontroller using the presentviewcontroller method

26503260
disk	ram
in the current scenario your queries are slower because your data + indexes size is so large that it will not fit in ram hence there will be lot of i o activity to get data from disk which is the bottleneck

26503279
google-chrome	firefox
i had this problem in google-chrome but not in firefox

26503289
width	height
with minimum width 200 and height 50 you get these rectangles

26503300
fastboot	adb
had this on client s machine it turned out he had an out of date version of adb installed via website offering adb and fastboot

26503305
implements	extends
i was inspired enough to create my own library in order to explore and extends class definition in javascript and to implements it for my own edification

26503309
fgets	strtok
instead i suggest you read the whole line into memory at once using fgets and then split the string on the comma using strtok

26503350
filtering	grouping
surely one can do an explicit filtering before grouping but that can be cumbersome

26503351
post	get
it is working fine and is able to send post and get request

26503381
spaces	linefeed
this replaces comma followed by anything but a spaces linefeed tab.

26503408
versioning	upgrade
strangely i also get prompted by resharper that extension updates are available and it wants to upgrade my externalannotations to versioning 8.2.3000.5176

26503423
portrait	landscape
however i noticed that when i simply disable shouldautorotate return no the method is called on portrait - landscape rotation but not on the following landscape - portrait rotation

26503423
portrait	landscape
run on simulator iphone 5s 7.1 shouldautorotate is called when switching to landscape and back to portrait

26503423
portrait	landscape
run on simulator iphone 5s 8.0 or iphone 6 shouldautorotate is called when switching to landscape but it is not called when switching back to portrait

26503458
ienumerable	ilist
it s ilist and not ienumerable because the method needs quick random access and most entries will not be queried at all the algorithm is similar to binary search and ilist seems to be the only suitable .net interface for this

26503458
ienumerable	ilist
is there a way to do a select on an ilist that returns an ilist rather than an ienumerable

26503463
ubuntu	debian
at that point was full of stuff of i believe later vintage than the debian ubuntu repository

26503464
google-chrome	firefox
if it doesn t work 1 enable devmode and look for exceptions or error messages and 2 check the network communication with google-chrome devtools then compare the request sent headers parameters with the one sent with a browser not working eg firefox with firefox devtools or firebug

26503491
for-loop	arrays
my objective is to avoid having to for-loop iterate over the arrays for efficiency reasons

26503497
getter	setter
in your class you have to define a string field value1 with getter and setter

26503561
google-chrome	firefox
edit ii have tested it in previous projects and it works in the newest versions of ie google-chrome and firefox

26503587
implements	extends
the risenumbertextview extends textview and use the valueanimator to implements the rising number effect

how do i gain this inherited of the properties and general structure of the connection url without the duplicate artifactid

26503623
button	checkbox
second operation check the checkbox in gridview per row when the date in that row also existed in another table - discount table using recompute button - checkapprovedisc function

26503649
hide	show
basically the toggle function should show hide the below lying div form_fields_con with on click event

26503663
getter	setter
go to the class you want to implement the getter and setter hit ctrl + insert and a dialog will appear click getter or setter and choose the variables you want to implement getter setter for

26503663
implements	extends
this also works for override and implements methods from classes you extends

26503685
inherited	properties
these properties are inherited by your project throught additionaldependencies

26503732
width	margin
you have to adjust the margin of your ul li to achieve the 100 width of the table

26503746
opera	google-chrome
for opera and google-chrome for input it works for select it doesn t work

26503815
width	height
so i believe i have to change add remove the video x-raw-yuv width 1280 height 720 framerate 10 1 parameter

26503838
versioning	upgrade
i am using proget free license at versioning 2.2.12 build 5 and i would like to upgrade to the latest versioning 3.2.0

26503860
google-chrome	firefox
the preloader shows up in firefox google-chrome and ie7-10 but it doesn t show up in ie11

26503901
post	get
pythonanywhere supports wsgi which means normal http request response interactions -- get post etc

26503946
getter	setter
in your bidder class you should define define getter and setter for your field names if you have not already done so

26503976
elasticsearch	kibana
so i have to come up with an approach to make a large amount of data readable for the user and was wondering if someone could point out the difference between an approach of using something elasticsearch + kibana versus using something like mrtg

26503978
for-loop	arrays
the aim of the for-loop is to create a new currentjob for each line of text from the file and store it in an arrays

26504015
thin	webrick
if you re using webrick to run your application on heroku you should try to switch to using thin to see if that helps see

26504101
folder	directory
anyway instead of change the matlab path you could access the directory of the desired folder

26504102
google-chrome	safari
wow64 applewebkit 537.36 khtml like gecko google-chrome 37.0.2062.124 safari 537.36

26504224
google-chrome	firefox
my data driven tests may or may not require any one or all of them one run may be all firefox or may require firefox and google-chrome

26504224
google-chrome	firefox
this is more important because in fact i have six such beans - firefox google-chrome ie remote firefox remote google-chrome remote ie

26504243
google-chrome	firefox
you should also be able to see whether this is the case by using firefox and the firebug extension or the web developer console in google-chrome

26504243
google-chrome	firefox
so if this is the case try with this instead this works for me in ie9 google-chrome firefox

26504243
hide	show
a possibly acceptable workaround could be to disable the link altogether or hide it via css and only reactivate show it upon main document being ready

26504295
google-chrome	safari
intel mac os x 10_10_0 applewebkit 537.36 khtml like gecko google-chrome 38.0.2125.104 safari 537.36

26504307
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the header works perfectly on google-chrome + opera but is broken on firefox + ie

26504340
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
look into loading the data asynchronously with nsurlsession or nsurlconnection and read apple√¢ s url loading system programming guide

26504342
getter	setter
it generates many data structures and getter and setter for accessing and using data

26504360
post	get
although you are using post you are sending json as a request parameter that is the get style

26504376
abstract-class	superclass
in order to maintain versatility i would make air and earth interfaces and motortype and nonmotortype abstract-class both extending a vehicletype superclass

26504376
implements	extends
a class like bicycle would extends nonmotortype and implements earth

26504376
implements	extends
a class like amphibiancar would extends motortype and implements both earth and water

26504390
keydown	onblur
you need to bind the reformat-function onblur cause ngmodel will trigger on each keydown

26504393
min	max
you can use the first or last as of oracle version 9i or min or max aggregate function

26504411
min	max
if you don t really care which name will be selected you can use min max first last.

26504445
textview	imageview
this layout as same which you created i just given id to imageview textview and also correct linearlayout weight

26504508
hide	show
instead of using css to hide and show elements use ng-if which will then remove the elements from the dom and therefore prevent any angular related magic happening for those elements until you want them back again

26504555
printwriter	bufferedwriter
if there are many continuous lines to be appended try using a single printwriter bufferedwriter object by creating a static final object

26504582
width	height
there is an easy way to get the screen s width and height in xamarin.forms and access it globally from everywhere in your app

26504621
post	get
i did not mention it that the post not get too complicated

26504645
int	chars
the value of the string has both alphabetic chars and a number an int in it

26504669
toolbar	tabs
the new toolbar cannot be used for inflating multiple line objects so it is impossible to add tabs to it

26504669
toolbar	tabs
here there is a custom library that uses v7 toolbar like tabwidget with the new material design animations but it uses the same methods from the old actionbar tabs so you can attach your viewpager to it

26504685
put	get
the above leads me to think that to get the most performance improvements i would have to make a collection of common includes put them into a single header file compile and include that header file

26504705
post	get
i want to get post publish date like 22 oct 2014 after the post title

26504755
int	double
the data can be either int or double

26504755
int	double
so i can circumvent the problem by defining two pointers one double and one int and check everywhere in my code which type i m dealing with

26504788
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	safari
jqbargraph is compatible and fully tested with safari 2+ internet explorer 6+ firefox 2+ google-chrome 3+ opera 9+

26504803
equals	compareto
apparantly the programmer implemented the compareto as if it was equals

26504816
maven	pom.xml
i need to use resteasy 3.0.8 and currently i am trying to achieve this result using maven and specifying that version in the pom.xml the correct resteasy is put in the war but seems like jboss keeps on using 2.3.7

26504837
exist-db	marklogic
i think it s worth the effort of putting these in an xml database such as marklogic or exist-db

26504842
required	placeholder
the example above contains the correct lambda only for the info i can extract from your question but as you can see it is just a matter to replace the placeholder lambda with the correct one that you required for the various combinations of checkboxes

26504853
serializable	deserialization
here is an example of full serializable and deserialization using protobuf with a dynamic runtime configuration for the data object

26504853
serializable	deserialization
wcf would take care of the serializable deserialization

26504895
comparator	comparable
violating the contract of comparable or comparator does not necessarily result in an exception

26504895
comparator	comparable
java√¢ 7 introduced timsort in it√¢ s sort implementation which is more likely to throw an exception for inconsistent comparable or comparator implementations than the implementations of earlier java releases

26504895
comparator	comparable
if you want to be on the safe side you should always implement unit tests for classes implementing comparable or comparator

26504915
put	get
when i put the fragmenttabhost in a fragment it gets no tab known for tag null when render and get runtime error when layoutinflater inflate the layout

26504987

i want to create new report using qweb template at odoo version 8

26505059
int	chars
the assignment is straight forward calculate the frequency of each unique chars in a list and emit out a list of chars int tuples

26505115
int	boolean	inherited	properties
case 3 4 on this one i am not exactly sure why it happens but since neither string nor int or boolean objects have a .count properties i could imagine that the properties is inherited by a parent-object

26505126
children	parent
i then want to be able to return a column when selecting the parent row with all its children so when i select other columns from products_id 2

26505137
width	height
i m using this simple directive to know the size height width of an dom element

26505187

26505192
fadein	fadeout
i have this jquery based fadein and fadeout routine which is working great

26505201
unsigned	short
i mean they are both unsigned short

26505307
spaces	delimiter
i just did a bit of testing which showed that you can also drop the spaces delimiter entirely

26505323
mathml	tex
you can use it to convert an html page containing tex code to one containing mathml instead using the page2mml command in the bin directory of the project

26505358
min	max
in case you didn t know there is a much simpler way to get the min and max values from an array - use math.min and math.min with apply

26505362
integer	unsigned
i presume that kvk_return is a #define or const integer and you are trying to cast to unsigned int

26505366
postfix	dovecot
i am currently trying to configure my first postfix - dovecot - postgresql installation

26505366
debian	linuxmint
linuxmint 16 petra debian wheezy

26505383
hash	md5
if i am not mistaken md5 hashing performance is the same as sha-256 so you could just check the list of hashing performance hash sec of each card here

26505394
min	max
use max rather than min for the aggregate and use the id__max key rather than id__min to get the value

26505420
min	max
the math operations needed include symbols arithmetic operations min max and some other basic functions

26505450
int	chars
the problem is that argv is a chars and i is an int

int	chars
is there any way around this or to compare the value in a chars with an int

26505486
uilabel	uibutton
i took uibutton below titles are uilabel

my modal view is 380 width x 550 height

26505714
jsf	tapestry
i don t know of any popular form builders for java and considering the amount of different view technologies available they would be tied to a certain type jsf tapestry etc.

26505773

consequently if i use a filter and rerender the icicle the g elements have the same position as before but the height and the width are as if it is freshly loaded

26505773
width	height
i solved my initial problem of d3 saving the width and height of the groups by setting the width and height equal to the width and height of the canvas

26505828

26506032
hash	salt
as the salt generated is at random hash of the salt+password combination would be different every time

26506032
hash	salt
exposed salt will create similar trouble as person trying to crack the password can append the exposed salt with different passwords to get the hash and match it

26506073
hash	salt
the server appends the salt and then hash the password

in my view i have an object viewcanvas with a width of 1250 and a height of 290

further when accessed from a server the same script works in google-chrome firefox and ie

26508327
implements	extends
it stated that there is function a function b and also protected function c so from that we derive if i am not extends implements this then i can not have access to function c

26508327
public	protected
now there needs to be a base send function that takes a message any type and a email address but since the classes are in an open environment then it will be dangerous to leave this send function public and therefore we need it as a protected method

26508329
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
the function gets passed two arguments the jqxhr in jquery 1.4.x xmlhttprequest object and a string categorizing the status of the request success notmodified error timeout abort or parsererror

objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
unless the data has been written by objectoutputstream you shouldn t use objectinputstream - that s very specific to java s binary serialization

26508395
maven	pom.xml
from what i can judge a that plugin should be available in one of those repositories and b if they are in the pom.xml file maven should be searching them but i can t see any sign of it doing that

post	get
the last time i installed that file version 4.5.30 the projecttracker project wasn t set up to run with visual studio 2013 so if you are new to csla and also running vs2013 this post i wrote on the csla forum may help you it describes how to get project tracker working in vs2013

26508701
versioning	upgrade
due to a versioning upgrade of camel to versioning 2.14.0 which internally uses now cxf 3.0.1 our services now stoped working as of a protocol mismatch for port x engine s protocol is http the url protocol is https - the configuration however was untouched during the version-update

26508701
ssl	https
note that cxf will use the jetty configuration beans during its initialization process and therefore create a ssl secured connection for https invoked urls - at least it did before the version-upgrade

26508730

and ensure you have a file called cookie.txt for example write it to tmp directory and give permissions 777 or make apache user the user of this file and give permissions 644

prepare	execute
i just had a similar problem where a query execute directly in sql server took 1 minute while the same query took 5 minutes through a java prepare statemnent

26508827
prepare	execute
when i execute the same query through a java prepare statement at the time that sql server is optimizing the query you haven t yet provided it any of the parameter values so it has to make a guess which index to use

26508827
prepare	execute
perhaps a better option for that would be to create multiple prepare statements optimized for different date ranges one for a day one for a week one for a month one for a year and one for a decade...or maybe you only need 2 or 3 options...i don t know and then for each query execute the one prepare statement whose time range best matches the range in the actual query

26508880
for-loop	loops
when running serially it is great to get diagnostic information about each iteration of the for-loop however when using the parfor loops for huge data set diagnostic information should be turned off

26508923
ssl	https
before we used to have good seo url like domain.com productname but last month we purchased ssl cert for our site now all urls is now on its https version so those product pages have changed its format for example from if you click the links it now messy like route productname in opencart

uicollectionview	uitableview
you probably should be using uicollectionview or uitableview instead of uiscrollview and manually adding your cells

26509196
uicollectionview	uitableview
maybe you have your reason s for using a scrollview and manually adding each row otherwise if you re open to alternative you can use uicollectionview or uitableview

26509196
uicollectionview	uitableview
that s where uitableview or uicollectionview comes in they reuse each cell when it goes offscreen that way you ll only ever need to render and store the visible cells on screen

swift	objective-c
an object is anyobject compatible if it is an instance of an objective-c or swift class or if the object can be bridged to one

26509504
swift	objective-c
you can bridge any nsarray object to a swift array because all objective-c objects are anyobject compatible

26509504
swift	objective-c
because all nsarray objects can be bridged to swift arrays the swift compiler replaces the nsarray class with anyobject when it imports objective-c apis.√¢ ≈ì

26510145
stdout	fflush
the reason you re not getting any output is that stdout as used by default by cout is not getting fflush

26510145
stdout	fflush
the stdout stream is buffered and this buffer will only be fflush in certain circumstances reaching a newline when it is instructed to fflush for example with cout.flush or on exiting the process

26510145
stdout	fflush
for these reasons stdout is never being fflush so any output is not being shown on the display

it will fail silently only when your specific require blah failed keeping all other loaderrors untouched as well as other exceptions nomethoderror or nameerror

given the code below i would not expect full_name to return joe smith as i am not using the .get properties accessor but recently found that this worked and does return joe smith

however i have another issue - when image changes from landscape to portrait it has been overlapped by buttons below

26510630
getter	setter
in the first example you are treating valid as a pojo field ie just like a getter or setter method except because it is boolean it is an isser method

26510630

getter and setter should have no logic behind them

the .modal state is an abstract parent state and there are several tab states that are children of that .modal.tab1 .modal.tab2 etc

26511500
slideup	slidedown
i also elected to use slideup and slidedown as it seemed to better suit your needs

26511524
width	text-align
the middle div should always be centered to the container while the divs to the left and right will always be touching the middle div and thus move around as the middle div s width changes the left and right s may be images so text-align doesn t always work

it works perfectly on google-chrome and firefox but when i test it on internet explorer 9 the image becomes enlarged even beyond the image size itself

26512451
google-chrome	firefox
instead of using oculusrifteffect i would recomend using vreffect and vrcontols and a firefox vr build or google-chrome vr build

26512452
int	chars
try calling scanf with c instead and convert the read chars to the corresponding int value this fixes your problem and should be managable to do by you

26512453
getter	setter
wpf bypasses your property getter setter and uses the internal dependency property instead for performance reasons eg setmyvalue is not called

26512454
folder	directory
my problem begins when i go to documents for example and i see in zsh that folder is under the same versioning as the home directory

26512455
hide	show	width	height
i checked up your website and i can see that it changes state from show hide on button as well as removing style or adds it to the div that is hidden but however your image width and height is 0.

26512455
hide	show
and here s simplified js fiddle since you asked how to show hide a div in your question so i used a button and hidden content just for sample demo

26512476
int	chars
in this case if res is not 1 scanf didn t read an int and you have some chars left in stdin

26512529

26512860
cdr	cons
i ve read and somewhat understand use of lambda for cons car cdr definition in sicp

26512860
lisp	scheme
consing as i learned it from various lisp scheme books is putting stuff in lists

26512860
cdr	cons
but as the light went on in my head cons was only sort of a placeholder for the eventual definitions of car and cdr

26512862

note that since your visited array contains only 1 s and 0 s you should use boolean instead of int for its elements

floating-point	integer
if it s an integer type the values are automatically converted to floating point values by the gpu when the vertex is being read either by converting them straight to floating-point values if normalized is gl_false or by dividing them by the maximum value of the integer type if normalized is gl_true

i have a snippet of code in which i was trying to do this put i do not get the intended results

26515590
versioning	upgrade
and lastly if you really did want to restrict system upgrade to only things available in a given minor versioning you would need to find a centos mirror which had broken out 6.x directories and them manually point your yum repository configurations at those repositories

26515621
post	put
writing to database will put content in db_name - post - user.uid - child - date post

26515676
int	chars
it doesn t work for sorting lists of int s chars s float s or non-representable types such as ptr and array

26515688
addition	multiplication
some wiseguy once came up with that because he could not handle being wrong unfortunately he was stronger than the others and threatened to hammer their heads in if they wouldnot do things like he had done so we are taught to this day that multiplication precedes over addition despite of the order they were put in

as an example i thought about piping an libav ffmpeg stream through an ssh tunnel

26515784
equals	gethashcode
override gethashcode and equals .if you are going to compare against only a single field property in your class then specify that field only like

26515784
equals	gethashcode
if you are going to have unique values in your list then it is better to use since it will only allow unique values based on gethashcode and equals implementation

26515784
equals	gethashcode
if you don t want to override gethashcode and equals then you can use a linq query to determine if an object exists in your list like

26516761
width	height
if they choose cylinder then the height and width fields are supposed to switch to disabled

26516773
int	double
i m not an expert on regex but you could check if entered data is numeric by trying to parse is as an int or a double for int or floating point numbers respectively

26516793
maven	pom.xml
i m not sure if the problem is that i right-clicked on the pom.xml file a few times and selected manual maven clean and installs and that somehow confused eclipse but i can t get it back to the point where eclipse knows how to build a war file for me and deploy it

26516796
elasticsearch	kibana

how can i ever upgrade my protobuf versioning with the requirement in place

26517474
button	checkbox
i ve a code where i add a class copyme and also toggle button enabled if at least one of the checkbox is changed checked unchecked this is the code behind that behavior

26517493
int	double
this happens because the ternary operator always evaluates to a single type and in your case java figures that given your second and third parameter the final type should be double and therefore it converts the int to match

26517535
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
this is ugly but its the best i have been able to come up with so far to distinguish between input types checkbox radio text and select dropdownlistfor

26517595
int	double
thus your int is unboxed converted to double and boxed into a double and the type of your numeric conditional expression is double

26517609
octree	quadtree
other types of 3d-trees octree quadtree kd-tree bounding-volume-hierarchy use axis-aligned bounding volumes and volumes are optionally allowed to overlap so contained objects don t need to be cut on volume boundaries

26517630
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition
multiplication division and remainder being performed before addition or subtraction

26517696
for-loop	arrays
all i have so far is my main but what i wanted to do for the other method was use a for-loop to check values at each space in my arrays and print them if they did not equal any of the other entries

26517703
for-loop	arrays
it is similar to a problem from my java lesson at college in which we were suppose to use the enhanced for-loop on a three dimensional arrays

26517740
setinterval	settimeout
it works great but as soon as i try and insert a settimeout or setinterval the data won t display

26517752
udp	tcp
that is all traffic inbound and outbound plus another security group with tcp udp ports open to my desktop ip

26517783
min	max	minimum	max
trying to put together regex that can match minimum 4 digits maximum 16 digits and those digits can be separated by characters - x+ but should not be part of the min max count

26517820
folder	directory
it would make sense to also not have this framework directory under git which is why the folder is also not deployed to my cloudcontrol app

26517841
bower	npm
first of all make sure you have bower in npm the node_modules folder

26517882
hex	binary
difference length possible conversion to numerical values using binary and or hex combinations etc.

26517888
lodash	underscore.js
that s an underscore.js template or lodash in this case which is a library and not at all something built into javascript

26517911
put	get
the get will return null because you haven t put in the map any k-v with key 0

26517919
knockout.js	upshot
i can t use for example knockout.js and upshot in the sources

26517940

26517974
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
nothing works i tried it in opera firefox all in windows and google-chrome debian

26517986
libs	buildpath
the jre libs in buildpath remove 1.7 and then add 1.6

26518067
for-loop	arrays
my question is how do i go from the arrays that is complete after the first for-loop to converting that arrays to a binary arrays in order to use the formula at the end of the code

26518095
listview	gridview
and then inside your class that displays swiperefreshlayout containing listview or gridview layout you can do something like this

26518097
children	parent
i m trying to create a function which converts an html string to a multidimensional array where the parent array is the tag and the children are the attributes but if i print_r my function it doesn t return every element

26518100
realloc	calloc
calloc fills memory with zeros but realloc leaves the value of the newly allocated portion indeterminate

26518100
realloc	calloc
on my platform long long is 64 bits but calloc and realloc accept size_t for the first argument so i m seeing several conversion from __int64 to size_t possible loss of data errors

26518108
bower	npm
in either scenario when other developers git pull or otherwise update their development environment things are likely to break unless they run npm install bundle cocoapods chocolateygoodness bower feathernest or python manage.py migrate bundle exec rake migrate or whatever and it√¢ s not always obvious that this is the case

26518126
google-chrome	firefox
if you really need the path you could probably write an extension for google-chrome firefox and force the client to install use it

26518148
for-loop	loops
the reason your code does not function as intended is because the value of the variable i will be at the end of loops and not 0 1 2 3 as desired because this would already have happened been incremented by the for-loop

26518151
free	malloc
the a s in the vector are stored on the heap but you don t need to manage the memory yourself no need for malloc free or new delete

26518167
jlist	jeditorpane
i have a jeditorpane and a jlist

26518167
jlist	jeditorpane
when the user selects an element in the jlist a website query is performed and the resulting html is written into the jeditorpane

26518167
jlist	jeditorpane
an issue arises however if the user scrolls through the jlist very quickly since every change starts a new query and the jeditorpane gets updated in a possibly wrong order individual results may take unpredictably longer or shorter to return and cause de-sync for the current list selection and the jeditorpane meaning that a list selection now shows a wrong result

26518167
jlist	jeditorpane
i tried making the method for updating the jeditorpane synchronized no effect disabled the jlist when a query has been launched no effect or paused the edt using thread.sleep as long as a query went on froze the gui

26518204
width	text-align
if you only need to center the text and the image in a div of a fixed width you can simply use text-align center on the parent container and display inline-block on the two elements within

26518230
strstr	substr
to find whether substr is in the string or not you can use strstr function

26518231
hex	binary
the function converts an hex representation to the binary string

26518237
inherited	subclassing
you would then actually generate a couple of car s motorbike s and truck s which all inherited from vehicle that are stored in the list as they are all vehicle s as well as their own subclassing

26518244
getter	setter
i m not sure if my class is wrong fields getter or setter

26518262
put	get
im am able to get data from the database but when i go to grab something in this case its all users and print it to the screen it shows nothing as if somewhere along the way it went off track and nothing got put in there

26518274
getter	setter
even in this example i would be tempted to make a main view interface which described the properties setter and getter and actions listeners callbacks that any implementation is guaranteed to provide then you don t care how these actions occur only that when they do you are expected to do something.

26518278
waitpid	fork
to do that you ll need to know its pid which suggests the use of the fork exec waitpid sequence -- a little more work than system but cleaner safer and generally more efficient -- and you ll need to deal with a couple of issues

26518278
curses	readline
furthermore if the application has placed the terminal in a non-standard state -- for example by using the readline or curses libraries which typically put the terminal into raw mode and disable echoing -- then the terminal may be rendered unusable

26518301
width	height
i want use a function that defines css s height width and some other attributes and that defines how many bar divs are used for the loading bar

26518427
int	chars
i ve tried using chars cast and use atoi i tried using a simple ascii translation and even doing a bitwise addition operation as shown here convert subset of vector uint8_t to int

26518501
flask	django
this is a best practice for any python-based web application be it flask django whatever

26518520
nswindow	nsvisualeffectview
to make this i have my own nswindow using a custom subclass which is transparent titlebar-less shadow-less that has a nsvisualeffectview inside its contentview

26518573
for-loop	arrays
some kind of followup to my last question for-loop - move deeper on numeric key in multidimensional arrays

26518604
google-chrome	firefox
my code runs fine in google-chrome but in firefox v31 and v33 i receive the following error

26518604
google-chrome	firefox
regardless of whether i use the button.fire or the button.dispatchevent the code succeeds in google-chrome and fails in firefox

26518630
getter	setter
for this change the types of the member the parameters in the setter and in the getter as well as the type in main to std string

26518637
folder	directory
use select root directory and browse for local folder containing adt-bundle-windows in pathname which typically looks something like c development adt-bundle-windows-x86_64-20140702 sdk extras android support v7 appcompat

26518647
post	put
if there s a better place to put this question i ll happily take it down and post it there

26518696
odoo	openerp
openerp odoo databases are incompatible between major versions

26518697
width	height
in general the preview and the captured image width and height will have to match

26518714
fixed-point	fractions
cv vec4i start_index end_index farthest_pt_index fixpt_depth where indices are 0-based indices in the original contour of the convexity defect beginning end and the farthest point and fixpt_depth is fixed-point approximation with 8 fractions bits of the distance between the farthest contour point and the hull

26518729
getter	setter
then i make getter and setter

26518745
google-chrome	firefox
altho it works great on google-chrome i can t seem to make it work on firefox explorer

26518751
width	height
a percentage height or width assigned to an element will only make it a percentage size of its parent element not the entire browser window

26518751
width	height
if the parent doesn t have a height or width assigned to it child elements with a percentage value have no effect

26518799
intrinsics	inlining
being a compiler intrinsics is just an optimization much like inlining and that doesn t interact with the c standard as long as the as-if rule is respected

26518812
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this is across multiple browsers google-chrome firefox opera ie

26518836
openssl	m2crypto
the following link was referred to build openssl first and then swig followed by m2crypto

26518852
put	get
perhaps the client first get s the customer then you add the new adddresses to addresses property and finally put it back to the server

26518852
put	get
now suppose things get really hairy and a get on customer followed by a put just can t work for whatever the crazy reason

26518886
put	get
if i put a in front of the switch statement i get a runtime error saying that i don t need to nest signs

26518927
mouse	keyboard
anyone know how to give mouse and keyboard input to a specific program without being focused so i can make a program that programmatically simulate mouse and keyboard input only to that program and i can do other things without getting disturbed by that process unlike java s robot that simulate mouse and keyboard control and that program must be in focus and foreground

26518929
for-loop	arrays
i tried putting the line inside a for-loop that runs the number of times spcified by user input instead of creating an arrays

26518937
width	height
note it s inside a box that is also using vh vw for height width

26518959
junit	mockito
instead of going mockito junit

26518959
junit	mockito
i had to put junit mockito

26518963
post	put
i forgot to add something rather obvious but you can define your own model serializers that can side-save any related models as part of a single post put transaction rather than using a .then approach depending on what your server supports

26518963
inherited	properties
firstly my application serializer mixes in the embedded records support and merging of the attrs properties so i can inherited serializers

26518983
post	get
this post s answer by matthew abbott seems easy but i m not able to get it to work

26519008

your code is a little hard to read but your immediate problem to why the touch doesn t work is because you are assuming your layer bubble has a content width and height

26533079
hide	show
so you can login and the navigation will show but after deleting the token it will only hide if i refresh the browser

26533079
hide	show
if you just click on the dashboard nav link it routes you back and show the home.html instead of dashboard.html but it never correctly hide the navigation even though scope.navigation false in the javascript

26533112
google-chrome	firefox
run the example and in firefox and google-chrome the background of the page will be red

26533215
post	get
but seems that my action method will be available for both post get requests when i do not specify any http method

26533217
versioning	upgrade
the software is 1.16.5 and i cannot upgrade it since the hosting server only supports a php compatible to this mediawiki versioning at the best

26533224
ready	each
the parent could create one named pipe and spawn multiple child which would each use the same pipe to tell the parent when they are ready

26533243
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i tried moving that code into viewwillappear instead of viewdidload but i get the same outcome - it s 600 in viewwillappear as well

26533387
google-chrome	firefox
this issue happens in firefox google-chrome and at least ie11

26533446
width	height
this has a fixed height but i want the width of the text field to scale with the width of the table or the table cell since these are the same width

26533446
width	height
my table and the table cells are scaling fine when i actually run the app although they are showing as misplaced in xcode which thinks the height and width should be zero see screenshot below

26533446
width	height
scaling to the height of a table cell is a common issue but not the width

26533446
width	height
and this is where i think the problem is since the expected height and width of the table view cell are both zero.

26533460
multiplying	multiplication
but i want something analogous to how in numpy for two arrays will do a column-wise multiplication very fast in contrast to explicitly looping over the columns of a and multiplying by z

26533465
lodash	underscore.js
libraries like underscore.js or lodash make this kind of thing easy but you can also do it easily with a simple loop

26533482
vpn	lan
maybe it is just a lan or maybe it will work in a big network and access through vpn etc

26533482
ant	maven
once you make sure your application works fine in different machines without any path conflict or resource loading conflict you can export your jar generate it using maven ant etc

today while creating a slider i stuck in the middle of code that how can i fadein and fadeout the image one by one in jquery

26533519

if you like your merge to be explicit always having both branches as parents you can call git merge --no-ff which will force the creation of a merge commit even if it could have been avoided by doing a fast-forward merge

26533522
plotrix	gplots
there are also functions in the gplots and plotrix packages for plotting text and adding tables to plots other functions in other packages probably exist along these lines as well

in my country dd mm yyyy is a common date format but if i want to store it in a mysql or postgresql database i must store it as yyyy-mm-dd

26533597
post	get
it is also probably a good idea to explain which error you get exactly when you post a question

26533614
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox and ie but it does not work in google-chrome

26533624
int	chars
- remember that site is the key a string so you re calling the method on string which expects an int and returns the chars at that index

26533634
submit	submission
the google sheets form submit event contains the form entry values in simple arrays e.values e.namedvalues whereas the forms form submit event contains a formresponse object that can be queried for all the information about the form submission

you can try putting another catch loops or check hasnext during that for-loop

26533690
build.gradle	gradlew
i run gradlew build for mp build.gradle the following output was produced

26533690

26533761
arduino	avr-gcc
yes it s possible - and what s better is you can use your existing arduino and its handy bootloader as a bare-metal atmega328p development board simply by ignoring the arduino ide and libraries and directly using avr-gcc to build and avrdude to load your hex files via the bootloader

26533769
google-chrome	firefox
perfectly working in firefox and google-chrome

converting an eml file to msg is as easy as

26534030
versioning	upgrade
to cut it short i m now using thor instead of rake and thor didn t work until i installed versioning 2.1.3 of ruby which is why i need an upgrade

26534038
for-loop	loops
the issue is it goes to next column instead of next element in the row and when i try putting the column for-loop outside it picks up 2 elements due to the inside row loops

26534078
apache	nginx
you could also just use a different node process per subdomain and performing routing in nginx or apache to the applicable process

26534155

many issues can come up when using setinterval instead of a recursive settimeout

26534198
hide	fadeout
then after load #home2 from home2.html i want to detach #home not just fadeout or hide

26534235
setinterval	settimeout
instead of using setinterval at a fixed 5s interval which is not dependent on the rest of the calls i would recommend using settimeout every time that the method actually is successful

26534270
rbenv	homebrew
it won t exist using rvm or rbenv either but homebrew will probably put a symlink

26534272
folder	directory
so i ve been trying to create a resource folder directory for my java project in intellij idea

26534292
spock	grails
if you want to use spock and you should then extend grails.test.spock.integrationspec for newer versions of grails that default to spock tests

26534331

afterall 2 will give you either 1 or 0 the least significant bit of your number in binary - no matter whether your input is binary octal decimal or whatever

26534333
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
downsides are that you have to digitally sign the application assemblies and clickonce manifest so clickonce can verify the upgrade and replace the older versioning instead of creating a brand new installation clickonce only installs into a user-specific app directory not into the all users program files directory and you cannot have any user-customizable install settings like installing various components or sidechaining additional package installs besides prerequisites

26534338
versioning	upgrade
longer answer i needed to upgrade my versioning of php

26534351
post	get
i am trying to do a post of a form in angular but the input testvalue doesn t get a value

26534647
superclass	subclassing
we have a backbone view superclass with six subclassing extending it

26534657
clang	icc
if i use gcc clang or icc with the -e flag to only run the preprocessor i get lines in the output that look like this

26534708

everything looks perfect on google-chrome firefox ie9 10 11 edge whatever but when you view it on 7 or 8 the header and footer change appearance and despite all my attempts i can t seem to fix the problem

26534708
google-chrome	firefox
i ve attached screenshots of the header footer in google-chrome firefox the browsers that work and i ve also attached the appearance in ie 7 8

26534724
hide	show
in order to bind it only to that specific link you can use your class that you ve specified for the links that hide and show the div elements

26534839
irix	linux
just be glad you no longer have to dig up access to hp-ux irix and aix as well. however i am under the impression that you can code to posix.1-2001 although not -2008 if you re only interested in portability to the open-source bsds full-scale desktop or server linux and osx

26534870
move	drag
when i use this code and try to drag something the entire screen scrolls down as a move the mouse while dragging

26534974

26535346
google-chrome	firefox
also i have a bunch of tests some of them need to be executed on firefox some of them under google-chrome

26535346
google-chrome	firefox
this solution is nice but still can be enhanced as browser handle their requests with different speed google-chrome will finish its queue much faster and firefox queue will work much longer

26535369
children	parent
so if a child has a parent i need to then find all other children of that parent then with those children find their parent and then with those parent find children...you get the recursive picture

26535369
children	parent
the link getting all the children of a parent using mssql query shows another method but doesn t return childpersonids 64 and 65 - it doesn t seem to recurse far enough

26535371
public	protected
when it gets filled with some value protected or public it would be available throughout all your controllers

26535391
ienumerable	ilist
you can cast the returned object to an ienumerable or to an ilist but not to an ienumerable of √¢ nor to a list of √¢ because the language simply doesn t give you the means required to express the √¢ part same type that myfoo has

this value is returned in ie8 and ie10 firefox 33 opera 25 and google-chrome 38

26535474
setinterval	settimeout
the clock in jasmine will only work if you re testing setinterval or settimeout functions directly as it just mocks those functions specifically to run synchronously

26535498
onchange	onblur
i ve tried setting an onblur or onchange attributes in the hidden input id_ayudacuentas but it also doesn t work

apache	nginx
this sort of file-serving architecture has been highly optimized by the various web server products like apache nginx and iis

26535769
width	height
for example if the imgloc column contains u 10234 abcde.img and the table also has width and height columns your web app can emit something like

26535838
versioning	upgrade
the trick is that the versioning numbers should be managed carefully to allow smooth upgrade for users of each platform

26535843
dictionary	map
i m thinking if a map view with bounds y2 y1 x2 x1 i could do a simple for-loop to find all the dictionary entries in those bounds with value true or even no value

26535868
put	get
edit i put some instructions following the official ol dev page on how to build run locally which will also get you the unminified ol source code

i cannot cd rm or chmod or chown the directory

26535886
maven	pom.xml
at first i thought i might be missing some libraries but this does not seem to be the issue now to me as i am using maven for dependency management .here is my pom.xml

26535906
webkit	blink
theoretically you could have also used image-set but support is pretty poor afaik blink webkit only with a webkit prefix

26535916
avassetwriter	avassetreader
either read the audio track from the source video file and write it out using avassetreader + avassetwriter or instead create an avmutablecomposition with the audio track from the source video inserted into an avmutablecompositiontrack and then use the export session as you have it set up there but with the composition as the asset

26535919
mp3	ogg
i did some research on google and ended up in saving the mp3 files in ogg format and reducing their duration as much as possible

using the included http post i should get back the json object below

26536087

i think it can be done that way but i can t make it i changed my field into quantity and item_to_adjust to have an arrays input and i edited my php action adding another for-loop

26536104
post	get
i have seen several post about using gcs locally but i can t seem to get it working correctly

26536159

26536185
fseek	ftell
i have tried using fseek and ftell but they are also resulting in a very similar issue

26536255
rmdir	chdir
a more gentle way would be to make some temporary directory using mkdtemp 3 then chdir 2 into it then perhaps unlink 2 or rmdir 2 it

26536257
direct3d	directx
for direct3d 11 development you should remove use of the directx sdk in favor of the windows 8.x sdk anyhow

26536263
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i tried in viewdidload and viewwillappear and neither of these work because what i believe self.interfaceorientation is still null at this moment

26536276
postgresql	mysql
or you can use the over clause if you re on sql server 2005+ recent versions of oracle or postgresql and most recent things not mysql or mariadb

26536388
getter	setter
write appropriate getter and setter methods for each of the private data members and

26536388

also use a for-loop you should traverse the arrays and display the title genre and rating for each

26536388
for-loop	arrays
can someone tell me what is wrong with the code and also if it s not too much to ask could you show me how to use arrays and a for-loop

prepare	execute
then finally the prepare execute is a simple two lines of code

26536417
width	height
for example i want width 5.1667 height 1.667 access to a c# windows form text box

26536417
width	height
but if i attempt to input those figures into a c# windows form height width property they are 1st invalid so if i change the width to 5 it is considerably to small to enter data into.

26536555
google-chrome	firefox
i tried the generated link using firefox and google-chrome and the dynamic link example is downloadable a jpg file without problems using these browsers

26536606
google-chrome	firefox
that way you can have 40 processes consume from a google-chrome queue and then switch to the generic queue once its drained and also have 40 processes consume from a firefox queue and then switch to the generic queue once it s drained

26536648
put	get
same thing with a put instead of get on the last hashmap to insert a value

26536659
pull	push
if the private server has access to internet you may setup instruct the repository on the private server to periodically pull changes from the external server and push its local changes back

26536659
pull	push
if the private server doesn t have access to internet you may use an intermediate host in your private network on which you first pull the changes from the external server repository and then push them to the internal server repository and vise versa effectively using this intermediate host as a mirror for both internal and external repositories

26536659
pull	push
if the private server repository resides on your workstation then simply pull changes periodically from the external server and push new local changes back

26536680
int	double
if i can assign an int to a double variable like this double num 1

26536703
free	realloc
if you don t mind the libc allocation functions realloc is even more efficient it wont copy the data on a shrink just mark the extra memory as free and if you grow the memory and there is memory free after it will mark the needed memory as used and not copy either

26536740
width	height
since the height is much bigger than the width there are top and bottom parts that are captured in the image that are not showing up in the live feed naturally

i know this post might be super vague...i m just stuck at data representation and i m sure that i ll be able to make some headway into this solver once i get some sort of idea as to how to represent this board as data

26536821
int	chars
please notice how the variable c is type int not type chars

26536836
cos	sin
for the endcaps you can use the sin cos output almost directly

26536888
for-loop	arrays
then fill in the arrays through a scanner with a for-loop

26536915
int	chars
you simply need to input 2 variables 1 chars 1 int and through a series of if statements determine if they are freshman sophomore junior or senior and what the major is

26536975
google-chrome	firefox
my wifi is already connected and works with firefox or google-chrome

26536981
put	get
as you can see if i put the method call addcounters in the for-loop i get many badges why i need to access the count-variables count_green count_yellow and count_red outside of the for-loop and ajax code

26537083
hash	salt
this has three weaknesses over using hash with salt

26537083
hash	salt
the really proper way to do it is to use a hash with salt but to iterate the function a few thousand times hash then hash again then hash again...

26537087
folder	directory
the browser assumes that it s looking at the default doc index.html home.htm etc. in that folder -- what originally was an index of the files in that directory

26537087
folder	directory
however without the trailing slash the browser thinks folder is actually a file called folder that is sitting in the root doc directory for the server as it has no way of differentiating -- it doesn t care one way or the other whether there is a file extension

26537100
min	max
i want it so that when i enter 10 into o12 my max function gives me 3 00 and my min gives me 1 00

26537100
min	max
my max function works perfectly and returns the highest number but my min function always displays zero

26537101
picasso	android-query
you can use android-query or picasso to do this

26537102
post	put
its this attribute that restangular seems to use for future post put requests rather than the id passed into the one command

26537115
int	chars
perhaps an array of int for each word would do the trick where you index the array with the chars you have found in the string

26537118
min	max
i am trying to set min date and max date for my date pickers but it keeps changing the values to the max dates in the date picker

26537141
outputstream	inputstream
i take the outputstream of the servlet and i take the jasper inputstream from another bundle and process this with this code

26537146
int	chars
you should have asked for the chars in one line and set it to major then asked for the int in another line and set it to year

26537178
min	max
and b all x is really doing is building up the interval from min start to max end for eacdh name which could be done with a simpler query and join

26537198
google-chrome	firefox
when i access to the server via google-chrome browser ask me for credentials as normally but when i access the same url via firefox it does not it just only displays a blank page

26537202
width	height
this creates a screenshot starting on pixel x y with your needed height and width independent of the current size of your application window

26537240
put	get
i scale the bitmap down and then get the pixels and put them into the int array

26537265
superclass	subclassing
hi guys trying to access the superclass from a subclassing and i have to add a instance of to the arraylist i am trying to sort the superclass instance but i wont let me do this

26537265
superclass	subclassing
the subclassing i am using is below i have tried the collections.sort shown below underneath the super.add but for some reason it will not let me access the superclass here is what i have tried

26537279
for-loop	arrays
first sort the arrays and then just do the following in a new for-loop

26537286
post	get
the post you referred to previously noted at the end that you can call getemployees without employeenumber and get all employees

26537328
width	height
when no width or height is supplied

26537359
prepare	bindparam
i m not sure you can use duplicate named parameters in a prepare statement but since bindparam is by reference the values will be identical

26537401
dbf	dbase
i am working in a software program called pastperfect that has a command window where it says you can use dbase commands to do global updates to the program s dbf files

26537420
put	get
if i put the server vars inline then the download and the var1 get sent but not the last two

26537427
width	height
set the height and width to the minimum size you want it only seems to grow not shrink

26537453
hide	show
for the front end you may want to push this all down via json to something like angular or knockout that can render the options available dynamically and show or hide different elements depending on the dependencies between groups

26537454
int	chars
a chars is a 16-bit unsigned value and if you cast it to an int then you ll get a value between 0 and 65535

26537475
int	chars
if you only want to store a limited nr of chars where some chars are legal and others are ignored you could create an array of fixed size where the chars s int value represents its index then increment the occurance value in that index as indicated in chiastic-security s answer

26537488
comparator	comparable
the collection.sort method expects either a collection of objects that implement comparable or a collection of objects and a comparator object that allows comparing them

26537488
comparator	comparable
you need to read up on the comparator and build a comparator that knows how to compare two product objects or write product so that it implements comparable

26537488
superclass	subclassing
one other thing is that you cannot access a private member of your superclass from a subclassing

26537488
public	protected
you can only access its protected public or package-accessible fields

26537488
super	extends	public	protected
if you do have visible protected public package-accessible field you don t need to use the super keyword to access it because the idea of extends a class is that you inherit its behavior and its state so if a field is visible you can just access it by its name or this .name

26537502
express	node.js
it uses node.js express monk mongodb and is a tutorial for new comers to node and express like me

26537536
webclient	httpwebrequest
if it s throwing an error i d attempt to collect the http status code you can do this by using the httpwebrequest and httpwebresponse i believe these pre-dated webclient

26537574
onclick	onchange
and finally a version that moves away from the obtrusive javascript of in-line event-handling onclick onchange etc

26537587
bindparam	bindvalue
instead of bindparam you should use bindvalue

26537606
min	max
this means you re actually allowed to use size min max and between rules to count array elements

26537611
getter	setter
imho it could be as simple as putting all activity utilities as fields in class activity and implement getter setter to use those utilities

26537670
git-svn	svn2git
the last is much bigger and git-svn runs for days and eventually crashes so i ve been experimenting with other tools like subgit svn2git kde s svn2git etc

26537677
mouse	keyboard
the issue with this plugin is that it checks if the user is idle using javascript if the keyboard mouse are being used

26537718
for-loop	arrays
suggestion as number one suggested add all elements in the temp arrays and copy the temp arrays into your list after the for-loop

26537801
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
on another note safari is rendering my font-icons from my subdomain but google-chrome and firefox are not

26537804
inherited	properties
it does however inherited from nscontrol which has a stringvalue properties

26537830
ng-show	ng-hide
you could use ng-show or ng-hide depending on how you want the semantics

26537860
width	height
i am trying to make a responsive image table but the images aren t showing up in the table if a fixed width height isn t given because of which perhaps it s not being re-sized

26537868
google-chrome	firefox
tested to work in ie9 latest google-chrome and firefox oct 2014

26537870
mouse	keyboard
if the user is not making requests and is not moving the mouse or keyboard or touching the device etc. then from the app s point of view the user is idle even if their eyeballs are not

26537871
richtextbox	textblock
as the richtextbox works with a flowdocument and the textblock with a inlinecollection this does not work

26537933
sequence	permutation
when you call it with ptr - 1 you only produce two permutation for a sequence of 4 items

26537933
sequence	permutation
when you use rnd.next ptr + 1 you get more permutation but with each possible loop you may not perform any swap which may leave a digit in its original position depending on the location in the sequence and other swaps

26537964
button	checkbox
i ve found a solution for binding a bunch of separate checkbox to their corresponding enum values one for each here but i m trying to create the togglebuttons by itemscontrol from the enum type s values so i wont have to remember to add a togglebutton every time i add another value to my enum type and also for shorter xaml code that creates the button

26537968
realloc	malloc
i suggest that you use malloc and realloc to manage your memory

26537996
post	get
i ve managed to get to the point of obtaining the authorization token but i don t know how to submit a post request to google

26538056
swift	objective-c
an api we are using has the following implementation that i am going to write in swift even though the original code is in objective-c

26538071
getter	setter
so as you can see the getter and setter are both in the public area

26538101
portrait	landscape
however if i hit the home button on the iphone and open the app again then the game starts in landscape but i see that the battery indicator and the signal bar is still in portrait mode

26538101
portrait	landscape
the game thinks it√¢ s in landscape but my iphone is in portrait

26538124
submit	submission
after the 1st submit the second submit for some reason is submission twice then the 3rd submit submit 3x..etc etc

26538139
for-loop	loops
i was told in class that i need a nested for-loop to do this but inside the rows loops i can t figure out what to put

26538176
google-chrome	firefox
but this work fine only in google-chrome but not in internet explorer and firefox

26538197
ubuntu	linux
update these instructions are based on ubuntu linux but i imagine the general concept applies on other systems as well even other dhcp clients must have similar configuration options

26538208
int	boolean
mysql will silently translate the boolean results of the tests into int 0 1 and then sum them up

26538214
int	double
i would parse these fields manually reading into int and double for the seconds then use days_from_civil to convert the year month day into a chrono system_clock time_point

26538214
ceil	floor
there are other rounding modes floor round ceil at this link

26538214
subtract	add
if your date time that you are parsing is known to be offset from utc you can add subtract that offset

26538253
jar	war
in a war or jar deployment the configuration file can be in either the meta-inf or web-inf directories

26538270
swift	objective-c
this approach would be illegal in swift due to type safety but you could still do it in objective-c

26538276
google-chrome	firefox
this could be throwing off google-chrome but not firefox

26538298
hide	show
i can t seem to figure out how to programmatically hide or show a setting

26538344
put	get
the other solution would be defining a non-generic base class for your variablenode then you can put your non-generic property there and finally you can easily cast your node as the base or interface and get the value of your property

26538347
versioning	upgrade
the workaround is to upgrade date.js to the versioning here

26538397
disk	ram
if you √¢ at the os layer √¢ create a ram disk you re technically not really writing to a permanent file and getting similar in-memory benefits if you can t use memdecompress

26538399
jar	war
to clarify in addition to the default war output and layout i need a jar that contains

26538436
implicit	shapeless
there s not really anything interesting you can do with a plain old t √¢ most operations in shapeless require you to provide some kind of evidence about the type in the form of implicit parameters like this

26538452
getter	setter
i have a contact class that has a no-arg constructor and some getter and setter

26538453
swift	objective-c
however if you define your class as objective-c then it should be equally usable from swift

26538454
setinterval	settimeout
in place of setinterval method try to use settimeout method

26538472
onitemclick	notifydatasetchanged
because of the log s i placed in the functions when the item is clicked i can verify that onitemclick is triggered and also that the notifydatasetchanged call is made to the adapter

26538486
int	double
it represents a single value similar to int double long ...

26538519
int	double
was all ushort for small memory in 32-bit but now also need int single and double versions

26538540
mouseover	mouseout

install and configure nodejs + npm to manage libraries through bower plugin

26538761
keystore	jks
with your private key and public certificate you need to create a pkcs12 keystore first then convert it into a jks

26538850
put	get
as netpoetica explained you can t just put plural ... inside expect because then plural is called before expect executes and what expect gets is the return value of plural but because it throws an exception expect does not get to execute

26538874
min	max
otherwise you d end up with a single figure for each year and not be able to calculate your min max and average

26538880
sorting	grouping
next is either one column referenced in a range condition or else one or more columns by which you are sorting or grouping

26538886

26539008
hide	show
when the server send a start session packet to the client it s shall hide the form1 and show form2 and when form2 load it ll show form3

26539075
factories	presenter
if you re doing something more dynamic like making a list of subviews that all need the same type of presenter you might make the parent view s presenter a factories of sub-presenters

26539087
getter	setter
or you can define a getter setter in the instance prototype but this approach has the disadvantage to have a lower performance

26539097
getter	setter
for example if the managed entity has a name field and the java bean standard getter and setter for that field defining the findbyname method in the dao interface will automatically generate the correct query

26539101
int	double
even without generics you can pass in an int and a double

26539191
udp	tcp
it isn t something you can just plug in and isn t as simple as the tcp socket stuff in openssl but i ve done something similar to write a udp based vpn with ssleay predecessor to openssl

26539191
rsa	aes
as an example you can initialize a session of your own using rsa then encrypt decrypt from a buffer with aes or some other algorithm that has hardware support for least latency

26539239
int	chars
it does not have a chars constructor because chars is an int and int arguments would auto-convert to chars resulting in very strange bugs

26539248
jar	manifest.mf
the issue is that the jar file has the meta-inf manifest.mf file only with no other files inside class files including

26539296
vb.net	vb6
printing in vb.net is very different to vb6

26539321

26539347
textwrangler	textedit
with regular encoding of utf-8 from either textedit or textwrangler the header error would appear in cron job as stated before

26539378
floating-point	integer
when you calculate temp the values can either be an integer math.factorial gmpy.fac or gmpy2.fac or a floating-point value gmpy2.factorial mpmath.fac

26539382
openejb	weld
2 picocontainer spring guice weld openejb needle

26539389
width	margin
since you float the content to the left and the sidebar to the right changing the margin won t have an effect unless maybe it gets bigger than the available width of the gap but certainly not while the margin is smaller than the gap that is already there

26539389
width	margin
perhaps a better solution would be to adjust the width of the content and or sidebar instead of using margin

26539392
width	margin
is their anyway to override the margin width of 900 and for the line to span the whole website while being static

26539393
put	get
if you are using jms when you put a message to a full queue you will get a jms exception jmswmq2007

26539451
mongodb	rethinkdb
i have seen that rethinkdb can do something like it but i was hoping mongodb would too

26539498
inherited	properties
okay i got it working by defining a constructor function that figures out if it s being called directly or through inherited by checking for templatename a properties that all my child classes define

26539541
superclass	subclassing
a subclassing constructor must call a superclass constructor

26539549
width	height
we have an app that is a fixed width and height and does not allow the user to scroll

26539563
width	margin
3rd column leave the width as desired but change border to outline outilne has no effect to the container width where border padding or margin does

26539584
folder	directory
but if your intention is to remove the link between local dire and git repo then you can just remove .git folder under your local directory

26539595
free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
yes you can allocate with malloc and keep track of the number of pointers used but you can free yourself from tying a counter to your list of pointers by initially allocating with calloc

26539595
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
you can evaluate whether to use malloc realloc off-the-shelf or whether to reallocate using calloc and a custom reallocate function depending on what your requirements are

26539600
put	get
one trick to get around swift s strict static typing would be to put something like this preprocessing block at the top of your file

26539623
hide	show
i would like to hide show the toolbar depending on if the user is scrolling up down the page just like in the new google s playstore app or newsstand app

then you can pass that array of integers to your average min max functions

26539745
width	height
the width and height set the size of the video that will be uploaded

you need to define a width in order to center with margin when its a block

26540339
swift	objective-c
swift objective-c code welcome

26540340
atoi	strtok
the first call to strtok line thus returns n which atoi converts to 0 then the next call to strtok null fails and returns null which causes atoi to segfault

26540340
atoi	strtok
i also suggest you use sscanf instead of atoi strtok

26540358
punctuation	words
the first one reads text from a text file the next one reverses every other words and does not include punctuation in the reversal and the last thread takes the reversed words from the queues and writes them back to a new text file

recommend to use fgets to read user input which is evil and then parse with sscanf strtok strtol etc

26540484
int	chars
if the value p being boxed is true false a byte or a chars in the range u0000 to u007f or an int or short number between -128 and 127 inclusive then let r1 and r2 be the results of any two boxing conversions of p

26540488
width	height
what you need to do is find the width and height of the tiles

26540513
packets	multicast	tcpreplay	wireshark
in a simple test case sending the same small multicast udp packets net data size 137 25 000 times using tcpreplay with at rate of 40mbps oftentimes not all packets arrive in my program although all packets arrive in wireshark which i run at the same time on that box

26540524
post	put
i believe this means i need the _csrf token for all request post put headers except login

26540724
loops	while-loop
here is while-loop code that is essentially equivalent to the for loops

26540731
getter	setter
firstly you need to define your variable abc with custom setter and getter

26540741
folder	directory
each custom rule project creates one dll file which has to be place in rules folder inside codeit.right directory

26540743
ember.js	qunit

26540791
fontfamily	font-size
i have been able to enter text but can t figure out how to change font-size and fontfamily

ember.js	qunit
if you weren t using ember.js qunit you could just use the container to fetch the controller initialized dependency not present when testing

26540807
inherited	properties
however properties inherited from the object s prototype will be copied over

26540832
submit	submission
please take note that i am submission multipart form and we know that its not stratight forward to submit multiparts using ajax

building off of denise s answer you can pass the double array to this function to print the average min and max

26540938
versioning	upgrade
you need to upgrade your versioning of handlebars as is stated in the error

26540973
jax-ws	saaj

width	height
i ve tried tons of crazy ways to figure out what the best layout would be such as checking the width of the input view or the width of the container app s view neither of which are allowed apparently and then determining what device it is so i can calculate a ratio for the size height and positioning of the keys according to the device s screen size and orientation

perhaps when you upgrade the versioning of angular you moved a script tag or the new versioning of angular has a subtly different execution time it used to wait for onload and now it doesn t

26543429
range	max
experimentally i found that with this quite simple approach an array with 100x200x300 elements generated by setting element f i j k to max f i-1 j k f i j-1 k f i j k-1 + random 100 can be searched for the middle value and t 1 checking only about 3 of the elements 25 elements checked for each element found within range

width	height
but i struck at ipad design because i used equal width and height for all devices using constraints its looking good for iphone devices but ipad also is showing as like iphone design so i need to increase button sizes so can i use a separate constrains for iphone and ipad buttons on single storyboard app in ios 8 with swift language

wordpress	joomla
also years ago was working with joomla drupal and wordpress

26543798
apache	nginx
phalcon 2 is written with zephir language to build apache nginx extensions

26543798

26543847
pthreads	fork
if you are absolutely sure you require fork and cannot instead use a more platform independent way of multiprocessing a thin fork createprocess wrapper or multithreading pthreads boost.thread c++11 std thread ... then you are forcing yourself to use cygwin

this leaves 3 classes but whenever i run the script below the min max values of the raster are displayed as the normal spread of the data not 0-3 for the newly coded classes

26544004
uialertview	uialertcontroller
the benefits to this approach is that you can abstract your alert presentation from your view controllers which should also make the transition to uialertcontroller easier since uialertview is deprecated

26544004
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
then what you can do is either create a default base uiviewcontroller and expose the coordination controller which can either be a singleton or a property on your app delegate or even a property on your own subclass of uinavigationcontroller

26544077
ready	each
its api is different from phantomjs in that each function or property that you call set takes a callback and so does page.evaluate for when the result is ready

26544099
libxml2	libxslt
i solved this issue on yosemite by both installing and linking libxml2 and libxslt through brew

26544185
width	height
my question is why when page content s height isn t enough to scroll width device-width doesn t work on mobile safari

26544224
strcpy	strncpy
strcpy does not check the margin of target memory so it is considered dangerous alternative strncpy is suggested instead

26544225
inherited	properties
you may need to pay attension to special script properties values common inherited unknown since some of characters has multiple properties or wrong properties

you have to define setter and getter method for property configuration

26544521
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it in firefox latest google-chrome latest ie latest

26544549
getter	setter
the first thing is to add equals and hashcode to your emp class like this without constructor getter and setter

26544584
min	max
this requires that we count back from max to min

26544642
tunnel	vpn
but all the solutions i have seen thus far use the vpn service class which creates a vpn tunnel for the whole device and not just my application

26544701
post	put
if i put in the post back trigger my file upload works nicely i can read out my bytes no problem

26544727
width	height
one solution it to add constraints to the view to keep the size you set right drag from the view to itself and then add a width constraint just as you would any other contstraint then either add a vertical height constraint or an aspect ratio constraint

26544738
implements	extends
some kind of copyable interface which the classes will implements a extends copyable

26544759
superclass	subclassing
their intended use is to allow subclassing to change specific party of the behaviour of their superclass see the template method pattern

26544791
qdatastream	qbytearray
think about them in qt terms as qbytearray or qdatastream

26544791
qtserialport	qtnetwork	qtcore	qtnetwork
then this base class in qtcore is reimplemented in subclasses like in the qtserialport qtbluetooth qtnetwork and the like modules

26544809
width	height
where the length width and the height of the cuboid would be the distance from the maximum point through an axis to the minimum point instead of randomly two points subtracting

26544860
mp3	wav

26544946
initializer	class-method
after a couple of research it seem that java allow overriding of class-method at initializer

26544962
uilabel	uibutton
just like uilabel and uibutton resizes itself based on its content the uiimageview also resizes itself based on the size of image its going to hold

26544962
width	height
so one simple solution for this is to set the width and height constraints or aspect ratio constraint on the image view so that the size of the image view will be constant

26545037
free	malloc
remember to check for a null return value from malloc and free the memory when you re finished with it

26545125

if i iterate through all grouping and then filtering locally i will fetch all contacts but most probably more than one time poor performance

26545234
gunicorn	uwsgi
as i mentioned in my comment the preferred way to deploy python applications with nginx is to use it as a reverse proxy to a standalone python wsgi server such as gunicorn or uwsgi

26545297
folder	directory
i added in a getdirectory method to create a new directory under the root where the file can sit and this is working but ideally i would like to save the file within the www folder of my cordova app

put	get
it works as expected on each runs of the batch file but if i put the call to cscript in a loop the return value seems to get cached while the batch file is running

26545380
width	height
add a width and height of 100 for both boxes and you can use the wrapper to define both boxes height and width and the same time

26545400
width	height
it seems that the rule width height in action

26545401
int	chars
you are checking a chars with int value in while loop

the first redirection of stdout redirects to current value of stderr tty

26545426
stdout	stderr
when stderr changes to dev null the stdout is still written to stderrs previous output tty

26545428
post	get
according to the name loadcountry i suppose it should be get method not post

26545433
post	get
a bit of a guess but i reckon you need a get instead of a post

26545486
width	height
the width and height of all layouts and views are need to be relative to the screen width and height

26545486
width	height
my problem is if i created a layout with 100 screen height and width then programatically i am setting the height of layout as 1280 pixels and width 768 pixels eg nexus 4 768 1280 logically the added layout should fit the device s screen

26545486
width	height
when i hardcoded the value for a layout width 768 and height 1280 it starts scrolling

26545486
width	height
how can i achieve the height and width to the views relative to the device s screen

26545486
width	height
i am getting the real height and real width of device from here link

26545515

26545776
awt	swing
have a look at performing custom painting and painting in awt and swing for more details

pull	push
because of this pushing and pulling from git requires a special sequence of commands rather than simply git push and git pull

26546094
google-chrome	firefox
but in order to debug your code and find the errors - i strongly recommend using firefox with firebug extension installed or google-chrome with developer tools open menu - tools - developer tools - check out your network tab - you will see there the files that load - the time they take for that - and check also the console for javascript errors

26546136

put	get
to counter this i have put the lock annotation on the method in the singleton bean but it still get executed twice concurrently

express	node.js
i found the solution over here partials with node.js + express + hogan.js

now during the execution of debugging pprof profiling cpu sampling is activated so a performance overhead is expected

26546698
for-loop	loops
i used to have a while loops to run the whole file but was getting an error and then decided to do a for-loop to have a smaller number of results

26546765
division	multiplication
this is still using integer division but the initial multiplication of will create a very large value say 291600 1080 which will still truncate but provide a seemingly correct value of 270

26546772
post	get
this is an exemple of the post redirect get pattern - if a post is succesfull the form was valid and the processing went ok it s good practice to return a redirect which will be followed by a get from the user-agent on the url you redirected to

i m learning directx by frank luna s 9.0c book and i m having some troubles acquiring mouse and keyboard

26546981
int	double
as math pow returns an xs double you would need to cast to an int first before trying to use the functions

26547014
sorting	filtering
this is incomplete code but the idea was to handle paging sorting and filtering

26547095
int	double
but doesn t define one for int and if i change the type of i into double they will run for equal speed

26547129

26548164
jboss	glassfish
you should know what ejb3 under jboss used hibernate ejb3 under glassfish used eclipse link jpa

26548167
for-loop	loops
but as nodejs is single-threaded and all code is executed in a loops whenever that for-loop gets executed it will be run from start to finish from iteration 0 to 9999999 without pauses so it will block other operations during that time

26548213
maven	pom.xml
i understand that when building maven project then only pom.xml is needed but in case i just click new- project

now i myself did once use it and wrote an extension to the ienumerable thing where it returns sorted ilist in a way where first items returned are the items never referenced by the other items

26548544
pop-up	dialog
what a lot of other responders don t know is that when you run a method in bluej it executes the method and if the the return value of the method is non-void it is shown in a pop-up dialog by invoking tostring

26548574
put	get
i would like to get the data from this website and put them into a dictionary

26548578
google-chrome	safari
i had the same problem and was getting notsupportederror dom exception 9 from cordova app on ios while the code worked fine in desktop safari google-chrome

26548579

it is working correctly when default parameters width and height are passed but when i enter integral size such as 100 for width and 100 for height output is not correct

26548597
min	max
the data is needed for a chart to be displayed in the mainwindow and some other classes which occasionally need the last n values to perform several checks min max average...

26548616

when you click the first radio button it has a drop down with a checkbox if you click the checkbox it adds 3

26548616
button	checkbox
click first radio button 78.25 and then the checkbox will make it 81.25 then pretend your the user change your mind and hit the second radio button it should change it back to 78.25 when you click

26548616
button	checkbox
i have it set up to uncheck the checkbox when another radio button is checked but for some reason the fee is not changing instantly and is delayed for some reason

26548633
getter	setter
a property with getter and setter actually compiles into methods in c#

26548642
children	parent
i am trying to position the 3 children by the following code in the parent

26548658
google-chrome	firefox
until recently it worked at the same speed on google-chrome ie and firefox on all computers where it was tested

26548659
width	height
when the child is inside the parent node set it s width and height to the element default which is auto

26548689
express	node.js
i m trying a simple node.js + express restful api example and i ve created a simple action to simulate a login request

26548771
hash	salt
the heading pretty much sums everything up although i would like to get a deeper insight and any suggestions into the best possible approach to salt + hash as users password field before the entity is persisted stored into the db javadb

26548771
hash	salt
i have done some reading and from what i have found it looks like we should have a method marked as transient within the entity which salt + hash the password prior to storing it in the db

26548809
udp	tcp
i believe they went this way to give you the ability to use i o with different protocols tcp udp by passing the right extension into the akka.io.io.apply

26548844
width	height
i implemented it successfuly but failed to control its width and height features

26548910
folder	directory
it can use #include ui_mainwindow.h because during compilation the build tool adds the build folder to the include directory

26548910
folder	directory
and the build directory may change for example you select another build folder for the release build

26548956
teamcity	jenkins
grunt can also be used in continuous integration tools like jenkins travis or teamcity

26548974
inherited	properties
as child controls automatically inherited their parent s datacontext objects you can now reference this view model from the textbox through the mycontrol.datacontext properties from the usercontrol s xaml

26549039
google-chrome	firefox
i really don t know why my code works perfectly in firefox but when i test it in google-chrome or ie it doesn t populate a dynamic dropdown

26549041
width	height
you re constraining width and height that distorts the images aspect ratio as the width changes but the height does not

26549041
width	height
most developers constrain width because devices have a physical maximum viewing width but can have an infinite vertical viewing height through scrolling

26549074
public	protected
please make sure that studentjson is a public or protected property in your backend class

26549099
hide	show
the tricky part is that based on a filter i show or hide certain values so i only wanna total the visible monetary values

26549127
width	height
the background-size property can set the width 50 in your case and the height 100 in your case

26549127
width	height
so first width then height

26549149
post	put
on versions 37 38 it fails with 401 unauthorized due to request authorization header missing in pre-flight options on both put and post

26549149
post	get
i have to workaround on chrome by sending get request instead of post and breaking rather huge data in multiple requests since url has a limit in size naturally

26549179
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the links function perfectly in both google-chrome and firefox but when i test it in safari the submit button just takes it to paypal s main page not the checkout

26549185
entities	entitymanager
you could solve the problem by adding custom methods to your entitymanager or a custom repository class that ll query all of the data required to compute the totalcost value for all entities and return only those you need

26549195
inherited	properties
i have a class that contains some properties and a class that inherited from that class that adds some additional properties

26549250
.htaccess	httpd.conf
in the httpd.conf .htaccess after setting allowoverride all and in my vhost

26549262
post	get
i get this error even though i have a post unauthenticated block in that module

26549304
union	distinct
as noted in the comments not only will the union remove duplicates between the columns but also those that occur with the columns meaning using a distinct is unnecessary

26549327
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
however this is only work in google-chrome firefox and opera which scrolls smoothly

26549328
rolify	cancancan
i would use rolify and cancancan to create an admin and client role

26549355
getter	setter
i can do this by manually having the developer modify the getter setter

26549388
dpkt	scapy
there are packages available such as pypcap dpkt and scapy

26549398
children	parent
define a function in the controller of the parent directive that will be consumed by its children directives

26549405
min	max
in all cases i am looping from 0 degrees to 360 degrees and want to find either the max or min

26549433
qapplication	qwidget
ultimately i need to instantiate qapplication to create qwidget -derived classes

26549440
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
the user is in sudoers and set nopasswd to avoid sudo passwd

26549459
icmp	ntp
i guess the distinction is not that ntp is for desktop operating systems and icmp for layer 3 devices since i know cisco switches that are using ntp

26549481
int	double
i tried math.round thinking it might somehow have become double even though the calculation involved only int s but without change

26549481
post	get
however when i reduced the line to just i to make my post here clearer i get the different error

26549485
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
using the network tab in the browsers inspector google-chrome firefox opera you can check the asset and see what kind of content type is being served

26549576
hide	show
by further research of the modifications of the dom while the loader show up and hide again i found a solution without changing jquery or jq-mobile methods i m using the mutationobserver api redirectslug dom 2fmutationobserver

26549579
xmltype	clob
try getting a clob from your xmltype using for instance getclobval and work your clob after that into a string

26549587
children	parent
here are some scripts that illustrate how a parent script can kill its children individually rather than en masse using kill -s sigterm 0

26549618
int	double
now it uses a different sqrt overload for int i_2 is int and sum_6 is double

26549657
daemons	systemd
turned out to be a complete nightmare- the rendered html output for the websites kept changing almost daily and quite often generated poorly formed html which could sometimes crash the spider daemons so we had to constantly maintain the systemd to keep it working properly

26549682
lisp	prolog
univ is handy because it lets you treat prolog terms similarly to how you would treat a complex s-expression in lisp it converts terms to lists of atoms

26549687
google-chrome	firefox
the following code works well when using google-chrome or firefox

26549687
google-chrome	firefox
here is how google-chrome firefox handles

26549687
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox result

26549705
width	height
you are essentially parallelizing width instead of height

26549796
int	boolean
where several fields such as a b c are boolean and some other fields like feet is a positive int

26549796
min	max
only one row max should be returned for any set of options and only one row min should be returned since the table guarantees there is one match but does not guarantee that it is exact

26549801
win32com	xlsxwriter
although you are looking for a win32com solution in the body of your question i ll point out for anyone who gets here via the title that this is also possible in python with xlsxwriter

26549830
min	max	range	min	range	max
i can probably fudge it a little because my min max range for every call will likely not exceed 2 billion but i d like to futureproof myself in case i decide that well i do need a broader range

26549831
entities	entitymanager
we either create a transaction before querying for the page then commit the transaction which detaches all entities associated with the entitymanager for that transaction or we explicitly call entitymanager.detach

26549874
fish	zsh
i ve recently moved from the zsh to the fish shell but i occasionally still stumble upon some incompatibilities

26549881
width	height
i have a max-width wrapper within it are four boxes of a fixed width and height

26549929
hide	show
you do not have to hide or show validation message instead use validation summary

26549929
hide	show
then you do not have to write hide show code

26549929
hide	show
validation summary will handle hide show

26549929
hide	show
and will have to write logic to hide show them it will be tedious to handle that

26549949
clearinterval	settimeout
using settimeout to clearinterval is not an ideal solution

26549952
put	get
so if i put in 7683 the output i want to get is 02 08 03

26549994
copying	overwrite
otherwise the null character is written at the same offset where the next field starts and copying a string to the next field effectively overwrite the last null character

26550006
joomla	typo3
in fact many cms systems already have such a rewritebase directive in their pre-written .htacces files which is commented out and only needs to be activated drupal joomla typo3

26550025
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux	debian	linux
if you re going the linux route then you further need to decide what linux distribution to use redhat ubuntu debian amazon etc

26550025
apache	nginx
the answer to that question will then narrow down your choices of the actual web service be it iis windows only apache nginx etc

26550036
button	checkbox
i originally had the submit button in the loop before i added the checkbox

26550051
octal	decimal
if you remove the leading zeroes from the code you provided an_example will change from 300 octal 192 decimal to 300 decimal 454 octal

26550054
hide	show
i am trying to get the element to toggle show on click and hide the other element

26550057
uitableview	reloaddata
when i rotate the device i resize the uitableview and change the position to fit nicely on the screen i also resize the tableview row height and call tableview reloaddata

26550076
folder	dir
for start in put the path of the dir folder where you want to

26550083
octal	decimal
300 octal is equal to 192 decimal so you will get the value 192 from this code

26550086
children	parent
parent has_many children belongs_to parent

26550086
children	parent
if the parent does not have any children null out the rest of the fields

26550113
ssl	https
already tried both http and https as some articles are saying fb requires ssl

26550130
implements	extends
if you want to implements an ai you ll probably start with the minimax algorithm and later extends it with alpha-beta-pruning

26550146
width	height
then enclose all of that within an item whose width is equal to the implicitwidth of the row and whose height is equal to whatever height you want probably the height of one item delegate

26550157
filtering	grouping
that way any filtering or grouping will be applied to them as well

26550157
filtering	grouping
this can come in handy when you want to reference an aggregate of the entire dataset from inside a grouping or other filtering section of the report as you can set the scope to be the name of the dataset itself and it will aggregate without fields

26550289
folder	directory
i have a remote directory under it i have a folder structure as below

26550306
many-to-one	one-to-many	many-to-many	one-to-many	many-to-many	many-to-one
i m trying to deconstruct a many-to-many relationship down to seperate many-to-one and one-to-many entities so i can add additional columns

26550339
octal	decimal	octal	binary
binary octal decimal and hexadecimal

26550339
octal	decimal
000300 is an octal number and represents 192 in decimal because you have a leading 0

26550360
bower	npm
inside a container if i run apt-get npm install bower install i cant get through the proxy

26550373
put	get
however as i was attempting to get python to at least give me the json string to put through a json validator i came across mention of json.load vs json.loads

26550442
submit	submission
if you instead setup an externalquestion hosted on your own server or an htmlquestion either created via the api then you can prevent submission by only showing the submit button when the code is correct

26550468
min	max
for min max average calculation again you d maintain your own list of recent items and update the calculations as each item comes in

26550468
min	max
maintaining a running min max average from the most recent n items is a pretty standard technique that requires very little processing

26550472
submit	submission
the user submit information about their gender age and which of 8 genres of computer game they like at least one and the datetime of form submission

26550480
children	parent
i m assuming you don t want it on parent or children

26550489
division	subtraction
edit please see wouter s comments about my solution it does not work for non-commutative operations like subtraction and division

26550497
mediator	service-locator
footnote i have seen the latter pattern work in jimmie bogard s mediatr implementation of the mediator pattern and in fact what i m trying to accomplish here is a very similar implementation that doesn t rely on the common service-locator but rather goes straight to our ioc container

26550546
int	double
and there is no necessity that they be int so i would declare both as double

26550546
int	double
in addition you know that you will be returning a number right know an int but based on 2 it should also be a double so i would declare that as well

26550550
google-chrome	firefox
the given code works in mozilla firefox 31.0 but not in google-chrome 38.0.2125.104

26550566
for-loop	arrays
wrapped is now referencing an arrays of functions because that s what you re returning in your for-loop

26550594
ubuntu	linux
i am building mdnsresponder-master on my linux machine ubuntu 32-bit

26550639

postgresql	mysql
also using sequelize with very few changes in code you can change the database you use - from postgresql to mysql sqlite

nsis	burn	nsis	prerequisites	burn	prerequisites
as you can see from above the burn bootstrapper is wrapped in an nsis package to install the windows imaging component which is a prerequisites for installing .net framework 4 on windows server 2003

26551075
submit	submission
upon submit the contact.php form strips code checks validity etc before submission

26551077
getter	setter
but if that object uses magic getter setter it returns an empty array

26551100
inherited	subclassing
more specifically imagenamed does not get exposed to swift subclassing of nsimage even when all other convenience inits are inherited

26551100
inherited	subclassing
also in the swift programming language book we see that the rules for subclassing initializer inherited are

26551100
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
if your subclassing doesn√¢ t define any designated initializers it automatically inherited all of its superclass designated initializers

26551100
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
if your subclassing provides an implementation of all of its superclass designated initializers√¢ either by inheriting them as per rule 1 or by providing a custom implementation as part of its definition√¢ then it automatically inherited all of the superclass convenience initializers.√¢

26551104
wildfly	undertow
they seem to be pushing it back to undertow wildfly because the hack exists in tomcat instead of fixing the actual issue

26551172
filtering	grouping
you should almost always use an index on any fields you are going to use for joins sorts grouping or filtering in where clauses

26551272
persistent	transient
so i understand that the transient from javax.persistence.transient marks that a property or field is not persistent

26551290
google-chrome	firefox
i tested the following solution on google-chrome ie and firefox

26551310
post	get
submit via post using javascript instead of get

26551313
post	get
what i want to do is get the 3 blog post with the most views in the past 24 hours

26551345
persistent	transient
transient means the field is not persistent which also means it will not be fetched from the database

26551356
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
specifically height width margin and padding are always listed

26551356
width	height
setting height and width certainly works for me - and i assume everyone else as well since every example i ve found on the web explaining inline-block sets one or both

26551361
versioning	upgrade
running laravel 4.1 as my company hasn t upgrade their php versioning yet

26551380
setinterval	settimeout
i refactored my code to use an anonymous function for the setinterval and settimeout methods that fixed this issue

26551413
int	double
you need to cast double values to int because only int accept by method

26551413
int	double
r.getx returns double so cast it to int and pass to the method

26551428
mouseup	mousedown
after mousedown move and finally mouseup events downedpos is equal to upedpos

26551439
maven	pom.xml
i was looking up how to get the application name artifact id and version from maven pom.xml or manifest when i came across this question get maven artifact version at runtime

26551449
width	margin
you re not seeing the right margin because your width is equal to the width of the body so technically the right edge is past the viewport

26551466
folder	directory
so what i did was i created an app which reads the whole folder and get its sub directory and files and generates the necessary code blocks like

26551481
public	protected
and yet another option is obviously to simply change your property to public instead of protected

26551541
daemons	systemd
i want to test that a daemons program is correctly started at systemd startup inside the vm and the vm is started test in my view should have been only a little side-test but it gave birth to the question

26551569
sorting	filtering
eg inequality filtering more than 1 cannot be used sorting based on custom data end user variables are two very big pains

26551577
width	height
use the ratio of height to width to determine which orientation you are moving to and adjust your constraints accordingly

26551577
width	height
you could make iboutlets to the view s height and width constraints and change their constant values inside that method

26551577
portrait	landscape
so for example if you wanted the view full width 768 in portrait and 350 in landscape you would solve these two equations

26551714
width	height
getright returns x + width - 1 and getbottom returns y + height - 1

26551814
sorting	grouping
i find wpa useful but grouping by stack in the cpu usage sampled table doesn t seem to allow sorting by aggregated function call count

26551854
superclass	subclassing
and i m expecting that i m using two different counter static fields one for the superclass genericresource and one for the subclassing type1resource

26551854
superclass	subclassing
i need instead to refer at different counter static fields one for each subclassing mantaining at the same time the static methods structure of the superclass

26551862
maven	pom.xml
copy your jar and all dependant jars to webapp web-inf lib directory or pom.xml if maven

26551881
getter	setter
self.x is the property accessed via getter setter methods created when you use property to declare x

26551881
getter	setter
when you use property previously used with synthesize no longer required it auto-generates the getter setter and backing ivar

26551881
accessor	properties	accessor	superclass	accessor	ivar	public	protected	superclass	subclassing	ivar	subclassing
if you declare properties double x in your public .h file it will be protected by default meaning that both the accessor methods and the ivar should be visible to instances of the superclass and subclassing but not to instances of other outside classes

26551881
ivar	subclassing
if you declare that same property in a class extension or the implementation block in your .m exposing only what you really need to it s private by default meaning the ivar is only accessible by instances of that exact class - not subclassing instances

26551881
getter	setter
this leaves only the getter setter methods exposed to the subclass

26551900
children	parent
in my specific case i need to import a tree of items and on one level a parent was using children as repository and it also had a multi reference list to a subset of the children based on some criteria

26551951
calloc	malloc
so the sizeof some pointer is always the same on your machine it is always 8 and does not depend of the size passed to some malloc or calloc function

26551951
calloc	malloc
given a malloc -ed or calloc -ed pointer there is no portable way to know the size requested at its allocation time

26551979
put	get
why it worked when you put document.ready last - because kendodatepicker made proper initialization and set correct date and when doc.ready fired it is able to get value and set

26551990
alasset	phasset
i tested on one video asset phasset shows the size as 43.703125 alasset shows the size as 43.703005

three.js	webvr
i m working on a small webvr web metaverse project where three.js scenes are connected using portals like you would find in the valve game

26551995
google-chrome	firefox
after a little testing it is kind of a pain to close the window after it prints because ie behaves differently than firefox and google-chrome

26551995
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the .print method blocks and the next line of code does not execute until after the printing is done

26552008
min	max
this code works well however when i find the max min or avg i need to grab the corresponding name of the country and print that as well

26552026
hide	show
instead of relying on gallery height manipulation you can just choose to show the first 3 images and hide the rest.

26552032
cos	sin
the point at angle √Æ in radians is cos √Æ sin √Æ

26552112
hide	show
i m using jquery ui show hide to show and hide my website menus on my responsive layout and have been doing so for months

26552112
hide	show
the show hide is working fine but whenever i scroll the menus are automatically hiding

26552112
hide	show
i don t have a scroll function defined and as i said show hide works fine on all browsers

26552185
abstract-class	superclass
i m extending an abstract-class from a library and i want to override a function definition and use the superclass s definition as a fallback

26552269
filtering	grouping
seems like you re looking for filtering grouping results

26552310
imageview	picasso
however when used in another page where the fragment replaces another fragment with an imageview in it loaded via picasso the app and my phone crash with an obscure exception

26552310
imageview	picasso
as i mentioned the mapfragment replaces another fragment that contains an imageview whose content is loaded via picasso

26552315
postgresql	mysql
it is much faster than phpmyadmin does less funky iframe stuff and supports both mysql and postgresql

26552332
mouse	keyboard
you re stalling the main thread which also does the event processing and rendering it uncapable of responding to keyboard mouse window messages

26552376
hide	show
i ve got nested accordions in bootstrap and have added a plus minus icon to the title to toggle on accordion show hide

26552376
hide	show
the problem is that with the jquery selectors i m using when one of the child accordions show hide the plus minus icon changes -- but the parent plus minus icon changes also

26552381
for-loop	loops
i tried to use a if statement after the function doajax but problem is it s an asynchronous function and the for-loop doesn t wait for doajax to end before starting another loops

26552403
touchesbegan	touchesended
in touchesended calculate the distance and direction of your initial touch touchesbegan and ending touch touchesended

26552428
grouplayout	miglayout
use a modern flexible layout manager miglayout grouplayout or formlayout

26552438
min	max
using the pandas module and below should show the max min and average respectively

26552450
width	height
so we can overcome that limitation by setting the background-size to 100 width or height depending on the orientation

26552488

if i create a vbo now is it bound to the vao

26552642
vbo	vao
after binding the vao if i create a vbo

hide	show
you can still get the intended effect you must hide your main window after the dialog is displayed show it again before the dialog closes

26552731
boost	allocator
so i made this container allocator memory_pools class based on boost pool

26552745
width	height
imagemap is a very old way to create websites i preffer using photoshop image s√£ lice and save as html maybe you should try it ir you will use non dynamic images that way you can fix width and height and a lot more

26552762
width	height
the issue is that the first image is wider than body width thus creating a horizontal scroll-bar making window height smaller

26552819
box-sizing	border-box
add box-sizing border-box to your table s css

26552824

26552938
public	protected
as an example all the qt framework is build with this idiom so you will never ever maybe exagerating but you get the point see any private class variable in the hundreds of header files they provide just public and virtual protected methods

26552960
client-side	server-side
it looks like you re transitioning from a classic web server-side development model to a client-side model

26552973
width	height
if you want to retain the full y-axis but only show say the middle 50 of the x axis then you have to plot on a device whose width is 50 that of the height approximately because r s default is to use different sized margins on the top bottom left right margins.

26552973
width	height
you could solve the problem exactly by setting the margins equal around the plot using and then work out the ratio of the range of the scores on the x and y axes get the scores sol and compute the range on both columns then compute the ratio of the two ranges then use that to give you the desired height of the plot for the width you want to state

26552979

now take your plugin folder which you can download as a zip from github for example and simply copy the folder into your packages directory

26553514
hash	salt
to avoid storing the password in plaintext in the code or anywhere else e.g database file etc. use hash and salt

26553514
hash	salt
you will hash the concatenated password and salt and store like hashtype hash salt

26553514
hash	salt
then to check the password you will concatenate the input with the corresponding salt hash it and compare to the stored hashtype

26553525

26553565
int	chars
after some research i ve realized that i used to look at solution in wrong way and to manipulate chars bits you need assembly 8-16bit interrupts for more information you can search about int 10h 11 service you can insert a strings of ones and zeros and get result...it works but only in xp command prompt and below systems you need to use dosbox emulator also you need to use c or c++

inherited	properties
car doesn t have a seats properties so see if it inherited one

26557791
width	height
i thought setting it to a position absolute would work but then the menu s height is reset and the width messes up

26557822
teamcity	dotcover
the coverage report from the nunit dotcover build step is stored in the teamcity hidden artifacts directory

26557858
squash	branch
if you re still really really convinced you need to do this you ll frequently need to squash your commits together creating one large commit for the entire feature then cherry pick the changeset between the branch

26557858
squash	branch	squash	merge
this methodology of squash everything associated with this feature into one huge commit and cherry-picking it between branch means you re doing very large merge .

26557887
macports	homebrew
if you want to use glib grab gcc from homebrew or macports and use it to compile your programs instead of clang

26557923
bionic	libc
in android world i would like to understand the purpose of extra layer hal in between libraries bionic libc and linux kernel

26557962
uiview	subviews
if the two views are subviews of different views use the convertpoint method of uiview

26558033
addition	multiplication
i have looked at attempting to convert the multiplication into an addition but that also requires me to use 2 32 which if i mod will again give me 2 32 so i am not sure how to perform an unsigned mod of a 64 bit value with a 32 bit one

26558045
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
another approach i d try is setting both elements box-sizing property to border-box and see whether setting your contentdiv s width to 100 then works the way you want

26558052
integer	unsigned
optionally a unsigned integer values

26558078
width	height
you can set the size fix size of your window in its load event when the window got its width and height based on the size of its content

26558107
build.gradle	gradlew
i have created a build.gradle file in the project s module which is recognized by idea correctly as gradlew file according to the icon next to the file name

26558109
post	get
and i have been asked to make it a post request rather than a get request anyway

26558118
post	put
i m not too familiar with tumblr and i am trying to figure out how to put some elements into each post requested by the person i m helping

26558148
hlsl	glsl
note i m working with both glsl and hlsl but they seem almost entirely feature-compatible

26558168
ssl	https
so basically if you re not getting https in your ajaxurl the is_ssl function isn t properly detecting ssl on your site

26558189
next	except
this next program does exactly the same thing except it uses mpi_bcast to send the values from process 0 to the other processes

26558197
strcpy	strncpy
strcpy replace by strncpy

26558198
swift	objective-c
you do this the same way in swift as you do in objective-c

26558238
for-loop	arrays
the thing i would like to know is how to write an enhanced for-loop for an arrays based on the class of the object in the arrays

26558262
strcpy	strncpy
strncpy is not a safe replacement for strcpy

26558262
atoi	atof
group atoi atof atol and so on

26558262
strtol	strtod
group strtol strtod and such

26558271
rtp	rtsp
i got h264 rtp packet from rtsp stream

26558326
ssl	https
create asp.net webservice for ssl https

26558339
post	get
when i try to hit submit i get this error stackoverflow won t let me post the entire error but here s some of it --

26558392
width	height
make sure that your and elements have their width and height at 100

26558412
profiling	instrumentation
to have a proper check of what s going on you might want to run instrumentation adding time profiling to your tab

26558442
apache	nginx
i m attempting to test out nginx and potentially make a switch from apache

26558442
apache	nginx
i m having issues getting the configuration of nginx to match that of my apache setup -- mainly rewrite rules

26558443
fts4	fts3
here an example to activate fts3 fts4

26558507
clang	icc
clang says 2 and so does icc 13

26558510
for-loop	arrays
now we have a for-loop that will go over the whole arrays by counting x from 0 1st part of the for-statement int x 0 until we reach the end of the arrays 2nd part x numbers.length in steps of 1 3rd part x++

26558538
queue	fifo
you can implement that pattern quite easily by spawning a second thread and using a synchronized fifo queue to send data from the network-handling thread to the packet-parsing thread

26558542
bionic	libc
as per the process stack above i see that dalvik runtime is talking to hal kernel layer via bionic libc library

26558555
for-loop	arrays
then once the last for-loop breaks out of scope i could reconstruct the new arrays digit by digit from converting it from a string

26558568
pull	push
since you are the owners of these repos it should be easy for your to sync them using git push and git pull

26558587
folder	directory
for security reasons i want to disable the user from right clicking any where on the file selection dialog box and being able to delete rename existing files and or create delete existing folder directory

26558638
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
one of the major points of inherited is that it should be possible to treat subclassing instances like a superclass instance safely

26558638
superclass	subclassing
a reference type of superclass type can point to an instance of that class or subclassing freely

26558645
build.gradle	gradlew
to get all intellij gradlew features you need to import the project via gradlew then point it to build.gradle

26558655
int	chars
the convertion from chars to int also preserve the value s sign so it produce 0xfffffff9

26558692
slug	permalinks
this is likely due to the _get request that is specifically looking for the page id instead of something like the slug or whatever is in the query string after you updated the permalinks

26558718
post	get
the outside firm we hired to develop our product created a hack to get around an issue where chrome would not post back if you wished to disable the submit button to prevent double post on the click of the button itself

26558767
box-sizing	border-box
it seems simply adding table-layout fixed and box-sizing border-box to my table has solved the problem

26558782
put	get
with robot you can tag your unit tests or put them all in a separate hierarchy so that you can run them separate from acceptance tests if you like or combine them and get statistics broken out separately

26558785
hide	show
i understand that i could just display 100 images each rotated slightly and show and hide them as needed

26558852
int	chars
your challenge adds a simple complication that you must read both chars and int from the file and then add the elements to the array based on whether the chars represent digits or whether it is the single chars x which you then substitute the value 99999

26558860
wav	ogg	wmv	ogg	gif	png	mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	mp3	wmv
default acceptable file types extensions are jpg jpeg png gif pdf doc docx ppt pptx odt avi ogg m4a mov mp3 mp4 mpg wav and wmv

26558921
google-chrome	firefox
i have a game project where i used a dynamically created table.the table and its cells appears in google-chrome but not in firefox.so to check it i created a separate table in another html file to see if it s a problem on my code or not but again the table cells doesn t appears on firefox

26558933
folder	dir
the problem is that i can get wix# to do this just fine but i can only get the msi to build if all the registry entries are inside a dir block and that winds up actually creating a physical folder which i don t want on the target system

26558933
folder	dir
as a temporary workaround i wound up using dir block specifying a dummy temp folder

26558968
centos	linux
it is working fine for windows xampp server and also tested on linux centos 6.0

26558970
width	height
now as the clicked div is animating to fill the page the other divs are animating to disappear using width height and opacity

26558970
width	height
the width height of all divs transition with the same speed so as the clicked div grows the other divs shrink and the clicked div won t snap to the left top

26559010
division	subtract
like grade school long division a b but in base 2 subtract b from a if possible then shift looping 64 times

26559010
integer	unsigned
below is a generic modu that works with any array size a and any size unsigned integer

26559048
strcpy	strncpy
strcpy - strncpy - strlcpy strcpy_s

26559063
vbo	vao
you can bind a vbo before you bind a vao and fill the vbo with data using glbufferdata

26559063
vbo	vao
in this case the vbo is automatically unbound from the currently bound vao but not from other vaos that are not currently bound

26559067
getter	setter
the property must be a valid entity type and the property should have a non-abstract getter and setter

26559085
spaces	delimiter
the one issue here is that the data as supplied in this webpage is delimiter by spaces not tabs

26559085
spaces	delimiter
as long as the date and time columns are separated by spaces and the data third column is separated by a tab you use the tab delimiter so i assume your data file has tabs in it somewhere this will work

26559236
uiswitch	uibutton	uilabel	uibutton	uilabel	uitextview
this seems to work well with all field types - uibutton uilabel uiswitch uitextview etc

26559269
outputstream	inputstream
at the java level the garbage collector gc will finalize any outputstream inputstream reader or writer that it finds to be garbage

26559294
rpm	yum
where rpm will report missing dependencies and quit cleanly a tool like yum or apt for rpm will try to satisfy those dependencies and implicitly add their providers to the install target

26559308
qitemdelegate	qobject
qitemdelegate subclasses qabstractitemdelegate which in turn subclasses qobject

26559308
qitemdelegate	qwidget
the first argument of qmessagebox.warning must be a derivative of qwidget which as you can see from my above explanation qitemdelegate is not

26559316
for-loop	arrays
what i m confused about is how the for-loop iterates the arrays

26559317
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
could it be as simple as using fileinputstream and reading bytes into an array and back out with fileoutputstream

26559352

26559491
screens	tablet
the navbar i have collapses when shrinking the screens on my desktop but when i pull it up on a tablet or phone it won t

26559493
implements	extends
as for ...when should we use an anonymous class to implements a listener the simplest answer would be when you need to extends two or more classes say extends someparentclass mouseadapter since this is not allowed in java what you can do instead is to use an anonymous class to extends your mouseadapter and have your enclosing class just extends someparentclass

26559516
free	malloc
malloc error for object 0x7f8a61403a00 pointer being free was not allocated

26559542
width	height
after scouring google stack for answers the closest thing i can find is being able to have a div with proportional height based on 100 width but what i am asking for is the inverse

26559542
width	height
100 height width proportional width

26559542
width	height
i attempted a solution using 100 height and gave the div a padding-width but that css hack only works because the padding property is based on the width of the div

26559542
width	height
i am able to achieve a width but not a proportional width based on height

26559544

autocompletetextview	spinner
note as i experienced the last point is correct in spinner not in autocompletetextview

26559967
autocompletetextview	spinner
you can read more about spinner and autocompletetextview

26560000
rational-numbers	base
that s because many rational-numbers that have a finite decimal expansion in base 10 do not in base 2

26560000

26560550
implements	extends
so when i try to implements a class besucheadapter extends cursoradapter i get the following message

26560575
put	get
example if you put a 1090px image on a 800px screen resolution it will just not work so what we do is to set image width value to 100 in this case and so on that way the images get auto resized the easy way

26560589
width	height
so if you want the width and height in variables w and h do this

26560589
width	height
now you can test the width and height and do further processing if necessary

26560589
width	height
you should now have the width and height of image input.png in 2 variables w and h check by typing

26560594

how to stop this re-sizing and giving a fixed width and height to the layout

26561070
concave	convex
if you try plot y x then it does not look exponential indeed it seems to be slightly faster than linear especially if you see that there are in fact two points in your data with the x y values 3.710225 7000 so you are trying to fit a convex curve to data which suggests a concave curve

26561101

google-chrome	firefox
here s the code this strange behaviour occurs on google-chrome 38 and firefox 32

26561187
google-chrome	firefox
although both look almost same the problem is that in firefox the widths of all the three rows are much larger than the actual width as shown by google-chrome

26561187
google-chrome	firefox
for example in google-chrome the width of the first row is 4222px which should be the actual width however in firefox the same row has a width of 8708px which is more than double

maven-install-plugin	pom.xml
you have bound the maven-install-plugin to the life-clycle in your pom.xml so you should simply call the life cylce

26561452
nexus	artifactory
best is to use a repository manager like nexus artifactory or archiva or if really don t like repository managers i don t understand why but this is a different story you can use stephen connolly s non-maven-jar-maven-plugin

26561538
inherited	properties
when you create a child scope it inherited properties from its parent scope like so

26561538
inherited	properties
this might seem a bit surprising but the reason is actually very simple the child scope inherited the foo object reference from its parent and since it s a reference assignment to one of its properties will propagate everywhere like they should

26561539

width	height
using pil to determine width and height of images

26561800
width	height
on a specific image luckily only this one - but it is troubling the width height returning from image.size is the opposite

free	malloc
one implementation of malloc free might be a smart heap that checks the validity of addresses you pass to free to verify that they are in valid arenas or heap regions before carrying out any action

26569971
free	malloc
the next malloc implementation might make an assumption that the pointer you passed to free was correct and access or set hidden heap bookkeeping values in an address relative to the pointer you passed

26569971
free	malloc
there is no standard implementation of malloc free so there are a bunch of possibilities

mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
i want to handle mousedown mousemove and mouseup events on the desktop and i want similar behavior on a touch screen

26570181
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
it gets stuck in the mousemove state until another mousedown - mouseup sequence within the target

26570181
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
for the desktop implementation mousedown would be bound to the target element and mousemove and mouseup would be bound to the window or some parent element from within the mousedown event

26570181
mouseup	mousedown
the mouseup would then always fire even when the mousedown is released - even if the cursor is outside the target element

26570181
mousemove	mouseup
the mousemove and mouseup would be unbound in the mouseup event

26570183

you already know that you can use any class that implements actionlistener as your button s actionlistener or any class that implements action or extends abstractaction as your button s action and it s easy to demonstrate this

26572990
hide	show
note that since .leftdrawer-hover and .rightdrawer-hover are children on #pgcontainer clicking on them would act exactly as you need because click events will bubble to #pgcontainer where you will detect them and show hide corresponding drawer

26573758

rest has nothing to do with html only http rather than using a wrapper like an xml document which says i would like you to do action x here is the input y which is roughly what soap does rest uses the url and the type of http request get post put delete to describe what s needed

26573758

26574259
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
the issue was because of the padding the width was 100 and also padding was added so the total width increased to 100 + padding using box-sizing border-box which gives padding border from inside

the semantics of the post method are entirely within your control and that s why they must be documented and you can t rely on the client knowing beforehand what it does as is the case with get put and delete

26577274
post	put
in simple terms having a put operation that isn t idempotent is a violation of the http method semantics but having a post that is idempotent is fine

26577274
post	put
if you want to do something like that you should use post not put

26577274

accessor	properties
the issue lay with the setter accessor and also with the _vatincusive properties

26577885
getter	setter
usually such values are not accessed through getter and setter but through a calculation class behavior

26577885
getter	setter
the first is to have getter and setter for all the values that your behavior depends upon - distancetraveled in this case

26577885
getter	setter
you d probably also have getter and setter for other fields but they are not pertinent to the behavior we are currently discussing

children	parent
say i have a public class parent and two derived children classes called son and daughter

26583118

all post unconfirmed post confirmed etc will never make to the index method as it will be matched with posts#show and then with get post friendly_id to posts#show

26583118
post	get
now even if you move your all get routes to top it will never make it to other methods you might wanna define later as all post unconfirmed post confirmed etc will be matched with and will be redirected as confirmed unconfirmed etc

26583162
public	protected
does this class inherit all the protected and public variables functions within the daughter class and the parent class

26583235

26583627
strtol	strtod
difference between scanf and strtol strtod in parsing numbers

26583630
int	chars
you need to check the return value because your c value can never be eof because eof is an int value that doesn t fit into a chars

26583645

int	chars
a pointer to the first chars following the int representation in s is stored in the object pointed by p if is different to n then you have a bad input

26583892
children	parent
this allows you to build a tree of game objects where the children follow the transformation of their parent

26583911
setinterval	settimeout
i would use a chain of settimeout s instead of setinterval s here

26583985
put	get
now to get different styles you just need to put another class on the second ul to target that one specifically

26584011
sorting	filtering
it provides filtering and sorting of components

26584030
nsstring	nsjsonserialization
you can convert nsstring to json format using inbuilt ios functionality called nsjsonserialization

26584030
nsstring	nsdata
for that you have to convert nsstring to nsdata

26584074

in your accountformbean the getter and setter for amount field are not named correctly

26584312

maven	pom.xml
one of the most confusing aspects of maven is the fact that the parent pom.xml can act as both a parent and as an aggregator

26584723
maven	pom.xml
99 of the functionality you think about in maven is the parent pom.xml aspect where you inherit things like repositories plugins and most importantly dependencies

26584745
nexus	artifactory
you will have to get the jar add it to your local maven repository or your organisation one generally nexus or artifactory and set the scope as provided

26584755
glfw	glew
the below example depends on glew + glfw + glm

26584760
public	protected
technically it is ok to modify the access specifiers such as public private protected which are defined in a probably third-party header file

26584760
public	protected
but one would better not to change access specifier from private to protected public because there won t be any guaranty that it holds a desired value any point of time during execution

26584798
for-loop	arrays
use arrays and for-loop to do this

26584821
drawrect	layoutsubviews
during his demonstration he performs the drawing of the view in layoutsubviews rather than drawrect

26584821
drawrect	layoutsubviews
it makes sense that drawrect should be responsible for the drawing of the view and layoutsubviews handling positioning

26584916
versioning	upgrade
you should upgrade to a newer versioning of php and use one of the opcode caching systems like xcache or wincache

26584931
width	height
note you can also set the height using only css but you cannot set the width only to one autocomplete

26585043
versioning	upgrade
however in my case i was unable to upgrade to the latest chromedriver versioning

26585068
hive	hdfs
a hive administrator can create the table and it can point it toward your own user owned hdfs storage location and you grant hive permission to read from there

26585068
hive	hdfs
hive authorization and hcatalog authorization is orthogonal to hdfs authorization

26585074
jobs	cron
i have some files that are called by cron jobs or ajax calls

26585077
hash	md5
both md4 md5 are not encryption they are a hash function that produce a 128-bit hash value

26585077
hash	md5
and to add on to the security aspect of md5 it has been declared as non usable due to several vulnerabilities that can result in hash collision and worst still reversing the ciphertext back to their original values using rainbow tables

26585110
hide	show
without changing the app too much we want to include angular just for this small part on the page a form with some complex rules attached show hide loop etc...

26585110
ng-app	ng-controller
the page does not have the ng-app ng-controller or angular js loaded initially

26585111
hide	show
i suggest that you hide the select and show another control that represents the date picker

26585122
opera	google-chrome
i tried the following code and it works on google-chrome opera ie9+ but not on mozilla

26585153
filtering	grouping
i m trying to set filtering to get all grouping that specific user is member of

26585165
cashapelayer	uibezierpath
a cashapelayer uses a cgpath which is the core foundation shape drawing object that is used internally by uibezierpath

26585189
mouseover	mouseout
the idea is that you setup a timeout on mouseover and clear it on mouseout

26585220
super	extends	superclass	subclassing
i have a huge superclass that many different not different enough to have their own super classes subclassing extends

26585220
superclass	subclassing
some subclassing don t use every single primitive declared by the superclass

26585258
superclass	subclassing
some subclassing don t use every single primitive declared by the superclass

26585274
width	height
you never call update width height for the viewport

26585285
subtract	add
it would be nice to be able to reduce this down to an atomic add subtract of the reference count

26585285
subtract	add
so i use read write locks on the large structures atomic add subtract for the reference counts and a garbage collector to do the actual destruction of items

26585285
128bit	64bit
if you have 128bit atomic operation to hand you can put a 64bit address and a 64bit reference count together and do something along the lines of

26585285
128bit	64bit
where foo is the 128bit combined ptr ref-count whose existence is protected by some external means -- assuming 64bit ptr and 64bit count -- and bar is a local variable of that form and ptr is a void

26585304
versioning	upgrade
to safely upgrade open your composer.json file find and change the versioning like so

26585342
uilabel	nsstring
4 uilabel + nsstring - quite fast but again no access to kerning

26585403
profiling	debugging
and for debugging profiling there are several tools

26585447
hide	show
i tried enriques solution # 1 to hide one payment method in frontend only to show it in admin

26585511
post	get
change the http method to post as opposed to get which would preserve the spaces as intended

26585572
subtract	add
i want to obtain a curve passing through the pixel-points positions of a canny edge of a free surface of water in a tank problem of sloshing so next i can work freely on the curve in an x-y plane for example to compare 2 curves and add or subtract them

26585573
children	parent
the parent shell doesn t see the variable updates in its children

26585657
screens	tablet
but still the icons look oddly smaller or larger for different screens as there can be tablet as well as mid-sized phones that can have the same resolution

26585710
hide	show
you should rather search for checked checkboxes count show the div if count is equal to 0 else hide them

26585716
width	height
1- in the parent tag of relative layout i have removed android layout_alignbottom android layout_aligntop android layout_toleftof and android layout_torightof no need for them because you already set width and height match_parent

26585802
int	double
in my db id is an int while latitude and longitude are double

26585979
centos	linux
i have wso2emm version 1.1.0 installed on a linux centos 6.5 with a separate mysql db server

26586039
post	get
i am trying to get the data from the web service by using the post method

26586049
width	height
how can i fix the width and height of each box they may all have different height without no scroll bars if text overflows

26586049
width	height
if text does overflow the cell height width must stay same size and hide any overflowing text

26586050
nsstring	nsobject
the format specifier for nsstring is and not actually any nsobject -derived class that implements the description method

26586077
int	double
every int is exactly convertible to double so the exact quotient of the double matches the exact quotient of the original values

26586077
int	double
exponent overflow and underflow in double are impossible for the int range so the two value sets will give the same answer

26586172
fgets	strtol
i know how this can be done using fgets and strtol i would like to know how this can be done using scanf if possible

26586172
fgets	strtol
as the other answers say scanf isn t really suitable for this fgets and strtol is an alternative though fgets has the drawback that it s hard to detect a 0-byte in the input and impossible to tell what has been input after a 0-byte if any

26586225
width	height
it should be original height original width x new width new height

26586244
jruby	mri
now the problem is the library nokogiri seems to accept this path under mri but not under jruby throws a syntaxerror

26586257

ubuntu	linux
but when i start compiling on my linux box running ubuntu for all the static libraries compilation the makefile libs is empty except the main gyp file which creates the executable

26586328
put	get
it must have a blocking get and put

26586350
listview	gridview
i was in a similar situation but i had a listview instead of a gridview

26586363
int	chars
when converting a chars to an int the result is implementation defined

26586363
int	chars
using signed or unsigned chars do guarantee the chars to int conversion outcome

26586386
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
note that this safer version may seem slower than using a for-loop and actually it is because it traverses the arrays 3 times - unless the compiler is able to optimize it - but i would prefer it over a loops because it s more compact and in my opinion more readable

26586398
put	get
no checks here for the correct type or that you have selected an item..but you get the idea put something more useful than a naked object or a mere string into the listbox

26586420
memmove	memset	memcpy	memset	memcpy	memmove
on macos x functions like memcpy memmove and memset have implementations that are optimised depending on the hardware you are using the same call will execute different code depending on the processor set up at boot time

26586420
strcpy	strcmp
nothing for strcpy and strcmp as far as i know

26586458
maven	pom.xml
as your stack trace shows the org.primefaces.event.nodeselectevent class doesn t exist in your runtime class path and if you take a look at your pom.xml as mentioned by gimby in comments you explicitly asked maven not to include your library folder in your final packaged war file

26586459
post	get
i am new in soap parsing my client give me webservices url and tail me this is .net webservices soap parsing and get json return so i don t know where should i start most of time i am using php webservices but this is new for me and i try to last 4 days i have download lots of example but i can t able go get response and before this question 5 days ago i post one question but i cant get any response

26586524
width	height
if the height and width of the circle are fixed then create some of the height with the top and bottom padding to center the text in the middle

26586547
apache	nginx
current code works on apache config but not on nginx

26586547
apache	nginx
works on the apache but not on nginx

26586645
google-chrome	firefox
the columns have fixed widths which are rendered correctly in firefox but completely ignored in google-chrome

26586655
switching	screens
switching pausing resuming worked fine but the locked screens seemed to kill the activity context and when the app resumed the dialogs became graphically corrupt and i got the √¢ ≈ìactivity has leaked window√¢ error message in the logs

26586689
int	double
in other words when you enter a number then press enter input.nextint consumes only the number not the end of line primitive data types like int double etc does not consume end of line due which this end of line remain in buffer ane when input.next executes it consumes the end of line from buffer from the first input

26586690
put	get
since there are many answers about a single approach but none that is comparing the different ways to get volley up and running i also put my two cents in

26586698
google-chrome	safari
this seems to happen in both safari and google-chrome for mac not tested on windows

26586746
min	max
if min and max are only used on ordered sets all reasonable definitions are equivalent

26586746
min	max
in practice however min and max are used on preordered sets sets in which you can have two elements that sort the same without being identical

26586746
min	max
on a preordered set the argument goes min of two equivalent elements should return the first parameter and max should return the second

26586746
min	max
the pair min x y max x y is either x y or y x

26586746
min	max
if x and y are distinct then min x y and max x y are distinct

26586746
min	max
the function that maps x y to min x y max x y is a stable sorting function for sets of two elements

26586872
mktime	strtotime
the reason i split it into 2 functions is because i wanted to emphasise the point that i can t just alter time to strtotime mktime or any other function

26586925
width	height
to fix the width and height and to stop overflowing you can use css class

26587015

profiling	instrumentation
so use instrumentation time profiling in particular

26587558
versioning	upgrade
i had the same problem but upgrade to latest versioning doesn t helped

26587560
udp	tcp
you can always open up a tcp or udp socket and communicate through that

26587698
int	double
my code so far recognises that a double has been entered where it wants an int and throws the error

26587698
int	double
an int can be passed in and accepted as a double value which i don t want

26587701
width	height
height and width are both 0

26587708
int	chars
the original intention of the format string was to accept one of three possible limiter chars between two int and today - thanks to cppcheck 1 - i see that accepts even strings of limiter chars

26587723
button	checkbox
as originally written this checked all control items including labels button etc. if they were checkbox and proceeded accordingly

26587731

a few have said to me to use the explode and substr to split the filename up and then i guess search through the array

26588256
serializable	deserialization
however my project already had a specialized xmlhelper class which handles the xml serializable deserialization so ed merks helped solve my issue within that class

26588274
post	get
the static website shouldn t have a real path it should just be a blank website which listens on host headers or post get to deliver images css and javascript from the right source

also we can make max min o 1 and delete o n instead

26637969
min	max
if your array is sorted it will cause insert delete to be o n but you will gain o logn find and o 1 min max

26637969
min	max
the complexity can be o 1 min max any how for both

26637976
min	max
the query produces result for min and max for the whole period of time outlined in the where clause so period of multiple days dramatically screws up the result

26638070
implements	extends
jaxb2 inheritance plugin allows you to make your classes implements a given interface or extends a certain class

26638081
minimum	max
hey buddy you are missing the minimum sdk version target sdk and max sdk

26638085
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome dev tools shows that the initial request to socket.io gets cancelled by the browser i ve tried on firefox and safari with similar results

26638147
swift	objective-c
as always file a bug if you d like to see apple change things. neither swift nor opengl are really designed around being friendly to each other √¢ opengl is a c api and swift s api bridging seems to be more centered around objective-c apis and their conventions

26638168
osx	yosemite
i had the same issue with pow.cx on my two macbooks after upgrading osx to yosemite

26638181
lxml	elementtree
now that this data format is better for parsing import elementtree from the lxml library

26638291
width	height
it is responsive and if your images width and height are defined and all the same this code will do

26638339
width	height
an image with 100 width will scale meaning the height will also adjust itself depending on how wide the image is

26638348
folder	directory
i have mounted a new drive to a folder within my home directory home mediapc downloads as i was running low on storage

26638392
dlsym	dlopen
you should read documentation of dlopen 3 and dlsym and you should always handle failure

26638418
stdout	stderr
you direct stdout to a file but warnings actually go to stderr

26638418
stdout	stderr
you can redirect both stderr and stdout using

26638427
next	except
to do the animation make a function i ll call it the draw function and call it what ever you want except reserved words then at the very end of the draw function call the requestanimationframe function and give it the name of the function to be called next frame

26638465
width	margin
lastly to center the dashed boxes you can define a fixed width for your main_article div and then center it using margin 0px auto

26638473
opera	firefox
the easiest solution is -webkit-linear-gradient but as much as i love webkit i feel i have a responsibily as a developer to support firefox opera and ie to some extent

26638473
width	height
svg also comes up in which i found this example but svg must be a current width and height in which i don t know what this text will be it s inputted by the client

26638473
width	height
unless we can get the height and width of the text and append svg dynamically

26638494
ssl	https
i ve tried directly loading a https url like and in both cases this fails with an openssl ssl sslerror error

26638499
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection	ilist	icollection
it returns a listbox.objectcollection object which implements ilist icollection and ienumerable

26638550
google-chrome	firefox
it works on firefox and google-chrome

26638586
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
i m just starting to learn how to deploy a node js application using amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk and i got stuck in this part from the tutorial

26638590
disk	ram
however i suppose if this query would be used on a machine with less ram it will starts spilling to disk and hurt performance badly

26638592
versioning	upgrade
do upgrade python-pysnmp4 package to 4.1.16a+ versioning

26638658
int	double
the task is to write a complete program that reads an int from the user using cin discussed in section 1.3 double it using the doublenumber function you wrote for question 4 and then prints the doubled value out to the console

26638702
cout	cin
cout and cin are object in std namespace

26638717
hide	show
naturally you will want to set the isrunning property of the activityindicator whenever you show hide the panel

26638725
gif	png
my understanding is that it only allows gif jpe jpeg and png

26638738
multiplying	multiplication
if you think of the operation in matrix multiplication terms you can t multiplying a 10x5 matrix with a 10x1 matrix

26638738
width	height
in particular it s pretty clear from the illustration in the paper showing the derivation of a and b from the larger matrix that the height of a is the height of b and the width of a is the width of b.t which is of course the height of b again

26638760
subtract	add
also to restore the stack pointer you need to add to it not subtract

26638762
width	height
i wasn t sure if the child knows about the parent s width and height

26638774
width	height
the height and width that the polygon will take up should always be equal to that of its parent in this case 200px x 200px which we will assume that it s always going to be a square

26638818
width	height
also you ll probably want to store some state in the shapes class so you can change the x y width height state

26638828
pow	math.h
for example i can find the pow function by pressing the ctrl + f1 keys in turbo c++ and the result is math.h

26638833
pull	push
you could consider using push and pull to order the columns

26638839
unix	solaris
so i have a makefile that has to compile on different machines solaris and unix so we need to create different directories for our object files for creation

26638861
for-loop	arrays
the first for-loop finds the first instance of atg in the arrays

26638861
for-loop	arrays
the second for-loop is supposed to report the first instance of taa tag or tga in the arrays that is after the first atg

26638862
maven	pom.xml
when i run mvn install against the parent pom.xml file this parent pom.xml references the other projects then i receive errors that some maven dependencies cannot be found

26638937
post	get
i have referred to angular ui router unit testing states to urls and a related blog post but cannot get a simpler version of what is explained there working

26638964
for-loop	arrays
if you want to do this without a for-loop like selman22 suggested your other option would be to use a jagged arrays or an arrays of arrays

26638987
qcheckbox	qlistwidgetitem
qlistwidgetitem doesn t provide any way to know where did user click label or box so the easiest way is to use qcheckbox as a widget

26638992
inherited	properties
projecta has a class which inherited from an abstract class in projectb and one of the properties of proejctb.baseclass is of type system.drawing.image

26638993
children	parent
create a list of all the children under the parent s transform

26638996
oncreate	recreate
from that point the fragment recreate a new adapter which means the adapter was null when the oncreate was run

26639119
width	height
a pseudo element is still a child of its parent so if you want to absolutely position it relative to its parent or one of the grand parents and use the grand parent s width and height in percentages as well in the pseudo element s definition you need to explicitly define the positioning on its grand parent

26639120
width	height
it recieves a file pointer to a .bmp image file the image s height and width and attempts to create a dynamic tridimensional matrix to store the rgb values of each pixel ignoring the alpha one wich is always 0 in .bmps

26639127
maven	pom.xml
so only solution in that situation is to add all missing dependencies absolutely with pom.xml files and then re-run maven install or just mvn dependency resolve

26639147
int	chars
in c c++ pretty much anything and go into if statement int pointer string constant number chars etc

26639154
getter	setter
then generate getter and setter

26639155
put	get
this is just a quick example i put together to try to get input on this

26639169
put	get
when i make get calls it returns me all the data but when i try with put patch i get

26639179
google-chrome	firefox
but it doesn t change the font-size in these browsers google-chrome and firefox

26639183
namenode	hdfs
you can inspect the balance of blocks from the hdfs namenode ui if you click on the live nodes link

26639196
g++	gcc
of course use g++ to compile c++ applications with gcc

26639196
g++	gcc
technically you still pass -i and -d flags at compile time and -l and -l flags at link time to gcc or g++ but the pkg-config utility or make .... is generating these flags

26639339
portrait	landscape
my application supports portrait mode in some pages and landscape mode in others so in the case of the ios version of the application i have portrait landscape left and landscape right turned on but restricted in the view controllers

26639355
google-chrome	firefox
according to the test below all firefox google-chrome and ie8 have the same problem but at different values

26639355
google-chrome	firefox
but on firefox and google-chrome much before that number some elements are shifted one or two pixels to the left or to the right

26639359
d3.js	dagre-d3
if you want to use d3.js for whatever reason have a look at dagre-d3

26639359
d3.js	dagre
use dagre with a newer version of d3.js it is still possible as long as all the breaking changes since d3.js v3 are fixed by yourself

26639392
post	get
as sqlfiddle does have problems today i can t build any schema only get a xml error i post the script here

26639429
integer	unsigned
this is because you are adding an int with an unsigned integer strlen returns size_t which results in the unsigned integer type and is always going to be greater than or equal to zero

26639453
folder	directory
so i created a directory on v1 folder called entities

26639495
odoo	qweb
i m using odoo v8 qweb report

26639496
versioning	upgrade
the suggestion to upgrade to the newest versioning is actually what caused the problem in our case so i wouldn t necessarily expect that to fix the problem nor is it always possible to do that

26639556
int	double
if your input contains one odd number and one even number the average in the int version would be an int while the average in the double version would have a fraction

26639562
clang	icc
g++ 4.8 and 4.9 in c++11 mode accept this code and so do clang 3.3 and icc 13

26639630
aggregate-functions	sum
1 its an aggregate-functions max sum count etc

26639639
width	height
public void getpixels int pixels int offset int stride int x int y int width int height

26639639
width	height
or to get a specific rect with x y upper left corner and width height

26639647
width	height
each of the images have been resized to the same 700px width and 450px height

26639654
inherited	properties
additionally you could reuse this for any control object by casting sender to control instead given that button inherited from control and all control objects have the visible properties

26639672
splinter	selenium
in python you can use splinter built above the selenium raw webdriver with a nice and pythonic api although there are many more similiar options

26639683
for-loop	loops
the for-loop is makes a loops of 4 li s list items thats gonna be inserted from the info i have in the objects

26639754
temp	tmp
the alternative is to go to your env variables and set both tmp and temp to point to a writeable directory such as c

26639804
folder	directory
also for directory outside my htdocs folder i use additional directory options

26639817
travis-ci	drone.io
now there are plenty of popular cloud continuous integration services like drone.io or travis-ci

26639831
mocha	sinon
i m using mocha with sinon to test my angular app

26639874
filesystems	ntfs
under ntfs filesystems cygwin by default implements unix permissions on windows acls although you can t see them in the security tab

26639885
children	parent
because elasticsearch only directly supports one level of parent-child relationships and because children can only have one parent it seems to me that we need to denormalize the data and use nested objects to establish this relationship

26639893
bluetooth	usb
the project i am working on involves using multiple and sometimes single usb bluetooth adapters to obex-push files to phones

26639897
button	checkbox
i get a checkbox on both forms above the add new category update button

26639915

put	get
if i put email creditcard or url on the description and send it incorrect data i don t get the error

26639915
post	get
if i uncomment the range field and post again i get email and range errors not length

26639937
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in google-chrome opera and firefox it works without problems

26640005
button	checkbox
you can give inputs the same name radio button checkbox to have them interact with each other

26640005
post	put
so following james suggestion you would do a to which you can post using the easiest way to do this would be to put it into a form assign the form an id do a serialized post

26640012
post	get
its must get me all post from unit that is in the unit type that

26640012
post	get
but the query is get me all post

26640012
post	get
it must get me only all post from unit post type that in unit type post type

26640084
minimum	max
i still have the minimum version at 10 but the max version is now 21

26640088
width	height
timing refers to the fact that you cannot assume the image has finished loading by the time you are trying to access height and width

26640137
folder	directory
open the previous android sdk s folder and copy these folder add-ons build-tools docs extras platforms platform-tools samples sources and system-images then paste these folder in you new sdk s directory

26640160
public	protected
change visibility to password protected from public and set strong password

26640194
width	height
a square is-a rectangle in the sense that like a rectangle you can get its height and its width

26640194
width	height
it is different from a rectangle in that you can t set its height and width separately

26640197
post	get
i found this but i still can t figure out how to make it get the post from the custom fields

26640214
vim	sublimetext
i recently switched to sublimetext from vim and trying to configure sublimetext 3 in the way which i used to

26640216
implements	extends
each of these usually have an associated fragment implements in a separate source file as you mentioned which extends the settingspreferencefragment class

26640219
capitalization	uppercase
the original url specified doesn t care about capitalization so basically every time i send a request to it i randomly set each letter in a specific part of the url to either uppercase or lowercase

26640248
vbo	vao
however i had another error in the code which needed fixing before finally something was visible on the screen which i d like to share as well i unbound the vao before populating the vbo with the matrix data

26640319
express	node.js
i am using git bash on windows and have started a project using node.js and express and npm start fails at the json start script

26640347
min	median	min	max	median	max
i am trying to factorize a data frame where the cut-offs would be min median max of each variable column

26640372
mouse	keyboard
also note that the input can be modified in other ways than the keyboard with the mouse

26640373
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
on firefox it is working very well but safari google-chrome ie nothing

26640471
folder	directory
if i add that file into the same directory but in the child theme folder nothing happens

26640480
google-chrome	safari
and while i have been creating them and running them in eclipse just fine when i go to open the html page in safari or google-chrome on a mac the applet will not load

26640507
hide	show
as you can see i removed the jquery and used pure css to show hide as well as changed the display elements to visibility

26640507
hide	show
i basically added after the show hide call

26640520
post	get
there were a couple suggestions from other similar post but couldn t really get it to work for me

26640577
cdr	cons
if you mean a submenu then the answer is to do the same thing you did for the top-level menu use define-key to bind a key to a cons whose car is the submenu name and whose cdr is a menu keymap

26640586
treemap	treeset
you can be sure a treemap will use the same ordering as a treeset if only because a treeset uses a treemap with null values under the hood for its implementation anyway

26640588
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	safari
apparently this works in firefox opera safari google-chrome and even ie9

26640588
getter	setter
i d always used object.defineproperty odp for getter and setter but this seems to be a lot more supported than i thought

26640648
implements	extends
my oauthdataproviderimpl class extends abstractoauthdataprovider and implements oauthdataprovider and contains this method

26640695
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
at the css file i changed the proprieties of tags main and container margin padding width and height making the menus being separated and being moved to the top left and top right

26640704
int	boolean
it compares a boolean with int value

26640728
spaces	delimiter
an alternative that you could try is using regexp_replace to replace all of your desired delimiter with spaces or any single delimiter like this

26640754
pull	push
for example bootstrap follows a similar approach in their push and pull classes using left and right properties

26640775
pop-up	dialog
this however causes the browser to pop-up a modal login dialog when it receives the 401

26640789
typedef	typename	clang	icc
given this i checked your sample against icc 13 and clang 3.3 on godbolt icc correctly rejects this msvc-ism with while accepting the conformant typename template qualified version whereas clang interestingly enough accepts both the conformant and the nonconformant typedef

26640804
viewdidload	viewwillappear
now normally i would just re-initialize the button in a viewwillappear but the issue is that i need to use the mapview object that was initialized in the viewdidload

26640861
min	max
ok 0.0 errmsg movechunk failed to engage to-shard in the data transfer can t accept new chunks because there are still 1461 deletes from previous migration from rs0 to shard1 chunk min account_id minkey max account_id -9218254227106808901

26640864
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
have you tried modifying the navigationitem of your uiviewcontroller instead of the uitabbarcontroller

26640864
hide	show
that way the rightbarbuttonitem should only show up when that view controller is show and hide automatically when a new uiviewcontroller show its own navigationitem

26640872
pop-up	dialog
when the user clicks on a host i would like to pop-up a modal dialog with additional details about that host

26640886
uiview	subviews
you need to create an uiview as a subviews of the uiscrollview as described below

26640886
width	height
has ambiguous scrollable content width and has ambiguous scrollable content height

26640886
width	height
continue with the same constraints above and just add the constraints equal height and equal width to your container view in relation to the main view and not to your uiscrollview

26640913
ubuntu	linux
well that did only work once and randomly a second time - it seems like the ati radeon driver behave not quite deterministically - i also checked on a linux ubuntu 14.04.1

postgresql	mysql
my script reads data from all tables in a source mysql db writes them in a python stringio.stringio object and then loads that data from stringio object to postgresql database which apparently is in utf-8 encoding format

26641037
swift	objective-c
i figured out that subclassing uinavigationbar and providing a similar implementation to the swizzled solution solves this problem swift here but the same works in objective-c

26641039
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
i m using elastic beanstalk with amazon-web-services

folder	directory
the current directory must not be one of the folder that is to be removed

26641082
ready	each
now you are ready to compute the specular component created by each light using the dot product between r and v

26641095
put	get
as a general rule the semantics of the get put patch and delete methods should be easily generalized for everything and if you re adding to their semantics something already available through something else you re probably doing something wrong

26641139
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works in firefox 33 but not in safari 6.2 google-chrome 31.0 or the eclipse built-in browser osx 10.8.5

26641161
folder	directory
hi i want use wp_enqueue_style function to register style.css file from plugin wordpress folder not in directory folder

portrait	landscape
so your label can run offscreen if the label is based off of a landscape layout but the device is an iphone 5 and is in portrait for example

26641205
hbase	impala
i think you need to install impala on hbase cluster as well

26641309
mpfr	mpc
for some reason the mpc mpfr gmp packages aren t being downloaded

i m debating between using post and get for this endpoint

26641482
tablet	galaxy
the activity returns a null value for selectedimage when using the nexus tablet but returns a valid value for the samsung galaxy 4

26641509
int	chars
use an array of unsigned long int because that s bigger than any offset than ftell can return and make it uchar_max + 1 elements long because that s how many distinct chars are possible

26641515
folder	directory
for this i also had to move my audio folder which contains a sub folder for each instrument into the bin directory where my main .swf file is located

26641535
put	get	post	get	post	put
you can guess what a get put patch or delete does based on the http standard but you can t guess what a post does

26641537
mdpi	hdpi
i tried to set different margins and sizes for different dpis hdpi mdpi xhdpi xxhdpi

remember to hide this element on the ui because you don t want it to be show

26641652
google-chrome	firefox
actually it does look correct in ie but not in google-chrome and firefox

26641656
ng-show	ng-hide
the reason for that is that ng-show and ng-hide sets the display to none

26641685
post	get
i can correctly get the dbpedia url related to my query using a curl http post request

a while loops is imo more complicated to read than a for-loop

26641719
distance	polygons
from simple trig the center of the polygons will be a distance

26641719
distance	polygons
note that our y axis is reversed from the usual computer graphics coordinate system. the radius of the polygons the distance from the center to each vertex will be

26641719
distance	polygons
for n even the diameter d of the polygons the largest distance between points on the polygons is

26641719
distance	polygons
for n odd it s not too hard to see that the diameter is the distance from one vertex on the base to the vertex at the top of the polygons

i have set up my uisearchbar using uisearchcontroller ios8 standards and i m adding it programmatically to my uiviewcontroller above my uitableview believe that s the only way to do it for ios8 at the moment like so in my viewdidload unlike all other tutorials where they add it in their tableview header i wanted mine to stick when scrolling my uitableview

26641801
for-loop	loops
there s are errors in your for-loop and while loops

26641814
folder	directory
you must first create the folder node_modules otherwise npm install the module in the next-higher-level node_modules directory eg your home directory

26641814
folder	directory
just type mkdir node_modules in the console to create the folder in the current directory

26641814
folder	directory
update if a package.json file in the directory exists then npm creates the folder node_modules automatically

26641816
folder	directory
if your current working directory when you run npm install doesn t have a package.json file it ll go up the tree until it finds one to put the entry for gulp into then put the gulp folder in that folder s node_modules directory

26641817
scalikejdbc	hikaricp
i guess this is not an issue of scalikejdbc or hikaricp

26641829
yslow	pagespeed
horses for courses i reckon and although tools like yslow and pagespeed are indicitive of an issue the end result is often best left to the multitude of devices and format handlers to reconcile natively and it s a fair bet that some compression may already have been applied by the server anyway even if these tools report a problem

26641848
post	get
i m trying to call a web service for which i send xml data with a post and i get a response back

26641854

hash	md5
for right now i am doing just a md5 hash of the url and replacing all the logic that gradle-wrapper.jar did with the following script

26642086
yslow	pagespeed
when i run pagespeed yslow on it via gtmetrix it complains about me having too many resources and that i should combined the files

26642086
put	get
i can only guess at this point that once i put the combined file on a cdn that things will get even faster

26642105
getter	setter
and do the same with your getter and setter

26642145

sdl	freeglut	glut	sdl
so i ve been trying to understand sdl interface and attach my opengl and freeglut test program to it - cleaning it from glut references

26642182
getter	setter
additionally the proper getter and setter are in each entity so that is not the problem

26642186
sorting	filtering
but when you do some filtering or sorting or other refreshing only the table you are doing that with ajax

26642205
width	height
by forcing the border radius and overflow hidden on the img_wrap div and also increasing the width height of the container div by 1px the effect is not visible

26642209
hex	binary
i have searched for both objectguid and objectsid using the escaped hex codes of the binary values

26642263
folder	directory
i m trying to arrange things properly in my app so i created a folder called validators in my app models directory to keep my custom validation rules there

after getting and converting json to an array of javascript objects data is passed to the control that should display autocomplete typeahead

26642342

which is why i get the list of categories but i never got the post that belonged to each one

26642359
background-image	background-color
i have body with a background-image and a div with background-color as white

26642367
tablelayout	margins
but you could simply add a width to each button and a margins to replicate the tablelayout

26642414
swift	objective-c
project has both swift and objective-c shouldn t matter but anyway.

26642420
coalesce	isnull
isnull or coalesce can impact performance when you are combining sets such as with joins or when you are filtering data

26642426
put	get
i can see you override form_valid so if it runs - form already is valid and you can get cleaned data from it if you want perform some additional validation put following code before form.save

26642459
popover	tooltip
for performance reasons the tooltip and popover data-apis are opt-in meaning you must initialize them yourself

26642496

when i run the ios app and post a reservation using the afnetworking class to communicate with the server i get back a response object with an empty array

26642496

i wonder if anybody can help me get this post script right

26642498
implements	extends
angularjs does not provide any mechanism to implements inheritance of services directly however for your case you can use provide.decorator to extends baseservice itself or use it like a prototype of another childservice using plain javascript

26642537
cpu	processors
of course opencl is mostly useful only if you have a massively parallelizing processors available like a gpu or a cpu cluster

26642602
children	parent
you can inherit profiles from a parent to its children

26642653
flask	django
i ve thought building a separate django flask app but looks like a lot of work and i ll end up with an ugly app

26642678
dictionary	map
then map your nsset to a dictionary

26642754
client-side	server-side
ruby is server-side and can t view the result of what javascript does client-side so you can t do this without some help from javascript

26642765
folder	dir
then you should symlink bin stylus from this folder to some dir in your path variable for example usr local bin if you on linux or os x

26642785
box-sizing	border-box
you will also need to set box-sizing border-box on your underlying elements

26642819
post	put
to note when the upload form post public tmp gets two files the epub and the png and upon posting the new form the epub tmp goes away and gets put into public however the png stays in public tmp

26642840
width	height
as you notice that i have out the width and height on image to get it resized if you remove width and height then it works fine

26642851
versioning	upgrade
for pandas 0.15.0 but better upgrade to a newer versioning there are two possible workarounds

it s a slight difference with rulesrepository your customrulesrepository extends rulesrepository could directly implements batchextension and javafilesscanner

26642912

what i want to do is input two numbers which would be pushed into two arrays so we can subtract or add them and display the result

26642934
uitableview	uisearchbar
i have a uiviewcontroller with a uitableview and a uisearchbar inside

26642934
uitableview	uisearchbar
there s no gap when the uisearchbar is a subview of the uiviewcontroller view instead of being a subview of the uitableview

26642934
uitableview	uisearchbar
two first images correspond to the uisearchbar being a child of the uitableview where the gap is occurring

26642953
disk	ram
it does persist data to disk but it also keeps the entire dataset in memory so you need enough ram for it

26642953
disk	ram
similar to redis all the data for these tables is kept in ram but also stored to disk so it s fully durable

26642973
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
ultimately m_stream will be a fileinputstream or fileoutputstream or a socket stream and they already finalize themselves correctly

26643004
int	chars
you could use character.touppercase chars string.substring int and string.tolowercase and something like

26643080
uitableview	uisearchbar
it s a little bit difficult without seeing the code but perhaps try setting the uisearchbar as the uitableview s header view instead of adding it as a subview

26643124
implements	extends
public class viewp extends fragmentactivity implements

26643129
versioning	upgrade
you can also try to upgrade node and npm versioning 0.10.9 and 1.2.24 are quite old now and the character is not supported in that versioning

26643182
oncreate	onnewintent
you need to process your search intent on onnewintent besides oncreate

26643189
int	chars
i am trying to solve the problem by converting the string to chars and then the chars to an int

26643189
int	chars
my logical behind converting it to the chars is make it possible to format the numbers for the int

26643189
int	chars
i am still working on the rest of the program but i know that c i + c i+1 with return an ascii value or a different int rather than combining the two chars together example of what i want 3 + 4 34.

26643234
getter	setter
if you have a property declaration in a class the compiler will normally automatically generate a setter sethealtheffect and a getter healtheffect as well as an instance variable _healtheffect for you unless you create them yourself

26643266
uitableview	uisearchbar
when you are inserting a uisearchbar and uitableview into a uiview the pull-down ui is not inherited as it is unique to uitableviewcontroller so the hint of a pull-down space is not there

26643277
width	height
i m pretty sure the main problem is that there is no fixed height because i want the content to stretch to the browser size so each image is 100 width height auto

26643277
width	height
how do you vertically align a grid of images which have no fixed height or width - is it even possible

26643280
getter	setter
the other parts of the code are getter setter and printf s

26643281
keydown	numpad

26643626
getter	setter
how do i create a custom getter or setter in a struct

26643640
completionhandler	nsurlsession
so handleeventsforbackgroundurlsession should save the completionhandler and reinstantiate background nsurlsession

26643654
getter	setter
yes you need the xml annotations but they must be located in the getter you have defined on the setter that is wrong

26643666
int	double
the purpose of my program is to accept int double and strings from the user and when the program is terminated by inputing the word quit the program averages the int and double and outputs the submitted strings

26643666
int	double
the int and double get processed well but im stuck in the strings

26643706
min	max
from my understanding aggregate on elasticsearch used to get metric data e.g max min avg cnt

26643806
subtract	add
you can make a member function taking one explicit parameter and the implicit this but in the opinion of many people these binary operators such as add and subtract are better implemented outside the class in the same namespace as the class as free functions taking two explicit parameters

26643811
division	modulo
since taking every other would mean you take every second letter or every second pass through the loop and you use counter to track how many passes you ve made you can use modulo division to check when to take a letter

26643812
width	margin
almost everything is floating left but i will like the navigation menu floating right and the logo floating left both in the same centered div with margin auto when the max width of 1170px is reached

i get values in edittext then i put those values into progressbar

26644546
post	get
retrieval is standardized by the get method so using post to retrieve information that corresponds to a potential resource is never restful

26644546
post	get
however since you re performing a query for which there isn t a single resource you could perform a get to it seems fine to use post as long as you re aware of the disadvantages and your documentation is clear about it

26644546
post	get
a convention for doing what you want would be to use the post method with the payload you described above and the x-http-method-override get header

for-loop	loops
i came across a situation where i need to implement a for-loop with more than one loops control variable

26645307
getter	setter
getter and setter have at least two common uses the first one is to expose your c c++ code to a scripting language eg lua and the second is to provide for threadsafe atomic access to possibly non-atomic data types ie a place for you to provide your preferred threadsafe mechanic

26645485
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
the jquery xmlhttprequest jqxhr object returned by .ajax as of jquery 1.5 is a superset of the browser s native xmlhttprequest object

26645485
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
when the transport mechanism is something other than xmlhttprequest for example a script tag for a jsonp request the jqxhr object simulates native xmlhttprequest functionality where possible

26645505
multiplying	multiplication
since this is multiplication you need to reset the accumulator to 1 each time and then you need to multiplying it by each number in turn

26645528
folder	directory
i suggest you to view your page source info so you can check if your sources are really in the web folder or are pointing in another directory symfony stores all css and javascript files in the web folder and when you do php app console assetic dump symfony will dump all the web resources from the bundle to the web folder

26645575

another option for achieving better performance and scaling in the caching front is via use of both ram disk specifically the disk can be used to virtualize the memory in somewhat like a memory extender fashion to solve scale as memory is scarce

26645598

what i understand from your question is you want to set cell s width equal to table s width and cell s height equal to tableviewcell s height

26645599
postgresql	mysql

overriding can be possible when you extends a class or implements an interface

26645782
ready	each
since it wasn t the question i m going to ignore the fact that you should probably just store the paragraphs in a separate path so you can just fetch them ready to go rather than going through this extraneous step of parsing them each time they are read

26645783
super	extends
at first i just made a super class to contain the variables but i am forced to find something different because java only lets you extends once and i need to use the super class for different reasons

26645836
width	height
important onto the end of your css width and height like this

implements	extends
next step is to implements an interface with all the possible button actions which each one of them will receive as the only parameter an entry from listadapter suppose your adapter extends from arrayadapter each action method would receive a video object and your fragment needs to implements this interface and when you instantiate the adapter you need to pass the fragment instance you could use simply this or a member instance

26646214
width	height
so i set the width of the toggle button to be as the height of the data grid

26646214
width	height
right now the width of the toggle button will be the height as i have rotated the toggle button there by leaving a big gap between the two expanders when they are in collapsed mode

26646265
boost	allocator
the basic crux of the problem is that the boost allocator construct method is implemented in terms of the c++98 standard allocator spec and have a construct method that takes a single const param that is used to copy construct an object in a placement new

26646265
boost	allocator
boost needs to be updated to use the new c++11 allocator spec

26646282

26646652
versioning	upgrade

26646752
children	parent
specifically i have data that looks like this the first column is a parent code and the rest are children if that makes any sense

26646752
children	parent
so you can see that in the parent column abc-1 may map to two different children and one child ab 1 for instance may map back to two different parent abc-4 and abc-1

26646796
width	height
x y are the column and row co-ordinates of the upper left corner of the bounding box and w and h are the width and height of the bounding box

pop-up	dialog
let s say i want to be able to click on it and that would open some pop-up dialog etc. and the rest of the text would stay normal

26646857
min	max
however that response suggests that you need to store each and every max and min at each point in the stack

26646857
min	max
a better solution would be to have a separate stack for the max and the min

26646857
min	max
for the max stack you will push a new element onto the max stack only if the new element is greater than the current max and vice-versa for min

26646857
min	max
you will pop elements of the min and max stacks when the element that you are popping of the main stack is equal to them and not equal to the next element in the main stack

26647182
std	ostream
country.h 24 10 note std ostream operator std ostream country

i would recommend you to use int in your loop and perform all calculations of double s inside the loop to prevent problems with floating point arithmetic

26647211
filtering	grouping
this hack would help to filtering values and get the grouping values

26647245
put	get
i get very cross when other sites do this. while many users know that they shouldn t use the same password on multiple sites they often still do - so if that email is intercepted you haven t just put their account on your site at risk but potentially other sites too

26647805
pclzip	phpexcel
however when we first bundled pclzip originally in phpexcel 1.7.6 it was only an option when writing zip-based formats not when reading them

26647805

in c++ the default size for array indices is size_t which is a 64 bits unsigned 64-bits integer on most x86-64 platforms

26650863
integer	unsigned
the advantages or using a signed integer over an unsigned one are numerous such as

26650863
integer	unsigned
works like it is supposer to with an unsigned integer this loop goes crazy when v is of size 0

26650863
integer	unsigned
can be reduced to a b with signed integer overflow is undefined and not in the case of unsigned integers

swift	objective-c
it adds two annotations one written in objective-c and the other written in swift and then logs self.map.annotations

the way this works is nested for-loop that grabs both pieces separate into variables you could do that with read and put them in on one loops if you want and then just counts the occurences in the second file with grep and whenever there is a count of zero it will reverse the value making the test turn true and echo the missing packages to the file missing_pkgs.txt

because the compiler sees you adding 2 chars together to the compiler chars and int primitive data types are considered to interchangeable and so the + is actually adding the 2 int values together

26666674
int	chars
chars is an unsigned integral type so chars are added together in the same way as all int - numerically

26666674
int	chars
when an addition happens you end up with an int not a chars so calling println on it produces a numeric result

i believe the reason for that is that you have declared temporalcell outside your for-loop and you keep changing it s value everytime in loops which also changes the value of the previous reference objects in the arrays

26671584

canvas width height attribute determines the actual pixel will be used to draw on canvas

26671584
width	height
on the other hand css width height is related to box model

26671584
width	height
by default the canvas usage 300px width and 150px height

26671584
width	height
if you set css width height without setting canvas attributes that will be applied on that 300px 150px

width	height
setting the height and width of the canvas through css will only set them to the html element canvas but not to the inner drawing surface this is generally bad practise when it comes to canvas elements

26671729
width	height
now usually with this approach when the element width and height is more than the default width and height of the drawing surface what the browser does is it scales up the drawing surface to find the canvas element size

26671729
width	height
setting the height and width of the canvas through the element width and height attributes set them to both the canvas and the drawing surface

width	height
just like brown s answer the height adapts to the text as required however the width is fixed which is somehow solved by the image being partially covered

26673382
width	height
a solution that would adapt both the width and the height would quite definitely require javascript as it is sort of circular dependency by changing the width the height of the blockquote changes thus the width of the height of the image changes thus the width changes which can be resolved but not in html css

26680055
youtube	vimeo
there is no actually way of completely stopping someone you could however as some have mentioned use something like vimeo or youtube to minimize the downloading of your videos or another way you could do it and have found from personal experience is either creating a login register on your site to make someone signup to get your video thus minimizing how many can download it or you can encrypt the video with a password i believe vimeo has this option which requires someone to enter a password in before even viewing the video

26680555
width	height
display the width and height variables not set yet

26680555

send an authorization token or something in a post so you can get an authorization cookie before using the rest api

26680758
min	max
if you added a.naam to the group by you may not get the desired results if you said max or min you may get what you want but the database can t figure out what to do in this case as not enough instruction has been provided to the database engine to provide consistent results

26680758
min	max
use min or max to return just the highest or lowest a.naam

button	checkbox
here is a basic example that uses checkbox controls with appearance set to button for the headers

26681212
ord	chr
once again this will be stored as a string full of ascii characters by default -- you ll have to use chr and ord to convert back and forth between byte value and ascii letters

26681235
width	height
essentially the method loads a new and hidden image into the body and then captures the width and height before removing it

26681241
for-loop	arrays
in fact your algorithm also has another bug which i found while writing this answer since java arrays indices start from zero the termination condition for your for-loop should be not

26681292
disk	ram
if you are using a computer with too little ram then yes...you ll run into performance issues as windows uses the disk to make up for the lack of ram

26681294

equals	charat
you re comparing a char which charat returns to a string which they are not equals

26681390
getter	setter
i tried hiding the internal _list and wrapping it with a public getter setter i thought if during deserialization it used the public setter to set the internal _list i could attach to the item events there but that does not work either

26681407
submit	submission
that way you can prevent the default submission disable the button then submit the form programatically

26681439
fseek	fread
these stream features were designed to look and feel as if they were native unix-like file descriptors where one can fopen fwrite fread fseek etc as if a normal file but with custom handlers that could for example open a database connection on fopen perform a sql select on fread an sql insert on fwrite etc creating a high-level database api which behaves like a normal file

26681458
post	get
already tried solution outlined in this post and i d still wind up doing some regex parsing but could only get it to work via script execution engine

26681467

26681498
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
we want to be able to use it to enter a file name into an openfiledialog or savefiledialog

26681498
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
this still doesn t prevent the keyboard from being unable to be used while an openfiledialog or savefiledialog is in their showdialog method

26681517
filtering	grouping
sql can where statement filtering out specific grouping for grouping by statement

26681535
public	protected	inherited	properties
now you can inherited this class in your hero thus having all of it s public and protected properties and methods available as local scope

26681546
folder	directory
if script in seperate js file which is in scripts folder then you have to come back one directory and have to write url .. default.aspx passthings

26681551
width	height
ultimately i went ahead and found mshtml had the tools to obtain the width height

26681587
inherited	properties
the things i ve considered are making the books dvds etc inherited from a common base class but don t think that will work because if i pass the baseclass to the method when it tries to use reflection to match the properties they will be the properties of the baseclass not the derived class

26681594
width	height
when you call drawprimitives specify vertexcount width height

26681594
width	height
vid will go from 0 to width height

26681599
post	get
first of all i would use post instead of get for a delete

26681600
min	max	aggregate-functions	sum
this means your select list can only contains columns that are grouped by or aggregate-functions count sum min max etc.

26681608
google-chrome	firefox
the reason this works is in google-chrome returns 0 but not in other browsers such as firefox

26681661
pull	push
just setup a new installation pull the repository and then just push to the new

26681687
post	get
and if you want to use post instead of the get method to pass some values to the webserver you can try this

26681770
pull	push
everything works perfectly except for push pull operations where there is a credential helper issue

26681773
folder	dir
does a get-childitem on the destination folder now using dir s b as it s way faster than gci

26681776

i have been testing in firefox 32 palemoon 25 firefox clone google-chrome 38 ie 10

26681788
hide	show
there is direct api support to hide and show the inputpane

26681795
picasso	universal-image-loader	listview	gridview
for performance you may want to combine the picasso universal-image-loader library with pulltorefresh library especially when your listview gridview want to load a lot of images

26681826
getter	setter
when you declare a property the compiler will automatically synthesize the variable prefixed with an underscore a getter method and a setter method

26681826
getter	setter
nonatomic means the variable is not guaranteed to always be a valid value in a multithreaded environment for example if the getter is called at the same time as the setter

26681826
getter	setter
additionally the compiler will treat dot syntax used to retrieve set instance variables as calls to the appropriate getter setter methods

26681826
accessor	properties
instead declaring them as properties automatically creates a private variable and accessor methods making adhering to oop best practices a little easier

26681826
getter	setter
if you declare your variables privately in the implementation part of your .m file the compiler won t be able to help you by synthesizing the getter and setter

26681826
getter	setter
even as private methods getter and setter can help reduce complexity in your code for example checking for the validity of variable values

26681826
inherited	subclassing	getter	setter
this way even when you subclassing myclass the subclassing will inherited the getter and setter methods that were synthesized for us by the compiler

26681844
width	height
in order to make scrolling easier you can add a frame 1 5th of the width height to keep some additional data available while preparing a new bitmap in the background

26681873
shadowing	named
decltype shadowed named must be used in the shadowing scope before the declaration of shadowing named

26681907
post	get
this code is assuming you are using the post method rather than the get method when your form was submitted

26681910
put	get
if you use former registerstartupscript it will put all script to end of tag which mean all input dom elements will be added by that time and will be accessible you won t get such errors which you had received till now

26681911
innodb	myisam
there are ways to influence statistics with both myisam and innodb

26681914

for a variety of reasons i do not want to upgrade the project to v4 and the versioning of system.management.automation.dll remains the same as before 6.1.7601.17514 dated 11 20 2010

26681967
accessor	properties
runtime liveness analysis for variables which are actually properties guarded by get set accessor can be translated to problem of measuring the code coverage of the set accessor

26681972
post	get
and if you want to use post instead of the get method to pass some values to the webserver you can try this

26682003
min	max
first insert a column between min and max salary in the bands table and use a formula to compute the span between max and min as shown below

26682058
factors	matrix

the steps 2 to 4 are duplicated for the residuals f extracts a second factors r reproduces a new matrix etc

26682155
min	max
the min and max values are defined in unity inspector

26682163

check to make sure that only one cron daemon is running by issuing this command from root

26682265
int	chars
code throws java.sql.sqldataexception invalid chars string format for type int each time i run i don t seem to know what the problem is

26682326
for-loop	arrays
if you want to use your single arrays sorting algorithm bubble sort to sort the two dimensional arrays then you have to add the another for-loop an outer for-loop which will take care of each row

26682340
scatter	graphing
i am currently making xy scatter plot and i have code for setting the properties of my line graphing

26682358

inherited	properties
you could create an attached behavior that you can affix to some scope element your usercontrol that will maintain an attached read-only properties that gets inherited down the tree

26682509
dlsym	dlopen
despite adding what i think are the correct flags based on other posts i m still getting undefined reference to errors for dlopen dlsym and a few other functions defined in dlfcn.h error message and make-file are included below

post	put
i have a flexslider post slider and in the end of the slides i want to put the a background image like the configuration that i have in the menu

26682531
udp	tcp
but you will have to implement crc generation mandatory for tcp optional for udp and the routing -- correct interface by yourself

26682570
int	boolean
the file consists of a thousands of lines each 2957 bytes long 1 byte boolean followed by 739 4 byte int

26682581
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome will at least make the request and throw an error if the resource api is not sending necessary headers

26682581

as you know division is really just a shortcut form of subtraction and a remainder is the part of the number that is left over when you divide

26682692
pop-up	dialog
when i try to checkout a repo the pop-up dialog doesn t have 1.8 selected i can only choose 1.7

26682776
mouseup	mousedown
one way you could do this would be to bind to the mousedown and mouseup events

26682776
mouseup	mousedown
use something like a stopwatch that gets started on mousedown and check the amount of time that s elapsed on mouseup

26682829
post	get
this works fine so i didn t feel a need to post it here it s a bit long because there are some special columns that need extra work to get set up

26682866
min	max
we could count them or get the min max values although in your case you want to use sum which predictably just adds all the values for column moneys during the collapse and then yields that number as a new column called amount

26682866
versioning	upgrade
only out-of-date versioning of php do so if you upgrade this code will immediately be broken

26682866
postgresql	mysql
have a look at the mysqli functions instead which are the new secure supported mysql connector or use pdo but that s usually silly unless you know your script s going to interface with multiple database formats like talking to mysql postgresql and sqlite files

26682871
std	ostream

serializable	deserialization
by default json.net will effectively clone these during serializable deserialization

26683015
viewdidload	didreceivememorywarning
your viewdidload method is not properly closed so what happens is that the class and didreceivememorywarning are defined as local to viewdidload

26683029
viewdidload	didreceivememorywarning
as written class counter and func didreceivememorywarning are inside viewdidload

26683030
exif	jfif
the structure of jfif and and exif stream differs only in the format of the appn markers that define the formats

26683030
exif	jfif
in other words a jpeg decoder only really needs to know that it encountered a jfif app0 marker or exif app1 marker to decode the image and does not need to read the data within those marker

26683030
exif	jfif
the greater complexity of exif over jfif occurs only in the appn markers

26683039
width	height
i am looking for a way to find 1 a file with the smallest width and with 2 the smallest height and show these numbers preferably command line either linux or windows

26683042
put	get
the source code for these tags have dashes and spaces so it s hard to get the exact string to put into the quotes when asking vba to get elements

26683060
prop	each
instead of looping with each method and setting you can use jquery s prop method to do the same but more concise

26683078
union	distinct
not sure how to do it if you just want a union since distinct is actually not supported in bigquery

26683080

26683162
execvp	fork
my problem is if execvp returns -1 for instance if the executable isn t found i can t communicate with the parent proccess since i m inside the child process in the fork

26683263
post	get
personally i would suggest especially for beginners not using the and methods but sticking with the fullblown and learning understanding how to use it for both get and post

26683275
textblock	repeatbutton
it appears that repeatbutton is not a solution here as it only reacts to itself being held and not released - and i need to know when it is released so that i can run a proper method to return textblock to its original state

26683287
hide	show
then you would just make the tables with these functions and show the table afterwards and hide when needed

26683295
swift	objective-c

26683322
sorting	filtering
an update of the grid was transmitted and reflected on all clients running the application perfectly with client side filtering sorting paging

26683322
sorting	filtering
the datasource i was using was rather large which caused some performance issues with the filtering sorting paging operations

26683322
sorting	filtering
so i then re-configured my grid to use server filtering sorting paging which did fixed my performance issue and drastically improved the usability of the application

26683322
sorting	filtering	client-side	server-side
i then switched back and forth between client-side and server-side filtering sorting and paging to verify that that change was the cause of my issue to be sure

26683353
uialertview	uialertcontroller
i accidentally shipped a product that s using the new ios 8 uialertcontroller api instead of uialertview while targeting 7.1 users

26683404
folder	directory
making apache s home directory the root folder of your machine doesn t sound wise if it s public facing

26683416
put	get
so store the integer you get from the put method into an arraylist or set and iterate through that

26683417
folder	directory
each folder directly in the documents directory is flagged so i guess the files inside them are not even on a real device

26683428
hide	show
when people click next after answering each question i want it to find the question that is visible hide it and then show the next question

26683428

addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition
single precision division square root and mathematical functions are calculated faster than double precision when the xmm registers are used while the speed of addition subtraction multiplication etc

26683642
stdout	stderr
it appears that console interpreter prompts go to stderr not stdout

26683648
min	max
once you guess a value that is incorrect you move either min or max

26683648
min	max	range	min	range	max
now you you always have the correct range for valid guesses between min and max

26683653
hide	show
you can show or hide the navigation controller s toolbar as needed by setting its toolbarhidden property

26683656
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
depending on the hardware the actual cpu or fpu if you like performance of double is somewhere between half the speed and same speed on modern cpu s for example add or subtract is probably same speed multiplying or divide may be different for larger type when compared to float

26683656
int	chars
and yes there are several architectures where only one size int exists - or only two sizes such as 8-bit chars and 32-bit int and 16-bit short would be simulated by performing the 32-bit math and then dropping the top part of the value

26683673
post	put
if you re willing to use the parent theme you can put the code that registers the custom post type in a plugin of your own

26697025
width	height
as this will include borders and padding so you dont have to manually add width or height for padding and borders as it is then included in the box model

26697034
serializable	deserialization
in this case it seems to me that developing and testing serializable deserialization in combination is the way to go

26697034
serializable	deserialization
if there are no external libraries available then - as long as serializable deserialization - yield the same result you will probably not have bugs but features .

26697034
serializable	deserialization
testing the deserialization with stored external datafiles does also make sense but this does not apply to the serializable imho

26697060
tablet	galaxy
using my smart phone the menu icon is there using lg phone but when i test it on my tablet galaxy tab 8 the menu icon is gone but the functionality is still there

26697076
post	get
this post by chris banes should get you started

26697096
setinterval	settimeout
i think you may need setinterval instead of recursive settimeout in your problem

26697096
setinterval	clearinterval
as you can see it is very important to reset the i variable the timercount in your example as well as doing clearinterval on previously declared setinterval

26697110
spaces	delimiter
if you re reading the text from a file and you can reasonably assume that the spaces character will be your only delimiter you should use the string.split method to tokenize each line

26697110
strsplit	substr
strsplit allows you to separate any string into a string of substr based on the char delimiters you provide in the first argument

26697141

26697397
min	max
i created variables for the threshold and for min max at the start of the function

26697412
terminate	timeout
so you have to make sure that the pool is removed when a session terminate either by logout or timeout

26697414
portrait	landscape
if you are using auto layout you can set different height constraints in portrait and landscape for example add a 32 height constraint for the toolbar in wcompact|hcompact mode you will be able to see a 32 height toolbar in landscape mode here is an toolbar test example

26697464
tcpclient	networkstream
there are other network apis that support async await tcpclient networkstream but if you want to use the socket class directly you re stuck with the old async models socket has two both callback-based

26697503
decltype	auto
siek decltype and auto

26697503
decltype	auto
so it s incorrect to say that decltype completely obviated typeof if you want reference dropping semantics then the typeof extension in those compilers still has use but rather typeof was largely obviated by it plus auto which does drop references and replaces uses where typeof was used for variable inference

26697518
qcombobox	qtreeview
i m trying to create a qtreeview that should hold a qcombobox on each row in a certain column so that i can choose the data for a cell from a list of strings

i will get name nil unless call reload on the post object

26698141
submit	submission
the attached form submit handler catches this event and prevent the form from submission

26698164
stdout	stderr
i also don t see where in the code i call entry points which might terminate r or write to stdout stderr but then if i remove the calls to rand srand this message disappears

26698167
inherited	properties
you can use inherited context and still bind to usercontrol properties by using either relativesource or elementname bindings

26698203
google-chrome	firefox
even if you open the image directly in browsers such as google-chrome or firefox you will see the image with the right orientation but if you load the image using the html img tag it will show the exif orientation

26698214

the question is missing many details but given you are going from postgres into elasticsearch you can use the jdbc river to either push or pull data along with incremental changes into es

26698265
folder	directory
deleting the .androidstudiobeta folder in my home directory and reinstalling android studio 0.8.9 resolved my issues

a simple hack in this case is to open firebug in a different window top right corner of the firebug bar than move your mouse at the desired location and drag and drop something from there out of the browser window

26698420
google-chrome	firefox
but in case of google-chrome and mozilla firefox you can get the path by

26698474
min	max
this means for it will check min max and step

26698474
min	max
so if you want to enter floating point numbers you have to make sure min max and step are correct

26698474
min	max
as you can leave min and max open you at least have to specify step

26698535
goto	break
the upside - no destructors will be duplicated the downside - it will involve non-sequential execution and jumping around and also extra hidden variables and conditionals which will be needed for example to determine whether execution leaves a block to continue execution in the parent block or to break continue goto return which also increases its complexity

26698550
implements	extends
i would recommend that you extends the class instead of implements the interface as does microsoft see first reference below

26698550
comparator	icomparer
we recommend that you derive from the class instead of implementing the icomparer interface because the class provides an explicit interface implementation of the icomparer.compare method and the default property that gets the default comparator for the object

26698578
versioning	upgrade
some free applications can often be upgrade to paid premium versioning

26698582
comparator	icomparer
we recommend that you derive from the comparator class instead of implementing the icomparer interface because the comparator class provides an explicit interface implementation of the icomparer.compare method and the default property that gets the default comparator for the object

26698624
capitalize	capitalization
also you should capitalize class names so you can recognize from the capitalization whether we are referring to an instance or class definition

26698646
put	get
i suppose if i put array as the first parameter for str_replace i would get correct output but i may not always know how many elements there will be in the array so i m looking for a function that only needs the replace sequence once and replaces each occurrence with each subsequent array element

26698658

hence everytime you add a button with table.add button add the information about its height and width with table.add button height ... .width ...

26698710
width	height
i used fixed positions based on top bottom right left height and width -values

26698731
clang	llvm
for gcc it is a free software compiler - and so is clang llvm - so you could study its source code you probably could try to compile some simple c++ test case code with -fdump-tree-all and then see that it is done at gimplification time

26698739

a circular buffer is useful for a fifo fifo scenario and therefore a good implementation strategy for a queue with a fixed maximum size

26699602
profiling	instrumentation
instead it provides an ado.net profiling capable of profiling calls on raw ado.net sqlserver oracle etc linq-to-sql ef including code first lightspeed and a range of other data access scenarios and a pragmatic step instrumentation that can be added to the particular piece of code which is explicitly required to be profiled

26699631
typedef	struct
i just found typedef struct pcap pcap_t

26699638

i ve been tweaking with the class and image width and height but i haven t managed to find a way to define specific width and height for each thumbnails

26699656
getter	setter
as a shortcut to declare ruby class setter getter for an instance variable called name quick and easy way of writing

26699656
getter	setter
name is how we tell ruby we need setter getter or both for an instance variable called name

26699679
hex	binary
instead you should write a separate function that takes four characters representing a binary number and produces a single hex character

26699685
width	height
in this case you are telling it to scale the area of room 101 so that it fits in a 1200x250 image the width and height

26699694

move	drag
draggable is setup for element of type x y what i want to do is when the drag direction is up kill the type x y draggable and switch to a type rotation draggable so that the card move around on an axis

26699707
int	chars
if the arguments can be 10 or greater you must use atoi or a self-implementation of that function as you can not cast from chars to int in c

26699708
puts	putchar
obviously you ll have to check for calls to putchar and puts too.

26699714
google-chrome	firefox
the image below is a combination of three screenshots of the same page paragraph the first from google-chrome the second from ie and the third from firefox

get the first chars and convert it to an int

26699862
google-chrome	firefox
this is happening in firefox and google-chrome

26699898
int	double
my approach would be to declare 2 required methods in that protocol todouble and fromdouble and implement both in float double and int extensions

26699968
width	height
those values are mapped between 0 and 1 which means that you have to mutiply them by your real image width and height

26699968
width	height
i assume that it s the same way 640 pixels width are mapped to 64 pixels width and 240 pixels height are mapped to 64 pixels height

26699983
google-chrome	firefox
the reason lines don t work as you d expect out of the box is due to how angle works it s used in google-chrome and in firefox to my knowledge it emulates opengl via directx

26700413
gruntjs	uncss
found the library called uncss it runs with gruntjs

26700413
gruntjs	uncss

ienumerable	iqueryable
note this is not using ienumerable or iqueryable

26700655
width	height
uiscrollview have dynamic constraints left top width and height are generated at runtime

26700669
free	strdup
also you never free the strings produced by strdup so all of them leak memory

26700707
width	height
self.canvas canvas window bg white height 20 width 20

26700748
for-loop	arrays
the actual script uses a series of arrays with lpadmin in a for-loop

26700751
libstdc++	libc++
also the same code runs fine with clang using a bundled version of libstdc++ since i haven t installed libc++ on the vm

26700756
next	document.write
in other words the first time document.write is called on page1 page1 is overwritten as intended but the next time it s called the new content is appended to page1

26700773
pull	push
the key thing you seem to have missed is that the main difference comes from the fact that your application shall build on zeromq-archetypes behaviour which is presented using use-case metaphoric names push pull but understanding of which is very important for any good design

26700774
sorting	filtering
the bookmangeractor should reply to messages like filtering books of date or sort books by date and name the sorting and filtering could take some time and the filtering can be composed

26700804
google-chrome	firefox
i checked the problem on both firefox 33 and google-chrome 38 and after i removed the position absolute from the js as you mentionned you wanted the element to flow with everything it just works well

26700804
mouseover	mousehover
you said you were using the mousehover event but this doesn t exist so you probably meant the mouseover jquery event

26700804
google-chrome	firefox
i also created a jsfiddle demo so you can check that the above works in firefox as well as in google-chrome

26700806
min	max
you can use min and max as scalar functions

26700816
mouseleave	mouseenter
i have an svg line that activates on the hover of a parent div in css but i cant get the animation to reverse on leaving the div so i m trying to use jquery with mouseenter mouseleave

26700856
folder	directory
it appeared in a folder with the name app in my home directory with subdirectories

26700930
folder	directory
to proceed you should open up a file explorer or finder window go to the android studio installation applications android studio.app and move the sdk folder over to a different location such as your home directory

26700930
folder	directory
the reason this is necessary is two-fold first we have made a lot of improvements to make the patch updater more accurate and in order for installation signatures to match you cannot have non-application folder inside the application directory

26700930
folder	directory
second placing the sdk folder inside the application directory was probably not a good idea to begin with this folder should typically be writable and in a directory with a lot of extra diskspace such that users can easily download and install additional libraries system images and so on

with good use of indexes you should be able to calculate min or max very quickly

26704577
min	max
all this is aimed at the best possible use of indexes during calculation of min or max

26704577
min	max
this is as i believe most optimal way how to get min or max from historical data table

26704577
min	max
the point is that using min with a lot of non indexed values makes server load all the data into the memory and then calculate min or max from the non-indexed data which takes long time because it has high demands on i o operations

26704577
min	max
bad usage of indexes when using min or max can lead to the situation where you have all your historical table data cached in memory without needing it for anything else except min or max calculation

26707016
filtering	grouping
in the simplest form where you only allowed one selection per filtering grouping then you could get away with coming out to this with the operator

26707016
filtering	grouping
the basics of constructing the query is working with an array of selection options for in each filtering grouping

26707016
filtering	grouping
of course then you only append to the array when there is a selection present in your filtering grouping

26707016
filtering	grouping
and then add in each of the checked options in each filtering grouping to its own in

26708586
post	get
the usual approach is to use get or post variables when you need to transfer data between different sessions

26708586
post	get
if the array is big enough not to fit as a get parameter then you will have to use post method

26708611
int	chars
even if your chars array had at least sizeof int bytes in it the compiler might still ignore or worse

26708638
post	get
i am not sure what the issue you are facing but as others mentioned it look like a cors issue.i wrote a post on cors here which explains about cors and shows ajax example too.a cors get request through ajax would look like this

octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
beyond types one could argue that maybe perhaps bit-distribution is slightly more apparent in hex octal or ultimately binary representations

26709302
getter	setter
if you will not get value please check setter and getter of the variable

26709314

one approach i have in mind is to run empty for-loop but unable to determine loops index required to achieve exact delay

26709373
superclass	subclassing
if you had init_time field in your subclassing instead of superclass you would get output -

26709373
superclass	subclassing
to summarize this means superclass gets intialized even if class initialization is triggered due to access of static field but subclassing is not initialized

26709377

you can prevent keypress from firing multiple time when the key is hold by the user a long time by setting a boolean to true in keydown and then set it to false on keyup but the good point about keyup and keydown is that they fire just once no matter how long the user hold the key pressed and you can avoid rrrrrrrrrrr

width	height
well someone correct me if i m wrong but i think it s because the size_hint property of the boxlayout and the image both default to 1 1 which translates to take up as much space in your parent as you can or 100 width 100 height

26713794
children	parent
though it may not be possible for a child to take up all of it s parent area if there are also other children in the parent like if you had a few image s in the boxlayout or more than one boxlayout in your app etc

26720331
for-loop	loops
i feel the only difference would be that a for-loop executes from 1 to 100 say in sequence but for a loops like below the order of threads cannot be predicted

26720399
division	multiplication
if the offsets were not remembered from segment to segment then they would have to be recomputed every time using at least one division and one multiplication per re-computed index plus conditionals or serious bit trickery

i d recommend bundler for versioning gems although both rvm and rbenv also have this functionality

26720520
pop-up	dialog
the authorization dialog does not pop-up in extensions

26720521

26720728
min	max
if you need a min or a max based on those variables you could create another column and use rolling_min or rolling type formulas

int	chars
you will probably want to make your array of type chars instead of int

26720859
portrait	landscape
the entire application will allow both portrait and landscape orientations but the first three view controllers will be portrait only

implements	extends
if i use this code implements v7 appcompat and extends to actionbaractivity my app crash on start

26721604
for-loop	loops
just fyi this is sort of an exercise of why using a for-loop might be better than using a for each loops as you have done

26721618
width	height
note that width or height depending on orientation needs to be defined for this method to have any effect

26721644
versioning	upgrade
a recommended alternative to the above scenario would be to upgrade your sqlcipher library to the latest 3.x versioning and perform a single time database format upgrade via another pragma

26721731

mongodb	bson
in your case a 2d coordinate value is best mapped as a collection type in odm which will ensure it is stored as a bson array in mongodb

26721977
mongodb	bson
ultimately it would also be nice for odm to support geojson as a mapped field type to convert mongodb bson objects to from geojson classes

26722003
post	get
never asume anything a user can change is safe like get and post

26722010

26722386
spaces	linefeed
in the solution examples above this is only spaces but not tab cr linefeed and all the other unicode-defined whitespace chars

getter	setter
however for a proper encapsulation i would rather design the employee class to provide proper behaviors instead of simply acting as a value object which only provides bunch of getter setter

hash	salt
the point of a salt is to ensure that if you and i have the same password we don t have the same hash password assuming we each have our own salt value

26742452
hash	salt
if you run encodepassword with a null salt value using bcrypt you ll get a different hash string for each run

26742452
hash	salt
the ispasswordvalid method implementation with simpler algorithms usually hash the cleartext password with the provided salt if there is one and checks that this value is the same as the stored hash

26742456
getter	setter
tried using getter setter but at that point it will return undefined

uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
the framework seems to call these methods under certain circumstances like when you set the rootviewcontroller property of uiwindow but not others like when you call addchildviewcontroller in uiviewcontroller

width	height
a media query consists of a media type and at least one expression that limits the style sheets scope by using media features such as width height and color

26742573
portrait	landscape	switching	screens
also be aware that most mobile browsers are designed to switching between landscape and portrait display on the fly -- but this isn t much of a problem since there is also a media-query that can be used to determine screens orientation

26742598
spaces	delimiter
the -match operation removes those lines that don t start with an sha1 hash and the -replace operation collapses adjacent spaces into a single delimiter so that convertfrom-csv won t create empty fields when there is more than 1 spaces in a row

operands	decrement
the increment or decrement operation occurs after the operands is evaluated

26742767
width	height
in addition you have to give it to the content view an explicit not related to the scroll view height and width because these are used by the scrollview to calculate its content size

26742767
width	height
in your case set the width equal to the vc main view width and the height to 1500

26742767
width	height
when width or height are bigger than the scrollview size it will scroll

26742767
width	height
content view pinned to scrollview + height 1500 width mainview width + label constraints as an example 20 20 from content view top left

26742777

26743309
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	safari
i maybe wrong here the latest qtp version maybe supporting this and if so i will appreciate if you can share your experience our target apps would mostly be web application and target web platforms would be ie google-chrome firefox safari opera

we are using sun oracle jdk7 on tomcat and the corresponding ibm jdk7 on websphere 8.5.5.3

listview	gridview
instead of declaring the type applied style as a listview resource it is much better to apply the style directly to the gridview

26743487

i have the total and average working but i am getting 2147483647 for the max and -2147483648 for the minimum

26743629
min	max
and you want to keep the number as the max and min not the total

26743632
min	max
additionally you need to replace tot with num if you want to get the min and max of inputs

26743643
post	get
i ve done much trial and error by changing get to post in both the javascript and java codes

26743665

let s say you ve prevented the form from submission and you ve determined that the data is good enough and it s time to submit the form

26743716
submit	submission
you could use either ajax or default form submission to submit the form

26743758
min	max
if you are given an array that you can guarantee has been heapified and not altered since then accessing the first element will give you the min respectively the max for a max-heap

26743796
put	get
once the value get long enough to be hard to read pprint will automatically put them in seperate lines

26743826
next	except
method #1 has a simple for-loop and should print out all of the numbers between the lowest number and the highest number that are multiples of 3 or 5 and method #2 does the same except for numbers that are multiples of 3 or 5 it also checks if that number is also a multiple of 6 and if so it prints the number and an asterisk next to it

26743959
int	chars
the getchar function returns an int value not a chars

26743959

i need a script to backup the contents of a directory including sub folder to a single archive file

26744422

also from the comment below this answer i understand that you need to keep reference of the parent at children

26744422
children	parent
edit parent are going to set to children by defineparent method recursively

26744425
post	get
the parameter is not needed for other types of requests except in ie8 when a post is made to a url that has already been requested by a get

26744428
google-chrome	firefox
update in response to op s comment i would say that if you have tested the code in both firefox and google-chrome and it works in one but not the other do the following

26744428
google-chrome	firefox
in my experience if a web page behaves different in google-chrome and firefox it tends to be because there is something wrong with the page

26744434
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome and firefox there is a network tab that will allow you to see what get requests the browser is making to load your site

26744480
google-chrome	firefox
i have recently implemented this for a client and found that omnibug for firefox or google-chrome and google real-time reports were the best combination for testing once we d set everything up

26744524
put	get
first i get names as inputs then change them to integer then i need to sum them and put them in equation which this sum doesn t work

26744594
versioning	upgrade
is that an inherent part of adding a bundle that exports a new incremented versioning or must something be done manually to tell osgi to look for upgrade

26744600
matlab	simulink
for simple operations on data that is not time-dependent parameters you are better off using matlab than simulink

26744616
squash	branch
i find a more generic solution is not to specify n commits but rather the branch commit-id you want to squash on top of

26744616
squash	branch
in my workflow i start a branch and my first commit on that branch summarizes the goal it s usually what i will push as the final message for the feature to the public repository. so when i m done all i want to do is git squash master back to the first message and then i m ready to push

26744630
folder	directory
found the solution ignore files in the current directory exclusively and don t ignore the folder whose contents i wish to track at all rather than not ignoring the contents of those folder

26744648
children	parent
but have stuck with a problem that parent flex container does not wrap around its children if they are wrapped to the next column

26744665
typedef	typename
don t forget to add the typename keyword if you use the using typedef members of mytraits in a dependent context

26744704
getdate	dateadd
you can use dateadd day datediff day 0 getdate 0 in sql server however to get just the date back

26744740
fadein	fadeout
my jquery level is amateur and now i try hard to solve this problem with slideshow i know how to make fadeout or fadein working with variables but i cant animate from left to right or from right to left 2 different layouts with next properties

26744744
serializable	deserialization
either you have to write serializable and deserialization functions for each such type or you have to give up the byte array requirement and use something like boost any to maintain type information and properly call constructors and destructors for you behind the scenes

26744744
serializable	deserialization
the other end uses the same structure and you have to write both serializable and deserialization one will be used at one end and the other at the other end

26744755
int	chars
also you shouldn t need to declare int a as an array when you are just casting a chars to an int

26744763
post	get
i ve read this post from undocumented matlab about java callbacks but i also can t get keypressedcallback to work

26744782
vim	sublimetext
long answer it s not that there is anything wrong with vintage but it is essentially binding vim keys to native sublimetext methods

26744856
int	chars
for each chars of the input string you are creating an array of a single chars casted to int and then you compute the sum of that single int

26745025
width	height
it appears as though padding might be adding to the height width properties or something im not quite sure but would appreciate a heads up on any niggly things anyone else has found before i try tearing my css to pieces

26745026
ciimage	uiimage	portrait	landscape
when i convert a uiimage to a ciimage apply a filter then convert back the image is upside down for landscape or rotated anticlockwise 90 degrees for portrait

26745070
children	parent
in itim isim you can define that roles are parent children of other roles and thus create hierarchies

26745070
children	parent
it also supports that notion of inheritance so that for example provisioning policies that apply to the parent role apply to the children roles as well

26745093
min	max
i computed the min max mean ratios of mean over variance

26745124
int	boolean	put	get
the error message i get when i put this in the time picker dialog listener is the constructor timepickerdialog new view.onclicklistener new timepickerdialog.ontimesetlistener int int boolean is undefined

26745151
children	parent
this will select all div s with class child that are direct children of div s with class parent and remove them

26745181
put	get
you would likely put something inside the inner stack panels instead of the grids i used as a sample to allow you to bind data items to a template but the listed scrollviewer stackpanel solution will get you started in the right direction

26745209
getter	setter
i can think many ways of doing this but i think the simplest one is just create a wrapper of the variable you wan t to listen to implemente a getter and a setter and of course the listener interface

26745267
ggplot2	vegan
there is an excellent example of how to do this from a previous stack overflow thread found here plotting ordiellipse function from vegan package onto nmds plot created in ggplot2

26745276
scipy	scikit-learn
also if you have big data structures consider to use scipy or scikit-learn for calculating the cosine similarity in a more efficient way the latter is not only quick but also memory friendly because you can feed it a scipy.sparse matrix

26745332
int	double
i have experimented and i can t find a way to parse an array of int and a matrix of double to a la4j matrice vector object

26745482
shadowing	named
also i changed the named of your list to lst to avoid shadowing the built-in

26745497
for-loop	arrays
if not why not iterate in reverse using a for-loop not arrays reversal and exit when the first item is found

26745522
hide	show
put contents in div and show hide depending on the menu button clicked

26745540
hide	show

my idea of linear solution is as follows use structure from data.sequence as efficient fifo queue and do everything as imperative bfs would do but i m stuck at point where i have to mark nodes as visited

26745717
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome download excel fine but ie with no pattern to it either opens a blank window and dies silently or opens a window and errors saying that it doesn t know how to handle this file. the original file is obviously on github and these are my futile attempts at a fix

26745741
apktool	dex2jar
now all i can do is to compress this app to an apk and take the code out with dex2jar and resources with apktool

26745756
put	get
then place another formula on your pf as well like below one and suppress it when so it won t show when the other has value and put one overlapping the other to get the value in the same place

26745797
execl	posix
since you already mentioned execl portability beyond posix to win32 seems not be an issue though and for that you should find lots of example code out there much better that what i can write up here

26745862
put	get
however this is very manual to put it into the above format once i get it into excel

26745895
int	double
i want to get int part of double

26745895
int	double
it is due to the fact that double int may have e-notation

26745905
width	height
i have 3 div boxes with fixed width and dynamic height that are set next to each other

26745933
subtract	add
afterward i could just subtract a few pixels and add my footer there

26745951
width	height
i m using percentage to determine width and height of each table cell

26745962
concave	convex
the polygon should be able to be concave or convex but it cannot intersect itself

26746007
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
google-chrome firefox and opera seem to work fine

26746044
button	checkbox
note i m using an input type checkbox instead of a button

26746054
subtract	add
i don t want arrays of these genomic arrays each one is simply a structured set of scalars that i want to reference by name position and be able to add subtract etc

26746070
width	height
- making them act more like an element such as img where it has a height and width but it is displayed inline and if there s not enough room on one line the elements will wrap to the next line

26746080
istream	getline
also note that std getline only works with objects of type std istream and since you re trying to perform input your outfile object shouldn t be std ofstream

26746108
icollection	iqueryable
e.subexpertises must be cast to iqueryable because it s compile-time type is icollection and the extension method any that fits icollection doesn t accept an expression but a func so it doesn t compile

26746139
min	max
get the min and max rowid s for each athlete

26746145
getter	setter
the getter setter

26746161
margin	height
then apply a top and bottom margin to the body and the margin should be the height of the footer and header

26746200
client-side	server-side
i see that there is the client-side flow and the hybrid server-side flow but i m not sure which one to use

26746270
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i would prefer something that works in firebug but i would be happy with something that works with the developer tools built into firefox google-chrome or safari

26746302
dictionary	map
these become keys in a dictionary with the values in the dictionary being the actual words that map to those letters

26746305
integer	unsigned
doing reinterpret_cast to and then dereferencing the resulting pointer is a violation of strict aliasing rule and is undefined behavior if std uint8_t is implemented as extended unsigned integer type

26746385
proficy	historian
collecting information for a program like proficy historian on the other hand is a different matter

26746403

i am running on a mac osx yosemite and using mamp 2.2

26746435
submit	submission
submit button is clicked the actionlistener picks it up and prints what is in the textfield at the time of submission

26746456
gtk	cairo
i m using a pango inside a cairo context inside a gtk window

26746499
width	height
because your div body has no content and does not have a fixed height width

26746539
google-chrome	firefox
a quick test i ve run has shown that executing option.innerhtml on 5000 options takes less than 2 milliseconds in firefox 33 and google-chrome 38 other browsers should behave similarly

26746542
sorting	filtering
in general i prefer to just return the query and let the caller decide to even call it directly or add some more filtering sorting instead of doing ndb.get_multi directly

26746562
hide	show
this is happening because you re using opacity to hide show the sub-menu instead of using display block and display none

26746564
post	get
i believe i heard to get the body from a post you have to use the async version of post

26746585
joomla	typo3	wordpress	joomla
i was pointed to big dogs like wordpress drupal joomla and typo3 but these are all very heavy-handed

26746609
portrait	landscape
essentially it is setting the view as portrait in a landscape view so everything is shifted to the left

26746609
portrait	landscape
if i open the app in any other position it is fine and it seamlessly switches between portrait or landscape in any direction

26746609
portrait	landscape
i know that the problem revolves around when you open in right landscape it sets the size of the screen to portrait but i don t know the culprit

26746615
ubuntu	linux
for ubuntu linux i came up with this process

26746631
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
none of which worked in google-chrome or safari but all but the last of which worked in firefox and ie

26746631
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
when i use alert slide.style.left when the window is wider than the image a positive value is returned in google-chrome and safari unlike the 0 from firefox and ie which tells me that the 0 value is never being written to slide.style.left

26746644
put	get
i m calling a php function to get a value via ajax and this is the out put of my alert

26746684
google-chrome	firefox
apparently this works in ie and google-chrome but not firefox

26746686
minimum	max
you could perhaps have the first date as the minimum of your current data and the end date as the max or adjust according to your needs

26746689
multiplying	add
so if you take 1 3 and add it to itself twice or multiplying it by 3 you will get .999999 not 1

26746820
min	max
when the render engine kicks in it tries to adheres to the html spec which determines how to calculate the step s min max and displays the slider accordingly

26746850
mouseover	mousemove
each element of the datasets has to respond to an event mouseover mousemove etc...

26746870
awt	swing
see painting in awt and swing and performing custom painting for more details

26746875
int	chars
my favorite method for searching for the number of chars in a string is you can do that for both and test those int

26746915
implements	extends
you should extends intentservice and implements onhandleintent intent

26746920
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition
addition division subtraction works but multiplication does not work

26746930
plot	errorbar
i suppose one solution is to plot the markers 1 pixel to the left right from the errorbar

26746974
libcrypto	libcurl
i already tried that with libcurl and it failed because it wanted a new version of libssl and libcrypto

when using objectinputstream and objectoutputstream classes ois class doesn t have a ready method instead it has a method called available which returns the number of available bytes to be processed

26769428

int	chars
essentially extract the i-th chars of each string convert them to int then do the subtraction

26769832
int	double
since in this case math.sqrt can only return a positive double you could skip the call to math.floor and just cast the result of math.sqrt to an int which will truncate the result

26769832
int	double
note that truncating the double to an int simply discards the fractional digits of the double and calling math.floor rounds the double towards negative infinity

26769854

you can use timespan.days property as well if you are interested in the total days as an int rather than a double

26780844
int	double
i told you totaldays property returns double and days property returns int

26780874
addition	multiplication
you can make things faster by turning repeated multiplication i j into iterated addition k + i

26780874
primes	modulus
conversely a wheel is the extension of the odds-only idea to dropping further small primes from the array like 3 and 5 in the famous mod 30 wheel with modulus 2 3 5

26780893
skip-lists	tree
1st question - i believe that it would still be o log n since a skip-lists is a type of a binary tree so there s no assurance where the head tail nodes are

26780902
width	height
1 the most critical i keep forgetting to remember that in order to scale a control the size must be relatively static that is do not set the max width height to large numbers

26780939
post	get
until now i successfully add the other post with the function wp_get_recent_post but of course i get all post

26780983
serializable	deserialization
if you are trying to send the struct you must use serializable and deserialization read about that you can start with

26780995
folder	directory
do it manually rearrange your folder first and then drag and drop your directory in xcode

26780996
width	height
you can check for which resolution is there according to set image height and width

26780998
google-chrome	firefox
there s actually a selenium framework that was ported to run with coded ui by a developer at microsoft which you can find here that will use the selenium components to run the tests in google-chrome or firefox

26781042
spaces	delimiter
for a pvk the dg command could be used as follows spaces delimiter to show how the command is structured

26781058
google-chrome	firefox
works perfectly in firefox but does not work at all in google-chrome

26781060
width	height
n filter length is 8 width and height are 1024 x 1024 filter coefficients are generated using generic filters

26781065
dictionary	map
if all you need is essentially a map but don t want to incur performance overhead associated with dictionary lookups this might work

26781107
scikit-learn	nltk
i am doing sentiment analysis of movie review using python with scikit-learn and nltk

26781150
width	height
better to make x and y global in your class and set the width and height there and just assign the new size when you click the button so you don t have it multiply every time you click the button

26781182
sitecore	examine
i would examine the inherited roles using the user manager and check if they have the sitecore designer role inherited

26781206
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
if you release another installer with the same appid directive value it will be considered to be an upgrade to the previous one on systems where the old one is installed actions performed by the new versioning will append to an existing uninstall log file

26781221
width	height
as i look closer it would still call onload but loads nothing with zero width and height

26781276
post	put
thus in this case post or put make the most sense

26781309
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i ve discovered that vertical-align sub makes checkboxes look good enough aligned in google-chrome firefox and opera

26781367
folder	directory
one thing i don t understand is why there are so many folder in the project directory bin conf contrib docs images m4 man notes etc

26781421
width	height
try to set the textview width and height relatively to your layout instead of wrap_content

26781445
hide	show
when i click the button an ajax request is send and on succes i need to hide this button and show the other button delete

26781460
google-chrome	safari
my html code is not displaying in any version of ipad 1 2 3 4 browsers safari or google-chrome app

26781479
pop-up	dialog
when running the test either via resharper 8 or with the mspec console running i get a pop-up dialog from r# with the following error

26781479
moq	mspec
i m using the latest moq and mspec from nuget

26781493
range	minimum
i think there s a problem with his approach the modified m array won t be able to handle future rmq range minimum queries since stores the index of a recent query

26781505
post	get
you can get the list of event listeners on a specific element as explained by this post

26781506
for-loop	arrays
if you only need to watch for changes you may save the files names in a string arrays and read them in another so comparing them with a for-loop will tell you any new file in that folder

26781515
tortoisegit	svn
i want to use tortoisegit to check out a svn repository via ssh

26781536
int	double
i ve tried using a double instead of an int and i ve tried using i++ instead of ++i neither fixed the problem

26781548
getter	setter
but this solution wouldn t be totally correct a better approach is declaring them as private and creating public getter and setter to access modify them

26781550
int	double
i want to know why new int i .hashcode or new long i .hashcode returns i but when hashcode is invoked by some other object say new double 345 .hashcode it returns a random number

26781600
int	double
a double has to be hashed in some different manner because the hash here has to be an int

26781604
folder	directory
one thing i don t understand is why there are so many folder in the project directory bin conf contrib docs images m4 man notes etc

26781611
getter	setter
whoever i must point out that most times it s not recommended to set members access as public and you should learn about getter and setter

26781637
int	double
double.hashcode will return a seemingly random value because floating point numbers float and double are not stored nicely 2 s complement like int or long in the bytes that are reserved for them but using ieee 754 binary floating point standard and so mapping those 8 bytes to 4 this is exactly what the implementation does will not be a meaningful number as an int which uses 2 s complement representation

26781644
int	double
in the case of long int and double the hashcode is the value except in the case of double where it is converted to int

26781674
ssl	https
i am trying to use ssl on my website but the recources that have a relative url load as http even when the page is using https

26781713
min	max
until now i have only succeded importing the file into an xmlschemaset object from which i still cannot read the string int bool types neither the max min occurences or hierarchies

26781779
slider	mmenu
i am using a plugin add on called mmenu - it is being used to create a navigation bar that slider out from the side of the screen like in the facebook app

26781783
integer	unsigned
you will usually see people cast to a unsigned 64 bit integer and then call the classic bsd functions to convert to from network byte order

26781783
int	double
for another i agree with neilkirk and the article you linked to the code to read write from a particular endianness is identical regardless of the actual endianness on the machine so just write code that will read big-endian little-endian data using the code from the article you linked to just cast it to a double after you ve read and manipulated the bytes as a 64 bit unsigned int type

26781860
put	get
starting to work with google spreadsheets need to get put some data there

26781915
equals	compareto
compareto retuns 0 if the two strings are equals a value less than 0 if p1.abnormal is greater than p2.abnormal and the other way around

26781920
hide	show
for starters you have your ad inside an id so to show hide this in your css you need to target an id not a class

26781926
superclass	subclassing
suppose the method is public in superclass and you have changed it to private while overriding in subclassing but since you have a reference of superclass so compiler will not complain but at run-time it will break down

26781926
superclass	subclassing
the same thing applies here as well since compiler looks for superclass method for throws but if at run-time the subclassing throws new or broader exception then who is responsible for handling all new checked exception that should be caught at compile time

26781949
inherited	subclassing
overridden only if they are inherited by the subclassing

26781949
public	protected
only override the non-final methods declared public or protected

26781993
for-loop	loops
i ve tried running with a for-loop a foreach loops a do loops

26781994
fflush	gets
mappera.update update some a - cache a gets fflush

26782007

when the progressbarimageview is loading and i lock my screens and then again switching on the screens then it reloads from 0 to current progress

26782007
onresume	onpause
i am not doing anything in onpause or onresume

26782012
rss	feed
i m creating an rss feed with yahoo pipes and i m trying to filter the links based on the keywords used in the page

26782041
width	height
i note in the documentation that absolutepanel can achieve this with its top bottom left right arguments but then you lose the side panel and in any case the plot while scaling to width seems to ignore available height

26782059
aggregate-functions	sum
because you can t mix normal column select with aggregate-functions like sum

26782080
spring-data-commons	spring-data-cassandra
i don t recall explicitly coding this into spring-data-cassandra but that behavior might just be provided entirely by spring-data-commons

26782099
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome i have wanted behavior but in firefox and ie i don t and i need to have it in all browsers

26782107
gson	jackson
so you can use jackson gson or the implementation that you to prefer to unmarshall them

26782119
inherited	subclassing
the subclassing can only override instance methods which are inherited by it

26782119
superclass	subclassing
the return type of an overriding method should be same as or a subclassing of the return type declared in the overridden superclass method

26782125
int	chars
then you iterate over it chars by chars call find on a each which return an int position of a substring in a string

26782154
min	max
to tell the truth the dispersion of the values is significant for q 55 min compression ratio is 22.91 while max value is 116.55 and the distribution is not normal

26782186
google-chrome	firefox
the same code works as desired in the latest google-chrome firefox and ie desktop browsers as well as within android

26782224
d3.js	dc.js
i have the following bubble chart coded with dc.js which is built upon d3.js

26782297
postorder	inorder
so its impossible to say given inorder and postorder traversals if the same tree was used to generate them

26782322
stdout	stderr
i also looked at nimbus.log stderr stdout ui.log there are no signs of error

26782346

however the big button hide show is used to hide show all of them

26782363

try-catch	exception-handling
i would probably use try-catch exception-handling handling and when you catch timeoutexception then call driver.navigate.back

26783953
int	double
so suppose that it is a function receiving a double and returning an int with the cdecl calling convention then you declare it like so

after quite a bit of testing and having read the post by almaz - i realized i could not get negative numbers to work

26784300
put	get
if you put 3.14159265 as a number into a variable - all you will be able to get is the 3 because the fractional portion is only accessible by multiplying the number by ten ie 10.0 repeatedly

google-chrome	firefox
when i accessed hello_spnego.jsp from firefox or google-chrome i was asked for username and password and then it showed me my username perfectly

after that all the three browsers google-chrome firefox and ie show this same error but none of them ask for username and password anymore

26784386
width	height
your best bet is to build a 100 width table height is useless and usually winds up breaking the layout anyway with the background color you wish

26784388
getter	setter
usually when declaring a property you get a setter and a getter method for it

26784388
getter	setter
using dot notation is then equivalent to calling the setter or the getter

26784388
getter	setter
not sure if this will actually solve your issue but i hope the explanation of properties getter and setter helps you to understand a little more what s going on

26784389
stdout	stderr
but a general principle of node is to make use of stdout and stderr as intended so i would probably just do a console.error whatever you need to say

26784390
swift	objective-c
there are a lot of objective-c implementations on github and a cursory search found a swift one too

26784403

post	get
i am trying to get scriptcs + fluentautomation to work having read scott hanselmans blog post

26784431
min	max
one alternative approach could be to look at all vertices of my 3d object and to determine which ones are the min max in x y

26784434
children	parent
in this example html we have a div as the parent and some p s as the children

26784554
abstract-class	superclass
the root of the problem was that there was a superclass of the superclass lets call it baseclass that was explicitly specified as as that was intended just as a common abstract-class for many-many types of objects

26784554
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
the nice solution was to use mappedsuperclass so the superclass does not have to be an entity but subclassing can inherited their fields and the fields annotations including id

26784558
getter	setter
from personalinfodao and its getter and setter

26784563
integer	unsigned
in c you can use uint64_t which is a 64 bit unsigned integer type

this web app has a table with multiple checkbox and an update button disbaled by default

26784634
button	checkbox
when one or more checkbox are clicked i activate the button

26784634
button	checkbox
the idea here is to send all the information of the checkbox which ones are on or off to the server when the update button is clicked and then to save those changes in the db

26784663
express	node.js
right now i have a simple node.js + express + socket.io server that detects connections and allows the user to interchange small files by just doing

26784775
content-disposition	content-type
if you would rather stream the content directly to the browser rather than a download and if the content-type is supported by the browser such as video audio pdf etc then remove the content-disposition header

26784776
ssl	https
hosted service has applied ssl certificate and on browse of url it appears with https

26784786
layoutparams	viewgroup
by passing the viewgroup that the view will be added too the layoutinflater can create the correct type of layoutparams to match the hierarchy

26784787
punctuation	words
this would give you a string array with the words and punctuation

26784797

delete parent then delete children

noexcept	throw
unlike throw noexcept will not call std unexpected and may or may not unwind the stack which potentially allows the compiler to implement noexcept without the runtime overhead of throw

equals	gethashcode
persongroups are compared by reference and all of the objects have different references.you need to override equals and gethashcode methods in your persongroup class to compare your instances based on state or implement an and pass it to groupby

26789750
equals	gethashcode
they override the definition of equals and gethashcode to be dependent on the identity of each of the properties they represent

26789750
equals	gethashcode
if you want to use your own custom type to group on and the default equality semantics aren t what you want you ll need to either provide a custom iequalitycomparer implementation or override equals and gethashcode for the type in question

26790102
nullpointerexception	illegalstateexception
edit after catching the nullpointerexception an illegalstateexception pops up too

26790113
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
the shell itself sh csh tcsh ksh zsh bash etc... is essentially just a binary the operating system executes to allow you to execute other binaries

26790113
vim	emacs
built in functions like echo don t need to create a new process but if the text is interpreted as a request to execute a binary vim emacs gcc test true false etc... the shell will create a new process for it unless you prefix it with exec and execute it

26790165

26790310
hash	hmac
hmac still often uses hash algorithms that are designed to be quick and easy to compute

26790320
versioning	upgrade
and you re certainly not going to get any support for 5.3.1 from the community if you hit something that you think might be a bug so do yourself a favor and upgrade to a versioning that was released more recently than 2010

26790379
nexus	artifactory
so since you added tag to your question here s an artifactory online service which provides you with exactly what you are looking for except it s not nexus but artifactory

26790379
saas	iaas
if you prefer using iaas and not saas you can run artifactory on aws azure or google cloud platform with bitnami

26790379
nexus	artifactory
and if you are wondering what are the differences between artifactory and nexus this comparison can be helpful

26790396

difference is that union without all implies a distinct which you don t need want

26790634
switching	screens
you should define the two screens separately or sikuli won t know to switching screens to look for the button you want

26790764
hide	show
the purpose of the code is to hide one object instruction and show another news-content then to do the opposite the next time it s clicked

26790808
accessor	properties
you are making an assumption that last argument will be properties assignment value and can be excluded from the list above enabling you to use optional accessor parameters however it is not a documented behavior and then - perhaps even more important - this is hardly supported by js engine which has its own constraints on automation properties

26790831
versioning	upgrade
for findbugs issue i don t want to upgrade java jdk versioning from 1.6 to 1.7.0 40 at this time as this core project s artifact is consumed by other projects which are still on java jdk 1.6

26790854
for-loop	loops
each time it would loops through the for-loop it would create a new socket with the ip address and the port number it is testing for

26790860
int	double
one of the fields value can be a double number like 24.87 or an int number like 24

26790892
atexit	main
a lot depends how you structure the rest of your code - if you are using worker threads subprocess multiprocess then atexit is probably the way to go if you are doing all your work in main then signal will probably work better for you

26790925
for-loop	loops
remember that a for-loop just expands like a while loops so this translates to the following

26790940
implements	extends
implements your receiver and extends parsepushbroadcastreceiver class

26791002
illegalstateexception	illegalargumentexception
it works if your throwing and asserting on very domain specific exceptions but i only throw those kinds of exceptions when i m working on code that needs to be absolutely immaculate --most apis will simply throw the built in exceptions like illegalargumentexception or illegalstateexception

26791016
apache	nginx
i think you can achieve this using apache nginx your server s rewrite rules

26791028
width	height
changing lparam from wrap_content to match_parent or other width height is not the solution

26791048
build.gradle	gradlew
you can archieve this by adding a new gradlew task to your build.gradle and attaching it as a dependence of processdebugresources and processreleaseresources gradlew tasks

26791058
getter	setter
that s because date fields have their owns getter setter in base model

26791079
width	height
this checkbox appears in the upper right hand corner of the selected items and has a height and width of 40 which effectively gives you a minimum height on these items

26791123
uiview	subviews
i know i can create a uiview subclass make that ibdesignable and assign it to the view controller s view but this would require that i make all other subviews properties of this uiview subclass instead of properties of the view controller

26791164
cpython	pypy
you ll see that pattern all over the place√¢ even in the stdlib where code is imported from c accelerator modules if possible but fallback code is used if not if you re using pypy instead of cpython

26791209
autocomplete	multi-select
while a single-select combobox lets you type a new value that is not in the list or facilitates the autocomplete feature when typing a value that is included in the list but the multi-select combo box prevents you from typing anything in its textbox and that behavior doesn t seem to change via the properties of the combobox control

26791229
swift	objective-c
either objective-c or swift would be fine

26791247
implements	extends
and want to add a method you propably could just extends each class with a new subclass and each suba subb subc and so on could implements the new method.

i have been following this tutorial to try and get mongodb node.js express and jade to work together but i can not for the life of me get the program to access any information from the database

26791351
std	ostream
error no match for operator operand types are std ostream aka std basic_ostream and std vector

26791356
swift	objective-c
this is the swift form of the objective-c factory method +lookatconstraintwithtarget

26791356
swift	objective-c
in general there are three easy ways to find out how an objective-c factory method like translates to a swift initializer like init bar which you call with the syntax nsfoo bar heresabar

26791356
swift	objective-c
type the class name into a swift file and command-click it to see the auto-generated swift interface for that class based on the objective-c header including initializer declarations

26791356
swift	objective-c
look at the documentation for a class online or in xcode and you ll see both objective-c and swift declarations for each api

26791373
ubuntu	debian
for ubuntu debian

26791378
try-catch	exception-handling
for diagnosis i would recommend debugging on the target machine so you can get the full stack trace of the exception-handling and barring that make a release console build and wrap the using in a try-catch as above but slam the exception.stacktrace into the console window for viewing

26791383
post	get
i d like to get webtest to run a multipart form post using mock

26791399

secondly you should check the headers you ve sent to the browser using the developer console in google-chrome firefox or even ie

26791428
hide	show
when the pdf is displayed in the iframe the toolbar and navigation pane show but we d like to hide those

26791428
hide	show
i ve written a test application which show that using pdfsmartcopy instead of the stamper works perfectly - the pdf is show in the browser which hide the toolbar and navpane by default

26791479
google-chrome	firefox
when i m with google-chrome i can see the background code perfectly but when i m with firefox the background color is not seen

26791508
folder	directory
copy all the dlls in the osgeo4w bin directory to a new folder in

26791541
mpmath	sympy
it looks like you are using the mpmath diff instead of the sympy one

26791553
folder	directory
you might be better off keeping separate source and simulation compilation directory and only use revision control on your source directory and maybe a folder for release binaries if you need to

26791565
flask	django
i m using gunicorn w wsgi no paster or django to run flask

26791578
try-catch	exception-handling
you can catch that exception-handling with a try-catch block

26791607
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome example 1

26791641
spaces	delimiter
it is very hard for you to set a contextual delimiter without teaching your program in advance that the spaces between new and hampshire is not the same as the spaces between california and sacramento

26791667
put	get
the following code works the server gets the com string and then the connection closes if i uncomment the bw.flush and its next line the server doesn t get the com string anymore and it just waits on the br.readline for a response which will not get since the server didn t got the com string if i move the bw.close and put it in the bw.flush position the br.readline will throw a socket closed exception

26791706
width	height
in your css you can specify media queries based on the width and height of the device

26791706
width	height
usually you only care about width but you can tailor rules to device width and height as well

26791706
google-chrome	firefox
to test if it works the google-chrome and firefox dev tools both have emulators for popular devices

26791744
int	double

26791763
dictionary	map
you can use the dictionary to map each word in the original phrase to the desired language whenever possible

26791763
punctuation	words
note that you might need to have a more careful tokenization scheme instead of using split to handle cases such as words followed by punctuation

26791771
implements	extends
to extends the cat from movable would be wrong because the cat is not a movable it can move so it should implements movable or leave default implementation of movable

26791798
width	height
i am not seeing any height or width attributes for that style

26791839
getter	setter
i have managed to implement a custom getter setter for the site_maanagers attribute where i can take a hash of user_ids passed by the form and fetch update the appropriate records as needed

26791839
getter	setter
i ve tried ditching the whole custom getter setter and going with a habtm implementation that uses a join table to manage all these records but i am concerned that this won t scale well if when we need to add more roles to the project each role adds an extra column to the join table

26791859
gdal	netcdf
program uses the gdal geotools netcdf ejml and jodatime libraries

26791859
gdal	ogr
update after just putting a message dialog in random lines until i could narrow down the issue looks like the error is with the gdal ogr libraries

26791884
folder	directory
the programs are copied to the folder because they only work in the current working directory

26791956
post	get
the client uses the requests library to make the remote rest calls mostly get and post

26792030
uicollectionview	uitableview
you can follow the uitableview uicollectionview pattern - dequeue a node prepare it for reuse set it up and then use it

26792085
osx	yosemite
os mac osx yosemite 10.10 happens on 10.9 too

26792085

26792090
serializable	deserialization
serializable or deserialization

26792090
superclass	subclassing
you can use a class or other type representing the superclass of the anonymous type to describe what to serialize using the overloaded tojson object type method but you ll still lose any new fields defined in the anonymous subclassing

26792104
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
but most importantly you have two nested loops two for loops which doesn t make sense you need only one for-loop two reverse an arrays and you don t even need the new arrays to put the result

26792104
for-loop	arrays
this for-loop works from both sides of the arrays inwards replacing the positions

26792158
sorting	filtering
when dgrid interacts with a store all paging filtering and sorting responsibilities fall upon the store not the grid

26792172
google-chrome	firefox
it s so bad it actually crashes google-chrome and ie firefox is a champ but still slow

26792200
int	chars
it just seems like not of one mind in the design here because int data and chars data of 16 bits is now differentiable but int and chars data of 8 bits is not

26792200
unsigned	short
but the feature of recognizing wchar_t as an official distinct type from unsigned short enables improvements but only for wide-string users

26792226
spaces	delimiter
the arguments are white spaces delimiter

26792234
integer	unsigned
on my system it takes less than 2 microseconds to calculate fib n 10 for any 32 bit or 64 bit unsigned integer n since the actual calculation is f n a n-2 60 f 2 10 all math operations are done 10

26792244
hlsl	glsl
i m trying to abstract some shader related code away into a small shader class which i ll hopefully modify further to allow for glsl in addition to hlsl

26792257
put	get
i can make a php page that will display results from a mysql database and i can get addresses to map with google but i can t seem to put both of them together

26792279
width	height
this will give the height and width i had some problems with some of the unicode characters and measuretext this was the only solution for some characters

26792286
pull	push
my laptop is behind our corporate firewall for most of the day so being able to do an hg push pull against bitbucket.org fails because it isn√¢ t hitting or proxy server

26792288
int	chars
yes probably but using single-byte int that aren t chars is pretty rare and you can trivially get around your stated problem via integral promotion try applying a unary + and see what happens

26792288
unsigned	short
it s also worth noting that your premise is flawed wchar_t and unsigned short have always been distinct types per paragraph 3.9.1 5 in c++98 c++03 c++11 and c++14

26792301
hash	md5
no there are no out of band hash values for md5 sha-1 or one of the sha-2 candidates

26792301
hash	md5
neither md5 or sha1 is currently so broken that you would be able to generate any random hash value but attacks only get better not worse

26792359
textview	imageview
each list item contains an imageview image of a hotel textview to hold the name address price etc of a particular hotel

26792369
client-side	server-side
we have an existing app already and i m investigating what it would take to integrate it with worklight including for performance reasons moving files from the server-side to the client-side without incurring too much refactoring of the current code

26792482
folder	dir
i m using recursivedirectoryiterator to scan for all files and folder within a given root dir

26792540
portrait	landscape
on landscape mode it works fine however on portrait mode it leaves out part of it on the side and the user has to scroll horizontally

26792607
concave	convex
well there are some tricks you could play with for all manner of convex polygons but concave ones will soon get difficult

26792608
folder	directory
i can access the php pages just fine but what i am trying to do is access php pages from within a directory inside the pages folder

26792620
int	chars
what i want to do is to catch the error in scanner when a user inputs a chars instead of an int

26792649
maven	pom.xml
either you need to add additional repositories to your pom.xml that contain the plugin or you need to get the plugin stored in the repo so maven can find it

26792772
google-chrome	firefox
here s the expected behavior snap taken from firefox 34 similar behavior on ie 9 10 and latest google-chrome

26792797
integer	fractions
sqlite on the other hand has no built-in way to do this although you could cast the result to an integer if you don t care about correctness for negative values casting chops off the fractions part while flooring should always return a number less than the input

26792830
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox but not in google-chrome

26792845
put	get
problem is event target get pointed to span element when clicking on + so we need to put an element type check so that we change class only when its element li

26792851
folder	directory
another option is to use a common bin folder and have all the projects output to that main directory and execute them from there

26792868
put	get
the problem seems to be that when i run the put it just returns the same data as a get

26792881
hide	show
i m trying to show hide tabs on click using just javascript but i m getting errors uncaught typeerror cannot set property classname of undefined tabs. anonymous function .onclick

int	boolean
similarly you can have int substitution d decimal floating point substitution f and as in the case of the original question you can substitute boolean values with r

26792959
ng-show	ng-hide
your concern that the element will still be there in dom if the expression is false happens with ng-show ng-hide

26792962
mousehover	mouseleave
i know i can use the mousehover and mouseleave event of each radiobutton but the code would be lengthy if i do it that way because there are too many radiobuttons

width	height
if the width or the height is bigger than 99 or 98 pixel most of the time i get an error message bitmap size too big

26793047
x86	64bit
change to x86 platform will work for both 32bit and 64bit os but i don t want to do this because of i want to take 64bit os benefit such as memory space for other heavy process

26793079
put	get
when i put the printf statement inside the while loop i get something along the lines of

26793096
int	double
you could write a function to test it by calling double.parsedouble string and catching the numberformatexception this will handle double and int values when it isn t like

26793097
post	get
i want to get all groups a yammer user can post message to i know get groups the use belong to but the results do not include public groups the use does not belong to

26793099
for-loop	arrays
two issues i found for accessing html element inside for-loop you need to use .item as its htmlcollection you are getting instead of an arrays

26793120
implements	extends
by explicitely extends any a class that implements serializable can now also be a value class

26793128
int	chars
the functions write suitably implement serialization of an int value and a sequence of chars

26793204
hide	show
and hide show the tab bar on scroll

26793207

this post provides a lot of useful information on how to get list of tables etc

26793359
ggplot2	vegan
i get essentially the same message for other packages i attempt to install eg ggplot2 and vegan though in many cases it is more verbose as it tries and fails to install dependencies

26793375
int	double
because casting a double as an int truncates the double to the highest int less than or equal to it

26793379
nscopying	nsmutablecopying
instead we have to query if an object conforms to nsmutablecopying or at least nscopying

26793388
post	get
i had to override the ondispatch method in my apicontroller class and only route to my custom method if its a get post or update command

26793390

i know i can get this to work with an explicit width and height but i know i should be able to get it by setting the width equal to the view s width and height equal to the view s width as well aka 1 1 aspect ratio

26793392
tostring	getter
there are three getter methods as you can see and a tostring method that creates a string in the hh mm ss format

26793442

the following works fine in safari google-chrome firefox and omniweb

26793466
base-class	subclassing
in my ef-model i have a base-class report and a set of subclassing for this

26793549

initially ng-hide will be hidden and ng-show will be shown then when you toggle to false for scope.value it will flip in reverse

26810285
ng-show	ng-hide
basically don t use two ng-shows but you use a combination of both ng-hide and ng-show

26810314

26811330
width	height
the cover will set it to fill the whole width and height without stretching the image

26811385
int	chars
your other obvious option is to write a filter that filters the chars out so that you are only left with number strings and then just run parseint over those number strings to turn them into int values

26811431
swift	objective-c
i need to be able to call this from my existing objective-c class but whenever i put the enum in the swift function arguments objective-c can t find that specific function it is even removed from the -swift.h file

this is the same as servicestack s soap support where all soap request are post s which you can ensure is accessible by soap mq requests by maintaining separate request dto s a common and recommended practice and implementing them using any so they re still accessible by both put and post requests e.g

26811624
post	put
this service enables access to the service via post customers and put customers 1 http routes while still allowing them to be accessed via soap mq

26812019
int	chars
well this is true just in the case of the chars if there is no 0 and the it is an int array the the program will crash because there will be a address whose elements are not the part of the array or pointer if the system has memory that was allocated using the malloc then the system will keep giving the memory

26812041
int	chars
when you receive a chars and change to an int you will get the chars equivalent in ascii

width	height
switch the values of the width and height so that the width is longer than the height

26812377
restrict	shared
normally i wouldn t fight this but i ve read that isn t fully restrict for use on the query string portion and since this url will be shared it would be a lot prettier with in place of 2f

put	get
a url identifies a resource and a get and put or delete on that endpoint can idempotently update or remove just a single attribute or even a subset of a value so long as the url scopes to that attribute or some subset it is by definition a distinct resource and http fully supports overlapping resources and even multiple resources being affected by a put

26824275

to answer your comment below a good rule to follow is to think of put as replace rather than update so that what you put is what you should get back assuming nothing else has modified the resource since your put

26824780
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
how would i embed this uiviewcontroller in a uinavigationcontroller so that the push segue works

26824786
children	parent
so instead of adding zoominup to the images nav-font to the links and so on and so on and so on √¢ simply write your css in such a way to begin with that changing only the class of the nav parent element changes the formatting of all its children where necessary

26824786
children	parent
and if not all elements that need to be affected are children of the nav element √¢ not sure because you are also selecting things such as .fa-shopping-cart in your code √¢ then simply don√¢ t apply this technique at nav level but on a higher common parent element.

26824801
jscrollpane	jtableheader
that would be the expected behaviour as the jtableheader expands the entire width of the jscrollpane s headers area

as for me i think the f in √¢ ≈ì repeat f 1 √¢ has the type of √¢ ≈ì chars √¢ and the func in √¢ ≈ì int repeat chars func int int int a √¢ has the type of √¢ ≈ì chars √¢ too

26827862
int	chars
if i change √¢ ≈ì chars func int int int a √¢ to

26827862
int	chars
√¢ ≈ì chars func int int int a √¢ the compiler testing in gcc and vc6 do not give any warnings and the running result is the same

26827862

warning incompatible pointer types passing chars int int to parameter of type double int int -wincompatible-pointer-types repeat f 1

26827862
int	double
it seems that the compiler treat √¢ ≈ì double int int √¢ and √¢ ≈ì double int int √¢ the same stuff

26827862
int	chars	int	double
in other words if i change √¢ ≈ì chars func int int int a √¢ to √¢ ≈ì double func int int √¢ the compiler will throw the same message i have tested it

int	chars	int	double
warning incompatible pointer types passing chars int int to parameter of type double int int -wincompatible-pointer-types repeat f 1

of course the f in √¢ ≈ì repeat f 1 √¢ has the type of √¢ ≈ì chars int int √¢ and the func in int repeat double func int int int a has the type of √¢ ≈ì chars int int √¢

26827862
int	chars	int	double
you can infer this by changing √¢ ≈ì int repeat chars func int int int a √¢ to √¢ ≈ì int repeat double func int int int a √¢ and check the warning message

overload malloc realloc free with specialized versions

26836217

26836564
accessor	superclass	mutators	getter	mutators	setter	getter	setter
and change all of scimemcalc s accesses to currentvalue to use the superclass accessor getter and mutators setter methods

26836564
superclass	subclassing
alternatively you could declare currentvalue as protected in your superclass which would allow you to access it directly in your subclassing

26836584
range	max
when i ran mine the average number of steps was usually around 16 and the max number of steps ran usually in the 80-90 range but was varied

it s important to note that uitouch objects are constant across touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended

26836847
touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended
you can think of a uitouch object as being created in touchesbegan altered in touchesmoved and destroyed in touchesended

26836847
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
you can track the phase of a touch over the course of its life by saving a reference to the touch object to a dictionary or an array as it is created in touchesbegan then in touchesmoved you can check the new location of any existing touches and alter the object s course if the user moves their finger you can apply tolerances to prevent jitter if the x y distance is less than some tolerance don t alter the course

also post the crash log and stack trace here if you get stuck

26849223
post	get
i m having an issue with getting the correct character encoding for data being post ed which is built up from multiple sources i get the data as a single post variable

26849225
serializable	deserialization
wcf allows your code to stay focused on your business logic not transport mechanisms and serializable deserialization

26849225
post	get
for this second service you also need to support read http get and write http post

26849238

bash	tcsh
since with a shell bash tcsh ksh etc. on linux and cmd.exe or powershell on windows you will get very different results

26849370
children	parent
background i have a database containing parent and children s names this is a simplification of the actual data but the analogy is close enough

26849370
children	parent
task the database has to store an ordered list of children s names for each parent

26849370
children	parent
parent typically have no more than to 4 or 5 children but rare and even extreme cases have to be supported as well

26849370
children	parent
children s names as well as their ordering for a particular parent are immutable

26849370
children	parent
when a new parent is inserted with a list of his children if such a list of names already exists in the database the new parent should reference the existing list identifier

26849370
children	parent
queries about names and their ordering should be possible for example - find all parent that names a child bob after naming a child alice or find all parent that named a child alice then had two more children with the third named carol etc

26849371
range	max
if the input range was empty then max will be equal to misc_data.end so the equivalent to your function would be .

26849415
post	put
this will put today s date first and within that put the post with the maximum upvotes first

26849415
post	put
the date function there pulls the date part of a timestamp value which is what i believe you want so post are put together by the date itself regardless of time

26849425
plot	heatmap
i have temperature data from eight different nonequidistant depths over several days and i would like to plot it as heatmap

26849431

26849838
versioning	upgrade
this is particularly true if you ve upgrade gradle from an older versioning

26849839
children	parent
what this means is that as your children link to a parent that parent should know who its children are but in this case they do not

26849851

i have only one button in my layout which covers the whole screen both height and width are match_parent

26850055
int	double
if the library you re using really takes a vector of int that is actually supposed to be a vector of double then its developers have put you in an awkward position

26850056
getter	setter
the case scenario is having a base object that has these properties and corresponding getter setter always defined id name content

26850056

26850541
post	get
i ve played around with your plunkr but you ll now need to test it as the http call needs a full url to post to but i was able to get the error alert to work so success should fire too under the rtight circumstances

i ve seen people subclassing them in objective-c but i haven t found one answer in swift

26850564
min	max
edit maybe a clarification i m looking for a maximum width for example min width 32 and max width 32 then the column should not grow wider than 32 px and shouldn t shrink to less than 32 px

26850612
inherited	properties
p.s some properties like text-align are inherited you don t have to re-declare it in a child unless you want to change the value

26850626
children	parent
just store the children for each parent

26850657
versioning	upgrade
there are no changes in the diff that upgrade to 5.2.2 except for versioning number changes there s specifically no node been added edited

to show and hide the actionbar i simply called show and hide on it

26850721
hide	show
to implement the same behaviour on the app bar i subclassed toolbar and added a show and a hide method that do the same first simply using setvisibility and then using animations -- getting the same results

26850738
org.json	jackson
the main advantage of jackson over the standard org.json api is its data-binding capabilites meaning the ability to convert json directly into your java objects without having to manually select each parameter and assign it to an object property

26850742
put	get
i create a new thread and have it call this method then get the string value split it on then put it in a few different textviews

26850776
disk	ram
this means that memory in hard disk will be used as additional ram but the access to it would be slower just like normal hard disk access

26850824
post	get
if i read your initial post correctly then you re saying that you get all the way to and past the return view call in your controller but your jquery ajax call says there was an error

26850888
post	get
get is for just getting the data from the page whereas post is submitting data to the page

26851330
ssl	https
if the user is accessing the website via https fiddler is able to act as a proxy and decrypt the traffic between the browser and the server by using a special ssl certificate thanks to user18044 for clarification in the comments below

26851364
implements	extends
if you want to make public void cancelalarms available in all activity then create a base activity class implements this method in that activity now extends all your activity with base activity class than you can call this method from any activity which has extended with base activity

26851372
versioning	upgrade
in the shortcut that i use to run the application i specified the path of a javaw.exe that is versioning 1.8+ and i also tried replacing the latest release of the tagger with the august 2014 release pre-java 8 upgrade and neither solved the problem

26851387
portrait	landscape
i have an iphone application most of which is portrait-only but with one view controller a video player screen that has to support both portrait and landscape this is for ios 8 only

26851387
portrait	landscape
to achieve this i have set the app s plist to support portrait and both kinds of landscape then subclassed uinavigationcontroller

26851387
portrait	landscape
this mostly works as expected the initial screens are all portrait-only and remain in portrait even when the device is turned to landscape

26851387
portrait	landscape
is also in portrait but will then rotate to landscape when the device is turned - all good so far

26851387
portrait	landscape
basically in the view controller that you need to be reset to portrait when the top-level view controller is dismissed while the device is still in landscape you just need to add this

26851426
hide	show
i m trying to hide show jsf panels based on ui events

bower	npm
use bower for front-end dependencies and npm for server side

26851611
bower	npm
also npm uses a nested dependency tree which has a much bigger footprint while bower uses a flat dependency tree

26851611
bower	npm
also bower will force you to only have a single version of a library while npm will let you have multiple versions

26851623
for-loop	loops
you ve coded your loops with a combination of both types of for-loop

26851650
installation	upgrade
the installation manager upgrade process may do this for you

26851679
post	get
i ve done a lot of search before post this question and tried lot of different ways to succeed my goal using imagick but i cannot get it done

26851697
for-loop	loops
i want to use an if statement to do so unless there s a better way but the trouble i m having is that the data is inside a for-loop and the code doesn t want me to use the values outside of that loops

26851697
for-loop	arrays
i also can t put the code inside the for-loop because then my arrays would all print out multiple times which isn t what i want

26851702
freemarker	velocity
for example .html for thymleaf .vm for velocity or .ftl for freemarker

26851711
put	get
im totally noob on meteor so i want to load my scripts.js after my template.html get loads without meteor i put thats scripts on the body and works but now im using meteor its seems like meteor load all scripts at same time on the and the problem its like i need to load first the template and later the script

26851726
bower	npm	client-side	server-side
as seth-pollack pointed out npm is mostly used for server-side dependencies and bower for client-side ones

ng-show	ng-hide
i can think of 2 approaches using ng-show ng-hide or a condition for your day variable when its empty

26851846
ng-show	ng-hide
ng-show ng-hide approach

26851851
width	height
without css the div has 100 of window width and about 20 of window height actually max body height and is stuck to the window borders

26851851
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
i want it to be centered horizontally and a bit detached vertically so i applied 100 width and 100 height to html and body tags and i also applied auto left and right margins to the actual div + 125px top margin

26851852
filtering	grouping
the second part of my question is that this regex should also grouping everything before these id strings into a capturing grouping so that i can call that grouping later on in the filtering effectively stripping out these id strings to look like the following

26851855
for-loop	arrays
you have a myarray arrays declared before the for-loop which you populate with student instances in the for-loop

26851935
for-loop	arrays
declare the arrays together with your myarray at the top of the for-loop that is

26851935
for-loop	arrays
that way the arrays will be visible within your for-loop

26851935
for-loop	arrays
when populating your students arrays myarray inside the for-loop you can then easily populate the ridersarrays as well directly in the for-loop

as a side note spindle s are generally applicable to sata sas not for ssd s

26852031
inherited	properties
objectname is the only properties of qtobject which is inherited by each qml item

26852048
margin	height
your current styling creates a height of 100 for the html tag + 125px for the margin which creates an vertical scroll overflow

26852115
google-chrome	firefox
when i use back button at that point it doesn t work in ie9 but does work in google-chrome and firefox

26852163

26852209
opera	safari
the icons still show perfectly in safari opera and my mobile android browser

26852209
opera	safari
however in safari or opera the icons shows perfectly as intended

26852213
int	chars
when the facet finds a chars that can t go into a int it stops reading and stores whatever s been read so far in the int being read

26852234
int	boolean
i m trying to emulate this but i ran into a little trouble because boolean don t convert into int

26852286
post	get
in reading the original post and the subsequent follow up post in response to people s answers i get the distinct impression that your original 10 digit decimal is actually a phone number that you want to somehow turn into an ip address

26852345
for-loop	loops
i am trying to use break continue statements to control the looping so that only one directory is created but 19 subdirectories are created with the correct data in that file the name of the name of that file must be the same in every directory so i have to move them immediately during loops so the data inside does not get overwritten since i have everything in a for-loop ranging from 1 to 20 it keeps on trying to create another main directory and it is saying that i already have created here is the code i have

implements	extends
to do so you would have to implements a new class extends gridview and override ontouchevent to call requestdisallowintercepttouchevent true

26852543
google-chrome	firefox
if you are using google-chrome or firefox you should be able to right click and inspect element

26852543
google-chrome	firefox
you can see what files are loaded by then hitting the sources tab in google-chrome something similar in firefox

26852571

for ubuntu to use javafx you either need to use the oracle jdk or the debian openjfx package as posted by emmanuel in javafx and openjdk

this is why your clicks don t work the has a width and height of 0

26852687
min	max
i wrote out 100 ticks at 30fps while doing absolutely nothing then used a triangular distribution between that min and max with 30fps as the mode then simulated the output with the turtle module

for-loop	arrays
but when i am trying to put last_name in the student arrays it gives me a null-pointer exception.if i omit the third line inside the for-loop the program is running fine

26852750
post	put
i now understand that rails forms embed a hidden _method and set it to put but my form is still getting delivered as a post that is preventing my form from finding my matching put url

26852758
nsnull	nsstring
it s very likely that you are trying to get the length of what you think is an nsstring but is actually nsnull

26852785
folder	directory
however it looks like the sources key is executed before the ondeck symbolic link is created to the current bundle directory so i can t reference opt python ondeck app when using the sources command because it creates the folder and then beanstalk errors out when trying to create the ondeck symbolic link

26852800
implements	extends
the consoleprogram class that your class is extends must be declared as implements serializable

26852830
post	get
web browsers are actually only programmed to receive post and get requests i m not sure why

26852830
post	put
so technically it s sending a post but with the put attached sort of awkwardly in that hidden field

26852883
lodash	underscore.js
instead of using object.create what you want is something like the extend function available in underscore.js or lodash more info about .extend is available in this so question

free	malloc
anything that is malloc d needs to be free

26852927
free	malloc
for each malloc in a program there must be a free

26852927

since you malloc twice free twice

26852946

in the work folder it turns out it s storing the jar that is copied over as well as a stdout and stderr file for that job

26852981
min	max
i want to secure that there is a number and a cpital letter in the password and i also want to define min and max length

26852987
width	height
select the scroll view then go to the size inspector make sure everything is zero aside from the height and width

26852987
width	height
use auto layout to pin the edges of the scroll view to its superview do not set any width or height attribute for the scroll view

26852987
width	height
constrain the content view in the same way that you constrained the scroll view but this time do set an explicit height and width height should be 1650

26852987
width	height
note that at no point do you set the scroll views contentsize and nor do you ever give your scroll view an explicit height or width

runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
on the other hand runtime or unchecked-exception are not meant to be expected and since runtimeexception the parent class of unchecked-exception also extends the class exception then the compiler is ok with it

26853168
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
exception has subclasses that are unchecked-exception runtimeexception extends exception

26853222
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
in java 7 i don t see that the discussion on checked unchecked-exception is directly relevant - while it s true that unchecked-exception don t follow the same rules unchecked-exception must inherit from runtimeexception which exception of course does not it is the parent of that class

26853396
bower	npm
ssh into your gear and cd to app-root data and then run npm install bower

26853410
post	get
why i still get data in random order though clustering order by is specified in post

26853428
stdout	stderr
the problem was the worker nodes were out of disk space caused by storing the data from transferring the jars as well as storing the stdout and stderr files

26853449
bower	npm
npm warn cannot run in wd meansample 0.0.1 bower install --config.interactive false wd tmp deployment application

26853449
gruntjs	package.json
also noting that other commands like gruntjs don t need the full path specified in the package.json and they work

26853500
for-loop	arrays
then we would make a for-loop and check every element or slot in the arrays

26853510
int	double
given that these appear to be heights with decimal values it is likely that you would want to store these as double s instead of int s

26853510
int	double
side note the reason you had to cast those numbers using int was because 175.5 is actually a double literal instead of an int which was what you declared the variable as before

26853540
folder	directory
you can start as many mongod processes as you want like this √¢ just make sure the data directory exist and both data folder plus log file are writeable

26853562
portrait	landscape
it looks right when iphone is in landscape mode but when it is in portrait it disappear from the screen

26853569
for-loop	arrays
and the for-loop i use to print the contents of the arrays list

26853593
put	get
i then switch to another view in my application its an ios application and i want to get this data from the table and put it in to my application

26853625
for-loop	arrays
normally the 2 for-loops sort my arrays and the last for-loop displays my arrays ordered so it looks like this

26853639
nunit	moq
i am new for unit test with moq and nunit

26853660
union	distinct
then you can get the count of the number of distinct names in the union this way

furthermore vimeo and youtube never show up in the list even though they show up when i trigger the sheet from the photo library

26853696
width	height
i save the project close it and reopen it the subview has its width and height set to 0

26853696
width	height
first i thought that tapping related to the subview was not working but found out that tapping was not working because i was tapping on a subview which has its width and height set to 0

26853721
button	checkbox
the way it works is when you re viewing the responsive condensed menu the menu button has a hidden checkbox input assigned to it

26853765
feof	fgetc
you could instead check say with if feof stream to see if you are at eof but i think just checking the return value of fgetc is nicer

26853828
min	max
the last table records the the min and max test result of different material under different test

26853828
min	max
i create another dropdownlist ddl_test which binding all the tests in the test table under the ddl_material and the textboxs to show the related test temp min and max result

26853828
min	max
then when i select from the ddl_test if there is min and max value related to that material with the specific test i selected those textboxs will show both temp from test table and min and max from material_test table

26853828
min	max
if the test selected havent applied to the material which means there is no records in the material_test table then only the texbox for test s temp will show but no min and max should show

26853836
free	malloc
without malloc guard i get an incorrect checksum for free object - object was probably modified after being free error at some point usually when the first key is unobfuscated and logged to console

also you need to set the canvas width and height attribute for this to function properly

26854023
width	height
i save the project close it and reopen it the subview has its width and height set to 0

26854023

26854024
google-chrome	firefox
you can create a custom parameter -dbrowser google-chrome or -dbrowser firefox

26854043
children	parent
each parent that does fork will need to wait on its children or the children will continue to run after the parent has exited

26854046
for-loop	arrays
if that is the case you can just make a new arrays targetarray where you can save to numbers to and then check using a for-loop if you already added it and if so you can generate a new random number

26854052
maven	pom.xml
by adding a resources stanza to my pom.xml i can exclude those folders from maven builds when i run mvn package and they won t show up in my war file artifact

26854166
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
however since both the controller and area are parameters for html.actionlink i don t see how asp.net-mvc would be getting confused

26854190
uniform	phong
it seemed to be working fine until i refactored phong shaders to use uniform blocks instead of uniforms

26854190
uniform	phong
since then the application can t find the uniform blocks in the phong shaders but works perfectly fine for all the other shaders.

26854190
uniform	phong
this is where i see the that both of the uniform blocks are not being found in the phong shaders

if you initialize it in onresume clean it up in onpause

26854476
client-side	server-side
that way the client-side could request an html file but that would still serve back the correct gsp html file from the server-side

26854505
post	get
this setup serializes objects so that the content_object field contains a hyperlink to the related object and when post ing to a view using this serializer and the data includes the content_object key we get the related object and pass it on

26854534
chown	chmod
some tools that will be useful include cd ls -l chown and chmod

26854534
chown	chmod
don t use them until you ve read their manuals especially chown and chmod

26854544
stateless	stateful
you are correct in that moving your state to a different layer means your application is stateful there are very few truly stateless applications mostly only ones doing pure math

26854544
stateless	stateful
that doesn t mean individual layers can t be stateless and those layers that are will scale differently than the stateful layers

26854574
sequence	permutation
in lieu of performing permutation on the sequence in a i would like to peform a pairwise interchange of the cells so the performance runs better even though the results won t be exact it will be very close to answer though

26854612
put	get
the result when i run this code is that all the messages get put on the queue but the signal handler in receiver never triggers

other browsers like firefox and google-chrome play the file fine

26854891
google-chrome	safari
it is not working in google-chrome or safari

26854891

i want the textview to align to the far left of the dropdown with the paddingleft and i want the imageview to align to the far right of the dropdown

26854923
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately this is browser-specific feature is not currently supported in either firefox or google-chrome and i am unfamiliar with it s support in other browsers

26854966
int	chars
minor change chars nextchar to int nextchar also related function calls.

26854967
qsub	mpiexec
you usually qsub things with a ccmrun for a serial job or an aprun instead of mpirun or mpiexec

i am attempting to make a program that initializes a series of variables prior to a for-loop but when the variable is changed within loops i want it to remain that value in which it has been changed to

26855001
put	get
i m trying to change values of an excel workbook using update but something is wrong y want to get the value from table b and put it in table a

26855006
build.gradle	gradlew
in a gradlew project you usually have a standard directory structure and the dependencies all listed in the build.gradle file

26855030
folder	directory
the state folder are windows directory with names written in capitals

26855032
min	max
represents a number less than min value or greater than max value

26855045
profiling	debugging
on the other hand tracking the function becomes impossible so to enable debugging or profiling you need to restore it explicitly

26855055
addition	multiplication
we would still be doing the list processing in exactly the same way but with two examples to compare it is pretty clear that multiplication and addition are the only difference between the two

26855055
addition	multiplication
so let s make the addition and multiplication bits into functions so we can pull that part of the pattern out

26855055
addition	multiplication
we need to pass a function in -- addition or multiplication -- and have it operate over the values

26855055
multiplying	multiplication
in multiplication the identity operation is to multiplying by 1

26855055
addition	multiplication
so we must start our accumulator at 0 for addition and 1 for multiplication and for building lists an empty list and so on

26855055
addition	multiplication
and they are functionally identical to the one we wrote above but the notation is more clear and we don t have to write a bunch of recursive details that tangle the idea of iteration with the idea of accretion with the idea of some specific operation like multiplication or addition

26855137
stdout	stderr
also the way assert_output works is that the block will write to stdout stderr and the arguments will be checked if they match stdout stderr

26855154
hide	show
while data is being retrieved it show an ajax loader icon and hide loader-success div

26855211
pull	push
with the fix in place there is no real difference between the two in fact i would say the new transition functions work better than the previously tried functions...i personally prefer this two lined alternative than the 13 plus lines of code i started off with...the carousel_left and carousel_right functions use a simple pull and push method take the first child from the front of the list and append to the back or take the last child and append to the front

26855232
dplyr	sqldf
put the data in a database then work with the database rodbc sqldf dplyr

button	checkbox
later i want to disable a button if none of the checkbox are checked

26855348
width	height
my code currently moves the image to occupy the height of the phone and therefore crops the width

26855350
google-chrome	firefox
the same issues occur with protractor 1.3.1 and 1.4.0 with the latest google-chrome and firefox drivers

26855390
google-chrome	firefox
so now it works for google-chrome firefox and ie

26855426
prepare	execute
you may want to investigate prepare statements -- prepare execute see here if you really want to dynamically put a table name into a query

26855437
min	max
looks like you were just missing some things all and also you used min instead of max

26855440
128bit	64bit
this answer shows how to get the exact top 64bit from a 64x64 bit multiply on a system that doesn t support 128bit integers

26855440
128bit	64bit
the diagram below shows one method for computing a 128bit product from two 64bit numbers

chunked	transfer-encoding
and then to stream the packets to nginx one by one it is transfer-encoding chunked without the hex size markers and the crlfs

26855478
x86	64bit
the default install directory is program files x86 on 64bit systems

26855484
virtualenv	conda
there are warning messages you might have buzzed past that warn that mixing and matching conda environment s and virtualenv environments is a risky business

26855526
filesystems	hfs
presumably if it s not a local filesystems it won t be hfs

26855571
getattr	setattr
finally just ask yourself how often you d have to use getattr and setattr if you went with attributes

26855577
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
tested in firefox google-chrome and safari on os x 10.9 same in all three

26855610
width	height
firstly you do not ever need to specify width s or height s on anything in order to get your infowindow to display without scrollbars although sometimes you may accidentally get it working by doing this but it s will eventually fail

26855610
width	height
it then measures that div which means that in this example whatever css rules in my document apply to h1 and p tags will be applied to it to get it s width and height

26855618
16-bit	64bit
just as 16-bit registers were increased to 32-bit and renamed ax to eax with the increase to 64bit the registers were again renamed eax to rax

26855660
getter	setter
my customer model is also just containg long id string name string address string location string image with getter and setter

26855739
width	height
i have it working for height however the width continually truncates at 320px wide

26855761
width	height
it will print the number of rows and columns or height and width respectively

26855827
serializable	deserialization
shows how to create a serializable modifier to allow to modify a value before serializable and after deserialization

26855834

in c# simple types such as int float double etc

26855854
tostring	getter	getter	setter
i also added getter and setter and a tostring

26855854
subtract	add
i have the class done already but eclipse is giving me an error with the add and subtract method around the part where i typed temp

26855879
pull	push
when dev b wants to also to commit his changes he should commit git commit -a -m something pull the changes git pull origin yourbranch and push again git push origin yourbranch

26855884
google-chrome	firefox
from my testing on google-chrome and firefox it seems that

26855888
folder	directory
the problem is that you need some dlls to run the executable so you have to put them on the local directory in order to run it and when you finish coding you will have to find a way to make them available to final user here is a little tutorial made for qt creator that explains it very good just have in mind that clicking the run button in netbeans it s almost the same than double clicking the executable in the dist release or dist debug folder

26855900
spaces	linefeed
you could try checking other blank characters other that spaces tab t linefeed n carriage return r something like this i haven t tested it

26855902
width	height
height heightgap width and widthgap are all defined as integers and just control the spacing between views and the size of the view

26855936
portrait	landscape
however then the user rotates the device s screen from portrait to landscape

26855961
build.gradle	gradlew
in android builds this means in release mode and with the shared configuration proguard-android-optimize.txt in project.properties for ant or build.gradle for gradlew

26855964
width	height
first explicitly define the width and height of all of your images with css

26855969
google-chrome	safari
also there are css vendor prefixes extensions for mozilla webkit used by google-chrome and safari that only apply to a specific browser

26856020
width	height
i know the width and height of rectangle 1

26856020
width	height
i know the aspect ratio of rectangle 2 along with a minimum height and width which will always be larger than rectangle 1

26856036
width	height
basically i have an imageview inside of a cardview the cardview is set to wrap_content for height and width

26856067
lodash	underscore.js
the two simplest ways i found to do this using underscore.js lodash are

26856070
for-loop	arrays
but i want to use a for-loop to populate the arrays cols key value

26856094
junit	jmock
snip these matchers have uses in unit testing frameworks such as junit 2 and jmock

26856113
profiling	debugging
when i changed my profiling schema to debugging mode and also made sure build configs has developer certificate in it

26856119
hash	md5
storing md5 hash of passwords and other sensitive information is a security risk

26856119
hash	md5
or - even worse - the md5 hash might be available in an md5-reverse-lookup-dictionary

26856132
int	chars
which of course are int not chars -

26856140
apache	nginx
now in the php world you would have apache with mod_php or nginx php_fpm or other running within your container

26856200
build.gradle	gradlew
i opened up the build.gradle and verified that there were no issues from the minsdk version and then did one last check on possible errors with gradlew

26856216
shadowing	named
you are shadowing the class member variable vector_int with a local variable of the same named in the constructor

26856219
puts	gets
the key thing to understand is that when the interpreter gets to a call to then or catcherror on a future it does not execute the code inside it puts it aside to be executed later when the future completes and then just keeps right on executing any following code

26856252
int	double
for your simple case just use pattern matching in getarea but you ll have to convert your values to double since the area of a circle is never going to be an int when you have an int radius

26856273
int	double
restkit seems to only want to map to a nsnumber type while a realm object only allows properties that are primitives int float double etc

26856288
lodash	underscore.js
note that underscore.js and lodash are both under mit license and so you can simply copy paste the functions you need and directly embed it into your distributed app lib whatever

26856303
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
but if i run my project as js it works just as expected on google-chrome and it fails in both firefox and safari

26856437
saucelabs	browserstack
for instance if you spawn your browser in a saucelabs vm or in a browserstack vm to run a test suite network delays are going to add significant time to how long it takes the suite to complete

26856458
ddms	adb
in eclipse you can access the adb connection timeout option by going to windows | preferences | android | ddms

26856488
oncreate	setcontentview
assuming this is in your oncreate method of the activity you need a setcontentview

26856498
uipangesturerecognizer	uipageviewcontroller	uipangesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer
instead of relying on the uipageviewcontroller s inherent uipangesturerecognizer include your own uipangesturerecognizer in the page view so that when a pan is detected in the appropriate section of the page and performed in the appropriate direction that new uipangesturerecognizer overrides the uipageviewcontroller s uigesturerecognizer s and triggers the necessary actions

26856520
put	get
i have a bool named recordcalled that is true when an up swipe is detected if the bool is true when the app goes into resign certain methods are suppose to get called that put the app in its default state

26856577
put	get
see you are overwriting with each pass of the loop as there are no other query conditions but the username i imagine you get the record with the highest id or as you put it the newest record

26856581
put	get
i ve finally worked out how to put together a complex query to get related models

26856589
post	get
it needs to send the request string in the body of a post request to the url that will route to the php script and get the output back

26856598
subtract	add
i need help writing a static version of the add and subtract methods

26856664
median	max
i used this code to calculate the max value and the median element in an array of integers but when i call the methods in my client class both of these two methods produce an output of zero

26856731
min	rank
now we ll select column 1 and rank it descending and add the rank back into the dataframe using the min method

26856757
for-loop	arrays
edit if you have learned arrays use it to declare an arrays of scores then use a for-loop to iterate through as paul is hinting at in his comment

26856812
put	get
when i put it in my compiler ms studios express i get a conversion error saying it cannot go from type string to type int

26856894
versioning	upgrade
i hit this same problem so i upgrade by versioning of python to work around it

26856930
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried using firefox as well as google-chrome browsers

26857043
uiview	subviews

26857251
google-chrome	firefox
the page is fine in google-chrome and firefox but even with no content the magical mighty ie is always hungry for the mysterious scroll

26857285
superclass	subclassing
i would need each of the subclassing to pass some sort of information to the superclass

26857390
margin	height
give overflow auto to body this is because ie takes body height as 100 by default ad margin inside it extends its height so to change its default behavior u can use overflow auto

26857399
for-loop	loops
not sure if this is making sense but you see that i reset the subcattds every time it loops through on the for-loop

26857426
google-chrome	firefox
if i use an element s internal css and bind it to the element s theme public attribute then it will only work in google-chrome and not firefox or ie

26857431
google-chrome	firefox
basically i want it to behave the same as firefox and google-chrome

26857448
junit	jbehave
jbehave essentially runs on top of junit so i don t think jbehave itself is the problem

26857480
post	get
as sean said you can t use placeholders for column or table names. you can however inject them into the query via sprintf note ensure all post get data is properly escaped

26857495
stdout	stderr
nspipe was just to collect stderr stdout from the second app in case of problems loading

26857499

26863824
pull	push
upstream means that if you tell git to push to the place you normally pull from it will push the branch to whatever remote branch it is tracking - the branch that you get updates from when you pull

26863824
pull	push
simple does the same as upstream when you push to the place you normally pull from and does the same as current if you re pushing somewhere else

google-chrome	firefox
it works good in ie google-chrome safari...but it s not working in firefox because window .focus

26864354
maven	pom.xml
while i considered this something maven special it will result in a maven artefact of type pom.xml in the repositories and can be seen as a normal dependency such as a jar it just isnt a jar effectivly providing implementations of any functionality but only maven based information on where to find further maven artefacts or manage their versions by importing their dependencymanagement information using scope import

26864354
maven	pom.xml
considered we have a new policy to only create new dependencies to the port pom.xml of a system we had to prevent usage of the scope at that point in the policy too the hole enforce something using maven approach is highly questionable but our main goal is to have a maven structure as close to our component design as possible

this makes a for-loop less powerful than a while loops but it is guaranteed that a for-loop will always terminate

26864486
for-loop	loops
in practical programming languages the distinction between the two is a bit blurred but is important to know that the c java for-loop is closer to a theoretical while loops while the pascal for behaves more like the theoretical for-loop

26864486
for-loop	loops
so indeed your example does not work with a pascal for-loop but of course you can use the pascal while loops to achieve the same effect

26864541

post	get
when i get a success callback all it gives me is the post id

26872190
put	get
if you always put after for while if and else even if there is only one line you ll avoid a lot of troubles because the compiler will tell you if you have a missing brace and also if you decide to add something to one of the loops you won t get commands that you thought were inside your loop or if and are actually outside it

26872368
getter	setter
the orms i have mentioned resolved these problems with a code generation tool that examines the db schema and creates classes with their physical getter and setter in the entity

26872368
getter	setter
propel for example creates a class with the table name with all the getter and setter in it and the logic there but also creates a class that extends it in the public directory so when you instantiate article you instantiate the empty class that extends the articlebase

26872400
superclass	subclassing	inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing

you re much better off using elementtree interface via perhaps the very fast lxml which iirc is what bs uses under the hood by default anyway

26872503

multiplying	division
instead of performing division when using modular arithmetic you must multiplying by the modular inverse

26873298
width	font-size
if you want to force the title fit in 2 lines or less then you need to evaluate a smaller font-size ratio depending on the width of the container div

26873599
division	multiplication
1 3 is 0 by conventional arithmetic if it s that what you re looking for in this case then there is no shortcut in general you can however trade the division for a multiplication and a shift if is known to be small enough

26873599
division	modulo
another option for division x y is however looking for the number that multiplied by y gives x in modular arithmetic and 1 3 with this meaning is 5 because is 1 when thinking modulo 7

you can t just provide the name because the filtering wont work and it ll just grouping the whole collection

26873676
put	get
in both cases your update method of coherencedao class is executed safe and sound and your coherence transaction is not rollbacked anymore which will put your cache in an inconsistent state because you will get a runetimeexception because of those db or hibernate exceptions and that will cause your container managed transaction to be rollbacked

goto	break
basically withrestarts invokerestart acts a little bit like a goto statement which allows you to break out of the loop

26873990
for-loop	loops
also if you can do the above you can probably just as easily turn your code into a for-loop which seems more appropriate given your desire to a break out of loops b use the operator to cause side effects

for-loop	loops
you want a while loops here not a for-loop

26875008
equals	gethashcode
if you look at the source code for enumerable.except and enumerable.intersect you can see that they use the internal class which is some sort of hash table so your implementation of gethashcode can affect the performance of your code but not the correctness as long as equals records return the same hash code

26875038
post	get
you shouldn t even attempt to solve this using javascript - js is good to get data from the server or to post data to it but you have no way to know if the same user is using another browser at the same time or another machine - these may all generate the same write request to the server at the same time

26875047

the simple answer to your question is you re right neither httplib nor urllib has public built-in functionality to do this

26875143
urllib	httplib
and if you go to 3.x httplib has been reorganized and renamed while urllib has been removed entirely so you ll already have bigger changes to worry about

26875982
division	subtraction
division similarly turns into subtraction

26875995
put	get
adding padding at the max-width media query would also work however you would get extra spacing when you do put your content inside p h1-h6 and so forth and this would not be consistent or recommended that s why there s no padding margin directly on the .col-x-x classes by default
